## Abstract
In the context of the ongoing investigation into the sudden emergence of Cryptococcus gattii globally from sources within and outside the United States, recently released aerial specimens (n = 8/Allianta and n = 6/All Elseifen) were used to determine the taxa phylogeny, distribution, and occurrence of this species. The samples were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar and Asca King algae surfaces and were incubated at 28ºC for 10 min followed by isolation at 37ºC for 2 h. Morphological features, ecology, and pathogenicity were documented in the morphological records. The records demonstrated that the species C. gattii was globally distributed in the United States (USA) with major changes in shape, ecology, and ecology.


## Introduction
The diversity of microorganisms inhabiting our bodies is of increasing concern owing to their ability to cause diseases ranging from superficial to systemic diseases. Infectious diseases are complex and involve diverse pathogenic mechanisms, which are determined by the virulence of the pathogen. The concept of virulence has gained a lot of attention because of its ability to deceive the host’s immune system, leading to opportunistic infections, which are mainly caused by non-pathogenic microorganisms, mainly bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites (Otzen and Olsson, 2016; Paul et al., 2016; Paul and Nisiotou, 2016). Non-specific infections are the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients and are classified into four categories: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. These infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. These are mainly caused by several non-specific bacteria, fungi, and parasites (Osborne et al., 2017). The term “viral” infection is used by the majority of scientists to describe a microbial infection caused by non-viral pathogenic strains of Gram-negative bacteria and to describe infections caused by a group of microorganisms which have no virulence factor (Ahuja et al., 2013). Visceral infections are caused by non-visceral bacterial infections (NEC), which have a spectrum from superficial to invasive, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral forms (Ahuja et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2016; Paul and Nisiotou, 2016). The most frequent EC-related forms include Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Burkholderia pseudomallei (BKS), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAS), Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus (Otzen et al., 2016).


## Methods
expansum and . expansum-extracellular complex

S. cerevisiae cells were cultured at 37°C in 0.5 ml of medium (Luria-Bertani medium) and 5% (v/v) glucose. The S. cerevisiae culture was prepared by inoculating fresh cells in a sterile loopful of 0.5 ml of culture medium, and the inoculum was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/ml. The growth of S. cerevisiae was monitored at OD_600, and the cell viability was calculated by counting the number of viable cells after 30 min of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO_2.

The antifungal activity of P. expansum against S. cerevisiae was performed as described previously (Pachón et al., 2009). Briefly, the mycelial growth of S. cerevisiae was monitored at OD_600 after 3 and 24 h of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO_2, and the cell viability was calculated by counting the number of viable cells after 30 min of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO_2.

For the antiparasitic activity, the mycelia of P. expansum were cultured at 37°C in 0.5 ml of medium and 5% (v/v) glucose. The mycelia was infected with a suspension of 0.5 ml of P. expansum at a concentration of 1 × 10^5/ml. The inoculum was inoculated into a 0.5 ml of RPMI medium containing 0.5% (v/v) peptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) mannitol, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) glycerol monostearate, 1% (v/v) glucose, 1% (v/v) amphotericin B, and 0.01% (v/v) sodium ascorbate (Sigma-Aldrich). The mycelia was infected with a suspension of 0.5 ml of P. expansum at a concentration of 1 × 10^5/ml. The inoculum was inoculated into a 0.5 ml of RPMI medium containing 0.5% (v/v) peptone, 0.


## Results
that showed significant antimicrobial activity were enriched with some diterpenes from the roots of Spitsbergia s. I. Kovalenko et al. (2013). Moreover, we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of the plant extracts of the roots of Spitsbergia sp. II. Their antimicrobial activities were evaluated against a panel of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi (Table 1). The antimicrobial activities of the extracts of the Spitsbergia sp. II were consistent with the results of Kovalenko et al. (2013). The extracts from Spitsbergia sp. II were enriched with the diterpenes from the root of Spitsbergia sp. II, while those from the roots of Spitsbergia sp. III were enriched with the diterpenes from the root of Spitsbergia sp. III, which might reflect the fact that the root bark has a higher pH than the root wood. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts from Spitsbergia sp. II and Spitsbergia sp. III were consistent with the results of Kovalenko et al. (2013) and Kovalenko et al. (2013). These findings are also in agreement with the results of Kovalenko et al. (2013) and Kovalenko et al. (2013).

In our experimental setup, the root bark was used for the first time to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the extracts from Spitsbergia sp. II and Spitsbergia sp. III. The root bark extracts of Spitsbergia sp. II were rich in the diterpenes from the roots of Spitsbergia sp. II, while those from Spitsbergia sp. III were enriched with the diterpenes from the roots of Spitsbergia sp. II. The antimicrobial activities of the roots of Spitsbergia sp. II and Spitsbergia sp. III were similar to those of the roots of Spitsbergia sp. I. Kovalenko et al. (2013), so that the extracts from the roots of Spitsbergia sp. II and Spitsbergia sp. III were likely enriched with diterpenes from the root of Spitsbergia sp. II. These results are in agreement with the results of Kovalenko et al. (2013) and Kovalenko et al.


## Discussion

All tested fungi are obligate aerobic, endophytic, and opportunistic, and have been reported to have a wide range of lifestyle, including their bio-presences (e.g., fungi in the soil, plants, insects, and other invertebrates), their own nutritional requirements (e.g., leaf-eating insects), and their lifestyles (e.g., food fungi). The studies of this study showed that the fungi inhabiting the roots of Spitsbergia arabia were significantly less efficient in degrading the nutrients provided by the roots of this beetle species. This is because they are able to tolerate the extreme fluctuations of the nutrients supplied by the roots, especially nutrient deprivation in the early stages of the process, while the fungi in the late stages of the process were reduced in their metabolism. The results indicated that the fungi in the root bark of Spitsbergia arabia were significantly less efficient in degrading the nutrients provided by the roots of this beetle species.

Antioxidant activities
The antioxidant activity of the roots of Spitsbergia arabia were significantly higher than that of the root bark of this beetle species. This is because the fungi in the roots of Spitsbergia arabia were significantly more efficient in degrading the nutrients provided by the roots of this beetle species.
