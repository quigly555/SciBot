## Abstract
Exposure to antifungal drugs increases the risk of cardiovascular and other cardiovascular events. Patients with cardiomyopathy and other cardiometabolic disorders are particularly at risk due to the limited efficacy of such drugs.

A 22-year old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department complaining of a long day and a sore throat. She had a past history of diabetes mellitus, recently diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy. She had a past history of diabetes and recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. She had a past history of chemotherapy and aggressive heart failure. She had a past history of diabetes mellitus for which she was started on treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a solitary brainstem lesion. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the chest, liver, spleen, liver, heart, and liver (CSF/spleen) and a positive blood culture were positive for FUS-16. She had a past history of diabetes mellitus, previously diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy.


## Introduction
2014.

The genus is divided into seven sections: Capillaria, Capillaria, Ageladora, Ageladomella, and Ageladomyrmacella. Section Capillaria (Southeast Asia) is restricted to the genera Ageladomella and Ageladomyrmacella, and the other species are restricted to the genus Ageladomyrmacella (Zhu et al. 2014). The genus Ageladomella was first described by W.M. Li, who was the first to use the name Ageladomella in the Chinese traditional medicine. According to the original description, Ageladomella is an aromatic genus, and its species, Ageladomyrmacella, is regarded as the best known genus in the genus. However, this genus is not well-characterized. The genus Ageladomella was first described by M.A. Ganley by investigating its pathogenicity on various plant pathogens (Ganley 1922). However, the species, Ageladomella, was reported as a pathogen of P. destructans and was reported to be weak to cause superficial infections and to be non-pathogenic to humans (Ganley 1922). The species Ageladomella was first described by G.M. Loew by investigating its pathogenicity on C. neoformans and found to be non-pathogenic to humans (Loew 1963). However, Loew and colleagues later observed that Ageladomella was more virulent in mice infected with C. neoformans than in the healthy mouse (Loew and Loew 1964). In the same study, Ageladomella was found to be more virulent in mice infected with C. neoformans than in the healthy mouse (Loew and Loew 1964). The species Ageladomella is a member of the subphylum Ageladidae (C. neoformans), which is found in the phylum Apicomerina, Order Agelaceae, and Family Agelaceae (Verkley et al. 2012).

The genus Ageladomella is based on the genus Ageladaceae, which was based on the ascus-like formae speciales.


## Methods
rg) [37. Furthermore, the entire collection has been deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) (http://www.cgmci.cn).

2.2. Microbial and Plant DNA
For each species, 5 µl of distilled water, 0.1 mg/ml sterile H_2O and 0.5 g of plant DNA (E. coli) was added. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the DNA was extracted by using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was cleaned using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The DNA concentration was measured by the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanosight, Inc.). The DNA was then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR reaction mixture was used to quantify the DNA concentration using the Qubit ds DNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA quality was checked using a Qubit ds DNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used as the internal control to compare the fungal DNA with the PCR-amplified DNA. The fungal ITS region was amplified using the universal fungal primers ITS1F (5’-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3’) and ITS4 (5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’) [38].

2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis
The sequences were aligned by using the program ClustalX2 [39] and manually adjusted according to the results of the analysis [40]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. The neighbor-joining tree was constructed with the program MEGA6. The neighbor-joining tree was visualized using the program TreeDyn [41].

New species identification in this genus
A.hangiana is characterized by the presence of a verruculose or hyaline pileus, a verruculose or flossy stipe, and a solitary, distinct branched, subcylindrical hyaline stipe. This genus is characterized by the presence of a solitary, subcylindrical hyaline stipe, a single, subcylindrical stipe, and a single, subcylindrical subiculum.

Morphologically, A.pinense differs from A.pinense by the lack of several typical characters. The stipe-end to stipe-stipe cell-end are typical for the genera. The stipe-end to stipe-stipe cell-end are typical for the genera. The main characters are the absence of the perithecial hyaline stipe and the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe. In addition, the shape of the stipe-end is unclavate, and it is reminiscent of P.flava. The stipe-end is reminiscent of P.terreus. The stipe-end is reminiscent of P.sublomentus. The stipe-end is similar to P.ramproni but differs from it by the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe and the lack of perithecial hyaline stipe. The stipe-end is similar to P.subpyratus but differs from it by the lack of perithecial hyaline stipe and the lack of perithecial hyaline stipe. The stipe-end is similar to P.perniciosus but differs from it by the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe and the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe. The stipe-end is similar to P.isolate but differs from it by the lack of perithecial hyaline stipe and the lack of perithecial hyaline stipe. The stipe-end is similar to P.gardia but differs from it by the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe and the absence of perithecial hyaline stipe. The stipe-end is similar to P.
