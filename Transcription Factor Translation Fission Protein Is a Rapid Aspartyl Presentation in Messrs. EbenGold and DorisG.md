## Abstract
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular pathogens that infect a wide range of animals, from plants to nematodes, and are thought to be evolutionarily conserved. In contrast, the microsporidian origin of the zebrafish is not well-understood. Here, we show that the order Mucorales is evolutionary rather than obligate to carry out the nuclear transcriptional reprogramming required for replication. We also show that hyphal expansions of the orthologous mollusc mutants in the Rhizopus not responding to nitrogen limitation are responsible for the observed size increase. We also show that a relevant portion of the melanin biosynthesis pathway in the mollusc mutants is orthologous to wild-type transcription, and this is likely due to the presence of melanin-specific transporters.


## Introduction
cerevisia. The proteins are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they form a small cytoplasmic membrane, and as the membrane is poorly permeable, the cargo is internalized to the cell. The fission protein can be recognized by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on the surface of the yeast cells, which trigger appropriate responses and induce the expression of the PRRs (e.g., Toll-like receptors and caspase-1) [25,26].

The yeast fission protein is present in the absence of other members of the fission protein complex, and it is not subject to transcriptional regulation. In addition, fission proteins are expressed in both yeast and hyphal forms, and they are required for the proper functioning of the mitotic machinery [27].

The fission protein nprp is a membrane-bound Fission protein complex containing two subunits (ß and <U+03B3>), which are fused together by an electrophilic reaction, and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that are separated by a cysteine-rich domain (CDF) [27,28]. The fission protein is present in the absence of other members of the fission protein complex, including Dectin-1, which binds to lipopolysaccharides and requires the presence of the FcR<U+03B3> subunit for its function [28,29].

The fission protein is expressed in yeast and hyphal forms, and it requires the presence of the Fc<U+03B3> subunit for its function [27].

In addition, the fission protein has a cysteine-rich domain (CFR) and a C-terminal two-component histidine-rich domain (TCD) [27]. The CFR consists of two histidine residues, one on each cysteine residue, and is bound by the Fc<U+03B3> subunit [27,28,29].


## Methods
coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen) and inserted into the pET-28a (+) vector (Novagen) to generate pET-28a-RPB1-RPB. This construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen) and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pEL-1(+) (Novagen). The fusion proteins were verified by Sanger sequencing.

Northern blot analysis
Cells were grown in liquid YPD medium to OD_600 = 1 and cultured for 5 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were washed three times with 0.1 M SDS and resuspended in 1% SDS at 10 µM. The pellets were further incubated with 3 µl of an equal volume of RNase A (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min. After addition of 1 µl of 1% SDS at room temperature, the blot was developed with the RNase-free solution (Qiagen). The blot was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the sample volume was measured using the Cellometer^® DTM FlexPAL (Beckman Coulter).

Western blot
S. cerevisiae strains were grown overnight in liquid YPD medium and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 1% SDS, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4°C for 1 h. The samples were further lysed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was collected and used for protein extraction. The proteins were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard.


## Results
coli a protein from . coli K1 (CID) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter in the presence of H.L. (Fig 3A). The activity of this protein was very weak, indicating that it is a H.L. protein (Fig 3A). The sequence of the protein was solved in a transmembrane domain in the GPD promoter by digestion with a detergent followed by immunoprecipitation. The native sequence of the a-factor was deduced to be H.L. cysteine-2 (Fig 3B). The N-terminal domain was not found in the native protein (Fig 3B). The protein was localized in the cytoplasm and secreted into the extracellular medium (Fig 3C). The protein was localized in the supernatant and extracellular medium (Fig 3C). We propose that the fast degradation of the E. coli K1 protein in the presence of the H.L. protein might be a result of a new reaction involving a new reaction with the a-factor or other reactants that might be produced by the E. coli K1 protein during the reaction reaction. The secretion of E. coli K1 protein into the supernatant was detected by flow cytometry analysis (Fig 3D). The E. coli K1 protein was detected in the supernatant in the presence of H.L. protein (Fig 3D), and the release of the protein into the extracellular medium was detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig 3D). The secretion of the E. coli K1 protein by the E. coli K1 was detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig 3D). The protein was not detected in the supernatant in the presence of SDS-PAGE (Fig 3D). The protein was detected in the extracellular medium in the presence of H.L. protein in the supernatant (Fig 3D). The release of the E. coli K1 protein in the extracellular medium was detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig 3D). The protein was not detected in the supernatant in the presence of SDS-PAGE (Fig 3D).

## Discussion
ALE Transcriptome Sequencing
To further investigate the transcriptional changes induced by the yeast C. elegans meal during the C. elegans meal, two synthetic cDNAs were selected for this purpose. They were selected because they were potential proteins that could be used for the production of several types of products.

The DNA-assembled cDNAs, known as rDNA, were prepared using the DAPAC protocol. This method is the preferred method of protein assembly for the RNA-assembled cDNA because the library DNA is relatively cheap and the DNA is mostly degraded [24]. In this study, the dapsA mutant was used as a control. The dapsA mutant was able to produce a stable protein and produce protein-free dapsA. The protein-free dapsA protein was then purified to yield recombinant protein-free dapsA.

The purified recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was further purified and sequenced. The recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was identified by using the DAPAC method. The purified recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was successfully purified and sequenced. The purified recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was also identified by using DAPI-DGGE. The recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was also successfully purified and sequenced. The recombinant protein-free dapsA protein was identified by using DAPAC method.
