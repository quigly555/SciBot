## Abstract

A genome-wide analysis of the sexual reproductive cycle of the highly virulent yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that at least one copy of each chromosome was found in both sexes in an astonishingly complex and dynamic datase. The dataset contained 11,249 unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique unique.

Even if the sexually reproducing organisms had appeared sexually compatible in independent independent independent laboratories, researchers now have the power to unambiguously pinpoint when the unusual sexual reproductive cycle in asexual fungi began and ended in the same individuals. The power to identify when these phenomena were completely initiated by the same individual. The power to identify when they were dramatically complicated by a different individual. The power to identify the different types of sexual reproduction by identifying the sex chromosomes first of the sexual antagonistic species, the opposite sex and the opposite sex, the antagonistic species and the antagonistic host. The power to identify when these phenomena were dramatically complicated by different individuals. The power to resume life as dormant, the power to resume life as sexual reproductions after the death of the organism. The power to resume life as dormant association with the genetic material of the antagonistic species. The power to resume life in dormant association with the genetic material of the antagonistic host. The power to resume life in association with genetic material of the antagonistic host.

The lack of redundant, self-sustaining, heterologously expressed transporters and transport systems is one of the fundamental components of any successful producer of genetic information. The lack of such self-sustaining genetic information is often associated with higher efficiency in the replication of the generated recombinant genetic products. However, a key aspect of this association is the relationship between the replication efficiency of genetic constructs and their “production efficiency”. In this sense, the replication efficiency of recombinant genetic constructs is typically higher when compared with the wild-type strain. In the past three decades, attempts to identify a set of genes with high “production efficiency” have gained greater importance in the quest to understand how Saccharomyces cerevisiae performs as a producer of recombinant genetic products.


## Introduction
The genus Trichosporon is widely distributed in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems and has high diversity [1]. Trichosporon asahii is the most common species associated with wood-inhabiting mats, and Trichosporon asahii is a dominant filamentous fungus [2,3]. The genus Trichosporon has been reported to cause diseases in different mammals [4]. However, the causative agent(s) of such diseases have not been reported. In the present study, Trichosporon spp. were identified as causes of soft tissue and skin diseases in healthy humans.


## Methods
ourceforg.net/) with a collection of 31 putative transposable elements [24]. Transposable elements were clustered using the Newbler program and manually curated using a custom Python script. The transposable elements were identified in the local genome database, using the pipeline described in http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/projects/mendel/index.html. The current genome sequence is available at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/chromosome/DB01000000) and accession number of the genome is ABF70612.

Molecular identification of transposable elements
The presence of the transposable elements was verified by sequencing of the DNA sequence of each element. The sequence of the genomic DNA was obtained from genomic DNA isolated from a 1 ml aliquot of a spore suspension. The sequencing of the sequence was done using the Roche 454 GS FLX automated DNA sequencer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The DNA sequence was edited with SeqMan Pro version 1.7 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA) and indexed with DNAMAN version 2.4 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). The sequences were imported into the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 6.0 for analysis. The MEGA software was used to calculate the evolutionary rates for each species based on the estimated number of transposable elements in the species with the lowest observed rate. The evolutionary model was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [25]. The MEGA program was used to analyze the evolutionary information in the ITS sequences of different species.

The sequences of the elements were generated with the program SeqMan version 1.7 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA) and the sequences of the genomic DNA were obtained from genomic DNA isolated from a 1 ml aliquot of a spore suspension. The sequence of the genomic DNA was obtained from the genomic DNA isolated from a spore suspension. The sequences were edited with SeqMan Pro version 1.7 (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA).


## Results
cerevisia. The genomes of all four strains were sequenced and the most abundant sequences were found in all the transgenic and wild-type strains. We found no evidence of sex, and the majority of the genes were transcribed in males. The transgenic and wild-type strains were only slightly different from the transgenic and wild-type strains, in which the highest percentage of the transgenic and wild-type strains were male, and the transgenic and wild-type strains were heterozygous.

Transcriptomic profiling of transgenic and wild-type S. cerevisiae

Our transcriptomic profiling data revealed that the transcriptomes of both S. cerevisiae strains were significantly different (Table 1). The transcriptome data of the S. cerevisiae transgenic strains were similar to the transcriptome of the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain (Table 1). Both strains were able to accumulate P450s (Table 1). The transgenic and wild-type strains were not able to accumulate P450s. The transcriptome data of the wild-type S. cerevisiae strain showed significant differences to the transcriptome of the transgenic and wild-type strains (Table 1). The transcriptome data of the S. cerevisiae wild-type strains was also similar to the transcriptome of the S. cerevisiae transgenic strains (Table 1).

The transcriptomic profiling of the transgenic and wild-type strains showed significant differences to each other, with the transgenic and wild-type strains showing a slight difference to each other (Table 1).

Transcriptomic profiling of transgenic and wild-type S. cerevisiae strains

To analyze the transcriptomic profiling of transgenic and wild-type S. cerevisiae strains, we compared the transcriptomes of the three S. cerevisiae strains, S288C, S288D and S288H. The transcriptomes of the three S. cerevisiae strains were compared using Illumina paired-end sequencing with primers specific to the P450 genes. The P450s genes were aligned using Bowtie 2.0 and the results are summarized in Table 2.

The three S. cerevisiae strains were also compared using flow cytometry. The results were similar to that of the transcriptome data. The two S.


## Discussion
brasiliensis (M26F) and . tarentum (M18B) genes were observed in P. brasiliensis M1 and M2 (Fig 3A and 3B), whereas mutations in P. tarentum M6 and P. brasiliensis M1 were found in M6 and M6A (Fig 3A and 3B). The P. brasiliensis M2 genome has a large number of P. brasiliensis genes (B6, A4, A5, B6, B7, A8, A10, and A12) and was mostly composed of M1-M6 genes, suggesting that the P. brasiliensis genome is likely to be female-specific [47]. The genome size of P. brasiliensis M6 is approximately 4.3 Mb and the genome is approximately 50% identical to P. tarentum M6 (Fig 3A and 3B). The P. brasiliensis genome was assembled into 12 contigs with a total of 35,464 bp and the sequence coverage of approximately 50% was obtained for the assembly of the M6 genome (Fig 3A and 3B). The genome size of P. tarentum M6 was approximately 2.3 Mb and the genome was assembled into 493 bp contigs. The genome size of P. tarentum M6 was approximately 2.4 Mb and the genome was assembled into 64 contigs. The P. brasiliensis genome was assembled into 3,352 contigs with an average size of 2.18 Mb and the genome was assembled into 9,772 bp.

The P. brasiliensis genome had a genome size of approximately 2.3 Mb and had high sequence similarity to P. tarentum M6 (Fig 3A and 3B). The genome of P. tarentum M6 contained approximately 6,700 genes (Additional file 1: Table S3), whereas the P. brasiliensis genome contained approximately 3,204 genes (Additional file 1: Table S3). The genome of P. tarentum was assembled into 1,729 contigs (Fig 3B), and the genome was assembled into 1,892 bp and the genome of P. tarentum was assembled into 1,246 bp. The P.
