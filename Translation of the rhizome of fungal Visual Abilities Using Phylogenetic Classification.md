## Abstract
We studied the role of CYP51A, the cytoprotective and apoptosis-associated protein, as a virulence factor in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. Using in silico analysis, we identified 5-hydroxynaphthalene (5-NE) as the major sterol-rich protein in C. gattii. Disruption of CYP51A increased its secretion and increased its virulence, supporting that protein as a virulence factor. Addition of a low affinity enzyme, cyclosynthetic dioxygenase (CyP), to the CYP51A mutant reduced the virulence of the wild type strain, indicating that CYP51A is required for virulence in C. gattii. Inhibition of fungal CYP51A by the exogenous 5-phenylethanol increased the virulence of the wild type strain, indicating that virulence-associated proteins in C. gattii are secondary requirements for the full virulence in this pathogen. Inhibition of CYP51A also increased the virulence of the mutant with a wild type background. These data suggest that the CYP51A protein is a negative regulator of virulence in C. gattii and a positive regulator of fungal virulence in the mammalian host. These data support the idea that fungal CYP51A protein plays a role in virulence and suggest that the cytoprotection of CYP51A could be an important virulence factor in C. gattii.


## Introduction
Thus, the ability to discriminate between two closely related genera, Phyostelium and Phytopthora, is a very useful biological tool for the identification of new fungi from culture collections (27.

Phyostelium is a basal genus from the Asteraceae and a basidiomyceteomycetous yeast-like group known as Ceratocystis (28). It belongs to the group of the Microstomataceae, a family of thermally dimorphic fungi and members of the Agaricomycetes. Phyostelium was first described from decaying wood (29) and was later found on trees (30). It is an apothecium that is formed by the exchange of carbon and nitrogen intermediates and is of the polyphyletic genus Ceratocystis (29). Phyostelium is distributed in temperate regions (e.g., Chile, Ecuador, and Costa Rica) and it is also found in areas of the Mediterranean (31) and Indian (32).

Ceratocystis is an economically important fungus that causes both aesthetic and crop diseases. It has been found on a wide range of substrates, including plant roots, in soil, on leaf tissue, and in food-borne food (33-35). Ceratocystis is an ascomycete with a wide range of ecological roles in plants, animals, and fungi (36, 37). Several studies have investigated the ability of Ceratocystis to colonize plants by the use of a variety of mechanisms including the production of enzymes such as chitinases, phytase, and proteases, as well as the production of hydrolytic enzymes (38, 39).

Among the enzymes produced by Ceratocystis, proteases have been shown to be crucial for the growth of both the fungus and its host plants (40, 41). The production of such enzymes is critical for the survival of Ceratocystis and for its pathogenicity. Production of chitinases, proteases, and phytases by Ceratocystis is essential for its life cycle (42). The production of these enzymes is also important for its survival and virulence on plant hosts.


## Methods
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
The leaves of P. henselae (Oryza sativa L.) were obtained from the Violet River in the Fujian Province, China. The leaves were collected in June 2013 from a forest in Fujian province of China. The leaves were cut into small pieces with a sterile razor blade and powdered at room temperature in a food storage room. The powdered leaves were then stored in a refrigerator at 4Â°C.

The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains used in this study were isolated from fungal inoculations of P. henselae obtained from the Violet River in the Fujian Province, China, from the rootstock of the following cultivar: P. henselae cv. KJ-10.


## Results
 2014. The two datasets were then clustered into a separate supertree (Figure 1). The supertree was then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 1). The supertree was then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 2). The tree was then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 3). The results are shown in Figure 4. The supertree was then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 5). The trees were then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 6). The results are shown in Figure 7. The supertree was then used to assign the visual ability to each fungal community, which was then used to develop a tree (Figure 8).

The phylogenetic tree showed that the fungal communities are largely separated from each other. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 9. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 10. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 11. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 12. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 13. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 14. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 15. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 16. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 17. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was shown in Figure 18.

Molecular Characterization and Morphological Characterization of the Fungal Community
The morphology of the fungal community is influenced by environmental factors, such as pH, salt concentration, seasons, and seasons of precipitation, which are the main factors affecting the fungal community (Zhu et al., 2014). The morphological characters of the fungal community are described in Figure 19. The fungal community of S. sclerotiorum and the S.


## Discussion
The common definition of the phyletic groups that formed in the same morphological group as the rhizome in Fusarium species is based on the concept of phyletic disorder and can be distinguished by its genus-specific character. Phylogenetic classification based on the seven protein sequences in this study confirmed that Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PCR) is the most popular method for classification of Fusarium species. PCR is based on the phylogenetic analysis of a large set of protein sequences. In this study, the identification of Fusarium species in this study was based on the seven protein sequences in this study. PCR has also been used by other authors who used a PCR for classification of fungi.

The seven protein sequences in this study confirmed that the Fusarium species in this study is well-defined by the presence of a single protein in their genomes. This indicates that the Fusarium species in this study has a high level of phyletic disorder, which is similar to that described in Fusarium species in the previous studies. This study also confirmed that this species has a high degree of phenotypic similarity to the species in the study by Liu [21]. The phyletic group was also confirmed by the combined results of phylogenetic analyses, gene expression data and phylogenetic analyses of Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PCR) using the seven protein sequences in this study. This study also confirmed that this species has a high degree of phyletic disorder, which is similar to that described in Fusarium species in the previous studies.

The Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PCR) is a more recent study that is based on protein sequences from a single collection of the Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PCR) database [23]. This study confirmed that Fusarium species in this study are well-defined by the presence of a single protein in their genomes. This is similar to that described in Fusarium species in the previous studies. Phylogenetic species recognition based on the seven protein sequences in this study is based on the phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences from the Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PCR) database. This study also confirmed that the Fusarium species in this study are well-defined by the presence of a single protein in their genomes.
