## Abstract
The wheat stem rust fungi are soil fungi causing disease and crop loss along with the agents of postharvest decay and disease propagation. Their primary productivity involves the removal of the infected grains from the dead plant after harvest. Side effects include a reduction in disease development and the enrichment of secondary metabolites. This phenomenon is called secondary metabolite reduction. Whole genome sequencing of the rust fungi Rhizophagus irregularis and R. equinum has revealed a remarkable level of similarity in genes involved in the reduction of rust fungi to secondary metabolites. In this study, we used comparative genomics to find out the different levels of activity related to the reduction of rust fungi to secondary metabolites. We found that the level of a gene's activity varies with the level of activity measured and that the expression levels of several proteins are all positively correlated with the level of activity measured. The level of a gene's activity correlated with the season, harvest time, and level of activity measured. We also found that several proteins have a conserved role in reduced rust fungi to different extents. The level of a gene's activity correlated with the harvest time, and the expression level of several proteins was positively correlated with the level of activity measured. This study provides a quantitative approach to the analysis of secondary metabolite reduction and the corresponding related secondary metabolites.


## Introduction
Rice blast disease (RDD) is a disease caused by the conidiophore Lophophophorus sp. and related rice-feeding insects (Namastii spp. and Phomatodes spp. and Phomatodes brasiliensis). The disease is characterized by a devastating impact on rice, causing an annual loss of rice in half its original range, and half of its annual yield (Odds, 1983; Pollard, 1992; Trennier and Seifert, 2012). The disease is widely distributed in temperate and tropical rice-growing regions. In some areas, such as North America and Europe, outbreaks have occurred with increasing economic and climatic relevance (Graner et al., 1998; Troxell, 2000; Dang and Lin, 2008). In Asia, outbreaks of rice blast have been observed in China, Japan, and South Korea, and rice-feeding insects are responsible for a significant economic loss in some cases (Liang et al., 2011). In Europe, outbreaks have occurred in England and Wales (Germany) in the past decade and have resulted in a decline of rice in some areas (Bianciotto et al., 2013). In South Korea, outbreaks have occurred in the north of the country (Nguyen et al., 2004), with losses exceeding 10% of the total area of the disease (Bianciotto et al., 2013).

The mechanisms that underly the increased resistance to rice blast are related to different environmental factors, such as the plant’s host diet, the plant’s genetic diversity, and the plant’s ability to adapt to different environments (Singh et al., 2012; Muhrzadeh et al., 2014; Le Chat et al., 2014). Studies have shown that the genetic and environmental factors contribute to the elevated rice blast resistance in rice (Fierer et al., 2005; Muhrzadeh et al., 2014; Bishara et al., 2015). Variation in the genetic diversity of rice blast is an adaptive response to the changes in the plant environment (Singh et al., 2012; Muhrzadeh et al., 2014).


## Methods
fumigatus AFS was cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28 °. The medium used for media and growth was used for the isolation of heterotrophic fungi. A. fumigatus were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28 °C. A. fumigatus conidia were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PPD) at 28 °C. The medium used for media and growth was used for A. fumigatus conidia. The fungal strains used in this study were S. cerevisiae strain SC5314, strain ATCC 10231, strain ATCC 90030, and strain CBS 1379 (serotype A) strain. The agar was used for sporulation. The media used for growth were YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% agar) and YPD+1% of 3,3-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) (2% peptone, 1% D-glucose, 2% dextrose, 1% D-sorbitol, 2% agar) with 2% glucose as carbon source. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.5 when required by adding 2% NaOH or 2% H_2O_2.

Mutagenesis and transformation of A. fumigatus
The A. fumigatus strain CBS 1379 was used in all transformations. To ensure that the mutant strain was not derived from a heterotrophic strain, A. fumigatus conidia were inoculated into the appropriate media and grown at 28 °C for 2 days. The resulting fungal colonies were then transferred to YPD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) containing 0.1% D-glucose. The resulting solid media was filtered through sterile cheesecloth to remove hyphae. The resultant fungal colonies were then used for DNA and RNA extraction.

For plasmid amplification, the genomic DNA of A. fumigatus was isolated from A. fumigatus conidia by using the QIAGEN Gel DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR amplification was performed using the A.


## Results
fumigatus is susceptible to . cerevisiae infection
The A. fumigatus genome contains a gene encoding a two-component histidine kinase (HK), kinase-like protein kinase (KNOX) and a protein phosphatase C (PPCC) gene, with the latter having previously been described as a heterologously expressed kinase of the PPCC family [16]. As A. fumigatus is a yeast, we tested whether the A. fumigatus KNOX gene is expressed during infection of a mouse. The A. fumigatus KNOX gene is expressed during infection and is also expressed during S. pneumoniae infection [17]. To examine whether the KNOX gene is expressed during infection of the A. fumigatus host, we performed a similar experiment using a mouse model of infection. In this system, we found that the KNOX gene was expressed in a similar fashion to that of S. pneumoniae, but the protein was expressed in a significantly lower frequency during infection (Fig 2).

A. fumigatus does not infect the mice
We next sought to determine whether A. fumigatus infects the host or whether it does so in the mouse. To examine whether the A. fumigatus KNOX gene is expressed during infection, we infected mice with the S. pneumoniae strain H99 and the mouse model of infection using a modified (human) B. dermatitidis infection model. As shown in Fig 3A, the infection was performed at a time point immediately after the first or second injection of the H99 strain, with the subsequent injection being determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Fig 3B, the infection was established after 72 hours of infection. The frequency of expression of the A. fumigatus KNOX gene during infection is high, with a peak of expression at 6 and 24 hours post infection. The KNOX gene is expressed in a similar manner to that of S. pneumoniae in mice, but is expressed in a lower frequency in mice infected with H99. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the KNOX gene is expressed during infection in the mouse.

## Discussion
albicans, . glabrata, and S. aureus. In our previous study, the efficacy of the “true” GXM-PPV was evaluated in vitro against C. albicans and C. tropicalis, respectively. In our study, we found that the “true” GXM-PPV could be effective against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and S. aureus. In our study, we also found that the “true” GXM-PPV was efficient in eradicating C. albicans and C. tropicalis. We also observed that the efficacy of the “true” GXM-PPV was similar to that of the “true” GXM-PPV, but in contrast, the “true” GXM-PPV was effective in eradicating C. albicans and C. tropicalis.

The findings of the present study suggest that the GXM-PPV is more effective against C. albicans and C. glabrata than that of the “true” GXM-PPV. This is in line with previous studies that have evaluated the efficacy of the “true” GXM-PPV against C. albicans and C. glabrata. In one study, the GXM-PPV was effective against C. albicans and C. tropicalis [14]. A recent study conducted by a bioinformatics pipeline, based on the algorithm applied in our study, reported a previously undescribed GXM-PPV antifungal activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and S. aureus [15]. In that study, the GXM-PPV was effective against C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This study is the first to report a GXM-PPV antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. glabrata.

In the current study, we observed that the “true” GXM-PPV was less effective in eradicating C. albicans and C. glabrata than the GXM-PPV.
