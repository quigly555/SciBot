## Abstract
Candida glabrata is a pathogenic yeast with a broad host range that causes superficial and life-threatening systemic infections in humans. Its high resistance to azoles and its propensity for overgrowth make it an attractive antifungal drug under certain situations, including in the context of its broad host range makes it a good target for anti-fungal development. However, it is currently only used as a last-resort therapy in limited number therapy trials, and little information is available on the resistance profile. Here we report the genome sequence of a clinical isolate of C. glabrata obtained through whole genome sequencing of the high-affinity iron-sulfur-dioxide (Fe-D-Cr-Sulfur) isolate D23580, which is clinically available for the time being, and compare it with two other clinical isolates (D23580 R2 and D23580 C115) that were obtained through sequencing of the Fe-D-Cr-Sulfur isolate D23580, one of which is resistant. The genetic diversity of the isolates is considerably reduced, and the Fe-D-Cr-Sulfur isolate D23580 shares genes with the model white-opaque syndrome strain BRF11, but differs from the other clinical isolates in several aspects, including its lack of tandem repeats and the presence of a homologous protein. The genetic diversity of the other isolates is significantly reduced, and the isolate R23580 is also reduced. Our results suggest that resistance to azoles and fungicides is a consequence of genetic divergence in the two clinical isolates of C. glabrata, and not a reflection of strain-specific speciation or chromosome content differences between strains of similar mating type.

Isolates of clinically important yeasts have been studied extensively, and comparative genomic studies have rarely been performed to isolate new strains for study of genetic diversity, phenotypic or pharmacological characteristics, or for developing new drugs. Yet, their genomic characteristics and pharmacological properties are very common in these species, and there is very little known about these isolates of Candida glabrata about. These results suggest that a common ancestral pathogen emerged as an after-effect of azole treatment and that the emergence of resistance to azole treatments was influenced by genetic divergence in the two isolates of Candida glabrata.

The authors have decided not to publish the peer review history of their article, which was written before the publication date of this article. The review process was described in detail in their response to the first letter of Reviewing Editor (with reviews from several experts) and the information provided in the peer review has been compiled from that communication. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the authors have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised version of your submission.

Summary:

The manuscript describes a new method for quantifying the abundance of pathogens on rice leaves using microarray. The authors conducted a quantitative analysis of fungi in the leaves and described their ability to degrade these byproducts. The paper then goes on to state that the paper "“prints’ out the statistical tiered models for the majority of fungi examined, which is a major concern. I am not convinced of the statistical tiered models. The paper is well written and informative. The statistical tiered models should be published. I would recommend the publication of the study.

Comments:

1) This is a very interesting study. The results indicate that the microarray method is useful for detecting abundance of pathogens on rice leaves. The authors could provide more information about the microarray methodology, which could be further expanded upon in the manuscript. For example, the analysis of the abundance of pathogenic bacteria in leaves can be performed using microarrays.

2) The study is very interesting and the findings are of high quality. However, the review process needs to be improved considerably.

3) The methods used in the present study were chosen based on their performance, and the results are presented in an easy-to-understand manner.

4) The authors should pay attention to the following:

- “Microarray analysis”: their analysis should consider microarrays and/or computer simulations. The authors should pay attention to the following:

- “““the measurement error of microarrays”, i.e.


## Methods
thaliana LAGS1 (S1 File), . thaliana LAGS2 (S2 File), M. thaliana LAGS3 (S3 File), and M. thaliana LAGS4 (S4 File). The starting tree is available in Table 1. The fungal species were used in the selection of the search pathogen for selection in the tree of life. M. thaliana LAGS1 (S1 File) and M. thaliana LAGS2 (S2 File) were chosen for the search, M. thaliana LAGS1 was selected as a search pathogen, M. thaliana LAGS2 was chosen as a search pathogen, and M. thaliana LAGS3 was selected as a search pathogen. In the case of the M. thaliana LAGS4, M. thaliana LAGS4, M. thaliana LAGS5 (S2 File) and M. thaliana LAGS6 (S3 File) were selected. M. thaliana LAGS5 was selected as the search pathogen, M. thaliana LAGS6 was selected as a search pathogen, and M. thaliana LAGS7 (S3 File) was selected as a search pathogen. The new species were named after the genera M. thaliana, M. thaliana, M. thaliana, and M. thaliana. The genus name was taken from the Dictionary of Phytopathogens (Dfor), and the geographical origin of the new species was assigned to the place of origin. The search parameters were as follows: species name = M. thaliana, species name = M. thaliana, species name = M. thaliana, search pathogen = M. thaliana, search pathogen = M. thaliana, search pathogen = M. thaliana, pathogen = M. thaliana, search pathogen = M. thaliana, pathogen = M. thaliana, search pathogen = M. thaliana, pathogen = M. thaliana, pathogen = M. thaliana, pathogen = M.


## Results
The first group was composed of the prime and the adjuvant, whereas the second group contained only the adjuvant and the third group was composed of the adjuvant and the other adjuvan. The results indicated that the composition of the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was similar between the adjuvant and the other adjuvants. The result suggested that the adjuvant had a better anti-inflammatory activity than the other adjuvants.

Analysis of the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES
The total concentration of the metabolites in the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was higher than that in the control group. The results indicated that the concentration of the metabolites in the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was higher than that in the control group. The concentration of the metabolites in the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was higher than that in the control group.

Effect of the Carbon Source and the Inhibitory Activity of the Proteolytic Compounds on the Antifungal Activity of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES
The inhibitory activity of the compound in the PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was evaluated against the different fungal species by S. cerevisiae. The results showed that the compound did not show inhibitory activity against the six species of S. cerevisiae. The inhibition was not significant when the activity was 20 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL. However, it was significant when the activity was 20 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively. The results indicated that the compound did not show inhibitory activity against the six species of S. cerevisiae.

Effect of the Carbon Source on the Antifungal Activity of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES
The anti-inflammatory activity of the compounds on the anti-fungal activity of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICLES was evaluated by the S. cerevisiae TOCR assay. The results showed that the anti-fungal activity of the compounds was not significant when the concentration of the compounds was 20 µg/mL, compared to the control group.


## Discussion
We show that these patients also have a higher proportion of patients with co-infection of Cryptococcus species than those with HI. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the diagnosis of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips is substantially delayed and that in-hospital mortality is comparable to those of HIV patients who do not have a CD4+ cell count lower than 200 cells/µL.

Our data also demonstrate that patients with HIV have a greater proportion of patients with other PLANT infections. This could be explained by the fact that patients with HIV are more likely to be treated for opportunistic infections in the home.

A recent study of HIV/AIDS patients with PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips found that only a minority had a CD4+ cell count lower than 200 cells/µL [14]. In a study of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips, only 12% had a CD4+ cell count lower than 200 cells/µL [17]. We show that this might be due to the fact that patients with HIV are more likely to have co-infection of Cryptococcus species with those with HIV.

PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips were more often seen in patients with HIV. Patients with HIV infection were more likely to have PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips. In a study of PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips, only 7% had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/µL [18]. It was possible that PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips might be more common in patients with HIV, as more patients with HIV had CD4+ cell counts >200 cells/µL. We do not believe that this is a general trend.

In the case of patients with HIV, PLANT CRYPTOCOCCAL ARTICELhips are more likely to occur in patients with CD4+ cell counts <200 cells/µL.
