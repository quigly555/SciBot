## Abstract
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a very efficient aerobic platform for microbial colonization. Bacterial colonization is usually carried out by a number of aerobic bacteria, some of which might be considered as commensal organisms.


## Introduction
Pathogenic microbes invade their host tissues through organs or fluids as they traverse the blood-brain barrier and the blood-chemotherapy pathway [1]. The secreted proteins secreted by these pathogens have been shown to modulate the immune response of the host, and this may be one of the main activities of these pathogens. For example, antibody-mediated phagocytosis (ABMM) and antibody-mediated killing (ABCM) of Candida albicans are two well-known ABMM activities, which are both directed at the phagolysosome and are directed at the endocytic system [2]. These activities are generally directed against bacteria or fungi, and most of them are considered virulence factors. The mechanisms by which these pathogens secrete proteins and other molecules that are not normally secreted or associated with the phagocytic system remain poorly understood.

In the late 1970s, a phenomenon called “chemosensory escape” was observed in mouse models of pneumonitis caused by C. albicans [3]. C. albicans activates the immunosensitization response, and mice treated with cg-1-MMP-Sulfoxamine showed that C. albicans was able to survive and replicate inside macrophages and in the extracellular space of macrophages [3]. This escape from macrophages was associated with the immunosensitizing effect of mTOR (pub. file, file:///PR/cg/cg.15444) [4].

The release of molecules that are not typical secretory or membrane proteins has been a major focus of research into the mechanism of escape of pathogens from the macrophages. Among these molecules, lipoproteins, proteins, and peptides were identified as important to facilitate the release of macrophage-derived molecules [5-7]. In mice, lipoproteins and proteins are released from macrophages after infection with a C. albicans strain [8]. These molecules can either be released from the macrophage or be internalized. The internalized molecules then travel through the cell membrane and can affect the outcome of the immune response [8, 9].


## Methods
italicum was examined with an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camer. The agar-embedded biofilm was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated with continuous shaking at 37°C for 24 h.

The microscopic analysis was performed by using a Nikon Eclipse TS-U2 high-definition digital camera equipped with a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera and a Nikon NIS-Elements D100 digital camera. The Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera was used for bright field, phase contrast and fluorescence imaging. The Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera was used for other imaging with a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera. A Nikon D9500 digital camera was used for image analysis. The images were captured using a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera and edited using Photoshop. The maximum intensity of the biofilm was evaluated using a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera using the Image J.

Microscopic analysis
The P. italicum biofilm was observed with an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera. The agar-embedded biofilm was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated with continuous shaking at 37°C for 24 h. The fungus was then washed with distilled water, washed twice with distilled water and observed with a Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera and a Nikon NIS-Elements D100 digital camera. The fungus was considered as a visible and clear biofilm when it was observed with bright field, phase contrast and fluorescence images.

The macro-morphological characteristics of P. italicum were compared with those of its natural environment, namely, soil, air and water. The experiment was performed in six different soil or air samples from P. italicum.

## Results
were isolated from soil and water, but were not found on leaves of plant material, fruits, or seeds of other plant specie. P. pannorum (Agaricomycetes) is a plant pathogen of various kinds. It has been reported that P. pannorum causes leaf spots, leaf spots are round, and is easily distinguishable from other Pseudomonas spp. by its small size and the absence of a mucoid apical appendage.

Pseudomonas rhododendri (Persicimonas) was isolated from soil and water and was not found in any other plant species, but was found in various plants as a leaf-spotting fungus. It was also found in some species of the genus P. persicimonas. In addition, P. rhododendri was found in several species of the genus P. pannorum.

Pseudomonas s. str. was isolated from soil, and was not found in any other plant species. It is not known if it can infect fruit, vegetables, or flowers.

Pseudomonas s. lat. is also known as P. strelitziae (Persicimonas s. str.); it has been reported that P. strelitziae is a leaf-spotting fungus of various kinds.

Pseudomonas yamashii (Persicimonas yamashii) was isolated from soil and water and was not found in any other plant species.

Pseudomonas yamashii (Persicimonas yamashii) was described from soil and water. It was not reported in any other plant species.

Pseudomonas nadendri (Persicimonas nadendri) was isolated from soil and water and was not found in any other plant species.

Pseudomonas nadendri (Persicimonas nadendri) was found in several species of the genus P. nadendri. In addition, it was found in some species of the genus P. pannorum.

Pseudomonas yamashii (Persicimonas yamashii) was isolated from soil and water and was not found in any other plant species.


## Discussion
was carried out using polyketide-producing bacteri. The results of biological activity tests (BSTs) of polyketide-producing bacteria are shown in Table 1.

The activity of polyketide-producing bacteria against Pseudomonas spp. has been reported in the literature [12]. However, the phenotypes of Pseudomonas spp. in the present study and results in Table 1 are not related to the production of polyketides.

The biological activity of polyketides produced by Pseudomonas spp. is significantly different from the activities produced by other yeasts. All the polyketide producing bacteria tested in this study were able to produce xanthochromes, which are produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. However, the production of polyketides was dependent on the strains of Candida species and did not have an effect on Candida albicans, but were less efficient than that of C. neoformans, which produced a very potent polyketide [14].

The activity of Polyketide produced by Pseudomonas spp. in the present study is comparable to that of polyketide produced by Trichosporon spp. in the literature [14]. The isolated polyketide showed high activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans in the present study, but not against C. neoformans, which produced polyketides [15].

Polyketides from Pseudomonas spp. have been reported as potent bioactive compounds and protective bioactive compounds against various microbial strains [15]. It is known that polyketides have a broad spectrum of biological activity and they have different biological activities in different physiological and pathological conditions. However, the chemical composition of polyketides varies according to the plant species, geographical origin and the production medium used. In this study, we found that Pseudomonas spp. produced polyketides. Polyketides are synthesized by the fungi in a number of plant species such as Ceriporiopsis, Sporobolomyces, Fusarium, Fusarium sp. and Fusarium graminearum [16,17]. Some fungal species produce polyketides and other biological activities that are not related to their natural compounds. For example, C.
