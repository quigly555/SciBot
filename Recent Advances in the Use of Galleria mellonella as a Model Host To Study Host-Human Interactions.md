## Abstract
Olea africhera and O. fruticosa are two of the most important crop species in the world, but the fungal communities of these two species are poorly characterized. In this study, we identified a new genus of 26 putative yeasts (Oleaginosporus) in the root of O. fruticosa and used comparative genomics to investigate their fungal communities and to identify the composition of their fungal community structures. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the large D1/D2 domain of the fungal-specific unigene rootkit assembly and revealed four major clades. The O. fruticosa rootkit contained 43.54% Metschnikowia sp., 34.16% Ophiocordyceps sp., and 28.17% Cladosporium sp., while the O. fruticosa-specific unigene-stored-roots was only found in the second half of the tree. A survey of the community structure of the O. fruticosa rootkit revealed a mixture of different species, including O. melanitensis, O. suttonii, O. terricola, O. terricola, and O. clypeus, which could be related to the occurrence of the harvest berries. The characterization of the O. fruticosa community revealed that a large proportion of the fungi were composed of recently described species, including O. melanitensis, O. stolonifera, O. fragilisporus, and O. bacillisporus, which were also associated to previous reports of unidentified species. This study not only sheds light on the distribution and community composition of these two major groups of yeasts but also may be useful for the discovery of novel methods for the study of the fungal diversity of O. fruticosa.


## Introduction
Oomycetes are filamentous fungi that cause many severe diseases in humans and animals, including systemic infections. In recent years, a number of opportunistic fungal infections have been increasingly reported in immunocompromised patients, including burn patients, recipients of burn wounds, and patients with hematological malignancies. ^1, 2 This phenomenon has been attributed to the relatively slow adaptation of the pathogen to antifungal therapy and, as a consequence, to the severity of the infection. ^3 Several aspects of the antifungal resistance of oomycetes have been shown to be mainly due to the small size of the spores and the ability of the fungus to resist the antifungal drugs.


## Methods

All animal procedures were approved by the University of Alberta Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care (COAT) guidelines [16. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines [17].

Physiological Analysis
Galleria mellonella (Musaeria muris) were placed in Petri dishes (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) with 8 mm of moist filter paper covered with aluminum foil. To mimic the natural environment, 10 µl of conidial suspension (1×10^6 conidia/ml) was spread evenly over the surface of the filter paper. The diameter of the colony was measured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at ×200 magnification. The number of conidia per gram of tissue was counted, and the number of conidia present was calculated based on the colony number. To measure the conidial concentration, a sterile cotton swab was used, and conidial suspension (1×10^6 conidia/ml) was spread evenly over the surface of the filter paper. The diameter of the colony was measured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at ×200 magnification.

P. brasiliensis (Musaeria aurantiaca) was isolated from gum tree roots of a watery bottomed tree bark (Hiran, Shizuoka, Japan) [18]. The fungus was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at room temperature. It was stored at 4°C until use. The bark was rinsed with sterile distilled water and treated with 0.1% Tween 20 in ethanol at 30°C for 10 min. The inoculated bark was then rinsed with sterile distilled water and the number of conidia was counted with a hemacytometer. The fungus was cultivated on PDA at room temperature.

For determination of the effect of the inoculum on the fungal growth, a single colony from 10^6 to 10^7 conidia/ml was inoculated on PDA slants at room temperature. The growth was examined under the microscope for three days and the lowest conidia concentration of 0.1% Tween 20 was considered as the minimal inhibitory concentration. The fungus was cultivated on PDA at room temperature.


## Results
graminearu. Galleria mellonella was used as a model host for all three techniques described above, although Galleria mellonella was most effective for the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum (F. graminearum) interaction. In the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction, the plant was used as the model host, but Galleria mellonella was more effective than other plant materials and it was more effective than other plant materials in terms of the interaction of F. graminearum and F. graminearum. The interaction between F. graminearum and the plant was successfully performed in the Galleria mellonella interaction. The interaction between F. graminearum and the plant was also successful in the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction, but the plant was more effective in terms of the interaction of F. graminearum and F. graminearum.

Gelera is a Cytomegalovirus, which is not a human pathogen
The interactions between the plant and the animal were successful in the Galleria mellonella interaction, but the interaction between the plant and the animal was more successful in terms of the interaction between the plant and the animal. The interactions between the plant and the animal were also successful in the Galleria mellonella interaction. The interactions between the plant and the animal were also successful in the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction. The interactions between the plant and the animal were also successful in the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction. In the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction, the plant was used as the model host, but the interaction between the plant and the animal was successful in terms of the interaction between the plant and the animal.

Gelera is not a parasite
In order to identify the pathogenicity of the plant material used as the host animal, we performed a comparative analysis with the pathogen F. graminearum. We first measured the virulence of F. graminearum in the Galleria mellonella-F. graminearum interaction.


## Discussion
We used larval hemolysis to gain insight into the interactions of different fungus and host in our syste. We found that the growth of fungal pathogens is not influenced by hemolysis but rather by host factors (Figures 2, 3). The occurrence of fungal pathogens in the hemolysis medium suggests that the fungal pathogens are able to disseminate to the brain. This could be an effect of host tissue or tissue-type that depends on the fungus. Alternatively, the establishment of a fungal infection could be highly beneficial to the host. We found that the host-fungus interaction, but not the fungus itself, is necessary for fungal growth in the brain. The fungal pathogen in this model is a large, multicellular fungus that can grow in both hemolysis and medium (Figure 4). The infection of larvae by this fungus could have been facilitated by the use of hemolysis and/or medium-derived nutrients. This hypothesis is consistent with the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans as a fungal pathogen in vitro (Figure 5A).

Pseudogenes were induced by hemolysis in the initial stages of infection (Figure 4A) and then decreased after a few days (Figure 5B). The necrosis of the fungal infection and subsequent infection with Candida albicans was increased after a few days hemolysis. As expected, infection of larvae with C. neoformans was inhibited by the use of hemolysis, but necrosis was not as significant as that seen in infection with C. albicans. This indicates that the hemolysis of C. neoformans is not the only factor affecting fungal growth in vitro. Hemolysis of C. neoformans is known to increase virulence of C. neoformans (64). In addition, hemolysis is known to increase fungal virulence (65). The hemolysis of C. neoformans is a key factor of fungal virulence (66). Our data demonstrate that C. neoformans can utilize hemolysis to induce infection and promote dissemination of C. neoformans in mammals. However, infection of C.
