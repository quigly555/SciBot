## Abstract
Phagocytosis is a fundamental process in eukaryotes that enables the rapid detection of outcrossing opportunistic fungi. A variety of signaling pathways control the reactivation of phagocytosis, which is a crucial step in the establishment of infection. Two classes of conserved transporters control phagocytosis: the alpha- and beta-proteins and effector proteins. To understand the role of alpha- and beta-proteins in phagocytosis, we identified the conserved GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family of transporters in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the GAP family is required for efficient phagocytosis. We analyzed the role of the GAP family during infection by 39 fungal species and found that the GAP family members only partially modulate the response to phagocytosis. We examined the effect of the GAP family member on growth and virulence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that the GAP family member members rescued the growth defect of S. cerevisiae when compared to homozygous GAP-dysregulated strains. However, we observed a decrease in virulence of S. cerevisiae when compared to homozygous GAP-dysregulated strains. Furthermore, we show that the deletion of the GAP family member affected the behavior of S. cerevisiae when it was infective, and the increased survival of the mutant strain S.


## Introduction
Increased incidence is caused by the increase in the number of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the widespread use of transplant and antiretroviral drugs, and the increased number of patients on anti-tuberculous therapy (1-3. The HIV/AIDS pandemic caused an increase in the incidence of HIV/AIDS patients on ARTs; however, the global HIV pandemic was also associated with a dramatic increase in the rate of deaths from HIV/AIDS (4). However, the global HIV pandemic also led to an increase in the incidence of opportunistic infections (5). Furthermore, the increase in opportunistic infections has led to an increased incidence of opportunistic infections, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/AIDS patients (6, 7). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS was up to 19,000 in early 2014 and 43,100 cases in 2015 (8). The most common opportunistic infection caused by opportunistic fungi is histoplasmosis, which is caused by the opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (9). The opportunistic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen in HIV patients, which causes an acute infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and life-threatening disseminated cryptococcosis (10). The clinical manifestations of cryptococcosis can be variable and vary significantly from person to person, depending on the immune status of the individual (11-13). For example, the rarer forms, such as pneumonia and meningitis, can be more severe than meningoencephalitis due to tuberculosis (14).

Infections by opportunistic fungi have rarely been reported in patients on ARTs. In these patients, the infection is usually associated with opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis, which can also be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (14). This opportunistic yeast has the ability to invade the brain tissue of HIV/AIDS patients. It can survive for months or years and can cause a fatal outcome (15, 16).


## Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the relevant ethical guidelines and regulations of the Medical University of Ira. All the patients were investigated for the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. The Cryptococcal Optimal Timing (COAT) study was conducted in accordance with the Iranian Ministry of Health guidelines on the use of human resources in this study.

Methods
Patients with cryptococcosis were classified as those with a positive serum cryptococcal antigen test result, positive CSF India ink smear, positive cerebrospinal fluid India ink stain, and positive cerebrospinal fluid India ink stain. All these patients received treatment and counselling at the Medical University of Iran Hospital.

Patients with cryptococcal antigen tests positive for India ink, India ink stain, cerebrospinal fluid India ink stain, and cerebrospinal fluid India ink stain were classified as ‘non-carcinogenic’. Non-carcinogenic patients were those who were diagnosed with a clinical diagnosis of cryptococcosis and those had no other medical conditions. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of cryptococcosis were those without CNS or psychiatric symptoms and without any other clinical features.

Among patients, only those patients with clinical diagnosis of cryptococcosis and CNS symptoms were included in the study. The Cryptococcal Optimal Timing (COAT) study was conducted in accordance with the Ministry of Health guidelines. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group included those with a clinical diagnosis of cryptococcosis and a non-carcinogenic group. The second group included patients with a clinical diagnosis of CNS or psychiatric symptoms, and non-carcinogenic patients. The patients were categorized into three groups: patients with a clinical diagnosis of CNS or psychiatric symptoms, and non-carcinogenic patients.

For the COAT study, all the patients were divided into two groups. The first group included patients with a clinical diagnosis of CNS or psychiatric symptoms. The second group included patients with a non-carcinogenic diagnosis. The patients were categorized as those with a clinical diagnosis of CNS or psychiatric symptoms.

The cerebrospinal fluid India ink test (CLSI) test was performed in accordance with the Iranian Ministry of Health guidelines.


## Results
. B. dermatitidis Isolated from a Manure Substitution
The mycelial growth and conidiation of B. dermatitidis and B. dermatitidis were assessed by mycelial growth and sporulation of the two strains, the latter as well as the isolate B-78. After 24 h incubation in the dark, the colonies of both strains were indistinguishable from the control and B-78 strains (Figure 1).

2.2. B. dermatitidis Isolated from a Manure Substitution
B. dermatitidis cultures were subjected to the electrophoresis of mycelia of the wild type strain, which revealed a few typical features such as blastoconidia and hyphal filaments (Figure 2). The fungal cell wall was observed to be thickened and darker than the surrounding air (Figure 2). The conidia were smooth, ellipsoidal, and smooth (Figure 2). The spores were smooth, cylindrical, and smooth (Figure 2). The conidial morphology of the wild type strain was identical to that of the B. dermatitidis strain (Figure 2). The conidial shape of the B. dermatitidis strain was similar to that of the B. dermatitidis strain.

2.3. The Same Growth Conditions for the Different Strains Were Similar
In order to further characterize the growth characteristics of B. dermatitidis and B. dermatitidis, the colony morphology and the conidial morphology of the wild type strain were compared. The aerial hyphal growth of B. dermatitidis was similar to that of the B. dermatitidis strain, and the aerial hyphal growth of B. dermatitidis was comparable to that of the B. dermatitidis strain (Figure 3). The conidial morphology of the wild type strain was similar to that of the B. dermatitidis strain (Figure 3).

2.4. The Conidial Length in B. dermatitidis Is Higher than that of B. dermatitidis

The aerial hyphal growth of B. dermatitidis and B. dermatitidis were also similar to that of the B. dermatitidis strain. The aerial hyphal growth of B. dermatitidis was similar to that of the B. dermatitidis strain, and the aerial hyphal growth of B. dermatitidis was comparable to that of the B.


## Discussion
As of 2015, there are fewer clinical data available on fungal infections in individuals with HIV and the number of fungal infections is increasin. Furthermore, the number of HIV-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis remains high, with 1 in 5 individuals with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis presenting to hospital [2]. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is most commonly found in individuals with HIV and the majority of individuals presenting to hospitals are from sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV and tuberculosis are endemic [4]. However, there are few published studies in this area and there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. We are currently unable to perform an evaluation of Cryptococcus detection by bronchoalveolar lavage. To date, there has been no evidence of Cryptococcus infection in the lungs or blood of HIV-infected individuals.

This study suggests that in addition to immunocompromised individuals, there may be individuals in sub-Saharan Africa who have acquired cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in response to a rare disease, such as tuberculosis, and those individuals may be more likely to acquire cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in the absence of other immunocompromised conditions.

Cryptococcus spp. is a common pathogen in HIV-infected individuals and the majority of individuals presenting to hospitals are from sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are few studies examining the prevalence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa. Due to the low prevalence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of individuals presenting to hospital are from sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are few studies investigating the incidence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa.

In our study, patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis had a higher prevalence in men with HIV, and the association between cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and elevated serum CrAg was similar to the association between HIV-1 latency and cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in previous studies [2, 9, 10]. In our study, the CrAg prevalence in those with HIV was higher in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
