# Pulmonary Cryptococcosis: The Need for Clear-Cutaneous Cryptococcal Disease to VetEURGA Recommendations
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Microbial metabolism is a fundamental component of the redox state. Lipid accumulation in the presence of mitochondrial electron transport chain has been reported as an oxidative response in many eukaryotes. We recently identified a member of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Tet/Met/Plb) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is likely that it is an independent factor in the regulation of electron transport in yeasts.

We analyzed the distribution and functional potential of yeast mitochondrial DNA by using the URA5-W3 strain, a non-typhoidal, transcription factor-dependent strain of Scapularickia pachydermatis. We compared the analyzed yeast with its human mitochondrial genome.

Our analysis revealed that the analyzed yeast mitochondrial genome is more similar to the human mitochondrial genome than most other fungi, including Trichoderma reesei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It contains a large subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a member that is not conserved. The analysis showed that the analyzed yeast mitochondrial genome is more similar to the yeast human mitochondrial genome than is Trichoderma reesei. We also showed that the yeast human mitochondrial genome contains a large subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These findings indicate that the analysis is related to mitochondrial function.

## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a common opportunistic fungal infection in HIV/AIDS patients. The most common site of infection is the central nervous system (CNS) and the most common site of infection in the lungs is the skin [1, 2]. However, the frequency of this site of infection varies in different regions of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, more than 50% of HIV/AIDS patients present for care without any indication of the presence of HIV/AIDS [3]. In developing countries, C. neoformans is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients with respiratory and hematologic failure in this region [4-7]. The clinical presentation is diverse and can range from asymptomatic to disseminated disease and life-threatening illness. Early antifungal treatment can be instituted at the point of infection and prevention of dissemination is imperative. However, the selection of the optimal antifungal drug is still challenging and has not been well characterized.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the combination of Amphotericin B (AMB) and flucytosine (5FC) should be used for the management of patients with CM. The combination of AMB with 5FC has a well-documented safety profile.


## Methods
The majority of cases are due to pulmonary cryptococcosis, and there is no data regarding clinical management in such case. If cryptococcal disease is suspected in patients with active CNS infection, and if proven, the patient is considered to have CNS infection. Thus, cryptococcosis in CNS infection is considered as a single event.

Meningitis may occur during an infection, with a higher incidence of symptoms, such as headache, altered mental status, or a focal neurological deficit. In cases of meningitis, the underlying cause of infection is unknown.

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis occurs when a patient exhibits focal neurological deficits, such as seizures, altered mental status, or a focal neurological deficit. As a consequence, these patients are referred to the neurology clinic for meningoencephalitis.

In some patients with severe meningoencephalitis, the underlying cause of infection can be proven by clinical and radiological results, such as neuroanatomic examination, brain MRI, and CT scan.

Patients with severe meningoencephalitis may also be referred to the neurology clinic for CNS infection.

Time to Death
Patients who are terminally diagnosed with meningoencephalitis due to cryptococcosis, and who are alive in the next 12 months are considered to have time to death. Time to death is defined as the time required for patient to recover from a specific physical or psychiatric disorder and the time since death to complete the treatment for the same disorder.

Medical diagnoses for meningoencephalitis due to cryptococcosis are based on clinical signs and symptoms, such as headache, altered mental status, and/or neurological deficits. They are also based on patient history, such as neuroanatomic examination, CT scan, and/or CT scan of brain biopsy or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Laboratory methods
The specimens collected in the study were from three different countries, and the clinical diagnoses were recorded.


## Results
Clinical indications for candidiasis are highly variable and require a definitive diagnosis based on clinical dat. Clear-Cutaneous Cryptococcosis is a frequent complication of candidiasis and is a major cause of death in patients with candidiasis [31]. The role of Cryptococcus in clearing the infection and limiting transfusion to prevent transfusion is currently unclear.

In addition, we recommend clearing the infection and reducing blood transfusion to prevent transfusion in the event of a suspected infection. We recommend that patients with pulmonary candidiasis be referred to the local healthcare facility for further support. Clear-Cutaneous Cryptococcosis is caused by candidiasis and can be caused by any of the following: S. aureus (S. aureus) or S. aureus candidosis: S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S. aureus candidosis with S.


## Discussion
In general, the Infectious Diseases agents to vetEURGA recommendations have been based on the patient’s overall medical history and laboratory finding. For the patient with pulmonary cryptococcosis, the Infectious Diseases agent to vetEURGA recommendations have been based on the patient’s disease history, physical examination, and laboratory results.
