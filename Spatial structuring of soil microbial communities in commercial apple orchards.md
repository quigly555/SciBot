## Abstract
The cAMP-binding module of the transcription factor Flo8 is involved in diverse physiological processes, and its precise role in stress adaptation and virulence remains unknown. Here, we show that Flo8 is essential for growth and filamentation in Aspergillus nidulans and filamentous fungi, and also contributes to the development of biofilm development. Flo8 is essential for the filamentation machinery, and the ability of these organisms to survive in host immune defenses. We also show that A. nidulans Flo8 is important for the hyphal morphology transition, which is a major virulence factor of this fungus. Furthermore, A. nidulans Flo8 is essential for the photoprotective activity of a-amylase mutants, and for preventing virulence-associated phenotypes. We also identify and characterize a-amylase mutants, which may be useful in further understanding of Flo8 function in A. nidulans and filamentous fungi.

Many fundamental biological processes are regulated by a complex set of structural and signaling factors. However, the role of Flo8 in filamentation and development is largely unknown. Here, we show that the master regulator of filamentation in A. nidulans and filamentous fungi is essential for virulence and that inhibitors of Flo8 function may be useful for further understanding of this fundamental biological process.


## Introduction
The yeast genus Candida contains over 200 species, of which approximately 200 are opportunistic pathogens, while only one species is an environmental yeast. Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are commensals of the human microbiota. While their numbers have decreased in the past few decades, their candidiasis remains a problem, with an estimated incidence of about 1.4 million cases/year (Rajma et al., 2017).


## Methods
Four commercial apple orchards in the city of Boru (ANZ) have been chosen based on their ecological characteristics (insect biomass, land use, land use pattern) and geographical location (urbanicity, vegetation type, and spatial patterns. The land use patterns of Boru and Anz are similar to the environment described in the study by Prakash et al. [17] and are shown in Table 1. The species and habitat of the sampled soil samples are presented in Table 2.

In this study, the total amount of soil samples was calculated from the soil microbiota (bacteria) and from the soil microbial communities (microbiomes) in the apple orchards. The soil samples were measured on a soil analyser (DET) with a distance of 2 m^2 in a total time step of 12 h (EtOAc = 1.4 mL min^-1, H_2O = 0.2 mL min^-1). The TMT method [18] was used to analyse the microbial communities, which were calculated as the lowest number of colonies per gram of soil and as the number of bacteria per gram of soil. The soil microbial community analysis was performed in triplicate, and results were reported as the average from all replicates. In this study, only the soil microbial communities were reported in the apple orchards, and the samples from the apple orchards were not used in this study.

In the laboratory, bacterial and fungal communities were measured using a standard bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing method (ABI PRISMÂ® III; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the primers ITS1 and ITS4 [19], [20] and a fungal ITS region amplified using the primers ITS3 [21] and ITS4 [22]. The bacterial and fungal communities were represented in the table with the exception of the soil microbial community analysis. For the soil microbial community analyses, the soil samples were collected in the same soil chemical facility as the soil microbial communities. The soil samples were quantified using the Microbial 16S rRNA Vitek MS^2 (Becton Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA).


## Results
The most abundant OTUs identified in the two fields were the soil fungi (average relative abundance of .59%), followed by soil bacteria (average relative abundance of 1.02%). The number of OTUs per site ranged from five to nine in the two apple andchards (Figure 1 and Table S2). The average relative abundance of fungal OTUs was higher in the two fields, ranging from 2.02% in the apple andchards to 4.22% in the two apple andchards (Figure S2). The fungi abundance in the two fields was comparable between the two cultivars, with the highest number of OTUs in the apple andchards. The highest abundance of fungal OTUs in the two fields was observed in the field in the two cultivars, with the highest abundance observed in the field in the two cultivars.

The soil microbial community structure was assessed by RAxML (Table 1). The soil microbial community structures in the two cultivars were similar, with the most distinct taxa being the soil fungal community, and the remaining significant differences included the presence of soil bacteria (average relative abundance of 1.43%) and soil fungi (average relative abundance of 1.27%) (Table 1). The soil fungal community structure in the two cultivars was also similar, with the most distinct taxa being the soil fungal community, and the remaining significant differences included the presence of soil fungi (average relative abundance of 1.22%) and soil bacteria (average relative abundance of 1.19%).

Effect of the seed selection on soil fungal community structure
To identify soil fungal community structure in the two cultivars, we next assessed the impact of a set of nine different seed selection treatments on fungal community structure in the two soil microhabitats. First, we compared the fungal community structure in the two cultivars in the seed selection process using both primers (Figure 2A). The primers were applied in the two cultivars and the resulting data were used to create the two seed selection conditions. The seed selection conditions were applied in both the apple andchards and the two cultivars.

The three most dominant fungal genera detected in the two cultivars were Stagonospora (average relative abundance of 1.55%), Rhodotorula (average relative abundance of 1.


## Discussion
This study is the first to identify soil microorganisms associated with apple orchards and to provide evidence that this diversity is a result of fungal and bacterial community structure. The fungal communities in apple orchards were higher than those found in commercial apple orchards in the United States and the Netherlands. Our findings also indicate that fungal communities in apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands are likely to be higher than those in the commercial apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands.

The soil microbial communities in apple orchards were found to be higher than those found in commercial apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands. The fungi detected in the apple orchards were mainly saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. They were mostly found in the apple orchards, but also in the apple tree tissue. The fungal communities in the apple orchards were generally similar to those found in commercial apple orchards, but in the apple tree tissue they were significantly higher than the communities in the apple tree tissue. The fungi found in the apple orchards were mainly saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. They were mainly found in the apple orchards, but also in the apple tree tissue. In our study, there was no significant difference in the fungal communities between apple orchards in the United States and the Netherlands. This suggests that the fungi in the apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands are more diverse than the fungal communities in the apple orchards in the Netherlands.

In the apple tree tissue, the fungi were mainly saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. They were mainly found in the apple orchards, but also in the apple tree tissue. It was also found that the fungal communities in the apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands were significantly higher than those in the commercial apple orchards in the United States and Netherlands. The fungi in the apple orchards were mainly saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. They were mainly found in the apple orchards, but also in the apple tree tissue. In our study, there was no significant difference in the fungal communities between apple orchards in the United States and the Netherlands. This indicates that the fungi in the apple orchards are more diverse than the fungi in the commercial apple orchards.
