## Abstract
The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains a major challenge in the medical setting. Aspergillus fumigatus is a prevalent mycosis pathogen in humans and animals worldwide. Aspergillus terreus is the most common causative agent of this disease. We recently recognized A. fumigatus as a unique strain with the ability to cause invasive aspergillosis (IPA). We hypothesized that this yeast would have an additional role as a causative agent in other diseases in which Aspergillus fumigatus has also been shown to have a role. We therefore conducted a transcriptome-based study to define the transcriptomes and examine their association with IPA. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis revealed a wide spectrum of expression patterns, with the exception of some patterns seen during the transition from yeast to Aspergillus. Analysis of these differential patterns revealed potential additional roles for the differentially expressed genes. These included, the reprogramming of the gene transcriptional network and the expression of key pathways important for the ability of A. fumigatus to grow in a variety of host tissues and conditions. Finally, we also examined the reprogramming of the transcriptome in response to A. fumigatus infections.


## Introduction
Acanthamoeba polyphaga is a marine freshwater microorganism that has been used as a model organism for studying a wide variety of biological processes [1,2]. A. polyphaga has been used in a variety of biotechnological applications, including bioremediation [3-5] and wastewater treatment [6-9]. A. polyphaga has a wide range of bioactive agents which include amoeba proteins, amoebas-protein [10], [11], protozoa proteins, amoeba-lipids, [12-14] and [15].


## Methods
gattii, . neoformans, C. krusei, and C. neoformans were identified by phylogenetic analyses (Table 2). For each protein, the species-level distribution was obtained by computing the species-wide distribution (LSU) of the alleles of each protein using the QIIME v1.8.0 software (QIIME Software, Madison, WI, USA). The species-level distribution was further validated by the homology of the alleles of the most common proteins with the species-level distribution for proteins from the other species (Table 3). For each protein, the species-level distribution was calculated using the HKY85 software (HKY85 Software, Tianjin, China). The posterior probability of the best-fit model for each species-level distribution was calculated using the HKY85 software. The best-fit model for each protein was defined as the best-fit model for a given species-level distribution. The HKY85 software used to determine the best-fit model for each protein was used to perform the phylogenetic analyses.

The evolutionary relationships among proteins were determined by the reciprocal best-match (RBP) method [27] with the HKY85 software. The phylogenetic relationship between each protein was tested with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [28] using the HKY85 software. The NJ method used for the phylogenetic analysis of the phylogenetic relationships was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the host plant and in the pathogen. The maximum likelihood method was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the pathogen. The bootstrap method was used to assess the reliability of the results obtained by the phylogenetic analysis [29].

The phylogenetic relationships among proteins were also determined by a neighbor-joining method [28]. The bootstrap method was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the pathogen. The NJ method was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the pathogen. The bootstrap method was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the host plant and in the pathogen. The bootstrap method was used to analyze the relationships among proteins from the pathogen.

The phylogenetic relationships among proteins from the pathogen were also determined by a t-test [30].


## Results
delemar proteins to the PHI pathway has been demonstrated for many fungal pathogens, including the pathogen, in terms of the ability to penetrate the host, elicit host response, and ultimately to cause disease [18,19. Here, we investigated the relationship between the R. delemar PHI pathway and the pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans in detail. The PHI pathway was conserved in all of the selected fungi tested and was found to be highly conserved in other fungal pathogens and pathogen species. However, R. delemar was found to be highly divergent in other fungi as well, such as C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, and C. neoformans [20]. Our results indicate that the R. delemar PHI pathway is highly divergent in all of the selected fungal species tested. The R. delemar PHI pathway is highly conserved in other fungal species and is found to be highly divergent in other fungi as well. Thus, the PHI pathway may be an alternative to other pathways in Cryptococcus neoformans.

The PHI pathway was found to be involved in a variety of biological processes, such as oxidative stress, transcriptional regulation, and signaling pathways. The PHI pathway is involved in several stress-related biological processes, such as energy metabolism, nutrient acquisition, cell signaling, and cell wall biosynthesis [21]. The PHI pathway is also involved in cell cycle and membrane signaling pathways, as well as in response to various stress stresses [22]. The PHI pathway was found to be involved in several stress-related biological processes, such as energy metabolism, cell signaling, and cell wall biosynthesis [23]. The PHI pathway is also involved in responses to a variety of stresses including heat stress, cell-mediated oxidative stress, ionic stress, and cell-mediated oxidative stress [24].

R. delemar is Transcriptionally Disruptible by the Phosphatase Phosphatase (PMPD) System
The R. delemar gene was found to be trans-phosphorylated in the presence of the PPD system, which is a phytochemical inhibitor that inhibits the activity of the phosphate-phosphate pathway in mammals. The PPD system is responsible for detoxifying and preventing the formation of toxic metabolites such as acetyl-CoA, glycerol-2-phosphate, and ethanol [25,26].


## Discussion
For each gene, seven different TEC genes have been identified, and six of them were involved in the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans (Figure 1), indicating that there is a high genetic diversity among the organisms studie. However, in contrast to other fungal pathogens, the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans is a complex process that involves several genes involved in different biological processes (43). The large number of TEC genes that are involved in this process may be explained by the fact that TECs are highly conserved in fungi (44), and therefore the ability to cope with different stress conditions, including the pathogen's innate immune system (45). Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree showed that the genes involved in the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans are most closely related to those involved in the TEC pathway, suggesting that there are some conserved functions in the TEC pathway.

In contrast, genes involved in the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans are most closely related to those involved in the pathogenicity pathway. The gene encoding a GTP-binding protein (GPR4) and a thrombin-binding protein (TDF1) were found in the pathogen genome and their expression increased with age (Figure 2). TDF1 is a high-affinity transmembrane ATPase involved in the uptake of GTP, and in the membrane protein vesicle trafficking (46). The TDF1 is also a cytosolic enzyme, and TDF1 was identified as a regulator of the C. neoformans virulence (47). The C. neoformans genome encodes only one GPR4 gene, and only one GPR4 gene was found in the pathogen. This gene is involved in the GPR4-mediated oxidative stress response, which results in a decrease in the intracellular ROS levels. This is in contrast to the C. neoformans genome, which encodes four genes that encode ROS and other cell wall proteins (48). The C. neoformans genome encodes one GPR4 gene and two GPR4 genes were found to be expressed only at a single time point (Figure 2).
