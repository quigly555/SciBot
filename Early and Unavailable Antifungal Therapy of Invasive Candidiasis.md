## Abstract
We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, sarcoidosis, and multiple myeloma who was admitted to our hospital due to severe abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. She had a favorable prognosis and passed away due to complication of antifungal treatment.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a serious fungal disease that affects both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. In HIV/AIDS patients, it is estimated that an estimated one million cases of cryptococcal infection occur annually [1]. A deficiency in CD4+ T cells, a primary contributor to the morbidity and mortality, results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. There are two major forms of immune cell damage, i. e., immune-mediated macrophage and effector-mediated killing. Macrophages are among the first cells to encounter fungal pathogens, and have the capacity to degrade a range of fungal cell membranes and initiate killing processes such as the induction of macrophage-specific cytokines and the activation of macrophage-dependent apoptosis [3]. Macrophages are classified into two main groups, classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2). M1 macrophages are generally activated by lysosomal or intracellular signaling pathways and are characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). Their activation is dependent on the macrophage’s phagolysosome for clearance of the fungus [4]. The M2 macrophages are activated by either signaling pathways or by a variety of signaling pathways, such as the classical pathway and the infarcted pathway [5], [6].

The classical pathway is activated by the G protein-coupled receptor GTPase activating factor (GAP). It is a member of a family of c-type lectins of which members bind to lectins on a soluble antigen surface and initiate secretion of T and other molecules involved in cell signaling [7]. In the infarcted pathway, GAP is the predominant macrophage receptor, and a key step in the classical pathway is the first step of the classical receptor-mediated killing of the fungus. The infarcted GTPase activates its target through an intracellular pathway known as the “coupling” [8]. C-type lectins bind to glycoproteins on the surface of fungal cells and initiate the classical pathogen killing mechanism.


## Methods
albicans was isolated from a swab collected from the site of the hospital in the city of Pune, India [37. The infection was confirmed by plating the swab on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, India) with the indicated antibiotic. The fungal suspension was then diluted with sterile distilled water to reach the final concentration of 0.5 × 10^6 CFU/ml. A swab sample was taken from the swab and washed with sterile distilled water to remove the yeast cells. Then, the swab was placed in a sterile container and kept at 4°C in a moist chamber for 5 days. The dried swab was then stored at 4°C for future use.

In order to evaluate the antifungal activity of the antifungal drugs, the use of antifungal drugs with a concentration of 100 µg/ml was considered as an antifungal susceptibility value [38]. The sensitivity and specificity of the antifungal drugs were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 guidelines [39]. The antifungal drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, India) to obtain concentrations of 5 µg/ml and 0.25 µg/ml. The doses were calculated according to the following formula: % of concentration = [(C_50-C_100)/(C_50-C_100)/2]×100%. The second drug was defined as a drug that exhibited at least 50% inhibition of growth or was present in a concentration of 0.5% in a specific growth assay. The final concentration of the drug was considered as the MIC. The final test was done in triplicate.

In order to evaluate the effect of antifungal drugs on the disease, the method of Qubit (Invitrogen, India) was used. The antifungal drugs were diluted in DMSO and added to the swab to obtain a concentration of 0.5 × 10^6 CFU/ml. Then, the swab was gently shaken in a sterile container to obtain the desired drug concentration. The drug concentrations were recorded daily. The highest drug concentration that resulted in a 10% reduction of growth was considered as MIC.


## Results
Of the 10 patients that received antifungal treatment at the time of the first procedure, 11 were received in the past two week. The patients with cryptococcosis received antifungal treatment at the beginning of the second procedure, and the patient with invasive candidiasis received antifungal therapy at the end of the second procedure. The study enrolled 10 patients and included 6 patients with end-stage candidiasis and 4 patients with end-stage candidiasis.

Clinical Characteristics of the Patients
The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The patients presented with both fever and mild headache, and the patients presented with the presence of cryptococcal antigen. The most common clinical presentation was cryptococcal fever in all the patients. The patients also presented with headache and chest pain, and the patients had a chest X-ray but no signs of illness.

The clinical and demographic features of the patients are shown in Table 2. Patients were mostly white, Asian, and African-American. The patients were mainly treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B. The patients were mostly treated with fluconazole (n = 7), flucytosin (n = 4), and amphotericin B (n = 1). The patient had a high-grade fever. The patients were discharged alive at the end of the study period, and the patient was alive at the time of death.

Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin was measured in all the patients. Hemoglobin was significantly lower in the patients with end-stage candidiasis compared to the patients without candidiasis. There was no difference in the hemoglobin in the patients with end-stage candidiasis compared to the patients without candidiasis. The patients with end-stage candidiasis had lower hemoglobin levels compared to the patients without candidiasis. The patients with end-stage candidiasis had higher hemoglobin levels compared to the patients without candidiasis. The patients with end-stage candidiasis had lower hemoglobin levels compared to the patients without candidiasis. The patients with cryptococcosis had higher hemoglobin levels compared to the patients with invasive candidiasis. The patients with cryptococcosis had higher hemoglobin levels compared to the patients without candidiasis.

Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin was measured in all the patients.


## Discussion
The second largest family of G proteins in the core E. coli lineages are family 2 G1 G2 (E. coli G1) and family 3 G3 (E. coli G3) G3.
