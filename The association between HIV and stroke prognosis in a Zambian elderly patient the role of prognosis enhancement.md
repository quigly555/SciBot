## Abstract
Meningitis is a common and severe complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Its management is challenging due to increased risk of complications, the need for co-trimoxazole, and the possibility of reactivation of the infection. We report a case of a seventy-four-year-old woman with a diabetes mellitus who presented with a meningitis that had resolved following HSCT. Our case illustrates the challenges in managing an increasing number of fungal infections, including those caused by Candida spp. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and management of fungal infections in adult patients with hematologic malignancies receiving hemostatic chemotherapy and HSCT, and the importance of implementing a successful immunodeficiency screening and management strategy for fungal infections in these patients.


## Introduction
Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a deep seated chromoblastomycosis, caused by the dimorphic fungus, Thamnionlla^TM. It is a chronic, subcutaneous, pulmonary, and subcutaneous adenocarcinoma. Although it is initially fatal, it rarely occurs in otherwise healthy individuals. It may also occur in other immunocompromised patients, including patients with leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and solid tumors, who have been neutropenic or who receive chemotherapy. CBM can also cause severe mesothelial lymphadenopathy, chronic respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchiectasis, which is a well-known risk factor for mortality.

CBM may be initially diagnosed as Thamnionlla^TM, but, in later stages of infection, such as in the case of CBM, the most common presentation may be Thamnionlla^TM. When this fungus is first identified, infection with Thamnionlla is usually suspected. However, with the use of antibiotics, other immunosuppressive drugs, and immunomodulation, the true prevalence of Thamnionlla is approximately 1% (Chandra et al., 2012). The infection may also be suspected in cases with no known immunosuppression. Patients admitted to the ICU with CBM have an increased risk of opportunistic infection, such as disseminated histoplasmosis, which is an infection that can be diagnosed by the detection of the presence of antibodies to Thamnionlla antigens (Chandra et al., 2012).

In the past, the use of antibiotics and other immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of Thamnionlla infection has been rare. However, over the past few decades, the use of anti-tuberculous drugs has become more widespread. This trend has led to a rapid expansion of antimicrobial prophylaxis, antimicrobial drug resistance, and the use of antibiotics in the treatment of many diseases, including infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Chandra et al.


## Methods
Study site and sampling
Four healthy university students were recruited in the study. They were students in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. All of them are part of a larger study of HIV infection in adults with HIV disease in the Pediatric Medicine Faculty of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. A total of six patients from this study were enrolled into the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the patient information was not collected in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study design
We followed individuals with HIV-1 infection who presented with fever, headache, altered mental status, or altered mental status with regard to their response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ART. We included in the present study those with an active response to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-based regimen, or those who had a negative response to antiretroviral therapy. We also included those with a positive response to ART and who were treated with subcutaneous antiretroviral therapy (SAR) or with CD4 count of <500 cells/µl.

Patients were divided into two groups: the first group was those who had a positive response to antiretroviral therapy, and the second group was those with a negative response to antiretroviral therapy.

Isolation of serum HIV-1 antigen
All the HIV-1 isolates obtained from blood samples of patients were tested by the ELISA method. We did not exclude patients with a positive result from this test, as our previous report suggested that this is the best method for detecting the presence of HIV-1 antigen in HIV-1 patients [28]. All isolates were stored in 25% glycerol at -80°C.


## Results
In this patient, the prognosis enhancement was observed in a lower CD4 count and in the presence of (CD4 count =100/mm^3. The difference in the prognosis was not statistically significant in a multivariate analysis (Table 2).


## Discussion
The current study was conducted to investigate the role of C. glabrata in the development of asexual and sexual reproduction in C. glabrata. The two mating types in C. glabrata are phenotypic: mating-type-1 and mating-type-2, respectively, in C. glabrata and in C. albicans [1]. Both mating-type-1 and mating-type-2 are involved in the sexual reproduction of C. glabrata and C. albicans, respectively [1].

In addition to sexual development, C.
