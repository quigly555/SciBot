## Abstract
The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (W) in aquatic ecosystems has stimulated interest in capturing and bio-fuels from renewable sources such as agro-industrial residues. This has been achieved by using cellulose as a sole carbon source to feed the growing population of aerobic bacteria, while also optimizing the storage conditions in which W and CO2 are available. However, it is still unknown how this strategy has been successfully implemented into aquatic ecosystems. Here, we leveraged the latest in bioeconomy-oriented strategies to analyze the aquatic W and CO2 reduction induced by cellulose using the model system carbon cycle analysis. We analyzed the storage conditions in which W and CO2 are available in the aquaculture industry using the CRISPR/Cas system. We analyzed the effects of W and CO2 reduction on the and nutrient content of the systems, and investigated the effects of cellulose and cellulosomes in mixed-species systems.


## Introduction
C. albicans is a fungus that can infect humans causing bloodstream infections in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. It can also cause primary pulmonary infections that can disseminate throughout the body, causing life-threatening pneumonia and meningoencephalitis. Although C. albicans is not as common as Histoplasma capsulatum, there is a high prevalence of this fungus in the environment. Moreover, it can cause disseminated infection in patients with sarcoidosis, which is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (SLE) disorder that can cause devastating changes in the quality of life of patients with C. albicans infections (1).

A key virulence trait of C. albicans is the polysaccharide capsule. This structure consists of glycoconjugates of a polysaccharide backbone with various branching domains, which are recognized by the C-terminal glycine-rich domain (Gly) and the F-terminal glycine-rich domain (F-D) (2). The capsule protects from the host immune system and is involved in several pathogenesis-related (PR) events, such as phagocytosis, phagolysosome maturation, and phagolysosome killing (3).

The capsule is a complex structure with an ordered network of glycoproteins that is involved in numerous biological functions, including proliferation, differentiation, cell wall integrity, and host-parasite interactions (4, 5). The C-terminal glycine-rich domain (Gly) and the F-D domains are found in the terminal cells of all cells, whereas the C-terminal glycine-rich domain (F-D) is present in all eukaryotic cells (6). The capsule is a complex structure that consists of a structural network of glycoproteins, which includes the terminal glycoproteins F-actin, F-ß-glucan, and F-lactamase (7). The capsule is a major virulence factor in humans and other mammals, which contributes to dissemination and disease. In mice, the capsule is mainly composed of the C-type lectin, which is able to bind to various immunogenic proteins, including CTL, and to induce the expression of virulence-associated proteins (VEP) (8).


## Methods
Briefly, three biofilm-grown biofilms were grown in Petri dishes with a coverslip and grown for 24 h at 37°C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. The biofilms were washed with PBS and incubated with different concentrations of FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and antibiotics for 3 h. The biofilms were then washed twice with PBS and the biofilms were re-suspended in PBS, and the cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicates.

Isolation of A. fumigatus CFU from The Fungal Biofilm
To evaluate the virulence of the A. fumigatus strain, the biofilm biofilm was washed twice with PBS, and the biofilm-washed biofilms were re-suspended in PBS. The biofilms were then washed twice with PBS, and the biofilm-washed biofilms were re-suspended in PBS, and the biofilms were incubated with different concentrations of FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and antibiotics for 3 h. The biofilms were then washed twice with PBS, and the biofilms were re-suspended in PBS, and the CFU count was determined using a hemocytometer. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicates.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.


## Results
fumigatus
To further elucidate the contribution of mycotoxin-producing and necrotrophic fungi to . fumigatus infections, we constructed a strain of A. fumigatus (ATCC 25250) for in vitro mycotoxin assays. The biofilm-based assay was then used to assess the effect of mycotoxin production on A. fumigatus infection. We used the A. fumigatus strain ATCC 25250 strain to stimulate A. fumigatus conidiation, a second step in the infection process. We found that the <U+0394>fusA strain produced significantly higher levels of A. fumigatus conidia than the <U+0394>fusA or wild-type strains (Fig 3A). In contrast, the <U+0394>fusA and <U+0394>fusA/<U+0394>fusA strains produced significantly higher levels of A. fumigatus neutrophils than the wild-type strain (Fig 3A). This result indicates that mycotoxin production by the A. fumigatus strain contributes to the virulence of A. fumigatus.

Mycotoxin Production by Fungal Strains Involves the Transmembrane Subunit Protein Pathway Fulfilin
To further explore the role of mycotoxin production in A. fumigatus infection, we next analyzed the expression of the mycotoxin biosynthetic pathway in A. fumigatus. These mycotoxins are secreted from host cell walls, which are synthesized by a host-pathogen-host interaction (HIPI) cascade that includes the pathway components fumarate carboxylase (EC:1.1.1.3), lysophosphatidylinositol-3 (EC:1.2.1.4), and phosphatidylinositol-4 (EC:4.2.1.3) [28]. To determine whether mycotoxins are involved in host-pathogen interaction, we investigated mycotoxin production by the wild-type and <U+0394>fusA strains.


## Discussion
neoformans is mainly dependent on the expression of the aurX gene in . neoformans. However, the expression of the aurX gene in the absence of the mycotoxin was much lower than that of the homologous genes in other fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but higher than that in other fungi, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [35]. For example, the yeast AurX1 gene encodes for the human aurX gene and the human ortholog (ePKD1) and human ortholog (ePKD2) of the human mycotoxin DPA1 (Tyracina paludens) [36]. In contrast, the aurX gene is required for the production of aurine auxotrophy in C. albicans, which has been shown to be required for the production of this fungus [37]. In C. neoformans, the aurX gene encodes for the AurX2 gene, which encodes for the aurX2 gene in the human ortholog of the aurX gene, and the aurX3 gene encodes for the aurX3 gene in the C. albicans ortholog. In addition, the aurX gene encodes for the aurX3 gene and the aurX2 gene encodes for the aurX3 gene in the human ortholog.

The aurX gene is also required for the biosynthesis of aurine auxotrophy in C. neoformans. A previous study showed that aurX2 gene expression is repressed in C. albicans [38]. In addition, aurX3 gene expression is repressed in C. neoformans [39]. Our results showed that the aurX3 gene is regulated in a similar way to the aurX gene of C. albicans. However, the aurX gene is expressed only in the presence of the aurX3 gene in the C. neoformans ortholog. This suggests that the aurX3 gene may be involved in the biosynthesis of aurine auxotrophy in C. neoformans. It is known that aurX gene expression is regulated in C. albicans.
