## Abstract
Primary central nervous system vasculitis is the most common type of spinal cord injury. Adrenal and pituitary malignant lesions are seen in many types of spinal cord injuries, and the majority of patients present with diffuse limblessness. We report a case of spinal cord osteomyelitis in a patient who was a member of the Ste12 Neurosurgical Team.


## Introduction
A summary of key features of APCs can be seen in Table .

APCs are not only highly specialized but also highly dynamic and sensitive to environmental changes. APCs are categorized into at least four types based on their physiological characteristics and function (reviewed in Ref. 1). Type I APCs are composed of hematopoietic and lymphocyte-derived macrophages. These cells are also expressed by many other cells, including B cells, eosinophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils, which are also activated in response to environmental signals and also express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Type II APCs are composed of lymphocytes and monocytes. These cells are derived from B cells. These cells express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and are also induced by a variety of ligands. In particular, ligands including IFNs, TLR2, TLR4, Dectin-2, TLR4 and other IL-2 receptors, complement or complement receptor ligands (CR ligands) (reviewed in Ref. 2) may be involved in signaling pathways that facilitate infection of other cells. In addition, two types of APCs are classified according to their biological characteristics into at least five categories: (i) Type I cells are classically activated by the host inflammatory response, (ii) Type II cells are activated by the inflammatory response and (iii) Type III cells are activated by the interferon-gamma (IFN)<U+03B3> (reviewed in Ref. 3).

APCs are able to sense their environment and adapt to it in a number of ways. In general, they can sense their environment by interacting with other cell types, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs), by extracellular signal-regulated receptors (e.g., TLR2, TLR4, TLR6 and other immune cells) and by signal transduction molecules, such as cytokines, which activate other signaling pathways. Upon stimulation, these cells can produce cytokines, such as IL-10, which in turn stimulate the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15 and TNF-a.


## Methods
The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method [49. To confirm the homologous recombination of the C. albicans GAPDH gene, a GAPDH-tagged version of the C. albicans GAPDH gene was amplified by PCR from the pRS316 vector (Invitrogen) with the primers GAPDH-F and GAPDH-R, and cloned into the pGADT-3 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, which were cultured at 37째C for 18 h. The resulting plasmid was purified using a SPE kit (GE Healthcare), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to confirm the presence of the GAPDH gene in the plasmid.

To confirm the recombination of C. albicans GAPDH with C. dubliniensis C. albicans spc1, a GAPDH-tagged version of C. albicans GAPDH gene was amplified from the pRS316 vector by PCR from the pRS316 vector with the primers GAPDH-F and GAPDH-R, and cloned into the pGADT-3 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, which were cultured at 37째C for 18 h. The resulting plasmid was purified using a SPE kit (GE Healthcare), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to confirm the presence of the GAPDH gene in the plasmid.

For detection of the effect of temperature on C. albicans C. albicans biofilm formation, a GAPDH-tagged version of C. albicans C. albicans C. albicans strain GAPDH was grown on PD agar (pH 6.0) at 25째C for 48 h. The culture was washed twice with distilled water, and then inoculated onto SDA (pH 7.0) and incubated at 25째C for 24 h. The biofilm was washed once with distilled water, and then air-dried.


## Results
However, only a very small proportion of yeasts were detected at both 3 and 4 days postinfection (Fig 2a.

Expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family is required for pathogenicity
We next investigated whether the CD4^+ T cell super-family plays a role in the development of the infection. The proteomic analysis revealed that MDR-CD4^+ T cell line expressing CD4^+ T cells, which was under the control of the CD4^+ T cell-secreted factor [16], were abundant at all times tested (Fig 2b). In addition, expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family was increased at all time points tested, in agreement with the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family expressed at the time of the infection (Fig 2c).

To further support the notion that the CD4^+ T cell super-family participates in the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus, we analyzed the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family in the recipient cells. The CD4^+ T cell super-family expression was increased at all time points tested, and in agreement with the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family expressed at the time of the infection (Fig 2d). In contrast, expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family was down-regulated at all time points tested, in agreement with the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family expressed at the time of the infection (Fig 2e).

To further support the notion that the CD4^+ T cell super-family participates in the development of the infection, we analyzed the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family in the recipient cells. The CD4^+ T cell super-family expression was increased at all time points tested, in agreement with the expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family expressed at the time of the infection (Fig 2f).

Virulence of Cryptococcus is dependent on the CD4^+ T cell super-family
The analysis of the differential expression of the CD4^+ T cell super-family in the recipient and recipient cells indicated that both the CD4^+ T cell super-family and the CD4^+ T cell super-family were required for virulence.


## Discussion

The effect of the cells to the fungal cell wall is known to be influenced by a number of factors such as temperature, pH, cell wall composition, and cytokinesi. However, the exact mechanism by which T. marneffei responds to the fungal cell wall remains unclear. To date, the immune response to T. marneffei is not well established. In addition to several studies, a few studies have focused on the effect of T. marneffei on the cell wall, as well as on other components of the cell wall such as the extracellular matrix, chitin, and chitosan. Furthermore, many studies have compared the effect of T. marneffei on other cell wall components, such as cellulose, mannoproteins, and chitin [37-39]. However, no studies have focused on the effect of T. marneffei on the cell wall integrity. The results presented here, as well as those presented previously, suggest that the effect of T. marneffei on cell wall components is mediated through the interaction with macrophages.

Previous studies have demonstrated that T. marneffei can activate macrophages in vitro and produce IFN-<U+03B3> in vitro [40]. We previously reported that T. marneffei could stimulate IFN-<U+03B3> production in vitro and induce macrophages to produce IFN-<U+03B3> in vitro [41]. Furthermore, T. marneffei showed inhibitory effects on the production of IFN-<U+03B3> in vitro. These studies demonstrated that the cell wall of T. marneffei is important for the integrity of the cell wall, but its participation is not specific for T. marneffei. In this study, we have shown that T. marneffei can stimulate IFN-<U+03B3> production in vitro and induce macrophages to produce IFN-<U+03B3> in vitro.

Several studies have shown that the inhibitory effect of T. marneffei on the production of IFN-<U+03B3> is dependent on macrophages. In addition to the cell wall integrity, T.
