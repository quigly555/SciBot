## Abstract
Plant and human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) infections are the two leading causes of initial infection in developed countries. This information gap has limited its full impact on the effective treatment of PLHIV infections, but several advances have been made in recent years. These include more accurate diagnosis, better possible timing of diagnosis, and improved prognostic factors. Advancements in multilayer, point-of-care (PLHIV point of care) devices, biopsies, and serology have led to more accurate and more accurate diagnosis of PLHIV infection. The present review is an attempt to summarize the most important advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PLHIV infection.


## Introduction
 2007; Lai and Xu, 2015. The folic acid-dependent 1,3-dihydroxy n-acetyl-glucosamine (BDG) receptor is activated by the action of the BDG ß-GlcNAc receptor and is required for the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides. The BDG receptor has been implicated in virulence and pathogenesis of some fungal pathogens including Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Cryptococcus neoformans (Huang et al., 2016). In addition, the folic acid-dependent 1,3-dihydroxy n-acetyl-glucosamine (BDG) receptor was shown to be required for the secretion of glucosamine from the extracellular milieu, suggesting that BDG-dependent mechanisms might be involved in the virulence of some fungi (Huang et al., 2016). These results highlight the possibility that the folic acid-dependent pathway may be conserved in eukaryotes. In addition, the majority of fungal pathogens are obligate diacyly-saprophytes, which play a major role in nutrient transport across the fungal cell wall (Dal Grande et al., 2010). It has been shown that the extracellular milieu is rich in polysaccharides, amino acids, and carbohydrates (Ventola, 2002; de Jesus et al., 2010). In addition to the extracellular milieu, the proteins within the fungal cell wall are highly glycosylated and present in a diverse range of substrates, including glycoproteins, lipids, and carbohydrates (Garrido et al., 2004; Dijksho et al., 2010). The components of the cell wall that are secreted by many fungi include glucans, cholesteryl units, and proteins (Bartels et al., 2012). The ability to degrade these complex carbohydrates has been demonstrated to be important in the pathogenesis of Candida species (Dijksho et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2014).

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunosuppressed individuals. It has been suggested that the meningoencephalitis is acquired by inhalation (Krijgis et al.


## Methods
Cell line and culture
The human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCC) from the ATCC, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Cells were cultured in complete medium (MM) (Difco) at 37°C and 5% CO_2. For media preparation, HCC was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min at 4°C, washed, and suspended in 0.25% trypan blue. For cell wall measurements, cells were stained with 10 µM of the specific dye FITC-FITC (GE Healthcare Life Science) and incubated in 0.5% NaCl for 30 min at room temperature.


## Results
Furthermore, the hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors modulate the pathogenicity of the fungus [33. Thus, we investigated whether C. albicans induces hyphal morphogenesis and virulence in the host. In this study, we assessed the hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors (Fig 2A). The hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors were significantly induced in all treatments, and in the presence of caspofungin (Fig 2B). C. albicans induced hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors were not only induced in the presence of caspofungin but also in the presence of a caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin (Fig 2B). In addition, caspofungin induced induction of hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors were not only induced in the presence of caspofungin but also in the presence of a caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin (Fig 2B). These results demonstrate that C. albicans induces hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors in the host.

Caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin induces hyphal morphogenesis and virulence factors in the host
To further examine the virulence potential of C. albicans in the host, we evaluated the susceptibility of C. albicans to caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin in the presence of caspofungin and to the compound in the presence of a caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin. The MIC and MBC values for caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin in the presence of caspofungin are shown in Table S1. All strains were susceptible to caspofungin-trimethylated caspofungin, except for C. albicans, which showed a reduced MIC and MBC of 0.5 µg/ml, while the MIC and MBC values were greater than 2 µg/ml (Table 1).


## Discussion
They are primarily responsible for degrading the fungal cell wall and fungal virulence [39], [40. However, the fungal cells are also the primary carriers of plant defense compounds, such as melanin [41], which are a source of melanin and protect against other plant defense systems. It has been reported that Fusarium isolates produce melanin, which is important for plant growth and protection against pathogens [42], [43]. However, the investigation of the Fusarium yeasts in this study was limited to identifying a few isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a unique genetic and phenotypic variation within the Fusarium species complex, in which all the isolates had a single gene encoding an AP-1 gene. The AP-1 gene is a transcription factor that modulates the transcription of a large number of genes and it is a key factor in maintaining cell polarity and morphogenesis [44], [45]. The AP-1 gene is up-regulated by the fungus in response to environmental changes [46]. In contrast, the AP-1 gene is down-regulated by different environmental conditions and its expression is regulated by different growth conditions [47]. Therefore, we considered whether the AP-1 gene is regulated by the fungus. We previously reported that the Fusarium species complex also contains a single AP-1 gene and the deletion of AP-1 gene led to a dramatic increase in the AP-1 gene expression. However, we did not observe a significant difference in the AP-1 gene expression between the two strains. However, we did observe an increase in the AP-1 gene expression in the fungus-infected Fusarium. Therefore, we inferred that the AP-1 gene is expressed at a higher level in Fusarium, compared to other fungal species.

Our results showed that the AP-1 gene is up-regulated by the fungus in response to environmental changes, which is in line with previous findings that the AP-1 gene is up-regulated by the fungus in response to environmental changes [48], [49]. In contrast, the AP-1 gene was down-regulated by the fungus in response to different growth conditions. This suggests that the AP-1 gene is activated in response to different conditions.
