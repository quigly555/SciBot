## Abstract
For the development of a new antifungal drug target, in the present study, was tested a first-in-class drug against the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Screening of 1,280 compounds was performed to identify any one of them as an antifungal target.

Antifungal activity of the first-in-class drug FKS1, a new derivative of voriconazole used in the treatment of several superficial fungal infections, was evaluated. The drug was first synthesized using a modified glucose-oxylase from E. coli by direct reaction and docking with a standard E. coli strain. Its mode of action was then determined by using the solubility and affinity mechanisms of active compounds as well as by measuring the activity of the substrate-accepting proteins (SAPs) against Candida. Finally, the drug was tested on C. albicans morphogenetically and phenotypically distinct mutants that were more sensitive to FKS1. FKS1 had a molecular weight of about 1.4-1.6 times the mass of the human antifungal drug.

Further, a mutant library of 12 mutants were constructed using the drug and on the substrate-accepting proteins as well as mutant SAGEseq data. FKS1 bound to the active compounds in a highly alkaline environment, which was more favorable for the drug binding to confer a stronger action to FKS1. These results indicated that FKS1 was more selective for C. albicans, and bound more strongly to FKS1 than to the inactive compounds. FKS1 had no effect on the colony characteristics of the mutant or on colony selectability.


## Introduction
Asexual development is the process by which a fungus reproduces sexually by budding cells in the environment and by the formation of colony-forming units (CFUs) on the surface of a host plant [1,2]. Many host plants secrete asexual spores, which are propagated to higher plants by the spore-producing dendritic cells (DC) [3]. The DCs, which are secreted to the leaf surface by specialized cells, phagocytes that ingest, transport and ingest the fungus, and produce definitive dendritic cells (DCs), are responsible for the phagocyte-mediated control of the infection [4]. Dendritic cells (DCs) can differentiate into different subsets depending on the status of the host plant [5]. Different types of DCs are characterized by the expression of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), elicit antigen presentation pathways and induce antigen-specific T cell responses [6,7]. The role of PRRs in the differentiation of DCs into spore-forming dendritic cells (SPCs) is still unclear, however, the role of a variety of cytokines in DC-dependent functions is well established [8].

The induction of cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13 and IL-17 during phagocyte development has been demonstrated to be critical to the control of fungal pathogens, such as Candida albicans [9,10,11]. IL-17 induction is induced upon the stimulation of IL-4 production, and IL-17A has been shown to activate the transcription factor NF<U+03BA>B, leading to the induction of NF<U+03BA>B activation [12,13,14]. The NF<U+03BA>B transcription factor is activated by IL-4, and the cytokines are produced by the activated cells [12,14].


## Methods
The membrane (.5 µM) and the reaction buffer (5 mM MES, pH 6.0) of the reaction mixture were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was terminated by adding of 0.1% SDS and the mixture was purified. The purified lipoid was eluted with 50 mM MES and the reaction was terminated with 40 mM MES, pH 6.0, after adding of 0.1% SDS. The purified biofilm was eluted with 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, and the reaction was terminated with 40 mM MES, pH 6.0, after adding of 0.1% SDS.

The reaction was conducted with the following reaction time-to-action (RT-PCR) program: 1 µL of purified lipoid (1.2 mg/mL) was mixed with 1 µL of a 2 mM dNTP solution (0.1 mM), and the mixture was incubated at 60°C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated with an addition of 1.5 mM MES and the reaction was analyzed on a Beckman Coulter 830 Plus (Beckman Coulter, USA). The PCR program was as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min.

The protocol was optimized for the use of all Lipoid-Based eSilicon PCR-Based Stable Lipoid Assays as an Alternative to Standard Lipidic Acid-Soluble Biofilms. The eSilicon PCR-Based Stable Lipoid Assay was performed with a single assay mixture of purified lipoid (0.1 mg/mL) and biofilm (0.0.065 mg/mL). The reaction was conducted in the following thermal profile: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min.


## Results

First, PLGA-based eSilicon PCR-based assay is suitable for screening microbial cells for their viability by the use of a standard PLGA-based assa. Second, the PLGA-based assay was tested to determine whether PLGA-based assay could also detect the viability of PLGA-based microalgae by using a PLGA-based assay in a non-humanized rat model of experimental invasive candidiasis. In this model, PLGA-based eSilicon PCR-based assay was used to determine the viability of PLGA-based microalgae by using a human monoclonal antibody against PLGA-based lipase.

A comparison of PLGA-based assay with the non-humanized rat model (Figure 2) demonstrated that the PLGA-based assay can detect PLGA-based microalgae viability by using a non-humanized rat model of experimental candidiasis (Figure 2).

For the evaluation of the efficacy of PLGA-based assay, the use of a non-humanized rat model of experimental candidiasis was used. In this model, the PLGA-based assay was used to determine the efficacy of PLGA-based assay on the human monoclonal antibody against PLGA-based lipase. The results obtained from PLGA-based assay showed that PLGA-based assay can detect PLGA-based microalgae viability by using a rat model of experimental candidiasis and non-humanized rat model of experimental candidiasis.

For testing the efficacy of PLGA-based assay to detect the viability of microalgae, the use of PLGA-based assay was evaluated to test the viability of microalgae.

As shown in Figure 3, the PLGA-based assay can detect PLGA-based microalgae viability by using a rat model of experimental candidiasis and non-humanized rat model of experimental candidiasis.

In order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the PLGA-based assay, the use of a non-humanized rat model of experimental candidiasis was used.


## Discussion
However, the pH value obtained from lipids extracted from . coli grown in vitro as an indigenously purified E. coli strain growing in liquid culture broth or in liquid medium was markedly different than those obtained from E. coli grown in liquid culture medium (2.7 and 3.1 mM). This indicates that the pH value obtained from E. coli strains is significantly lower than that obtained from E. coli strains grown in liquid culture broth or in liquid medium, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.

The pH value obtained from the indigineous peptide of E. coli-grown lipids (H16N and H18N) and purified E. coli-grown lipids (H18N and H20N) was similar to the value obtained from non-indigineous lipids (N0A) (0.37 and 0.37 mM) and purified non-indigineous lipids (N0A, N2A and N2C) [16]. However, the value obtained from indigineous lipids (H20N and H20N) and purified non-indigineous lipids (N0A, N2A and N2C) were significantly higher than that obtained from indigineous lipids (H0A and 0.33 mM) and purified indigineous lipids (H1, H1A and 0.33 mM) [16]. This indicates that the relative contribution of indigineous lipids to E. coli-based lipids is greater than that of non-indigineous lipids.

The present study showed that lipids from E. coli grown in liquid culture broth or in liquid medium were significantly more stable than those from E. coli grown in liquid culture broth or in liquid medium, which is consistent with previous studies. The general trend was that E. coli strains grew well in liquid culture broth or in liquid medium, whereas the E. coli strains grew poorly in liquid culture medium, which is consistent with previous studies [13,13]. The analysis of the RDA indicated that the rate of growth of E.
