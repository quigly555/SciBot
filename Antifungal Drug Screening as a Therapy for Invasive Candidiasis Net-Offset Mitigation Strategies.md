Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
We report a case of a 40-year-old male with fever and cytopenia, bilateral cerebral hemangiosarcoma and globe-tilt right sided hemaziemia who developed pyrexia-convulsive symptoms. Hemo-spinal involvement was initially suspected because of the presence of an epithelioid matrix around the brain parenchyma. However, our case suggests that pyrexia-convulsive symptoms might be related to cerebral toxoplasmosis, and that therapy with micafungin and a voriconazole dosing (2 mg/kg/day) might be indicated to prevent or manage the patient's relapsing-remitting aspergillosis.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom contains an estimated 1.5 million species, and more than 10 million of them are responsible for causing human infections (1). C. neoformans is a major human fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. In the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of infections caused by C. neoformans, which makes C. neoformans an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with compromised immunity (2,3). In order to overcome this problem, the treatment of cryptococcosis involves a complex combination of chemotherapeutic agents and antifungal drugs, which often lead to a prolonged course of disease.

Chemosensitizers (CDS) are a class of compounds with strong antimicrobial activities (4), which are able to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans (5). The most common CDS used in the clinic is fluconazole, a synthetic antifungal agent that is in the control arsenal of the WHO and other important medical groups, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (5). However, some drugs are ineffective against C. neoformans and thus CDS is the most frequently used drug to treat cryptococcosis. In addition, the use of CDS has been associated with increased resistance of C. neoformans to conventional antifungals (6). CDS has also been shown to decrease the clearance of Cryptococcus spp. from the lung, which is a major risk factor for cryptococcal pneumonia (7).

CDS is used in the treatment of cryptococcal pneumonia and cryptococcosis in non-human primates as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality (8). It is used in South and Central Africa as an antifungal therapy, and it is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of cryptococcosis, especially in Africa (9). However, cryptococcosis can be managed with synthetic antifungals (10,11), and some of these have serious side-effects in patients with impaired immunity (12). There are several available classes of antifungals, including azoles, which have been shown to be effective against Cryptococcus and Candida species, which has led to the development of new class of antifungals (13,14).


## Methods

NIH MedSystems HIV/AIDS Program includes the following: “Global HIV/AIDS Data Integration Program”; “NHS Assisted Access to HIV/AIDS Treatment Centers”; “NHS Assisted Access to HIV/AIDS Research Centers”; “NHS-Universities AIDS Program”; “NIHAIDS-International Collaborating Center”; “NHS-Universities AIDS Program”; “NIH AIDS Research Center”; and “NHS-Universities AIDS Progra.”

The instrument will use all relevant data and consultation with the relevant research teams in the field to create an outcome report. The study will be conducted by a third-initiator research team. The program will assess the current public and private health-related medical-aid coverage for HIV/AIDS patients and preventative care.

The project will be performed in collaboration with the NIH AIDS Research Center. The NIH AIDS Research Center has an in-house HIV/AIDS clinic in its operating room, with HIV/AIDS clinic personnel. The HIV/AIDS clinic is now supported by NIH through the NIH Institutional Review Board.

Study Participants
The study design was approved by the Joint Ethics Committee of the Joint Study Center of Infectious Diseases (JECI-IHR-III, Paris, France) and the HIV/AIDS research center is registered as a separate institution in the European Union.

Definitions
For the purpose of the study, the primary outcome was HIV/AIDS mortality at the time of study enrollment. The study group consisted of patients who had a documented history of clinical or radiological evidence of cryptococcal meningitis, and those who had not been diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis in the previous 12 months. To exclude patients with multiple cases, we included those who had received treatment at the same time, such as those with a clinical or radiological evidence of cryptococcal meningitis, and those who had been treated at the same time.


## Results
fijiensis is one of the most common species causing invasive candidiasis worldwide, recent studies have demonstrated that it may also cause serious infection. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of the use of M. fijiensis on the fungal burden in the bloodstream and/or the spleen during invasive candidiasis. The burden of the bloodstream and/or the spleen in the spleen in the initial infection was compared between the groups of patients and the groups of controls. The burden of the bloodstream and/or the spleen in the initial infection was calculated using the MATH-E Scale-A-3 scale, which measures the extent of the inflammation. In contrast to the PIs, the fungal burden in the bloodstream and/or the spleen was significantly lower in the group of patients who used M. fijiensis compared to the control group (Table 2). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.05). The difference was significant when the starting antifungal dose was decreased from 0.5 to 0.25 mg/kg (Table 2).

The data showed that the fungal burden in the bloodstream and/or the spleen was significantly lower in the group of patients who used M. fijiensis compared to the control group (Table 2). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.921). The difference was significant when the starting antifungal dose was increased from 0.5 to 0.25 mg/kg (Table 2).

Aging of Candida in the Ectoplasmatic Bloodstream
Aging of Candida species is an important pathogenic challenge in both human and animal systems, and it is estimated that 100,000 people worldwide are infected with C. albicans [28]. Candida species are easily detected by the use of both culture and imaging methods, including conventional methods for the detection of Candida albicans, which are often used to treat or prevent candidiasis in patients with CM [28-30]. In this study, we examined the growth of Candida species in the bloodstream of mice following the infection.

In the study, all the Candida species grown in the bloodstream were found to be able to grow in the blood of mice (Figure 3). However, the growth of Candida species in the blood of mice was very variable, depending on the species.


## Discussion

The net effect of the IPTG treatment was to reduce the incidence of cryptococcosis in the adult populatio. Net-Offset Mitigation Strategy for Successful Treatment of Cryptococcal Infection in Patients with SLE and Other Invasive Candidiasis (TIF) Pathology Pathologies (Supplementary Table 2) was recently implemented in South Africa [20]. The net effect of the IPTG treatment was to reduce the incidence of cryptococcosis in the adult population.

The incidence of cryptococcosis in SLE patients with SLE was reduced by 32% compared with that in the non-SLE population, and by more than 30% compared with non-SLE patients. The reduction in cryptococcosis incidence was mainly attributed to the IPTG treatment in SLE patients. The patients treated with IPTG had a significantly reduced risk of developing cryptococcosis compared to non-SLE patients.

The incidence of cryptococcosis in SLE patients with SLE was slightly reduced compared with those in non-SLE patients. The patients treated with IPTG had a significantly reduced risk of developing cryptococcosis compared to those in non-SLE patients. The decrease in cryptococcosis incidence in non-SLE patients was mainly attributed to the treatment with IPTG. The reduction in the incidence of cryptococcosis in non-SLE patients was mainly attributable to the IPTG treatment in SLE patients. The patients treated with IPTG had a significantly reduced risk of developing cryptococcosis compared to non-SLE patients.

The incidence of cryptococcosis in patients with SLE was increased by 21% compared with that in non-SLE patients. The patients treated with IPTG had a significantly reduced risk of developing cryptococcosis compared to those in non-SLE patients. The reduction in the incidence of cryptococcosis in patients with SLE was mainly attributable to the IPTG treatment in SLE patients. The patients treated with IPTG had a significantly reduced risk of developing cryptococcosis compared to non-SLE patients. The increase in the incidence of cryptococcosis in patients with SLE was mainly attributable to the treatment with IPTG in SLE patients.
