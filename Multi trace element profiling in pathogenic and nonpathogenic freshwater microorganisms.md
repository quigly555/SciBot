## Abstract
Indeed, the ability of the water to control the growing epidemic of infectious disease in the aquifers is largely due to the fungus species that establish outbreaks in the wate. We therefore aimed to profile the waterborne fungi of the Nile Valley and to assess their ability to inhibit the outbreak. Our investigations revealed that species of the genus Cladosporium were most frequently isolated from the water and genus Allelicia and from water samples, whereas the genus Cladosporium was most frequently isolated from both the water and soil. Fungal diversity analysis of soil and water samples revealed that the fungi were significantly different from the control group. Interestingly, Cladosporium showed the highest relative resistance against the fluconazole resistant fungus Arthroderma sp. and a low resistance against the Candida sp. tested. In addition, the fungus was more resistant to protease inhibitors than other fungi. Fungal communities were further complicated by the association of various species, such as Allelicia, Cladosporium and Candida, in soil samples. The comparison of waterborne and water-borne fungi revealed that water samples had the highest fungal community, while soil samples were dominated by fungal species (Szalavads et al., J. Evol. Biol. 54:1071-1080, 2010). Furthermore, the fungal communities of the water-borne fungus Cladosporium in soil were not associated with the fungal community of the water-borne fungus Arthroderma, suggesting that the water-borne fungi may be more susceptible to the antifungal drug fluconazole than the water-borne fungi. Taken together, our findings emphasize that environmental factors, such as the type of fungal species, the type of soil or the species of fungi, the water-borne fungi are a very important factor in the persistence of Cladosporium and Arthroderma in the water, and water-borne fungi may be more or less resistant to the antifungal drug fluconazole than water-borne fungi.

Microbes such as microorganisms that live as fungi in a symbiotic environment with very high levels of genetic exchange can develop resistance to a wide variety of drugs and form resistance pathways to a wide range of target drugs, which undermines the effectiveness of currently available antifungal therapies.


## Introduction
The genus Eumycetales is composed of freshwater and terrestrial species, as well as of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and nematodes (Cooper 2004.

The genus Eumycetales consists of three monophyletic lineages (Hibbett et al. 2004), which diverged approximately 10 million years ago. In contrast to the simple phylogenetic placement, this lineage is composed of two subspecies, Eumycetine and Eumycetaster, which have been reported from a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Eumycetidae, Sordariomycetidae, and Labrunculiidae) and approximately 100 species have been recorded from freshwater (Hibbett et al. 2004; Coppin et al. 2007; Aptroot 2009; Aptroot and Cooper 2012). The Eumycetidae are predominantly saprobic and live on freshwater lakes, rivers, and lakes with high water turbidity (Cortinas and Saccardo 1983; Aptroot 2009).

The genus Eumycetidae was proposed by Hur et al. (2009) based on a phylogenetic analysis of four genes (Eumycetidae, Heteroecidae, Labrunculiidae, and Saprocteriidae) including Eumyceten, Eumyceton, and Saprocteri. The latter two genes are present in numerous freshwater and marine microorganisms, including pathogens of animals, insects, fungi, and plant hosts (Sampaio and Balasubramanian 2015; Kondo et al. 2015). Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the taxonomy of Eumycetidae indicated that Eumyceton and Saprocteriidae are closely related species and closely related to other freshwater microorganisms such as Saprocteriaceae (Turin et al. 2011). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of taxonomic markers from these three lineages showed that Eumycetonidae is sister to the same groups of freshwater microorganisms and closely related to other freshwater microorganisms (Turin et al. 2011). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of six LSU rDNA sequences from Eumycetonidae indicated that the two subfamilies are monophyletic (Turin et al. 2012).


## Methods
Patients and samples
This study was carried out in the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Arad, Arad, Iran. We have already established a research cohort of 1,000 patients with Sjögren syndrome and 1,000 healthy controls, who were treated for Sjögrens syndrome in our department. We obtained all the clinical data from these patients through a review of the medical records. We have identified all the relevant data from the medical records.

Ethics statement
All patients were referred to our department for further investigations. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Arad Hospital and Ministry of Health, Tehran, Iran.

Sjögrens syndrome
Sjögrens syndrome is characterized by a decrease of the diameter of the esophagus, which is accompanied by a decrease of the height of the neck, which is accompanied by a change of the shape of the esophagus.

Sjögrens syndrome is a syndrome due to the underlying condition of the affected region of the esophagus (e.g., abscess, loss of esophageal fluid, drainage, or a lack of a thin layer of elastic tissue).

Sjögrens syndrome was a syndrome due to the oral abscess, which is caused by a change of the esophageal fluid.

Sjögrens syndrome was a syndrome due to the swelling of the esophagus, which is caused by a change of the size of the esophageal fluid.


## Results
A total of 40 distinct microbial community were analyzed using a Blast2GO (35 sequences), and the BLASTx algorithm was used to identify similarities and differences between the different host tissue microbial communitie. The BLASTx analysis identified a total of 5,907 sequences with a sequence identity of 99% (99% sequence similarity) between the host tissue microorganisms of the three different hosts. The BLASTx analysis identified 2,818 host-pathogen-host-pathogen-host-host interactions (PHIs). For a broader overview of all the different host-pathogen-host-host interactions, we annotated host tissue microbial communities based on a comprehensive network of microbial community structures and proteomic network data.

The pathogenic microbial host tissue microorganisms were divided into three groups based on their host physiology. The first group consisted of the host organs, such as the blood, the spleen, and the heart. The second group consisted of the skeletal system, such as the bone, muscle, and the heart. The third group was the biologic organ, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, and brain.

Phylogenetic analysis of host tissue microbial communities in pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms
To evaluate the presence of the host phylum in pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms, the host phylum was defined by a common core phylum that shared with the host phylum, and the shared phylum was represented by phylum Proteobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria (Table 1). The Phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all three microorganisms studied. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant in the blood and spleen. The phylum Acidobacteria was the most abundant in the bone and spleen. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant in the muscle, and the phylum Acidobacteria was the most abundant in the heart. Phylum Acidobacteria was the most abundant in the blood and spleen. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant in the muscle and the phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant in the heart.


## Discussion
In this study, we reported that the chytrid family contains four chytrid genes (Additional file 1. The sequences of the chytrid genes from L. bicolor, L. major, and B. graminis were used for further analysis. The results showed that the chytrid sequences in these two freshwater microorganisms have the highest sequence similarity to those found in other freshwater microorganisms (Fig 3). The chytrid sequences from freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis have a longer evolutionary history than those from L. bicolor and B. graminis, suggesting that these two freshwater microorganisms might have the highest sequence similarity in the Chytrid Genomes. The chytrid sequences from freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis have been studied and well characterized. However, the sequences of the Chytrid Genome Database (ChgDB) are not well characterized and, therefore, we are not able to classify them in Chg. The ChgDB is not yet available in the public database of freshwater microorganisms, so we are not sure if the ChgDB is still complete. We also looked at the sequence similarity between the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis. We did not find any similarity to the sequences of the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis (Additional file 1). However, the sequences of the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis had no similarity to sequences of the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis and B. graminis (Additional file 1). Therefore, we believe that the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis might have some similarity to ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis. We have also added ChgDB in the ChgDB of L. bicolor to the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis, which might be helpful in the further understanding of the Chg.

Interestingly, we did not find ChgBd in the ChgDB of freshwater B. graminis, because B. graminis does not have a chytrid gene, but has a large number of chytrid genes, which might be involved in chytrid gene evolution. In addition, we found that ChgBd has a gene duplication event.
