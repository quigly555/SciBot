## Abstract
The bacterial mycobiota is an important factor that plays a key role in the host invasion of most of the fungal pathogens. In general, the mycobiota of Streptococcus pyogenes comprises a large mycobiota that is mainly involved in the transport of secreted metabolites and proteins. However, recently we found that the secreted proteins of S. pyogenes are also important in the colonization of Candida glabrata, the causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs). To better understand the molecular processes involved in the transport of these molecules and their links with other pathogenic processes, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of S. pyogenes proteins in order to identify putative proteins involved in this process.

The presence of several proteins in the S. pyogenes genome was analyzed through next-generation RNA sequencing. Using these data, we identified putative secreted proteins in addition to specific ones in the bacterial mycobiota. These data allowed us to identify the proteins in the S. pyogenes secretome, which is composed of 12 classes of predicted proteins. Using the data, we postulate that the secreted proteins of S. pyogenes were mainly derived from pre-mRNA-splicing gene. The proteome analysis revealed several S. pyogenes proteins involved in different cellular processes. We found several proteins that were exclusive to this bacterium, which we named them.


## Introduction
Fungi have developed numerous strategies to escape from our current knowledge and consequently, they must acquire the nutrients needed for growth and survival in the environment. This is evident by the fact that fungal pathogens usually rely on carbon sources that are restricted to higher order eukaryotes, such as fungi, which receive nutrients from a far higher variety of sources, including the decaying biomass of higher plants and animals (Alvarez and Dromer, 2002; Sanyal et al., 2015). This includes the reduction of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide (N_2O_2) by soil microbes as well as fungi (Alvarez and Dromer, 2002; Schlosser and Schlosser, 2004; Ramirez et al., 2014; Yener, 2015). In addition, fungi utilize nitrogen and sulfur compounds from plants, which is further limited to higher order eukaryotes such as fungi (Alvarez and Dromer, 2002; Schlosser and Schlosser, 2004; Ramirez et al., 2014).


## Methods
Yeast strains and media
A. fumigatus strain AF293 (MATa his3<U+0394>1 leu2<U+0394>1) and the genome of <U+0394> fumigatus Af293 were kindly provided by Dr. David Wells (University of California, Berkeley). The C. glabrata strain FYE18-1, a wild-type strain isolated from a patient with multiple mutations in chromosome sequencing, was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Reynolds (University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, MO). A. fumigatus strain <U+0394>ucpA was obtained from Dr. N. D. Muench (University of California, San Francisco). A. fumigatus strain <U+0394>ucpA1 was kindly provided by Dr. John A. Durbin (University of California, San Francisco). All other strains were grown at 30°C or 37°C in YPD or YPD + 1% glucose.

Preparation of agar plugs
To prepare agar plugs for microsatellites analysis, approximately 1-cm-thick-thick agar plugs were used for each of the following assays: agar plugs of <U+0394> fumigatus strain, 1.


## Results
In addition, the average number of introns per genome was close to those of the genome size of the mouse (Table 2. This result suggests that the majority of the introns are present in the C-complex, which may explain why the genome sizes of VGIIa and VGIIb have only a small fraction of introns compared to the mammalian genome.

The identification of introns in VGIIa and VGIIb genomes
To determine the intron locations in the genomes of the different VGIIa, VGIIb and VGIIc species, the sequences of introns were extracted from all the VGIIa and VGIIb genomes. The analysis of the sequences identified introns in all the VGIIa, VGIIb and VGIIc species revealed a high number of introns (n = 7; n = 14; n = 2, 5, and 3 introns, respectively), with one exception: introns 1 and 2 in the VGIIa and VGIIb species, respectively. The introns 1 and 2 in the VGIIa and VGIIc species are located on the N-terminal terminal regions, and introns 2 and 3 in the VGIIa and VGIIc species are located on the L-terminal terminal regions. In addition, introns 3, 4 and 5 in the VGIIa and VGIIc species were located on the C-terminus and the C-terminus region, respectively. The N-terminal terminal regions of the introns are characteristic of introns in other fungi, as well as other eukaryotic introns, such as N-terminal introns, E-terminal terminal introns, G- and C-termini and C-terminal terminal introns, respectively [32]. In VGIIa and VGIIc, the N-terminal terminal terminal terminal regions are highly conserved and common to all the species, while the C-terminal terminal terminal regions are characterized by low conservation (Table 3).


## Discussion
The extracellular glycosidic component was most abundant in the protist pathogen . neoformans, but not in the amoeba S. cerevisiae or the chytrid P. chrysosporium. The extent of extracellular glycosidic component in the pathogen was most significant in the basidiomycetous fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The glucan content of the chytrid P. chrysosporium was lower in comparison to the other fungi. This may be due to the fact that the fungus is a saprophytic fungus. In contrast to the previous study, the chytrid P. chrysosporium has a higher degree of glucan content in its genome compared to the other fungi. The high degree of glucan content in the chytrid P. chrysosporium could be due to the fact that it grows in an acidic environment [25].

The chytrid P. chrysosporium has been found to possess a variety of secreted proteins, but none of them is secreted in the wild type. In contrast to the fungus C. neoformans, the pathogenic basidiomycete fungi, the basidiomycete yeasts, and the protist S. cerevisiae do not have extracellular chytrid proteins. The basidiomycete yeasts are found in the soils of the United States, but their fungal lifestyles are limited to saprophytic lifestyles [27]. In contrast to other fungi, the pathogenic basidiomycete yeasts are found in the soil of the United States. It is possible that the saprophytic lifestyle of the pathogenic basidiomycetes and yeasts is related to the specific ecological niche of the fungus.

Overall, the results of the genome sequencing and assembly indicated that the genomes of C. neoformans and S. cerevisiae are very similar and that the genome of C. gattii is slightly different.
