## Abstract
Currently, the treatment of invasive fungal disease (IFD) is slowly deteriorating. The growing incidence of fungal infections, particularly Candida species, poses a serious threat not only to the patient but also to the health care workers and the public. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel triazole monoclonal antibody (mAb) mAb 4CAA/9CAA (6-F) against Candida albicans (Alb1, Sp1, Sp2) in conjunction with the fluconazole (6-F) and voriconazole (7-F) (8-F) (9-F) (10-F) (11-F) (mAb 4CAA/9CAA (6-F) - Abay) (mAb - 4CAA/9CAA (6-F) - Abay) [Abay] (6-F)] was evaluated in vitro.


## Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of lymphoid tissue dysmorphism caused by lymphocytic leukaemia (also known as basal-tract lymphohistiocytosis or basal-tract lymphohistiocytosis [1]). HLH is a common but frequently misdiagnosed condition that has been diagnosed in recent years, and has been associated with the development of idiopathic CD4+ T lymphopenia [2, 3]. The lack of definitive diagnosis for HLH may lead to a delay in treatment and even a complete cure, a phenomenon known as late-AIDS co-morbidities [4, 5]. Hitherto, the early diagnosis of HLH has been challenged by the fact that CD4+ lymphocytes are often not detected in serum samples [6, 7]. Moreover, the presence of a CD4+ lymphocyte has been demonstrated in serum samples, as well as in in the CSF [8]. On the other hand, CD4+ T lymphocytes are found in CSF [9], and it is increasingly recognized that this CD4+ T lymphocyte might be present in CSF from HIV-positive patients with HLH [10]. However, the clinical manifestation and prognosis of HIV-associated HLH are not well understood.

The clinical manifestations of HIV-associated HLH are most often asymptomatic, but can progress to severe liver dysfunction with progressive kidney injury [11]. These patients can also develop an infectious etiology that can be triggered by infections such as histoplasmosis, which is a common human fungal pathogen, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which causes pulmonary tuberculosis. The latter is an extremely important pathogen because it causes an estimated annual loss of more than $1 billion in the United States [12]. While HIV-associated HLH is usually suspected as a cause of pulmonary tuberculosis, HIV-associated HLH is also involved in other infectious causes as well [13].


## Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. They are preserved in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) and used without further purification.

Strains and culture conditions
The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. All strains were routinely cultured in minimal medium (MM) at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The minimal medium used for the cultivation of the fungi was DMEM (Hyclone) (HyClone Laboratories, New York, USA) containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) and 0.


## Results
The patient presented with a white blood cell count of 1.5 cells/µL, a CSF glucose level of 37.2 mmol/L, a CSF protein level of 22.7 mmol/L, and a CSF glucose level of 28.3 mmol/L. The patient had a fever, headache, and altered mental status. The patient was taken for immunosuppressive treatment. The patient was lost to follow up for 3 weeks. The patient had a history of headache and fever. The CSF sample was negative for fungal culture. A positive for S. pneumoniae was present in the CSF sample of the patient. The patient was stable on antifungal therapy at the time of his death.

The patient had a history of headache, fever, and altered mental status. The patient was readmitted from hospital for a diagnosis of pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, and anemia. The patient was readmitted from hospital for a diagnosis of hematological or pulmonary cryptococcosis, and was discharged with anemia. The patient was readmitted from hospital for a diagnosis of hematological or pulmonary cryptococcosis, and was discharged with anemia. The patient was taken for renal replacement therapy at the time of his death. The patient was found to have renal failure at the time of his death. The patient was discharged from hospital for a diagnosis of hematological or pulmonary cryptococcosis and died on time.

## Discussion

The patient presented with a cough, dyspnea, chest pain and chest pain on admissio.

The patient had a history of recent lung involvement.

Cough and chest pain were noted in the patient’s case.

The patient was treated with oral fluconazole and polyene antifungal therapy for 6 months, and then was started on polyene antifungal therapy for 6 months. After six months of treatment, the patient was stable on polyene antifungal therapy and the patient relapsed.

The patient also had a history of lung involvement.

In the present case, the patient was a diabetic and had a history of lung involvement.

The patient was treated with oral fluconazole, polyene antifungal therapy for 6 months, and then was started on polyene antifungal therapy for 6 months. After six months of treatment, the patient relapsed and had a history of lung involvement.
