## Abstract
The plant microbiota is fundamental to plant communities and has evolved to meet environmental challenges. Studies of soil microbes in the rhizosphere have revealed significant influence of soil microbes in the rhizoplilic, plant-associated microbiota, including microbial communities are associated with soil moisture, plant density, and soil pH. Adjacent microbial communities, including communities associated with rhizosphere fungi, are also associated with soil moisture. However, the microbial composition of rhizosphere communities and the influence of these communities on rhizosphere fungal communities remain unclear. Here we show that the rhizosphere rhizosphere microbiome is partitioned by overrepresented bacterial phyla, and their impact on the rhizosphere soil microbiota is different. The majority of fungal taxa were found to be present in the rhizosphere soil, but some taxa found only in the rhizosphere plants, and in contrast, a considerable number of fungal taxa were found in the plant-associated soil. Our results suggest that the rhizosphere soil microbial composition is partitioned by a diversity of fungal phyla, and these different fungi contribute to the rhizosphere fungal community. This study validates the notion that the rhizosphere soil can be used as a platform for studying fungal communities and the impact of fungal communities on rhizosphere soil communities.


## Introduction
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is used for the production of bioactive metabolites, including carotenoids, hydroxyurea, and antibiotics [1]. Among the compounds produced by A. nidulans, sesquiterpenoids have been the focus of much research. Sequiterpenoids such as isocitrate (1,2-dihydroxy-ß-cycloisocyanate) and lutein are structurally related to carotenoids, which are compounds that have a cyclodextrimex-1-propeller structure. In general, sesquiterpenes are active components of the sesquiterpene ring system, which is found in the penultimate region of the aromatic rings [2]. sesquiterpenes are synthesized by the enzyme sesquiterpene dehydrogenase (SREC), which is activated by the enzyme thiol-reductase, which is composed of two catalytic and two non-thiolating subunits. The enzyme thiol-reductase is highly conserved among fungi, making it an attractive candidate for biotechnological applications [3].

Among several sesquiterpenes, isocitrate (1,2-dihydroxy-ß-cycloisocyanate) is the most common and is found in nature.


## Methods
2007. The PMN2 polarization was performed by serial dilution of C. albicans (10^5-10^7 CFU/mL) with PBS, and the presence of PMN2 in the PMN2 mutant was confirmed by qPCR and western blot.

Fungal viability
For survival evaluation, C. albicans strains were grown overnight at 30°C. The suspension was filtered through 0.22 µm filter and diluted to an optical density (OD_600) of 0.5-1.0 at 25°C. The cells were spread on SDA plates, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The number of CFU was determined.

Phagocytosis assay
For phagocytosis assay, C. albicans strains were grown overnight at 30°C in SD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or SD medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) hemolytic peptone and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. For phagocytosis assays, 10^5 C. albicans cells were plated onto SDA plates, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The number of CFU was determined.

RNA-seq
Total RNA was extracted from C. albicans cells following the protocol of the RNAiso Plus Mini kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. All the RNA samples were DNase treated (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After DNase treatment, total RNA was purified and treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). The quality of the RNA was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit. For RNA-seq analysis, RNA samples were normalized to the transcript level of C. albicans strains from non-coding RNAs, and the relative transcript levels were calculated using the delta-delta Ct method. For RNA-seq analysis, RNA samples were normalized to the transcript level of C. albicans strains from non-coding RNAs, and the relative transcript levels were calculated using the delta-delta Ct method.


## Results
Among the 1269 blood cultures collected from children, we obtained 448 patients, of whom 493 (53%) were diagnosed with a clinical suspicion of candiduria, 434 (30%) with a clinical suspicion of invasive candiduria, and 438 (36%) with candiduria without candiduria. We also obtained 37 patients with a clinical suspicion of systemic candiduria (Table 1).

Among the 3265 patients with candiduria diagnosis, 449 patients were found to be at high risk for disseminated candidiasis (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.78-0.97; p = 0.


## Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of PMN2-depletion of . neoformans in human immunodeficiency virus patients.

We have previously reported the phagocytosis of C. neoformans by PMNs in the peritoneal macrophages, and this process is associated with an increase in phagocytosis of C. neoformans [12, 12, 14]. PMNs are not cell wall-degrading and, in addition to the inhibition of phagocytosis, they are also capable of phagocytose other pathogens [21, 22]. Previous studies in mice have shown that the PMN microenvironment may be able to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans, which is consistent with our findings in this study. A model of the phagocytic phagocytosis of C. neoformans by PMNs was established by measuring the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the peritoneal macrophages and in PMNs infected with C. neoformans [22]. PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro but not in vivo. PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro but not in vivo. PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro but not in vivo. We found that PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro. These findings are consistent with the reported reduced ability of PMNs to phagocytose C. neoformans in our model.

We also found that PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro but not in vivo. The ability of PMNs infected with C. neoformans to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro was similar to that of C. neoformans infected with C. albicans [22]. Similar to PMNs infected with C. albicans, PMNs infected with C. neoformans were able to phagocytose C. neoformans in vitro but not in vivo. PMNs infected with C.
