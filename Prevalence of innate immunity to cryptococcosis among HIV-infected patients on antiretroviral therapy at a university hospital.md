## Abstract
Metabolic resistance (R) refers to the concept of microbial resistance to overuse antibiotics, which, in the current case, involves overutilization of certain antibiotics while working toward the acquisition of resistance. This antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (RdU) is widely distributed in the aquaculture and food industries, where it ranks second among all the organisms that overproduce aflatoxins in a population of consumers. Exuberant growth of this strain in a culture medium that lacks oocythemia or erythema might be due to a combination of antibiotic induced stress, unresponsiveness to antibiotics in the water column and a lack of consideration of other potential antibiotic exposures at the individual and cascades level.


## Introduction
The pathogenic fungi of the genus Aspergillus are responsible for a wide range of pathologies, including invasive aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), allergic alveolar macular blast, and allergic blast, to name a few. The most common manifestations of ABPA include pulmonary aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and allergic alveolar lymphoid pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (1-5). In addition, A. fumigatus also causes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (6-8). ABPA is also a common manifestation of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, particularly in severely ill patients (9).

Invasive aspergillosis is also known as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (1, 2). Recently, A. fumigatus has been associated with other uncommon manifestations of aspergillosis, including aspergilloma, mucocutaneous and mucosal inflammation, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (1). Some of these uncommon manifestations have been described in the literature. However, none of the studies reported in the current literature investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ABPA.


## Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Rio de Janeiro and informed consent was obtained from all the patient. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Data Collection
The study was performed using a retrospective, case-control study on HIV-infected patients who were admitted to the hospital for cryptococcosis. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Rio de Janeiro. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before the clinical and microbiological tests were performed.

All patients with cryptococcosis admitted to the hospital from November 2011 to March 2012 and from September 2012 to March 2013 were included in the study. After this period, the patients were classified according to their ART status, which included ART treatment, CD4+ and HIV-infected status. The patients’ data were collected by the University of São Paulo Public Health Laboratory personnel in a standardized questionnaire, to enable the observation of the treatment and the results. The results were obtained from the time of admission to hospital and after the time of discharge to the hospital.

The patients’ demographics and their HIV status were summarized by gender. HIV status was defined as the presence of detectable HIV-1 RNA or RNA^+ viral DNA in serum or urine and/or plasma by current laboratory techniques, and the presence of detectable HIV-1 RNA or RNA^+ viral DNA in serum or urine or plasma by current laboratory techniques. The patients’ CD4+ count, the number of days since admission to the hospital, and the proportion of the patients with HIV-infected status in the study group were also included.

Ethical approval
The University of São Paulo Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol of the study and the reference document M27-A3 (No. 259/2012) was used for the interpretation of the relevant regulations.

Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the test was performed. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo (Protocol No. 18/11/2014).

Microbial Community Assessment
A total of 64 patients with cryptococcosis admitted to the University Hospital were included in the study. The microbiological cultures, including 10 Gram-positive, 10 Gram-negative, 10 Gram-negative and 10 Gram-positive, were included to confirm the clinical diagnosis.


## Results
%, consistent with previous reports that have documented a higher frequency of HIV-1 T-cell priming in HIV-infected patients [23.

The prevalence of natural and acquired infections, including cryptococcosis and toxoplasma, was 35.3% and 30.9%, respectively. The average annual incidence of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients was 2.8/100,000, and the annual incidence in patients on antiretroviral therapy was 1.3/100,000. The incidence of acquired infections was higher in HIV-infected patients (median: 1.1/100,000), but the prevalence of acquired infections was higher in HIV-uninfected patients (median: 1.1/100,000).

Treatment and outcome of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients
The use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with a higher risk of death compared to non-users (odds ratio [OR] 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.87). Among patients on antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of death was 32.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.2-43.1) and the overall incidence was 2.9/100,000 (95% CI, 1.1-5.1).

The incidence of death was 16.6% (95% CI, 9.5-23.6) and was 3.2/100,000 (95% CI, 2.4-5.7).

The incidence of death was 6.7% (95% CI, 2.3-9.2) and was 2.9/100,000 (95% CI, 1.3-4.8).

The incidence of death was 32.2% (95% CI, 23.2-43.1) and was 3.2/100,000 (95% CI, 2.4-5.7).

Treatment and outcome of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients
The use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of death compared to non-users (OR 0.22; 95% CI, 0.19-0.91). Among patients on antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of death was 32.2% (95% CI, 23.


## Discussion
The incidence of cryptococcosis was reported to be 11% in immunocompetent individuals in Uganda between 1992-2004 [10. The incidence of cryptococcosis in patients with immunocompetent hosts in Uganda between 1992-2004 was also reported to be 5% in the same study [10].
