## Abstract
Aneuploidy is common in eukaryotes but appears to have emerged independently in plants and most other eukaryotic micro-organisms in the last thousand years. The origin of this line of multinucleated giant cells of unmentered cells is unknown, as is the mode of differentiation. We show that the origin of multinucleated cells in animals and plants diverged about 1.4 billion years ago and that this transition has been driven by highly specialized machineries that produced eukaryotic messengers, gene-silencing machinery, and other cellular components.

Unmentered cells of unmentered organisms were first shown to differ in their non-uniform nucleation frequency after their birth, which is reflected by their diminished complexity and abundance in evolution.


## Introduction
.Upper)

Ceruleanidase from fungi [12] is the commonest enzyme with no substrate specificity for gram-positive bacteria. However, it is able to bind the C. tropicalis lipoarabinomannan and also the other ß-lactamase of this organism [13]. C. tropicalis has a wide array of mechanisms to convert L-lysine to E-lysine, for example, the E-lactamase Ctr1 in bacteria [14] and the C. tropicalis DcaCtr1 in fungi [15]. In addition, the C. tropicalis DcaCtr1 is found in the skin and in the gut and is expressed in a wide variety of organisms, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and also in a wide range of organisms, including humans [16,17,18]. DcaCtr1 was first isolated from the skin of a Japanese man and subsequently from several other people in the United States and Australia [19]. DcaCtr1 was later isolated from the gut of an Australian man and isolated from a number of animals [20]. In the process of investigating the fungus, it was found that several fungi can use E-lactamase as a substrate, and that some fungi have ability to degrade ß-lactams [21].

In addition to DcaCtr1, other ß-lactams can also be expressed in other organisms, including the insect pathogen Drosophila melanogaster [22], the nematode Caesarean cysts [23], the parasite Caenorhabditis elegans [24], and the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [25]. E-lactams, also known as natural killer and TLR-2, are a family of TLRs in which the TLR2 gene is homologous with D. melanogaster Dhh1 and Dhh2, a family of TLR-like proteins, and is expressed in the majority of vertebrates and fungi [26,27,28]. E-lactams also have the ability to inhibit the expression of ß-lactamases, which are ß-lactam antibiotics and natural killer (NK) cells [29].


## Methods
Fungal material
Sections of mycelium were obtained from the Soil Research Laboratory, Department of Botany, Pune, India (Sri Lanka). Isolates were deposited at the Herbarium of the Institute of Botany, Pune, India (IFI). The specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the Institute of Tropical Botany, Chiang Mai University (Chiang Mai, Thailand).

Isolates
Three different isolates of P. expansum were selected for this study: P. expansum-5, P. expansum-7 and P. expansum-10. The isolates were grown on PDA at 28°C for 2-3 days. Mycelium of the different isolates were collected and ground in liquid nitrogen. The ground samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further use.

P. expansum strain P. expansum (ATCC 47066) was isolated from a mycelium of P. expansum (P. expansum was used as the recipient strain in this study). The isolate was maintained on PDA at 28°C for 2-3 days. The isolate was subcultured in 200 ml of liquid medium (pH 3) at 28°C for 4 days. The mycelium was harvested by filtration and the ground mycelium was ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle.
