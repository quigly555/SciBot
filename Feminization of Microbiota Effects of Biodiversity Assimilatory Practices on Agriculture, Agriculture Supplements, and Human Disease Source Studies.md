## Abstract
We report a case of serologically diagnosed Aspergillus niger bloodstream infection (BSI) in a patient receiving dexamethasone for the treatment of refractory celiac disease. A patient had been treated with an isoniazid, but had a failure of response and/or a grade Ia B lymphocytopenia. A complete blood count and/or culture of the patient were negative for Aspergillus niger. Two patients in the SSN group had a BSI. Fungal culture of the pleurisy was negative for Aspergillus niger.


## Introduction
 2016. In the case of Biodiversity, the role of Microbiota in shaping plant health and disease remains unclear.

The Biodiversity hotspots in the world (Figure 1) are of great importance as global biodiversity hotspots have been understudied in many countries. These areas represent ~20% of the world’s land area and have a great diversity of habitats (Goffeau and Turchetti, 2000; Singer, 2013). Microbiota, particularly oomycetous fungi, are commonly found on plant parts as well as plant organs. They play important roles in plant health and disease as they can facilitate symbiosis, increase plant productivity, and increase plant growth (Goffeau and Turchetti, 2000; Singer, 2013; Thakur et al., 2017). Several studies have documented the presence of fungi in plant parts (Walsh et al., 2000; Bass et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2007; Bhatt et al., 2009; Chatterjee et al., 2010; Chaterjee and Singh, 2012). Biodiversity hotspots have been defined as areas that are diverse but are rarely sampled, that are subject to continuous cropping events and climatic changes, and that are characterized by relatively high rates of seasonality (Bass et al., 2004; Brimble et al., 2007; Behrends et al., 2009). Biodiversity hotspots can be defined by the fungal species that colonize the plant. Within these areas, the diversity increases by the increasing seasonality (Behrends et al., 2009; Behrends and Stukenbrock, 2013), and by the spread of diseases (Hof, 2006; Bhatt et al., 2009; Behrends and Stukenbrock, 2013) that lead to significant yield losses and soil degradation (Behrends et al., 2009). The diversity of the Biodiversity Hotspots in the world is being recognized as a global problem (Cabron et al., 2016; Adhikary et al., 2017).

To date, only few studies have documented the diversity of the Biodiversity Hotspots in the world. They have been documented only for fungi, such as P. depauperata, B. cinerea, B. chlamydospora, and B.


## Methods
pacificicum and 5 . japonica. We collected 10 samples from these plants, and performed an assessment of the impact of Biodiversity Resources Assessment (BRI) (http://www.biomolecularresearch.org/bri.html) and the scientific survey “Risk assessment of plant pathogens” (http://www.biomolecularresearch.org/risk.html) by using a sampling effort to collect 10 plant species. The most abundant plants in each genus were selected and selected based on previous studies (Wang et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017). The BRI was conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted principles for the protection of biodiversity of plants, including the requirement of quality control, the requirement of plant pathogens and the need for a minimum of three plant pathogens per species, and the use of a soil pathogen detection system. For this purpose, a negative control group was included, which included the plant species collected. In addition, the pathogen-free, control group was included to ensure the validity of the BRI. The BRI was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Code of Medical Laboratories and Industries, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Federation of Laboratory Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS).

The BRI was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Expert Committee on Biodiversity Assessment (JEC21) and the National Committee on Plant Protection and the BRI was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the United States Biological Conservation Service (ACP), National Research Council (CPC) and European Organization for Biological Resources (EOL) guidelines. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Medical Sciences (CEPH) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (RABSS) under protocol number MUFF-116-01 and number UEP-144-01.

The total number of bacteria and yeast was estimated from the soil samples, and the total number of yeasts was estimated from the air samples, using the methods described by Linde et al. (2001) and Rüdiger et al. (2014).

The impact of the Biodiversity management practices on agriculture was estimated using the model of RSM (using a two-tailed Student's t test) and the logarithm of the interaction between the factors was determined by a R^2 test (Table S5. The effects of the Biodiversity management practices on agriculture were estimated using the model of RSM and the logarithm of the interaction between the factors was determined by a R^2 test (Table S6). The effects of the Biodiversity management practices on agriculture were estimated using the model of RSM and the interaction between the factors was determined by a R^2 test (Table S7).

Effects of Biodiversity management practices on Human Health and Nutrition
We assessed the effects of Biodiversity management practices on human health and nutrition using the model of RSM (Table S11). The impact of Biodiversity management practices on human health and nutrition was estimated using the model of RSM (Table S11). The effects of Biodiversity management practices on human health and nutrition were estimated using the model of RSM (Table S11).

Biodiversity management practices on food and agricultural waste are associated with higher levels of total and non-metric environmental pollutants in soil
We assessed the effects of Biodiversity management practices on the concentrations of the total and non-metric environmental pollutants in soil. The effects of Biodiversity management practices on the concentrations of the total and non-metric environmental pollutants in soil were estimated using the model of RSM (Table S12). The effects of Biodiversity management practices on the total and non-metric environmental pollutants in soil were estimated using the model of RSM (Table S12).


## Discussion
The results show that the topology of the leaves is largely different compared to that of the stem. In the leaves of C. sativus, the two fungal species are primarily composed of plant pathogenic fungi. However, the fungal community composition is more similar to those of the leaves. The roots of C. sativus are dominated by Ascomycota, which are saprophytes. The stems of C. sativus are dominated by Basidiomycota, which are opportunistic pathogens. In contrast, the roots of C. sativus are dominated by Chytridiomycota and Microbotryomycetes, which are pathogens of wheat and barley. The overall microbial community composition was significantly different between the two plant species. However, the roots of C. sativus and C. sativus stems, which were dominated by Glomeromycota, were dominated by Ascomycota and Ascomycota, respectively. These results indicate that the fungal community structure in the roots of C. sativus is different from those of C. sativus stems. In general, differences in microbial communities in the roots of plant species are found in the roots of different species. For example, Glomeromycota are dominant in the leaves of C. sativus, but they are also common in the stems of C. sativus. In addition, Glomeromycota are found in the roots of P. oleracea, but in most of the plants studied, they are predominant in the stems of C. sativus. Moreover, Glomeromycota and Glomerotrophylum are often found in roots of P. oleracea. However, their root densities were different from those of C. sativus.

Biodiversity of soil fungal communities in soils and forests
The soil fungal communities of different soil types were analyzed by calculating the DGE plots. We found that the fungal community composition was significantly different between soils of different soils. The fungal community was dominated by the phylogenic Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phylotypes. The main phylotypes of soil fungi in the soil of C.
