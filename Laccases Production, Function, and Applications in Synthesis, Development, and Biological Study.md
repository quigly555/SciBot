## Abstract
The yeast-like fungi colonizing pigeon excretory vesicles invade the lungs and are responsible for tissue damage and morbidity and mortality in the pneumonia and histoplasmosis phases of the immune system. The phagocytes of the innate immune system control the progression of diseases by ensuring efficient secretion of anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is an effective treatment of microbial infections. However, the use of non-invasive antimicrobial chemotherapy, such as surgical disk warming, has a negative effect on the ability of these fungi to spread and survive in the lungs. In this review, we discuss the use of non-invasive antimicrobials in the treatment of infections caused by yeast, including pneumococcus, as well as some of the agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).


## Introduction
These enzymes have emerged in the last two decades, and their applications are increasing (Bischoff and Wingfield, 2003; Wang et a., 2005; Marchetti et al., 2007; Aoki et al., 2007; Blankenship et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2013). However, the enzyme produced by this pathogen is very different from the one obtained from other fungi and bacteria, and the structure of the enzyme is complex and does not always correlate with the microbial origin. For instance, the composition of the cell wall is altered by fungi and bacteria and their interaction (Wang et al., 2005). The enzyme produced by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii is known to be produced by the endosporium and contains proteins with an amino sugar moiety (Hennig and Hollis, 1999; Hennig and Hollis, 2001). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of chemicals that are produced by different microorganisms and play important roles in various pathologies. AMPs are classified into four groups, each of which includes glycosaminoglycans, hydroxyl groups, and chiral molecules, and include lipopeptides, nucleic acids, and proteinaceous molecules (Dodds et al., 1992; Hall, 1996). The composition of the cellular AMP structure varies depending on the microorganism and the host, and therefore, the structure of this structure may have a positive or negative impact on the pathogen’s ability to cause disease. Some of the most common pathogens associated with skin and nail diseases, such as P. brasiliensis, A. fumigatus, and A. terreus, contain lipopeptides with a glycosaminoglycans moiety (Hennig and Hollis, 1999). In addition, fungal pathogens present a variety of hydroxyl groups in their hydroxamido-type glycans and hydroxyl chiral molecules present in these glycans are required for the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Melland et al., 1995; Nevitt and Baddley, 1997). Therefore, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors play a crucial role in the carbohydrate synthesis and may have a negative impact on the pathogen’s ability to infect the host.


## Methods
cerevisiae S288C (FGSCA3) was isolated from rice seedling. S. cerevisiae was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C for 4 days. The fungi were harvested and resuspended in 0.85% sterile saline, and the fungal cells were then transferred to a sterile glass tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell suspension was diluted with 0.85% sterile saline. The final cell concentrations were 0.5×10^5/ml in 0.85% sterile saline, 0.5×10^4/ml in 0.85% sterile saline, 0.5×10^4/ml in 0.85% sterile saline, and 1.0×10^5/ml in 0.85% sterile saline. The resulting cell density was adjusted to 1×10^3 cell/ml, and 1 ml of this suspension was mixed with 0.85% sterile saline, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was then removed, and the cell concentrations were adjusted to 1×10^6/ml. In addition, the cells were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium at a final concentration of 1×10^5 cells/ml.

Cells were grown in 2 ml of culture media at 25°C. The cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was removed. The cells were pelleted again, and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were transferred to a fresh 1 ml tube and the pellets were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 2% sucrose, and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were re-suspended in 0.85% sterile saline and vortexed. The tubes were vortexed again, and the tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.85% sterile saline, and the cell concentrations were adjusted to 1×10^5 cells/ml. The cell concentrations were then adjusted to 1×10^5 cells/ml.

Cells were grown in 2 ml of culture media at 25°C. The cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was removed.


## Results
luteus are the tyrosine, lysine, serine, and valine as well as tyrosin. Lysine is the major product of tyrosine biosynthesis in methanol, ethanol, and glycerol. Lysine is a critical product of tyrosine biosynthesis in fungal and plant pathogen systems [32-34]. Lysine biosynthesis is crucial for cell growth and development, and LYS synthesis is essential for the fungal pathogenicity [32, 34]. We hypothesized that M. luteus Mp1 could be a positive regulator of LYS synthesis in M. luteus. To test this hypothesis, we next tested the contribution of Mp1 to Mp2 signaling in M. luteus. Mp1 is a PR-dependent kinase, and Mp1-mediated activation of Mp2 is required for the Mp2-mediated pathogenicity of M. luteus. To test whether Mp1-mediated activation of Mp2 signaling could account for Mp1-mediated LYS synthesis, we constructed strains that were co-expressed with Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling in M. luteus and Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling in M. luteus. We constructed a co-culture of Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling and Mp1-mediated Mp1 signaling (Fig 1). The co-culture of Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling and Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling is shown in Fig 1A. Our results show that Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling can activate Mp1-mediated LYS synthesis in M. luteus.

Mp1 promotes Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling in M. luteus
In the M. luteus LYS pathway, Mp1 is required for the Mp2-mediated pathogenicity of M. luteus [31]. Mp1 plays a key role in M. luteus pathogenicity through Mp2 signaling, which is important for the growth and virulence of fungi [35-37]. Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling in M. luteus can activate Mp1-mediated Mp2 signaling in M. luteus [31, 32, 38-40].


## Discussion
As shown in Table 2, the mixtures with enzymes from the other families of the family A1 displayed different activities, especially at low pH (Table 2), indicating that the enzymatic activities were not the same between the mixtures of the two enzyme. The mixtures of the other enzymes showed the highest activity at low pH, with all the mixtures of the enzymes from the other families showing activity at high pH (Table 2). The reaction with all the enzymes showed a significant increase in the pH of the reaction, with enzymes from the other families (Table 2), suggesting that the reaction is not only the same for the two enzymes, but also for the two mixtures.

Atypical activities of the other enzymes
The enzymes from the other families showed activities at pH 6.5 and above (Table 2), suggesting that they are active at acidic conditions. The activities of the other enzymes showed the highest activity at pH 6.5, with the highest activity at pH 6.6 (Table 2). The activity of the enzyme from the other families showed a decrease in the pH of the reaction (Table 2), indicating that the enzyme is more active at low pH. The enzyme from the other families showed a decrease in the activity of the reaction (Table 2). The enzyme from the other families showed a decrease in the activity of the reaction (Table 2).
