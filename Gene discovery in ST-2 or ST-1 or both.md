## Abstract
The ability of pathogenic fungi to grow in vitro or inoculate in vivo is crucial for the survival of host and their microbial pathogenicity is therefore not yet clear. Here we report the first genome-wide analysis of the recombination rates of filamentous fungi. Our analysis uncovered several large protein-coding regions that are significantly recombinantly transcribed between two parental lineages of the fungus and two parental states of the ascomycete yeast species Candida and Cryptococcus. These regions encode recombinantly transcribed domains of unknown function. We found that recombination is a key factor for the fungus to grow in a mixture of two parents and to form spores. Using a novel cloning strategy and high-throughput screening, we identified the large subunit (SSU) region of the protein coding region (SrcA) in the nucleotide binding pocket of the SrcA region of C. neoformans protein Ndr1p.


## Introduction
ST-2 and ST-1 are known to be involved in the induction of IL-6 and IL-12 secretion, respectivel. IL-12 is an extracellular cytokine that has been found to be produced during the induction of both TNF-a and IL-6 in different immune cell lines (25, 26, 27). IL-12 is a key cytokine in the induction of Th1 and Th17 responses. IL-12 has been demonstrated to be necessary for the pathogenesis of various infections (26, 28), and the results of IL-12 induction have been associated with a decrease in the number of T cells in the draining lymph nodes (29). IL-12 production in the context of the Th1 response is associated with IL-12p70 and IL-6 secretion, respectively (29, 30). However, the relationship between the cytokine and the host response is not clear. Thus, the role of IL-12 in the interaction of the T cell and the inflammatory cells is not clearly established.

To determine the role of IL-12 in the interaction of the T cell and the inflammatory cells, we first analyzed the effect of IL-12 and IL-12p40 on the recruitment and activation of all macrophage subsets. IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of all cells, but not IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of macrophages, was found in vitro. In a previous study, IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of T cells was found in vitro, and IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of T cells was observed only in the presence of IL-12p40. In contrast, IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of all cells was not observed.

Here we demonstrate that IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of T cells is essential for the interaction of T cells with the inflammatory cells. IL-12p40-dependent recruitment of T cells in vitro leads to the induction of Th1 and Th17 responses, whereas IL-12p40-dependent recruitment leads to Th2 and Th17 responses. IL-12p40-dependent recruitment leads to the induction of Th1 and Th17 responses.


## Methods
The list of non-fungal fungi in ST-2 or ST-1 was compiled from the list of non-fungal fungi in ST-1 and ST-. These strains were chosen based on the recommendations of the International Fungal Fungal Research Institute (IFRF) [33]. For the non-fungal fungi, we used the genomes of the T. reesei and T. rubrum [44], T. marcescens [45], and T. zonatus [46]. For the fungal strains, we used the genome of T. nivariensis [47] and the genome of T. syringae [48]. The relative abundance of each gene in each gene was calculated using the following formula:

Gene expression
The expression of each gene was determined using the Gene Expression Annotation software (http://www.expasy.ch/). The <U+0394>Ct method was used to calculate the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method [49], and the <U+0394>CT method was used to calculate the <U+0394>CT method [50].

Isolation of transporters
To analyze the efficiency of transporters, the whole genome of T. rubrum was sequenced. The genome was sequenced using a Roche 454 technology. The transporters were identified using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Transporter Classification (TOC) tools of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [51]. We selected the best transporters for phylogenetic analysis and then searched for homologs in T. rubrum using BLAST with the T. rubrum genome sequence. The best hit was used as a query to search for homologs in the T. rubrum genome. The best hits were selected from the 3-phylogenetic tree of the T. rubrum genome with the best hits as the outgroup.

Protein-protein interactions
The P_CAGR_GAL_Protein_Interaction (P_CAGR_GAL_Protein_Interaction) algorithm was used to identify proteins from T. rubrum.

## Discussion

When analysing the phenotypic and phenotypic differences between the two groups of fungi, it is important to note that the very different responses of the two groups of fungi to different fungi or different substrates may result in different fungal phenotype. This can be seen in the difference in colony morphologies of the two groups of fungi, which also leads to differences in the diversity and complexity of the fungal community structures. Thus, it is possible that different species of both groups of fungi can produce different phenotypes. Thus, it is possible that the results obtained with ST-2 and ST-1 or ST-2 or ST-1 of the two ST-1 isolates may have been derived from the heterokaryon incompatibility/non-homothallism paradigm. Alternatively, the phenotypic differences may be due to the differences in the genetic and epigenetic landscape of the fungus.

The phenotypic differences between ST-1 and ST-2 are not surprising, as the two strains of the two groups of fungi have very similar cell wall and cell surface structures and are genetically different. However, differences in the genes encoding the putative virulence factors and pathogenicity factors of the two groups of fungi are not surprising. However, differences in the genetic landscape of these two groups of fungi have been observed in studies conducted on different strains of different strains of the same strain group [34,35,36]. It is interesting to note that the genomes of ST-1 and ST-2 have relatively close sequence similarity to each other, even though the two strains differ in their genome sequences. This suggests that the genome of ST-1 and ST-2 may have more than one gene set and therefore that they are more closely related than their genomes would suggest. However, when comparing the genomes of ST-2 and ST-1, the two genomes are somewhat different in the number of gene regions compared to ST-1.

The differences in phenotypic characteristics between ST-2 and ST-1 have also been observed in other studies [36,37]. For instance, the ST-2 strains of S. cerevisiae are genetically similar to each other, but the strain of S. pombe differs in the number of genes involved in protein metabolism and cell differentiation [38,39]. In a study conducted on C. albicans, the three strains of the same strain group are genetically distinct [40].
