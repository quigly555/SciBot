## Abstract
A 59-year-old woman who was receiving corticosteroids for rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of a cough and a swelling in the left lung. An Xpert® Xpert® X-GY-101 was administered for consolidation and stabilization of the pneumonia and for prevention of pulmonary infection. The computed tomography (CT) showed a diminution in size of the left inferior lobe, and an increase in volume of the right lung parenchyma. A lumbar puncture (LP) showed a consolidation of a mild nodule in the right lung, and a slight expansion in the size of the right lung parenchyma. A lumbar lesion was also detected on chest radiography. Cytology and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were positive for cryptococcal antigenemia. The patient was treated with Amphotericin B and oral flucytosine. The pneumonia resolved after discharge from the hospital. At our recommendation, the patient underwent brain lorectomy. Our case suggested that a LCE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an occult pneumonia with pulmonary infection as the initial diagnosis when the pneumonia is expanding and the enlargement is due to lymphadenopathy.


## Introduction
Microorganisms have been used in traditional medicine and have contributed to the pharmaceutical industry by providing substances with different biological activities (Babu et al. 2017; Bhatt et al. 2017; Samantan et al. 2017). The use of microorganisms as health care personnel is well known, and the use of such entities has been found to be more effective in enhancing health outcomes (Kaur et al. 2018). In the clinical setting, they are used for their beneficial effects and their associated cost-effective pharmacological activities (Zhao et al. 2015; Zeng et al. 2016; Parnell et al. 2017). As an example, in the case of liver-associated cartilage damage in people with diabetes, the glucanases may be used to treat patients (Sokol-Karina and Ekman 2015). In the case of cartilage loss, the extracellular protease may be used as a selective agent to inhibit cartilage breakdown, thereby increasing the beneficial effect of these agents (Gelfand et al. 2017). In this regard, a variety of compounds have been described, such as alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids, which are described as having anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties (Gelfand et al. 2017). Some of these compounds have also been demonstrated to have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities (Zhao et al. 2015; Zeng et al. 2016; Parnell et al. 2017).

The use of these compounds in traditional medicine and pharmaceutical industry is already reported (Wisplinghoff et al. 2016), and their reported activities include anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-fungal, and anti-viral activities (Zhao et al. 2015; Zeng et al. 2016).


## Methods

For the experiments, the conditions described in the Supplementary Table 1 were used, as described previously [50. A total of 200 µL of mixture (1.0 g l^-1) was added to the top of 50 µL of the supernatant to which the samples were transferred, and the solution was then heated to 100°C and then cooled to 20°C. Samples were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 10 mL of sterile distilled water. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 µL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and then 10 mL of the supernatant were added to 500 µL of 10% SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 60°C for 10 min. The gels were stained with a solution of 0.1% SDS-PAGE and visualized with a G-20 PRO-TOF/TOF/TOF/TOF (Invitrogen, USA). The blot was then examined by using an Epson spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The blot was also quantified using the Quant-iT™ Plus dsRed (Invitrogen, USA). The analysis was carried out in a Bio-Rad CFX manager Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).

Identification of Lignocellulosic Carboxylesters
The Lignocellulosic Carboxylesters (LCCs) were analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the fungus and the R. irregularis strains (Supplementary Table 1). The sequences were downloaded from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) and assembled into a single-domain BLAST. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained using the method of Díaz and colleagues [22].

PCR and qPCR
The PCR reaction was performed with a mixture of primers (Table 1) with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 54°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1.


## Results
3.1. The Impact of Amplification of E. coli LPS on the M. tuberculosis Biofilm
The effect of the addition of E. coli LPS on the biofilm of M. tuberculosis was tested by standard biofilm assays. The addition of E. coli LPS did not affect the biofilm growth of M. tuberculosis (Figure 2). The addition of LPS did not cause any growth impairment in the biofilm of M. tuberculosis (Figure 2).

3.2. Differential Expression of Macrophages by E. coli LPS
The ability of E. coli LPS to induce changes in the M. tuberculosis biofilm was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell (FAC) staining of the blood, muscle and organs of mice as well as the release of macrophages from M. tuberculosis. The treatment of E. coli LPS did not cause any changes in the M. tuberculosis biofilm. However, the treatment with E. coli LPS resulted in the release of macrophages from M. tuberculosis. The release of macrophages was significantly higher in the treatment with E. coli LPS than that with the control (Figure 3).

3.3. Effect of E. coli LPS on the M. tuberculosis Biofilm
The antifungal activity of E. coli LPS on the M. tuberculosis biofilm was evaluated using the antifungal susceptibility assay. The results are shown in Figure 4.

3.4. Effect of E. coli LPS on the M. tuberculosis Biofilm
The results of the antifungal activity of E. coli LPS on the M. tuberculosis biofilm are shown in Figure 5.

## Discussion
toruloides, we investigated the potential for the ability of lignocellulose degrading enzymes to be utilized by different fungal specie. We performed comparative analysis of the roles of four lignocellulose degrading enzymes in a single-cell strain: LigA, LactA, LigD, and SiderA. We found that the latter two enzymes are important for the production of lignin, melanin, and necrosis of C. albicans and C. neoformans. The LactA/LactA-LigD complex, which contains a LigA-LactA-LactD lysine-to-LactA, is required for the utilization of L-DOPA, and then L-DOPA-LactA and L-DOPA-LactA, respectively, in T. reesei [36]. These four enzymes are required for the production of lignin, melanin, and necrosis of C. albicans. The LactA/LactA-LactA-LactA complex contains three LigA-LactA-LactA-LactD lysine-to-LactA, and is required for the utilization of L-DOPA, and then L-DOPA-LactA and L-DOPA-LactA, respectively, in T. reesei [36].

We also investigated the effect of L-DOPA and L-DOPA on the ability of T. reesei to grow on the liquid medium of L-DOPA and L-DOPA, which were obtained by the latter method. The growth of T. reesei on the liquid medium was reduced by 38% compared to that on L-DOPA. These results indicated that the presence of L-DOPA in T. reesei is important for the growth of T. reesei.

L-DOPA, L-DOPA, and L-DOPA are capable of converting L-DOPA to L-LactA in the enzyme complex
To determine the application of the enzyme system for lignocellulose degradation, we conducted comparative analysis of the four lignocellulose degrading enzymes in T. reesei.
