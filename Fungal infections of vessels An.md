## Abstract
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a serious complication of antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV/AIDS. It is often fatal without treatment. In HIV-negative patients, the mortality rate is greater than 50%. Despite that, there is little published literature on the issue. We sought to determine the factors associated with mortality in HIV-negative patients with PAM.

A prospective cohort of patients with HIV-4 infection and HIV-1-infected controls performed PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Web of Knowledge search for peer-reviewed publications from November 2017 to December 2018. Data were retrieved from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) through a Web of Knowledge registry and included in our analysis. We summarized the main causes of death, identified the clinical conditions that contributed to PAM, and identified risk factors associated with PAM. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of mortality.

Among the HIV-4 HIV-infected patients, the most significant independent factors associated with death were HIV-RNA viral load (aOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.


## Introduction
The genus Pterilidae includes over 200 species, most of which are well-known as phytopathogens, with only a few of them recognized as pathogenic or pathogenic for humans. In the past, Pterilidae was restricted to the subphylum Mycosphaerella (Madsen, 1964), but Pterilina was recognized as a distinct family within the family Mycosphaerellaceae (Crous et al. 2001), which was later expanded to include several related species (Crous et al. 2005, Crous et al. 2007). Recently, the genus Pterilina was expanded to include a new species, P. lusitaniae, and several species have been found as pathogens in different hosts (Crous et al. 2011).

The genus Pterilina was proposed by Crous et al. (2007) to accommodate species isolated from pine needles in Asia. The species P. lusitaniae was found in sympodial associations with three additional Asian hosts, namely, Japan, Korea, and China (Crous et al. 2007, Crous et al. 2007). The genus Pterilina was later transferred to the genus P. pyronella (Crous et al. 2011) in order to accommodate species isolated from cypress root rot in Europe and in the Mediterranean (Crous et al. 2011). P. pyronella was first described by Crous (1910) as the representative species of the genus Pterilina in Europe (Crous & Groenewald 1910), and later, it was recognised as a pathogen of pine and evergreen trees in the USA (Groenewald 1918, Spitzer 1949).


## Methods
. albicans was inoculated through the lateral tail vein into the footpad of the footpad of the outbred mice. Mice were monitored daily and weighed daily. Animals were kept in a ventilated room at 20 °C. For histopathological analysis, the footpad of the footpad was excised with a sterile scalpel, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.

Ethics statement
The animals in this study were cared for in accordance with the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [12] and the Guide for the Care and Use of Research Animal of the National Research Council (Approval No. 115/2011). Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Texas at San Antonio and by the Texas A & M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Determination of fungal burden in lungs
Mice were euthanized at day 8 after sacrifice, retro-transcribed to 1.5 ml of heparinized water, and then stored at -80 °C until use. Fungal burdens in the lungs of these mice were determined by using standard histopathological methods. Lungs were excised with a sterile scalpel, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Lung tissue was excised with a scalpel, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. The excised tissue was then mounted in glycerol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. For the histopathological analysis of lung tissues, the lungs were excised with a scalpel and fixed in 70% ethanol and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.

## Results

During the course of the study, four main outcomes were reported: (i) eyes were fully occupied, (ii) the heart was at a steady state, (iii) blood pressure increased and (iv) the liver and the heart were norma.

Ocular examination was performed on the same day and the heart was normal in all the patients. The follow-up time was analyzed at the end of the study. The follow-up time was less than 2-3 months.

The characteristics of the patients at the end of the study are shown in Table 1.

The proportion of male patients was higher at the end of the study (62.5%) than at the beginning of the study (34.9%). The difference in male and female patients at the end of the study was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean male and female patient age was 38.2 and 29.6 years, respectively, and the age of male patients was 42.3 and 26.4 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient gender was 42.3 and 26.4 years, respectively, and the sex of female patients was 34.5 and 25.8 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient age was 31.3 and 29.2 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient gender was 35.9 and 30.3 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient age was 33.8 and 31.4 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient age was 32.2 and 31.2 years, respectively. The mean female patient age was 32.2 and 31.4 years, respectively. The mean male and female patient age was 32.3 and 31.4 years, respectively.

The most common symptoms were fever (75.7%), headache (55.6%), cough (51.6%), dyspnea (50.5%), visual deficit (40.3%), abdominal pain (39.1%), and abdominal pain (38.1%). Other symptoms included: (i) headache (54.2%), (ii) cough (57.6%), dyspnea (54.1%), (iii) abdominal pain (55.3%), and (iv) visual deficit (46.6%).


## Discussion
The main findings of this study are that M. restricta is able to colonize and colonize the human host and is able to colonize various fungal species. M. restricta can colonize various fungal species, as well as different fungal strains, and can produce various metabolites and enzymes, which are valuable for human health and growth.

In this study, M. restricta was able to colonize and colonize the human lung, colonizing fungal strains isolated from lung and lung tissue. However, the colonized fungal strains were not able to produce phytoalexins and could not produce enzymes such as pyruviclavin and fatty acids, which are important for cell survival and proliferation of fungal pathogens. The fungal strains could not produce pyruviclavin and fatty acids, which are important for cell survival and proliferation of fungal pathogens.

In this study, we isolated M. restricta strains from human bronchiectasis patients and evaluated their ability to produce pyruviclavin, pyruviclavin, and fatty acids, which are important for the development of lung and pulmonary diseases. The results of our study suggested that the production of pyruviclavin and pyruviclavin could be stimulated by M. restricta in bronchiectasis patients.

Pulmonary infections are caused by fungi in inhalation and are usually caused by single organisms such as fungi or bacteria. There is a high prevalence of the disease in HIV patients, which is associated with several factors such as age, sex, and physical health [1].
