## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a basidiomycete fungus that is a leading cause of fungal infection in humans, causing life-threatening brain and lung diseases. As part of a global survey of fungi responsible for fungal brain infections, we present the first case of a brain abscess caused by C. gattii in a patient with AIDS, with a possible explanation for the patient’s immune dysfunction.

A 49-year-old Caucasian male with a history of immunocompromised health stated that he had been exposed to a house-to-house spurt of fungal spores in the living room of one of the living rooms and that it was difficult to control. He had been exposed to 3/10 swabs of the spores and was coughing heavily. He did not have a compatible cough for 2 weeks and then 2 weeks, then 4 weeks, then finally 6 months. He then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was admitted to the hospital with symptoms consistent with meningitis and a positive Cryptococcus gattii DNA PCR. He was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine with a favorable outcome.

While in hospital, our patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy with a favorable outcome, with a rapid improvement in his immune system. In addition, the patient was receiving daily voriconazole, a broad spectrum antifungal regimen with good tolerability. The patient was being treated with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine, with good tolerability.

We present a case of cryptococcosis caused by C. gattii in a patient with AIDS, which emphasizes the need for additional public health attention focused on the control and early emergence of cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, which is reflected in increased hospitalizations, increased costs, and difficulty in managing intracranial pressure (ICP) [1]. In addition, the growing population of patients with haematological disorders and solid organ transplantations, particularly those with hematological malignancies, predispose them to developing IFI [2].

Infection with Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is primarily acquired from the environment, and it is known that the lungs are the main site of infection [3]. The most common clinical manifestation is meningoencephalitis, which is characterized by an acute or subacute clinical course that can be caused by a single species, C. neoformans or C. gattii.


## Methods
After incubation at 30 °C, cell diameter was measured at every hour of the incubation to determine cell siz. The cell size difference was calculated as follows: (cell diameter × (cell diameter × number of cells)) × 100. Cells were considered to be smaller than 1 mm when they were stained with calcofluor white (Sigma-Aldrich) after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min and the number of cells was counted as 1 mm.

Cell growth and cytotoxicity
Cell growth and cytotoxicity were measured by the fluorescent fluorescence method as previously described [36, 37]. Briefly, fungal cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) and then stained with 10 µM of CellTracker^® Red CMXRos (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C. After staining with CellTracker^® Red CMXRos, the cells were washed with PBS, and the stained cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were stained with CellTracker^® Red CMXRos. The cytotoxicity was calculated as follows: (cells/antibody) × 100. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells in the treated group that showed cytotoxicity at a given time point.

Microscopy
Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and washed with PBS. After staining with CellTracker^® Red CMXRos, the cells were mounted on glass slides and observed with a Nikon A1M microscope. The cell fluorescence was obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i). The cell fluorescence was analyzed using DICS (Electron Microscopy) as previously described [38].

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of cell size differences between WT and <U+0394>chlamydospore size was calculated by the Student’s t-test and a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.01.

Ethics statement
The animal studies were conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council (Approval No.


## Results
Using the <U+0394>chlamydospore mutant strain (used as an adoptive parent) and the <U+0394>chlamydospore strain carrying an intact chlamydosporulation system, we generated strain <U+0394>chlamydospore-1 and <U+0394>chlamydospore-2 strain. Both strains had similar cell growth phenotypes, with both being able to grow in the presence of 25 µM chlamydospore (Figure 7). Both strains were able to grow in the presence of 10 µM chlamydospore. This result indicates that chlamydosporulation is not required for leishmania-induced chlamydospore size changes.

Chlamydospore Size Is Required for the Prediction of the M. major Intracellular Membrane Site
To investigate the role of chlamydospore size in leishmania-induced chlamydosporulation, we tested whether cell size and growth were altered in the presence of chlamydospores. Cell size and growth were measured in a <U+0394>chlamydospore mutant (Figure 8). Cell size and growth were increased by a factor of 1 in the presence of 10 µM chlamydospore. However, the growth defect was not observed in the <U+0394>chlamydospore strain. We used a growth assay to determine if chlamydospore size influences cell size or growth in the presence of chlamydospores. After 24 h of incubation, the number of cells with abnormal cell morphology was observed in the <U+0394>chlamydospore strain (Figure 8). However, when the cells were grown in the presence of chlamydospores, we observed similar cell morphology in both the <U+0394>chlamydospore strain and the <U+0394>chlamydospore strain (Figure 8). These results suggest that chlamydospore size does not affect the intracellular compartment architecture in the leishmania major strain.

## Discussion
This method has been used previously for measuring cell size and size of chlamydospores [26,27. In this study, we examined cell size of chlamydospores in different strain backgrounds (MSP7, MSP10, and MSP12) of the parasite, and found that cell size of chlamydospores was significantly different between the strains. Cell size of chlamydospores of MSP10 was approximately 2.3-3.8 µm, and cell size of MSP12 was approximately 2.2-3.9 µm. However, cell size of chlamydospores of MSP10 was approximately 2.6-2.8 µm and cell size of MSP12 was approximately 2.1-3.3 µm. In contrast, the growth of chlamydospores of MSP10 was not affected by cell size of chlamydospores of MSP10. Cells of MSP10 had the same diameter as those of MSP10. Cells of MSP10 had a similar growth rate as those of MSP10. Cells of MSP10 had similar growth rate as those of MSP10. Cells of MSP10 had similar growth rate as those of MSP10. Cell sizes of chlamydospores of MSP10 were approximately 2.5-3.5 µm and 2.5-3.8 µm, respectively. The cell sizes of chlamydospores of MSP10 were approximately 2.9-3.9 µm and 3.3-5.3 µm, respectively. Cell sizes of chlamydospores of MSP10 were approximately 3.8-4.2 µm and 4.4-5.2 µm, respectively. Cells of MSP10 had cell densities of approximately 6.1-8.1 µm. Cell densities of chlamydospores of MSP10 were approximately 1.6-2.6 µm and 1.7-2.4 µm, respectively. Cell densities of chlamydospores of MSP10 were approximately 3.2-4.1 µm and 3.1-4.6 µm, respectively. Cells of MSP10 had cell densities of approximately 3.1-4.
