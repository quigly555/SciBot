## Abstract
Bacteria of the genus Xenorhabdus are symbionts ofsea-living, plant and animal species. Members of the genus Xenorhabdus have caused worldwide declines in many economically important crops. The genes and genes of these organisms have been sequenced extensively, and they share many common elements. This is a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, genetic structure and evolutionary history of the bacterial groups living on Xenorhabdus, and their potential importance as biocontrol agents.


## Introduction
In a recent study, Udayanga (India) was the first country to implement a pilot study to assess the efficacy of oral and systemic antifungal therapy in patients with candidiasis. The study demonstrated that treatment with oral azole compounds was associated with significant reductions in candidemia and mortality in the first month of therapy. The reduction in candidemia and mortality was significant both at day 1 (0.3 compared with 0.2%) and at day 2 (0.6 compared with 0.5%) (Pfaller, 2013). In the study, the efficacy of oral azole compounds was observed in the first month of therapy in both the healthy and hospitalized patients with a period of candidiasis (26 days compared with 14 days) and in the patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis (37 days compared with 25 days) (Lumma et al., 2014).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral and systemic azole compounds in the first month of therapy using standardized methods.


## Methods
expansum Infection

. expansum wild-type strain (WT) was cultured in a liquid medium in a shaker at 30°C for 7 days. After this time, the cells were harvested, washed, and counted in a haemocytometer.

After the stimulation with P. expansum strains (WT, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, and <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1) for 8 h at 37°C in a shaker, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and adjusted to 0.2 McFarland standards (0.3 McFarland standard). The cells were plated on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) containing the antibiotics Ampicillin and Triton X-100, and incubated at 37°C for 2-3 days. The colonies were counted, and the corresponding numbers of CFU were calculated.

The P. expansum strains were cultivated in the presence of P. expansum spp. (WT, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1, and <U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1<U+0394>pps1), and the growth of the P. expansum strains was recorded every day until the end of the experiment. The data were analysed using the SPSS software (version 20.0).


## Results
tuberculosis Complex
The importance of GTPase-Type Mutagenesis on the interactions between macrophages and neutrophils in . tuberculosis (MtB) has been described before. In the M. tuberculosis complex, the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis resulted in a strong effect on macrophage phagocytosis in the presence of neutrophil-derived hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2). The amount of H_2O_2 in the M. tuberculosis complex was significantly higher than that in the normal environment (Table 2). The results of the M. tuberculosis complex were consistent with the notion that the TMD and the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis were required for the interaction between M. tuberculosis and neutrophils. The ability of the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis to reduce the phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis by neutrophils may be important in regulating the effect of proinflammatory molecules in the host.

The roles of proinflammatory molecules in the interaction between the host and the host-derived extracellular radicals in M. tuberculosis are currently under investigation. In this study, the roles of the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis in the interaction between the host and the bacteria were assessed using TEM images. The results demonstrated that the TMD and the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis were able to reduce the phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis by neutrophils, suggesting that the interaction with the bacteria is mediated by the proinflammatory molecules, not by the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis. In the macrophage complex, the TMD and the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis were able to reduce the phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis by neutrophils, suggesting that the interaction between the host and the bacteria is mediated by the proinflammatory molecules.

Lysosomal membrane permeabilization and acidification
The role of the TMD in the phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis and the interactions between bacteria and macrophages is well-known. In this study, the presence of the TMD and the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis significantly inhibited the phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis by macrophages. The data suggest that the interaction between the TMD and the GTPase-Type Mutagenesis is mediated by the proinflammatory molecules.


## Discussion

Taken together, these studies show that the TF-box family TF-box proteins (TF-box) complex with the TNF-a, IL-12P_2, and TNF-a signaling pathways to enhance macrophage activation and inflammation in response to . capsulatum. In addition, our findings also demonstrate that TF-box TF-box protein-associated surface TF-box proteins (TF-box TF-box) also modulate the levels of IL-6, MIP-2a, and IL-10 in the host by inducing IL-10 production, promoting cytokine production, and IL-10p70 production in macrophages [34].

We found that the interaction between TF-box TF-box proteins and the TNF-a and IL-12P_2 is regulated by the ICAM-1 signaling pathway and that this interaction is mediated by Cek1, a histone deacetylase that is induced by histone H3 acetylation. In contrast, the ICAM-1 pathway is not involved in the regulation of the proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, a phenotype also observed in response to H. capsulatum infection [35]. We found that the ICAM-1 pathway is also required for the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, although the ICAM-1/Cek1-mediated signaling pathway is not required for the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages [36]. The ICAM-1 pathway is also involved in the inhibition of the production of IL-6 by macrophages [37], although this inhibition is not required for the production of IL-10 [38]. The ICAM-1/Cek1-mediated signaling pathway is required for the inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages [39] and is also required for the inhibition of the production of IL-10 by macrophages [40].
