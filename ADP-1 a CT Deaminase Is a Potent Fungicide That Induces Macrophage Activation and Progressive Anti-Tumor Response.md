## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus is an important component of the human lung with a wide range of characteristics, such as ability to thrive in diverse microenvironments, and to grow in a variety of abiotic environments. As a biotechnological tool, plastic has become a main material of industrial and medical interest. The lung is commonly remodeled for the benefit of all organisms, including fungi, making it an ideal platform to add complexity and diversity. The lung has been shown to be a great resource for the development of new therapeutics due to its diversity and versatility. In this review, we summarize the major mechanisms that allow for growth in microenvironments, with a focus on fungal diversity, fungal growth conditions, and environmental factors that influence fungal proliferation in the lung. These include the ability of filamentous fungi to thrive in a variety of abiotic conditions, and the fact that the lung is inhabited by diverse fungal species, making it an ideal environment to modify the lung to function in either useful beneficial or detrimental ways. In particular, the lung is an excellent environment for the development of new anti-fungal agents, as it contains abundant fungi that pose a very low risk to humans and animals. In this sense, the lung is a useful and versatile environment, offering new opportunities for the development of new anti-fungal drugs and other environmentally friendly solutions.


## Introduction
.


## Methods
 2005. A single cell culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium. The cells were then harvested, washed in 0.85% NaCl and then diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 24 h with shaking at 250 rpm. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and washed in 0.85% NaCl. The cells were then resuspended in 0.85% NaCl and spotted onto LB agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were then collected by centrifugation and washed in 0.85% NaCl and stored at - 20 °C.

Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of A. fumigatus A1-DsSP and A. fumigatus A1-DPF was determined by the cytotoxic assay of 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) in the presence of 1 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) by the microtiter 96-well plate method (Millipore Corp., USA). The assay was performed in 96-well plates (Varian Blue GmbH, Germany). The concentrations of A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus A1-DsSP and A. fumigatus A1-DPF were determined by the Microtiter 96-Wells Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) at a final concentration of 0.125 µg/mL. The concentrations of A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus A1-DPF were determined by the microtiter 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) at a final concentration of 1 × 10^5 cells/mL. The concentration of A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus A1-DPF was determined by the microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) at a final concentration of 0.125 µg/mL.


## Results
fumigatus on . acridum and M. acridum ATCC-7390 cells were accompanied by a pro-inflammatory response, we infected mice with A. fumigatus and compared the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses. Both the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses were significantly enhanced in mice infected with A. fumigatus than in mice infected with A. fumigatus alone (Fig 6). Moreover, the anti-tumor responses of both the A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus +/+ strains were significantly lower in mice infected with A. fumigatus than in mice infected with A. fumigatus alone (Fig 6). These results suggest that, in addition to activating MHC class II, A. fumigatus is able to induce proinflammatory responses that are associated with M. acridum ATCC-7390 cell pro-inflammatory response in M. acridum and M. acridum ATCC-7390 macrophages.

A. fumigatus Is Functional in Mice Infected with Mice
To test whether A. fumigatus can induce the MHC class II-induced proinflammatory response, we infected mice with A. fumigatus and compared the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses. The pro-inflammatory response was significantly enhanced in mice infected with A. fumigatus than in mice infected with A. fumigatus alone (Fig 7A). However, the anti-tumor response was significantly lower in mice infected with A. fumigatus than in mice infected with A. fumigatus alone (Fig 7B). These data suggest that A. fumigatus is functional in M. acridum and M. acridum ATCC-7390 cells that are associated with MHC class II.

A. fumigatus Is Functional in Mice Infected With Mice
To evaluate the functional significance of A. fumigatus in M. acridum and M. acridum ATCC-7390 cells, we infected mice with A. fumigatus and compared the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses. Mice infected with A. fumigatus, but not A.


## Discussion
However, these studies were mainly focused on Fungi and their interactions in mammalian hosts and the significance of Fungi in pathogenic organism. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of the A. alternata genome and the Fungi genome using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Using a large number of genes, the A. alternata genome contained 36 putative genes (Table S1). These genes were divided into four distinct clusters (Table S1), and genes belonging to cluster 1 were divided into five clusters (Table S2). The A. alternata genome contained an average of 98.6 kb per gene, which was larger than that of other fungi [25]. Cluster 1 had the largest gene content, with an average of 45.2 kb per gene, and this cluster contained 11.5 kb gene. Cluster 2 contained 4.3 kb gene. These genes were located on the scaffold A1. The A. alternata genome was assembled using the Illumina MiSeq platform.

Genome size of A. alternata
The A. alternata genome contained 8.5 Mb of genome, which was smaller than other fungi (9.5 Mb). The A. alternata genome was composed of 26.1 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.35 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 5.22 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.71 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 11.1 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.27 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 6.7 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.87 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 5.01 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.59 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 3.96 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.35 Mb per gene. The A. alternata genome was composed of 4.03 Mb of genome and had a mean of 1.24 Mb per gene.

The genome sizes of A. alternata were estimated to be 0.22 Mb and 0.56 Mb respectively.
