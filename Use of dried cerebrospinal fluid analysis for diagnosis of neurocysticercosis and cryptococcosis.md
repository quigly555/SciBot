## Abstract
We investigated the roles played by fungi in host-pathogen interactions by examining the fungi inhabiting the human gut.


## Introduction
A total of 1.3 billion people have been exposed to the human body's surface, and more than 1.5 billion live in the human body (1). Human skin is the largest human habitat, with about 1.5 million species of skin, 40,000 species of hair, 30,000 species of legume, and more than 4500 species of reptiles and amphibians (1, 2).

On the skin, melanocytes play important biological roles, including host defense, cell adhesion, and cell differentiation (3). Melanin is a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and protects the skin from adverse environmental conditions (4). Secreted fungal cell wall proteins are the major determinants of skin barrier function and control. The ECM is the main source of fungal pathogens, and the most common fungal species are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (5). However, there are also other fungal species, such as Candida glabrata, Malassezia globosa, and Talaromyces (6), that can cause skin lesions that are independent of ECM (7, 8).

Although some studies have been conducted on the potential pathogens of skin lesions, little is known about the fungal species of skin lesions. In this study, we analyzed the fungal species of skin lesions in people living in Brazil, and also compared the ECM microbiome with bacterial and fungal species.


## Methods
To avoid possible contamination with cryptococcal cells, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also analysed using a macroscopic examination to rule out possible infection with Cryptococcu.

Lungs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood samples were obtained by taking out of a sterile, disposable tube, using sterile forceps and gently scraping the tissue with a sterile blade. The blood samples were prepared from the paranasal sinuses, the brain, the brain, the brain and the heart.

Invasive fungal infection was defined as fungal infection in the paranasal sinuses, sputum or BALF. For these, the results of histopathology, immunohistochemistry, culture, and PCR were recorded. The results of microbiology, culture, and PCR were also recorded. A total of 70 fungal isolates, from which 40 isolates were obtained, were then subjected to molecular and cell-based methods and confirmed by culture.

Invasive fungal infection was defined as fungal infection in the sputum, the brain, the brain, the brain, the brain, and the heart.

For the analysis of PFI, all the samples were analysed by PCR. The PCR products were isolated, and subsequently purified, using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The products were visualized with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Isolation and identification of yeast
The identification of yeast was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers listed in Table 1. The fungal strains were identified by the strains on which they had been isolated using conventional methods.

In order to confirm the results of the PCR, two fungal strains were included. The first was K. pneumoniae ATCC 48415. This strain was isolated from a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, which was confirmed to have a yeast-like morphology on Gram-negative plates. The second was Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 15982.


## Results
For the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis, we were able to obtain the results of the PCR products using the following methods: 1) Aorta-specific primers, 2) Biotin-specific primers, and 3) L-arginine specific primer. To enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the PCR products, we developed a series of commercial PCR-probing kits. These kits are designed to be able to detect specific organisms, but they do not require a sterile needle or a needle spacer for amplification. In addition, the PCR products from the Biotin-specific primers are also able to detect cryptococcal organisms (Figure 1). Therefore, we used the commercial PCR-probing kit described above as the best diagnostic option for diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.

Microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid specimens revealed a single non-reducing sign with no evidence of a hyphal formation. This sign is not indicative of cryptococcal infection. Instead, this sign indicates the presence of a cryptococcal infection in the cerebrospinal fluid. This sign is evident with a thin staining of the subcutaneous tissue and the identification of bacteria by the culture. On the other hand, the non-reducing sign does not indicate a hyphal formation. The signs of hyphal formation in the cerebrospinal fluid are generally not evident with microscopy (Figure 2). In addition, the presence of a yeast-like form is not evident with microscopy (Figure 2). In addition, the non-reducing sign is not evident with microscopy. Furthermore, the non-reducing sign is not evident with the histopathologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. However, we observed a non-stained sedimentation of the cerebrospinal fluid and an accumulation of yeast (Figure 2). In addition, the non-stained sedimentation was not evident with microscopy (Figure 2). The non-reducing sign is not evident with histopathologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. However, the non-stained sedimentation was evident with microscopy (Figure 2).


## Discussion
 2005. However, in a study of patients with HIV/AIDS, 38 of 44 cases (11.4%) had CSF findings suggestive of neurocysticercosis (Niemel et al., 2005). In addition, a retrospective study of HIV patients with suspected neurocysticercosis (n = 7) reported that CSF findings suggestive of neurocysticercosis were only seen in patients who had received a second injection of a corticosteroid, and were not identified in those patients who had received a third injection (Niemel et al., 2005). In a case series of seven patients with neurocysticercosis who had received a second injection, the CSF findings suggestive of neurocysticercosis were only seen in patients who had received a third injection (Niemel et al., 2005). However, in our study, the authors reported that the CSF findings of neurocysticercosis were only seen in those patients who had received a second injection (Niemel et al., 2005). Therefore, the importance of this study for neurocysticercosis diagnosis was not assessed. However, in a recent systematic review of the literature on neurocysticercosis, the authors concluded that the CSF findings of neurocysticercosis were only seen in patients who had received a second injection (Niemel et al., 2005).

The significant CSF pleocytosis in our study, which is typically seen in patients with HIV infection, may be associated with neurocysticercosis. In our study, the CSF pleocytosis occurred in 15.4% of patients. This percentage is comparable to the rate observed in a study of HIV patients with neurocysticercosis (19.4%) (Niemel et al., 2005). The main reasons for the pleocytosis in neurocysticercosis patients may be a lack of CSF pleocytosis or a lack of CSF cell wall protease. CSF protease is a mediator of inflammatory responses to cryptococcal infection (Niemel et al., 2005). CSF cell wall protease is involved in the early stages of the disease (Niemel et al., 2004). The CSF cell wall protease plays a role in the immune response to cryptococcal infection, thereby increasing the susceptibility of the host to infection (Niemel et al.
