## Abstract
Current models of microbial communities are concerned with a stable, spatially integrated view of microbial diversity but have major limitations due to a lack of robust, spatially explicit criteria for classifying subcultures. We propose a new microbial classification system, the classification of S-palmitoylationases (S-palmitoylationases-specific inhibitors of protein S-palmitoylation) with emphasis on their role in microbial community formation and characterization.


## Introduction
The human body’s primary functions consist of a myriad of cellular processes including nutrition, immunity, transport, communication, and health. Each of these processes relies on the coordinated action of multiple interacting components. This is reflected in the various environments that are within the human body such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, lung, and brain. However, it is also manifested in a myriad of non-specific areas such as the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and skin. Human GI tract is the largest and is the primary site of inflammation, the most common of which is the case of HIV-associated meningitis. On the other hand, the skin is a very restricted area, and as such, can be affected by a variety of microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The brain is the second most important organ in the CNS and is the major site of learning, memory, and language, but it can also be affected by a variety of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The immune system has many distinct members that function in both local and global immunity, and one of the most prominent is the natural immune response. As such, it has been shown that the immune system is able to clear and control infections.

The immune system is able to clear both self-limiting and self-limiting infections. The immune system can also be controlled by host factors that enhance the immune response to microorganisms. For example, macrophages are part of the innate immune system, which can eliminate self-limiting infections in the presence of a microbe. In contrast, macrophages can control infections and other complications by phagocytosis.


## Methods
Yeast strain and culture
The yeast strain of C. albicans used in this study was isolated from an infected tooth of a 15-year-old boy with hair loss who was diagnosed with Ehromycin B (IRB) treatment. This isolate was previously identified to be C. albicans ATCC 90028 and was confirmed to be C. albicans CBA/J in the present study. The strain was maintained on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar plates at room temperature (24-27°C) and used to inoculate YPD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 37°C.


## Results
graminearum from the 2007 clinical trial and confirmed these isolates to be . graminearum WLP12 and WLP14 isolates. The most common isolates were WLP12, WLP14, and WLP15, as they were identified in a previous study as the main F. graminearum pathogens in the Fungal Community (19). Among the F. graminearum isolates, F. graminearum WLP12 and WLP14 were the most common isolates with three isolates each, and WLP14 was identified as the most common isolates in all the cohort studies. These isolates were grouped into seven clades (clade A, B, C, D, E, and F) with the predominant Fusarium species being Pseudomonas sp., Alternaria sp., and Acanthomonas sp. (Table 1).

Among the F. graminearum isolates, WLP12 and WLP14 were the most common isolates with one isolate each, but WLP12 and WLP14 were identified as the most common isolates in a previous study (19). The present study also identified the most common Candida species in the F. graminearum F. graminearum WLP12 and WLP14 isolates, but WLP12 and WLP14 were identified as the most common Candida species in a previous study (19). Although the present study identified the most common Candida species in the F. graminearum WLP12 and WLP14 isolates, the current study did not identify the most common Candida species. In addition, the current study identified the most common Candida species in the WLP14 isolates, but WLP14 was identified as the most common Candida species in a previous study (19).

In the present study, the most common Candida species were Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, and Candida krusei (Table 1). The most common Candida species were Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, and Candida guilliermondii with four isolates each. The present study identified the most common Candida species in the WLP14 isolates, but WLP14 was identified as the most common Candida species in a previous study (19).


## Discussion
We aimed to define the Fusarium species-specific differences in the occurrence and phylogenetic distribution of certain common genotypes between the different specie. Our results showed that the frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species has not changed in the past decades. The frequency of common genotypes has remained unchanged in the past 10 years. In this study, we explored the frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species by comparing these genotypes between the different species. Fusarium species appear to be more genetically diverse than other Fusarium species. For example, the frequency of common genotypes in C. albicans was significantly higher than that in S. cerevisiae, but the frequency of common genotypes in A. fumigatus was lower than that in C. neoformans (Fig 3). The frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species is strongly influenced by the geographic location of the isolates. The frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species is strongly influenced by the geographic location of the isolates. The frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species is strongly influenced by the geographic location of the isolates. For example, the frequency of common genotypes in C. neoformans was significantly higher than that in C. albicans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. neoformans is significantly higher than that in C. albicans (Fig 3). Thus, we propose that the genetic diversity and the epidemiology of Fusarium species are more closely related to geographic location than to geographic origin.

The frequency of common genotypes in Fusarium species is significantly higher than that in C. albicans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. albicans was significantly higher than that in C. neoformans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. neoformans was significantly higher than that in C. albicans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. albicans was significantly higher than that in C. neoformans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. neoformans was significantly higher than that in C. albicans. The frequency of common genotypes in C. neoformans was significantly higher than that in C. albicans.
