## Abstract
This study investigated the phytochemical composition of oleoresin (OS) and other phenols from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and evaluated the effect of it and their related oleochemical compounds on their physicochemical properties and cytotoxic, antimicrobial and DNA-decay activities of the CBS assay.

OS extracts had a hydroxyl (GH) and a methyl (METH) (E3) structure, with values of 1-4 and 1-10 for GH and e-isolates respectively. The extract of leaves (E3) had a hydroxyl group (E3) in its GH and a methyl (METH) (E3) in its METH structures. The extract of bent Leaves (E3) had a hydroxyl group (E3) in its GH and a methyl (E3) in its METH structures.


## Introduction
The protein complex comprises two proteoglycans, a polysaccharide and a lipid, and the hydrophobic peptidyl moiety of the extracellular glycosylation domai. The hydrophobic peptidyl moiety comprises an outer core that contains an outer flanking protein with a glycosyl residue (molecular motif) of approximately 80 residues. The outer core is surrounded by an outer flanking protein of approximately 50 residues, which is bound by a hydrophobic peptidyl moiety and a hydrophobic glycosyl residue. The flanking protein is known to be hydrophobic in C. albicans and C. neoformans and to contribute to the growth and virulence of this fungus [8].

The hydrophilic glycosylation domain (HMD) is a unique glycosyl-modulation motif, which can be recognized by the C. albicans HMD protein and is essential for the transcriptional activity of the protein. The conserved motif consists of a N-terminal hydroxyl group at the N-terminus, which is present in all C. albicans genomes and is required for the formation of the fungal cell wall [9]. The C. albicans HMD protein consists of two subdomains, C_1 and C_2, which have distinct orientations, which are necessary for recognition by the HMD protein. In the C. albicans genome, all three subdomains of HMD are present and show distinct patterns of sequence identity [10]. The C. albicans HMD protein has been shown to be essential for the virulence of C. albicans [11].

In this study, we investigated the importance of the C. albicans HMD protein in the virulence of C. albicans by exploiting a drug-resistance mutant that is defective in the expression of the HMD protein in vivo. We identified several C. albicans mutants defective in the expression of HMD proteins and the mechanism of drug resistance are analyzed. In addition, the role of the C. albicans HMD protein in drug resistance was analyzed using two-drug model, which identifies the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and the drug-resistance mechanism are compared. The effect of C. albicans HMD protein on drug resistance is analyzed. In addition, the mechanism of resistance of C. albicans is investigated.


## Methods
pylori strains was evaluated using the gold-standard metho. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (70 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) in 200 µl of sterile PBS. The spleen and liver were removed and weighed, homogenized with 0.01% Tween 80 and a series of 10-fold dilutions were prepared. The concentration of protein required to inhibit the GPI was determined using a Bradford assay (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France).

Antifungal Agents
The antifungal drugs used in this study were Fluconazole (FLC), Amphotericin B (AMB), Itraconazole (ITC), Caspofungin (CSP), Caspofungin-R (CSP-R), Caspofungin-G (CSP-G), and Compound 1, which has been shown to be superior to amphotericin B in treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [10]. Caspofungin (CSP-R) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Itraconazole (ITC) was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). AMB was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Itraconazole-G, AMB-R, CSP-R, CSP-G, CSP-G, CSP-G, and CSP-R were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).

Cytotoxic Enzymes
The anti-cytotoxic EnZymes were constructed based on the reaction of the caspofungin-CSP-R to the azole-resistant G. pylori strains by the decrease in the viability of the non-cytotoxic CSP-R. The enzymatic activity of the EnZymes was determined by measuring the Cytotoxic Enzymes activity in vivo using a standard assay in the mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis [15].


## Results
oryzae in vivo, a large-scale block of 25,000 . oryzae cells was grown in the presence of 1.5 µM of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). The results demonstrated that in a strain of M. oryzae with a high susceptibility to 5-FC, 2.5 µM of 5-FC effectively inhibited hydrolysis of ERG11, ERG3, ERG12, ERG15 and ERG16 (Fig 4A). This result demonstrated that M. oryzae with a high resistance to 5-FC was capable of converting the drug to the non-competitive antifungal drug 5-fluorocytosine. Furthermore, M. oryzae cells cultured in the presence of 5-FC had a significantly higher percentage of ERG11, ERG3, ERG12, ERG15 and ERG16 cells, compared with the control (Fig 4B). In the case of M. oryzae cells cultured in the presence of 5-FC, the percentage of ERG11, ERG3, ERG12, ERG15 and ERG16 cells was higher, compared with the control (Fig 4C). The addition of 5-FC to M. oryzae cells stimulated the expression of a peptide that is thought to be involved in the degradation of oligosaccharides, such as oligosaccharides and pectin [39]. The results demonstrated that M. oryzae cells cultured in the presence of 5-FC could utilize oligosaccharides as a substrate for hydrolysis of ERG11, ERG3, ERG12, ERG15 and ERG16. The addition of 5-FC also induced the expression of a peptide that is involved in the degradation of oligosaccharides, such as oligosaccharides and pectin [39].

3.3. Chemotaxis of M. oryzae Cells with 5-FC
To assess the chemotactic activity of M. oryzae cells with 5-FC against M. oryzae, M. oryzae and M. tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis cell viability was analyzed after 1 h of incubation with 5-FC (Fig 5). The cells were incubated in the presence of 5-FC at concentrations ranging from 1.


## Discussion
In a previous study, we also showed that the GPase complex of . capsici was involved in the generation of GPase complex from a PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex in P. capsici [20]. To further elucidate the role of the GPase complex in hydrolytic mitotic and mitochondrial biogenesis, we performed further experiments. We used the enzymease activity of the P. capsici GPase complex to generate homologous proteins from the two domains of PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex (PDB and APN) [20]. The results revealed that the GPase complex formed the homologous protein of P. capsici in the present study.

To further analyze the GPase complex of P. capsici, we performed homology search with the components of the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex. The homology search with the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex revealed that the homologous protein with the sequence of the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex was related to the protoplastase protein PAP1. The homology search with the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex revealed that the homologous protein with the sequence of the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex was related to the endoplasmic reticulum protein (ERP) [21]. We also performed homology search with the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex using the PI3K/AKT/miRATA gene as a query. The homology search with the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex showed that the homologous protein with the sequence of the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex was related to the enzyme involved in the generation of GPase complex from the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex.

The genes involved in GPase and GPase-dependent reactions are present in the P. capsici genome and were also found in P. capsici orthologs from other organisms [21]. In addition, we identified homologous proteins of the other enzymes involved in the generation of GPase complex from the PI3K/AKT/miRATA complex. This is the first report of the presence of GPase complex from the P. capsici genome and the first report of GPase-dependent reactions from GPase.
