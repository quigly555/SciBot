## Abstract
The genus Neocosmospora (C. bacillisporus) includes about one hundred and five species from different kingdoms, many of them related to plant pathogens of the genera Trachysporium, Babesia, Clypeosphaeria, Milliporis, and Parmelospora. Most species are restricted to humans and their close relationship with their hosts and their ability to cause disease has motivated the study of their morphology and life cycle. These differences, in turn, have led to the identification of some genes that are key players in acellular development. In this study, we have demonstrated that the conidial surface of N. bacillisporus contains a distinct transmembrane network of at least 17 distinct RNAi proteins, of which 16 are also secreted to different degrees during life cycle. By conditional gene silencing of these proteins, we obtained a transcriptome model of the mating-type locus of N. bacillisporus and investigated the protein and transposase expression profiles during sexual development.

By analyzing a subset of transcripts, we have demonstrated that acellular development requires the presence of a key RNAi isoform, i.e., MATa. We found that RNAi is a functional transcription factor that silenced RNAi-deficient cells can generate in response to the loss of MATa. In addition, we have identified four different gene products that are necessary for asexual development of N. bacillisporus and demonstrate a gene product that is necessary for anoxia immunity to N. bacillisporus. We have also established an RNAi target, PDR1, which is a target of the RNAi target protein Prx1, which is a secretory protein.

The findings of our study may eventually lead to a novel RNAi-based diagnostic tool for this etiological agent, allowing direct identification of protein kinases and secretory proteins in the noclonus, a genetically tractable sub-population of the phylum of the dematiaceous fungus.

Many pathogens contain small RNAs (birrellides) in their genome that influence many biological processes.


## Introduction
Virulence of pathogenic microorganisms depends on the stage of infection, the host immune status, and on the immunological status of the infected individual (1, 2). Antibodies are primarily produced by innate cells (3). Most of the antibacterial agents are activated by a range of mechanisms, including the production of bacterial lytic enzymes, which kill microbes before they can be eliminated, and the secretion of a variety of biologically inactive antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that inhibit microbes (4-6).

Microbial pathogens are characterized by the ability to invade and colonize virtually any organ of the body, including the respiratory tract, wound, and other tissues. In fact, the rate of fungal infections is increasing globally due to the increase in the number of immunocompromised patients (7). Candida albicans is a common opportunistic pathogen that can cause disseminated infections in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. Candida albicans infections are usually asymptomatic and are often asymptomatic in healthy individuals, whereas in immunocompromised patients, C. albicans can cause systemic infections that require specialized medical treatment. The development of chronic superficial infections is a common clinical manifestation of superficial fungal infections (1, 8, 9). While C. albicans infections can be controlled by antifungal drugs, they can also be fatal in immunocompromised individuals (10).

In the context of systemic candidiasis, the best-studied virulence factors include the ability of the fungus to grow at 37°C and to form biofilms (11). Biofilms are the formation of extracellular aggregates that form between the microorganisms and the host cell membrane, where the microbial cells are protected from various macromolecular defense mechanisms (12, 13). The ability to change morphological forms, such as yeast or hyphal morphology, is essential for fungal pathogenesis (14). For example, the ability of C. albicans to switch from a hyphal form to a pathogenic yeast form is essential for the establishment of an infection (15).

C. albicans has been classified into two different classes, the a and a cell types (16).


## Methods
falciparum (S1 Text. The participants were screened for associations between Tissue and Lipid (SH) and Tissue-Related Diseases (TRD) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [15].

Pathogen detection of TRD was performed in the endocrine system, as in previous reviews [15]. In brief, the tissues of the liver, spleen, and kidneys of mice, as well as the kidneys and brains of healthy animals, were fixed in 10% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, stained with 0.05% crystal violet and 0.01% uranyl acetate in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer [14], and kept in a refrigerator at 4°C until the time of testing. Subsequently, the tissues were sectioned into 5 µm squares, and the sections were stained with 0.05% crystal violet and 0.01% uranyl acetate in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer for 30 min, followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water, and staining with 0.05% uranyl acetate in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer.

The presence of Ttr2-TRD was confirmed using the cytotoxic activity assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria [15]. Briefly, the samples were diluted with 0.05% crystal violet and 0.01% uranyl acetate, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Then, the samples were treated with 0.05% uranyl acetate and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer for 30 min. The samples were rinsed with sterile distilled water, and then the samples were air dried, weighed, and analyzed using a light microscope (Leica TCS SP8; Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan).

In vivo A. fumigatus cell culture, transfection, and trans-Ttr-TRD
For A. fumigatus transfection, the liver was removed from mice with a needle, and the kidneys were removed from mice with a needle, respectively, followed by a surgical procedure to remove the soft tissue.


## Results

Transcriptomic analysis of the human cell wall derived proteins
The transcriptomic data were collected from the whole genome sequencing (hGUS-seq. The results were compared to the transcripts of known human cell wall proteins, which were isolated from the lipids of rats, and were used to predict the association of the fungal cell wall proteins with human cell walls. We used the FoxProtease and FoxProtease E2 (WPDE2) genes to annotate the human cell wall proteins and to predict the fungal cell wall proteins as a group. We applied the WPDE2 gene in the W. dermatitidis genome to predict the fungal cell wall proteins. The results are shown in Figure 2. The expression of WPDE2 in the W. dermatitidis genome is nearly 2-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. The WPDE2 transcript level was nearly 4-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. The WPDE2 transcript level was up to 5-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. The expression of WPDE2 was down to 1-fold than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. The transcription level of WPDE2 is 1-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. We obtained a significant up-regulated transcript in the W. dermatitidis WT strain. The expression of WPDE2 was up to 10-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain. The WPDE2 transcript level was up to 10-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W. spleens KN99a strain.

We identified a significant up-regulated transcript in the W. dermatitidis WT strain in addition to the WPDE2 gene. The WPDE2 transcript level was up to 5-fold higher than that of the W. dermatitidis WT and the W.


## Discussion
We have provided a new paradigm for the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of phytoceramide and azithromycin. We demonstrated that the phytoceramide-resistant C. neoformans strain has a mutation in the CBM gene that increases the expression of CBM1, a key regulator of the growth-promoting enzyme CBM2 in response to phytoceramide. Although CBM2 was originally identified in C. neoformans, subsequent studies in other yeasts revealed that the CBM gene is involved in a variety of biological processes, including morphogenesis, cell wall composition, drug resistance, and virulence [25]-[30].

The gene CBM2 was identified in the phytoceramide-resistant C. neoformans strain and was upregulated by phytoceramide (Table 1 and Figure 1). This was consistent with the phenotypes of the phytoceramide-resistant C.
