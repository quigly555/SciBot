## Abstract
This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of the ethyl acetate extract of the deep-sea fungi, Phaeoacreveculum miculata (left image), obtained from the submerged plant of Mrakia in the East India Ocean, as well as the potential of substituting the two compounds for the corresponding active principles. The kinetic parameters of the ethyl acetate extract were determined through determination of kinetic coefficients and the statistical analysis of the p-value was done with R software. The results showed that the ethyl acetate extract of Phaeoacreveculum could inhibit the growth of 14.1% and 32.9% of the tested fungi in the broth with 70 CFU of bacteria, respectively. The results also showed that the ethyl acetate extract of Phaeoacreveculum could inhibit the growth of 11.9% and 30.4% of the tested fungi in the broth with 70 CFU of yeast. In addition, the results of the present study suggested that the ethyl acetate extract of Phaeoacreveculum could be used as a candidate in the development of a new antifungal drug.


## Introduction
 2014.

Hyphal differentiation in fungi is characterized by melanin-degrading structures called multispecies complexes (McGinnis and Horton, 2006). Melanin is a key virulence factor and determines the morphology and development of the fungal hyphae. Melanized fungi have a dimorphic life style, while filamentous ones can have both morphological and asexual life styles. Melanized fungi are classified as either non-host-specific or host-specific and distinguished by various molecular processes. Non-host specific fungi can only infect other fungi, and non-host specific fungi can only infect other fungi and cause disease on other hosts (Hofmann and Boddy, 2013). Melanized fungi generally acquire the ability to live in environments with high humidity, such as the soil or air, that is occupied by a host. Melanization in fungi is due to the interactions between the fungal cell wall and the host cell wall, and the cell wall-localized melanin is recognized by the host cell receptor (TCR) (Gustin et al., 2009; Estrada et al., 2014). The TCS plays a role in the virulence of fungi, and melanin is recognized by the TCS, which is regulated by the activation of its own ß-hydroxylase. Melanization and turgor pressure result in polarized growth, and the activity of the TCS is required for the activation of the macrophage cell wall in order to kill the fungus (Gustin et al., 2009; Estrada et al., 2014). The activity of the TCS is not essential for the activation of the macrophage cell wall in fungal pathogens, but depends upon the availability of other nutrients and on the stress conditions within the host environment. Melanization and turgor pressure are sensed by the chaperone Cch1 and the adaptor Cta1. Upon binding of environmental stimuli, the adaptor chaperone Cta1 activates the cAMP/PKA pathway. On the other hand, the adaptor chaperone Cta1 represses the transcription of genes encoding genes involved in the production and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Gustin et al., 2009; Estrada et al., 2014).


## Methods
Mutants were selected based on genomic features suggestive of hyphal morphogenesis [14. All mutants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting.

D. discoideum virulence was assessed by counting the number of spores and counting the number of viable spores in a 96-well plate in RPMI-1640 medium. Bacterial strains were grown on glucose-glucose-uridine-buffered saline (GVS) agar plates at 37 °C. For determination of virulence, strains were grown for 3 days on GMM plates. For survival curve analysis, single colony-forming unit (CFU) were counted in a Neubauer chamber at 20-cm intervals. Survival was calculated by dividing the number of CFUs by the total number of CFUs in each strain. For statistical analysis, data were analyzed using SPSS version 13.0. For experiments with C. albicans, overnight cultures of wild-type and deletion mutants were grown in LB broth for 48 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm and were then diluted to OD_600 = 0.1. The cultures were then diluted 1:10 with fresh LB broth and grown for another 24 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. For this time point, the cultures were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and plated in triplicate onto LB agar. Colony counts were performed after incubation at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 3 days.

D. discoideum survival curves were evaluated on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates at 37 °C. PDA plates were incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 48 h and then transferred to the experimental and control plates. For growth curve analysis, fungal cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber at 10^5 CFU/ml. For survival curve analysis, CFU were calculated by dividing the number of CFUs counted in each strain by the total number of CFUs in each strain. For statistical analysis, data were analyzed using SPSS version 13.0. For experiments with C. albicans, overnight cultures of wild-type and deletion mutants were grown in liquid YPD medium at 37 °C for 3 days and then diluted to OD_600 = 0.1 in fresh YPD. For this time point, the cultures were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and plated in triplicate onto YPD agar.

## Discussion
In addition to the . capsulatum H4, the other four proteins involved in the intracellular signaling pathways were also identified in the present study. The P. brasiliensis Pbs2, Pbs3 and Pbs4 were involved in the Pbs2-Pbs3-Pbs4 pathway, while the Pbs2-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway was not found in the H. capsulatum H4. The fact that these three proteins are involved in the Pbs3-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway suggests that Pbs3 may be involved in the Pbs3-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway in H. capsulatum.

Pbs2, Pbs3 and Pbs4 were the most highly expressed proteins in the genome in this study. In fact, they were the most highly expressed proteins in the P. brasiliensis Pbs2-Pbs3-Pbs4 pathway, which indicated that the H. capsulatum Pbs2, Pbs3 and Pbs4 proteins are the main ones involved in Pbs2-Pbs3-Pbs4 pathway. This indicates that the H. capsulatum Pbs2, Pbs3 and Pbs4 proteins are the main ones involved in the Pbs2-Pbs3-Pbs4 pathway. The present study showed that Pbs3 and Pbs4 were up-regulated in the H. capsulatum Pbs2, Pbs3 and Pbs4, indicating that Pbs3 and Pbs4 is the main protein involved in Pbs2-Pbs3-Pbs4 pathway. It has been reported that the expression of the Pbs proteins, which is important for Pbs3-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway, is up-regulated in H. capsulatum [21]. Pbs4, which is a Pbs3-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway, was also found to be up-regulated in H. capsulatum [21]. In addition, the expression of the Pbs4-Pbs4-Pbs4 pathway was up-regulated in H. capsulatum [21].
