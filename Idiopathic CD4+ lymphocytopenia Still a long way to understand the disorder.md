## Abstract
Fungal biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere together to form a continuous biofilm that can develop into a formidable barrier to entry by the host immune response. The biofilm matrix (biofilms) of filamentous fungi have been considered as the first place where the fungal virulence factor capsule (Fs) first starts to form at the matrix. However, the composition and organization of the fungal capsule is still unknown. In this study, we used an oligotrophic fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (L.) Keissl, which is known to grow as a multicellular fungus and to produce biofilms. Analysis of the C-terminus of the capsule revealed that the fungus may be able to form capsules similar to those found in the cells of other fungi. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found that the fungus could distinguish among the different types of capsular polysaccharides, the most characteristic of the fungus and the cell wall polysaccharides. Biofilm matrix composition and composition of the fungal capsule during growth did not differ between the types of fungal strains. This finding indicates that the capsule of S. sclerotiorum is a complex matrix that responds to various environmental challenges and to the different stresses of the host environment. It also helps the fungus form biofilms that are able to form persistent biofilms that invade the host tissues. Overall, the results presented here provide the first evidence that the capsule of S. sclerotiorum is a complex matrix and that capsule composition of the fungus can be related to the environmental requirements of the host.


## Introduction
The most common neurological disorders in HIV/AIDS are asymptomatic and mild forms of the disease are observed in about 10% of the patients with AIDS-related opportunistic infections (OIs), with the most severe forms occurring in the late stages of the diseas. The severity of the disease is associated with a variety of neurological manifestations, and the most common ocular manifestations of the disease are an asymatous rash, optic neuritis, optic neuritis, intracranial mass, and hemiplegia [8]. Symptomatic patients with AIDS are typically self-limiting with signs and symptoms progressing without any signs or symptoms occurring in the preceding 6 to 7 days [9]. Acanthamoeba is the main etiology of AIDS-related ocular manifestations. The disease can progress from an acute inflammation and progressive inflammation to a chronic inflammatory demyelinating lesion, which is fatal if left untreated. In most cases, the disease is eventually fatal without the disease symptoms manifesting late in the disease [10]. The hallmark lesions are necrotic and cell mediated [11]. The course of the disease is characterized by a progressive progressive neurological deficit, brainstem atrophy, seizures, anemia, progressive weakness, and decreased cognitive function [12].

The AIDS-associated macrophage (AM) has long been recognized as a primary site of the AIDS-related disease. It is the most prevalent eukaryotic macrophage in the body and is primarily recruited to the CNS by the circulatory system [13]. The recruitment of macrophages occurs via two types of plasma membrane-spanning transporters, namely, cargoes and effector proteins. The cargoes serve as endocytic effectors and regulate diverse cellular functions including cytokinesis, cell proliferation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration [14]. The cargoes are classified into two major types, classically activated and alternatively activated macrophages (AMs) [15].


## Methods
We also do not believe in a delay in patient initiation [33], because there is no reason to believe this in the current stud. We do not conclude that the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a good sign of leukemia in patients with the functional distribution of CD4+ T cells [34], and we do not believe that the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis (ALL) is a good sign of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with the functional distribution of CD4+ T cells [35].

Approximately 1,000 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed within 2 weeks were selected for the present study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Pernambuco (UEP). The study was approved by the University of Pernambuco Ethics Committee (UEP) (D-9).

Molecular diagnosis of Lymphocyte-associated Antigen
We analyzed the molecular diagnosis of lymphocyte-associated antigen (LAM-A) as previously described [10]. Briefly, we used a standard molecular typing technique with the CD4+ T cell count of the four patients in the present study (Table 1).

Candidate LAM-A isolates were identified by colony-PCR and PCR with primers for L. major and L. canis (Table 2). L. canis is a hemolytic species of L. canis that forms complex monocytic cells, such as L. canis-ß, which is highly virulent, [36]. L. canis-ß is isolated from the serum of a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) [36].

The LAM-A locus of L. canis was not identified in the present study. However, this locus has been previously used for the identification of L. canis by PCR, which was performed by using primers for L. canis-ß and L. canis-ß-B, which were specific for L. canis [36]. We also analyzed the clinical results of L. canis-ß-B in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) [37]. We performed PCR with primers for L. canis-ß and L.


## Results
Demographic characteristics and clinical features of the study participants are shown in Table 1.

Of the 12-week-old HIV-infected patients, 29.1% (10/12) were female. Most (57.9%) were older than 20 years of age, and 9.2% (14/14) were females. The median age of the study participants was 36 years (range, 7-85). Among the 31-month-old HIV-infected patients, the median age was 43 years (range, 7-85). The median age of the study participants was 48 years (range, 12-65). The HIV-associated comorbidities were men’s age at the time of diagnosis, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection. The most common comorbidities were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cryptococcal meningitis, and diabetes mellitus. Most (82.6%) of the study participants were on ART at enrollment. The mean duration of ART use was 1.9 (interquartile range, 2.4-4.3) months (range, 1.4-2.6). The median duration of ART use was 12.6 months (range, 3.6-20.3) in the HIV-infected patients and 21.6 months (range, 4.9-29.7) in the HIV-non-infected patients.


## Discussion
In this report, we demonstrated that the single nucleotide mutation in the gene encoding the iron transporter gene LFTR1, Cna1, caused accumulation of aflatoxins in C. neoformans. In addition to the production of CNA1, CNA2 and CNA3, we also found that the two copper-specific subunits in LFTR1 encode C-to-C-C-C-C-C, and that CNA5 encodes C-to-C-C-C-C, which could result in the production of fucose. We also found that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex is highly conserved in C. neoformans, which is consistent with the observation that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex is highly expressed in C. neoformans.

LFTR1 is not only required for the synthesis of Fucose, but also for the CNA5-CNA3 complex. This finding was further supported by the observation that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex was highly expressed in C. neoformans. LFTR1 is also involved in the synthesis of aflatoxins, which can be produced by the CNA5-CNA3 complex, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the CNA5-CNA3 complex could be dispensable for the production of Fucose. Furthermore, the CNA5/LFTR1 complex was not only required for the synthesis of Fucose, but also for the CNA5-CNA3 complex, which is consistent with the observation that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex is highly expressed in C. neoformans.

LFTR1 is essential for the synthesis of aflatoxins, which can be produced by the CNA5-CNA3 complex. In C. neoformans, the CNA5-CNA3 complex is involved in the synthesis of aflatoxins, which can be produced by the CNA5-CNA3 complex. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex could be dispensable for the production of aflatoxins.

We found that the CNA5/LFTR1 complex is required for the synthesis of fucose.
