## Abstract
The genus Ambrosiodmus includes many species of wood-boring fungi, which are part of a large mycobiota in the Southern Hemisphere. The genus Ambrosiodmus has been proposed to belong to a clade containing species of Eucalyptus, a xerotolerant family of metallothioneins. The current taxonomy of Ambrosiodmus is based on the type species of the taxa that are recorded, not the type species of the fungus that is most frequently the subject of a single paper.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal disease (IFD), caused by fungi of the genus Cryptococcus, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The most common species that cause IFD are C. neoformans and C. gattii; however, the causative agent C. gattii is increasingly recognized as a primary pathogen in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients, particularly those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and those with hematologic malignancies. In addition, C. neoformans is a major cause of infections in apparently normal hosts and patients with hematological malignancies. Here, we present a case of a non-immunocompromised patient with cryptococcal meningitis, who developed a C. neoformans meningitis with a more severe acute course.


## Methods
All of the patients were classified into three groups: Control (G8P group), Intra-group, and Lymphatic Grou. Each of the three groups consisted of four adults (age = 18 years) with CD4 counts of < 100 cells/Âµl. A negative control group was also included in this study. All of the patients were treated with complete fluids and the results of all tests were recorded.

G8P group
The G8P group consists of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who were initiated for the study by the identification of Candida species and the diagnosis of pneumonia. All of the patients were treated with incomplete fluids. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Intra-group group
The Intra-group consists of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, who were treated with incomplete fluids. All of the patients were treated with incomplete fluids. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Lymphatic Group
The lymphatic group consists of patients with chronic leukemia, who were treated with incomplete fluids. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Pathology
The histological study was performed by the Pathology Department of Makerere University Hospital. All of the patients were treated with incomplete fluids. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Microglial staining
The microscopic study was performed by the Microglial staining Laboratory of Makererere University Hospital. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Lymphatic staining
The lymphatic staining was performed by the Microglial staining Laboratory of Makerere University Hospital. The results of the tests of the organs were recorded and the results of the analyses were recorded.

Cryptococcus neoformans
The Cryptococcus neoformans strain was isolated from a patient with acute mycoses in the hospital, and the identification of the clinical isolate was confirmed by the culture.

Clinical isolates
The clinical isolates were obtained from patients with acute mycoses, who were treated with incomplete fluids and the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis.


## Results
broussoniae was shown to produce a number of antimicrobial molecules that are capable of inhibiting proliferation of numerous microorganisms [16. We therefore investigated the antimicrobial activity of the isolates obtained from a variety of different patient groups, including patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and a subset of patients with fungal infection. In this study, we used the MICs of the Gram-negative isolates (Table 1), but also tested the MICs of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 2). The results of the susceptibility tests indicate that the MICs of the Gram-negative isolates were much lower than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 2).

The MICs of the Gram-negative isolates of the four Candida species of Candida spp. were less than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 1). The MICs of the Gram-negative isolates were more than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 2). We also investigated the susceptibility to the antifungal drug fluconazole. The MICs of the Gram-negative isolates were more than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 2). The MICs of the Gram-negative isolates were much higher than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 2).

3.3. Preliminary Analysis of Antibiotic Assays
Based on the results obtained in Table 2, we assessed the susceptibility of the tested oral drugs to the different Candida spp.

The MIC of the tested drugs against all Candida spp. was less than those of the Gram-negative isolates (Table 3). The MIC of fluconazole was found to be less than that of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 3). The MIC of fluconazole against the Gram-negative isolates was more than those of the Gram-positive isolates (Table 3).

3.4. Evaluation of Antibiotic Assays
The susceptibility of the oral antibiotics to the Candida spp. isolates was evaluated in the first round of the study. We evaluated the activity of the oral antibiotics against the Candida spp. isolates by the MICs of the test drugs against the Candida spp. isolates. We found that the MICs of the test drugs against the Candida isolates were much lower than those of the Gram-negative isolates (Table 4).

## Discussion

The main challenge with current therapeutic strategies is the lack of understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the healing proces. In the present study, the patients' patients were successfully treated with combined chemotherapy and oral prophylaxis with itraconazole, as evidenced by a favorable response to the treatment (Fig 2). The patients' patients were treated with oral prophylaxis with anidulafungin for 2 weeks. In the case of candidemia, anidulafungin therapy was used as a single-pharmacy chemotherapy followed by other treatments, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with azoles for one week (Fig 3). For the patients' patients, a third-generation cephalosporin (a secondary prophylaxis) was also used to treat candidemia, with a less proportion of patients receiving treatment with azoles for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients received the combination of oral prophylaxis and treatment with itraconazole, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for two weeks. For the patients' patients, treatment with itraconazole was continued for 2 weeks, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with azoles for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients received azole therapy for 3 weeks, with a lower proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients received oral prophylaxis with itraconazole for one week, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients were treated with azoles for one week and the patients' patients received azole therapy for one week, with a higher proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients received oral prophylaxis with itraconazole for 2 weeks, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for a longer period of time (Fig 3). The patients' patients received oral prophylaxis with itraconazole for 3 weeks, with a greater proportion of patients receiving treatment with itraconazole for a longer period of time (Fig 3).
