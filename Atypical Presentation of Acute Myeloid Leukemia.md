## Abstract
The emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic fungi has further heightened concern about the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of pathogens. Current therapeutics are either toxic, have low efficacy, or are overly broad in several important clinical scenarios. Thus, there is a critical need for new antimycotics that overcome these limitations and still perform optima. metal complexes were/were not used to prepare/distill a list of the most promising natural and/or commercial antimycotics, or chemical modification that affect their properties, including bioactivity, stability, or side effects.

This list is not intended to replace your regular chemical evaluations, and antimycotics from natural sources are by no means an exhaustive list. Instead, this list highlights some of the potential antimycotics that have already been explored, as well as some that have been very, very far along their development history.

We hope this list helps or even inspires other researchers and patients with HIV/AIDS who wish to explore other antimycotics, or who are considering starting/entrotherapy their natural antimycotics orifices. We encourage experimentation, discussion, and discovery.

## Introduction

Although the presence of Listeria in the spleen has been shown in HIV-negative patients with HIV infection, Listeria monocytogenes (LCM) infection is rarely described in the splee. This observation was attributed to the low abundance of Listeria in the spleen, which is associated with the capacity of Listeria to proliferate in the spleen and invade the lymph nodes [20, 21]. The spleen is known to be a reservoir of Listeria for infection and colonization [22]. Listeria is highly abundant in the spleen and the lymph nodes and can be readily cultured from the spleen in the absence of an associated external source of Listeria. This microorganism is able to persist in the spleen in the absence of external sources of Listeria, even in the absence of an infected host. This ability to persist and spread in the spleen was originally described for bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus [23, 24]. In addition to Listeria, other bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus are known to be associated with Listeria spleen infections [25, 26]. In addition to bacteria, spleen spleen bacteria have been identified as parasites [27]. Parasites of these bacteria can be present in the spleen and liver of patients and are believed to be the primary reservoirs of Listeria in the spleen [28]. In addition, Listeria spleen bacteria are associated with HIV infections in the spleen, which may be attributed to the spleen bacteria being enriched in proteins related to HIV infection [21, 29, 30].

Although the ability of Listeria spleen bacteria to colonize and invade the spleen has been reported in a few studies [21, 22, 30, 31], the role of these bacteria in HIV/AIDS remains controversial. The major role of Listeria spleen bacteria in the spread of HIV/AIDS has been demonstrated in a number of studies, including in a large cohort of patients with CM [32], in a large Ugandan cohort of patients with cryptococcal meningitis [33], and in a small Ugandan cohort of patients with CRAG1 mutations [34].


## Methods
. Chemistry
The antimony compounds were synthesized by in-house synthesis of the antipyretic compound a(p)p-a-n-acetyl-a-d-phellianopyranoside. The antimony compounds were dissolved in water and evaporated under reduced pressure to give a stock solution of 1 mL. The stock solution was prepared by dissolving the antimony compounds in water. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a dark residue, which was purified through a series of column chromatography (50:20:1, 20:10:1, 20:10:1) to give a white solid (1 mL). The resulting solution was refluxed for 3 h at room temperature (10:10:1, 10:10:1) to remove the solvent. The resulting solution was refluxed again and dried under reduced pressure to give a white solid (2 mL).

## Results
. Characterization of the P. aeruginosa Strain
The genome sequence of P. aeruginosa strain SM29 strain was submitted to the Genome project and the whole genome sequence of the S. cerevisiae strain SM59 strain was submitted to the BLASTp database. A total of 796 putative introns were identified in the P. aeruginosa genome. The corresponding gene number for the S. cerevisiae strain SM59 strain was 604 (Table 1).

3.2. Unbiased OrthoMCL Primer Primer Analyses
The genome of P. aeruginosa strain SM29 strain was submitted to the OrthoMCL pipeline with an average of 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per site. For the different sites, the P. aeruginosa strain SM29 strain was chosen as the source of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The resulting OrthoMCL gene model was generated and the resulting OrthoMCL gene models are shown in Table 1. The genome sequence of P. aeruginosa strain SM29 strain was submitted to the OrthoMCL pipeline with an average of 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per site.


## Discussion
AML is characterized by mild to moderate leishmaniasis [29], histiocytosis [30], and transient neutropenia [31. Patients with AML, which is commonly characterized by a leishmanial lesion, also present with acute hepatosplenomegaly, hepatotoxic syndrome, and severe renal disease [32].

Myelosuppression due to autoimmune diseases has been described in patients with HIV and/or AD [33]. Patients with AD have a higher risk of developing chronic lung disease, and the risk is increased in patients with AIDS and patients with malignancies [34].

In our patient, a leptomeningeal lesion with a necrotic scar around the right side of the brain was present. However, the patient was not in the early stage of AIDS and did not have a history of leptomeningeal disease. The patient was diagnosed as HIV and the patient's symptoms were mild, but the diagnosis was delayed due to the presence of a pulmonary lesion. The diagnosis was made in the patient's blood and liver and the patient's serum was negative.

Clinical manifestations of HIV-associated AML include cerebral toxoplasmosis (CD4+ cell counts < 100 cells/µl), cerebral toxoplasmosis (CD4+ cell counts = 100 cells/µl), and meningoencephalitis (CD4+ cell counts = 100 cells/µl). CD4+ cell counts are the highest marker for HIV in HIV-positive patients [35]. CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive patients are as high as 60 cells/µl [36]. CD4+ cell counts are widely used to diagnose AML. The CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive patients have been reported to be over 50 cells/µl [37]. CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive patients are over 50 cells/µl, which may indicate a non-specific inflammatory response to infection [38]. CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive patients are also over 50 cells/µl [39]. CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive patients are also over 50 cells/µl [40].

The patient was initially diagnosed as HIV, and his symptoms were mild to moderate. The patient was treated with fluconazole 400 mg orally three times a week.
