## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal disease with estimated global distribution, with cases of infection caused by these basidiomycete fungi currently being neglected in public health attention. The prevalence of cryptococcosis in Asia is low and its environmental exposure to these fungi has little correlation with risk of infection. We report a case of cryptococcosis in a patient who was immunocompromised for one year and was admitted to our hospital due to fever and cystitis. The patient presented with subacutely mild symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and the initial diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis was made without microbiological findings. The patient was treated with the combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine. He survived and discharged from our hospital with a 100% grade of healing.


## Introduction
Fungi are very efficient at evading the host immune defense mechanisms, and yet they can still cause infections. This is true, for instance, for opportunistic pathogenic yeasts, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, which usually cause superficial infections of the skin and nails and can cause severe and life-threatening invasive infections (reviewed in McDermott and Roughgarden, 2018). However, the immunological aspect of fungal infections is still not well understood, especially in the context of the immune system. The lack of detailed knowledge on the molecular, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that govern such complex responses makes it extremely difficult to perform routine molecular and cell biology analysis of such fungi, which has significant implications on the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.

Amino acids are the major building blocks of eukaryotic proteins.


## Methods
SIC is a multivariate analysis of correlated data from independent sample groups, using the general time-series method (GST) and a hypergeometric distributio. The DMM was derived from a seed table of the two yeasts and the seed index was derived from a seed table of the colony. The method has been validated in previous studies (Fries et al., 2015). All data was normalized using the unweighted pair group method (UPGMA) and the one-sample-ratio method.

Protein sequences of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were retrieved from NCBI and converted to protein sequences using the Nucleotide Package. This resulted in a P-value of 0.01. The amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. The tree was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method with a 1,000 bootstrap from 1000 replicates.

The best-fit model for each protein was estimated using the model-based approach. The best-fit model for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis was estimated using the PHYML method. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the MEGA5.2 web server. The model for C. dubliniensis was estimated using the STATISTICA method. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the Jukes-Cantor model. The best-fit model for C. dubliniensis was estimated using the GTRGAMMA model. The best-fit model for C. dubliniensis was estimated using the GTRGAMMA model. The best-fit model for C. dubliniensis was estimated using the GTRGAMMA model. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the HMMER. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the GTRGAMMA model. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the MEGA5.2 web server. The best-fit model for C. albicans was estimated using the Pareto method.

The best-fit model for C. dubliniensis was estimated using the neighbor-joining method.


## Results
The invertose-repeat structure of the invertose-repeat structures has been suggested for fungi, and has also been shown to be important for the yeast morphology [4], [18], [19. In this study, we generated a complex by the conversion of two 5' non-canonical antisense repeats to one 5' antisense repeat, and then constructed a multi-spindle structure by the conversion of the non-canonical antisense repeat to the non-canonical antisense repeat in the trans-transformation (see Materials and Methods for details).

A schematic view of the complex
We first built a complex by the conversion of the non-canonical non-canonical non-canonical antisense repeat to the non-canonical antisense repeat in the trans-transformation. We then constructed a complex by the conversion of the non-canonical non-canonical non-canonical non-canonical antisense repeat to the non-canonical non-canonical antisense repeat in the trans-transformation. The complex was then divided into two halves with an extension in the middle. We then designed a series of trans-transformation mutants that were transformed into the complexes with the first trans-transformation in the trans-transformation, and then transformed into the complexes with the second trans-transformation in the trans-transformation. This latter trans-transformation was completed in 20 hours and was used to generate the complexes. In contrast, the trans-transformation mutants were continuously transformed into the complexes with the trans-transformation in the trans-transformation for two days (Figure 2).

The T. reesei complex
The T. reesei complex was generated by transforming the non-canonical non-canonical antisense repeat into the non-canonical antisense repeat in the trans-transformation (Figure 3). The trans-transformation mutant was then transformed into the complex with the trans-transformation in the trans-transformation, and the trans-transformation complex was then used to generate the complex. The complexes were then divided into two halves with an extension in the middle.

Figure 4 shows the structure of the complex in the trans-transformation mutant.


## Discussion
The whole sequence analysis of the chromosomal sequence showed that the three yeast Pichia species have two completely inverted repeats (Figure 3. The inverted repeats are approximately 1.3 kbp apart from each other and form a 3.2 kbp stretch in a region of approximately 4.3 kbp between the two copies. The first repeat is 1.6 kbp apart from the second repeat, which is 1.6 kbp apart from the second repeat. The third repeat is 1.8 kbp apart from the fourth repeat and is 1.9 kbp apart from the fifth repeat. The sequence of the Pichia species, as a whole, contains a repeat consisting of two inverted repeats and two adjacent repeats that are 2.1 and 1.9 kbp apart from each other. The inverted repeats are approximately 1.2 kbp apart from each other. The repeat structure is similar to the one of the yeast Pichia species, with the inverted repeats of the P. pachyrhizi and P. trichocarpa, and the repeats of the P. mucoides and P. roquefortii, respectively.

The repeat of the yeast Pichia species, as a whole, is approximately 2.3 kbp apart from the second inverted repeat. The repeat is approximately 2.5 kbp apart from the first inverted repeat, which is 1.9 kbp away from the fourth inverted repeat. The repeat is 2.6 kbp away from the fourth inverted repeat, which is 1.9 kbp away from the fifth inverted repeat. The repeat is 2.8 kbp away from the fourth inverted repeat, which is 1.8 kbp away from the sixth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.3 kbp away from the seventh inverted repeat, which is 1.4 kbp away from the eighth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.3 kbp away from the ninth inverted repeat. The repeat is 2.3 kbp away from the tenth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.4 kbp away from the tenth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.5 kbp away from the tenth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.4 kbp away from the tenth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.2 kbp away from the tenth inverted repeat. The repeat is 1.
