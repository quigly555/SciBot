## Abstract
Fungal infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The most common invasive fungal infections are caused by Candida spp., which frequently enter the host through inhalation of microorganisms, bloodstream and organ/surgical debris. The ability of fungi to colonize the respiratory tract is of fundamental importance as they can quickly spread throughout the host. In this article, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the host defense mechanisms against fungal infections and the impact of fungal pathogen on the innate immune system, including our discussion of the role of B-cell immunity against C. albicans in the context of systemic candidiasis.


## Introduction
Furthermore, a combination of two-cytotoxic drugs such as a-pinene and ciprofloxacin have been used to induce apoptosis of . albicans in vitro [31]. However, as we have already shown, these combinations are highly toxic and lead to loss of viability of the host cells [31], [32].

In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic mechanism of the fungal cells, we have used a combination of both biological methods and immunocytochemical methods to study the apoptotic mechanism of the C. albicans cells. We have identified a number of molecular mechanisms which control the apoptotic mechanism of the cells and have shown that cellular death caused by the apoptotic drug is dependent on cell death-related (CDR) genes and the apoptotic protein kinase C (CKC) [31], [32]. CDR genes can be activated by various stimuli, including light, transcription factors, cytokines, or stress stimuli such as DNA damage or apoptotic agents [33]. In C. albicans, the CKC is involved in the activation of caspase-8-dependent apoptotic protein kinase C (Kcs1) and caspase-6-dependent caspase-8-dependent apoptotic protein kinase C (CPKc1) [34]. CPKc1 is activated by different stimuli, such as DNA damage and apoptotic agents [35], [36]. Activation of caspase-8 by caspase-9-dependent caspase-6 caspase-9-dependent apoptotic protein kinase C (CPKc6) results in caspase-9-dependent caspase-9-dependent apoptotic protein kinase C (CPKc9-COP) which then activates caspase-9 and caspase-9-dependent caspase-9. CPKc9-COP is involved in the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, leading to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-9 [37], [38]. CPKc9-COP is activated by several stimuli, such as heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) [39], DNA damage and caspase-8, and activation of caspase-9 leads to caspase-9 activation [40].


## Methods
In brief, MMCCs were grown overnight in YPD, diluted to an OD_600 = .5 and used to inoculate 6 mL of YPD with 1.0 × 10^3 CFU/mL in a total volume of 200 µL. Cultures were incubated at 37°C for 72 h in a shaker at 200 rpm and then OD_600 was measured. The IC_50 values were calculated using the following formula [27]:

The antifungal activity of MMCCs against Candida albicans (MMCC-A) was evaluated by MTT-FITC assay. MMCC-A was cultured overnight in YPD and diluted to an OD_600 = 0.5 and 0.3 mL was added to 10 mL of YPD with 0.1 × 10^3 CFU/mL and the culture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Cultures were then incubated at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm and then OD_600 was measured. The IC_50 values were calculated using the following formula [28]:

The antifungal activity of MMCCs against Candida albicans (MMCC-B) was evaluated by MTT-FITC assay. MMCC-B was cultured overnight in YPD, diluted to an OD_600 = 0.5 and 10 mL of YPD was added to 10 mL of YPD. Cultures were incubated at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm and then OD_600 was measured. The IC_50 values were calculated using the following formula [29]:

## Results
and . albicans (n = 32), 10,768 fluoroquinolones were tested in the same way as for the control strains. The following two exceptions were observed (Table 1): (i) a total of 7,014 fluoroquinolones (n = 7), which were tested in the presence of 1 µM of fluoroquinolone AMB; and (ii) 6,970 fluoroquinolones (n = 6), which were tested in the presence of 1 µM of fluoroquinolone AMB; the number of fluoroquinolones tested in this group was greater than the number tested in the control group. In addition, a total of 2,777 fluoroquinolones (n = 6), which were tested in the presence of 1 µM of fluoroquinolone AMB; and (iii) 6,351 fluoroquinolones (n = 6), which were tested in the presence of 1 µM of fluoroquinolone AMB; the number of fluoroquinolones tested in this group was greater than the number tested in the control group.

As expected, in the presence of a synergistic (p=0.05) or synergistic (p<0.001) synergistic (p<0.001) (Table 1), the number of fluoroquinolones tested was greater than the number tested in the control group (Table 2). A comparison of the numbers of fluoroquinolones in the different groups is shown in Table 3. A significant difference was found in the number of fluoroquinolones in the control group and in the combination group (p<0.05) (Table 3). The combination group had higher numbers of fluoroquinolones in the combination group than the control group (p<0.001).

A significantly higher number of fluoroquinolones (p<0.001) was observed in the combination group (Table 3). The combination group had higher numbers of fluoroquinolones in the combination group than the control group (p<0.001) (Table 3). The combination group had higher fluoroquinolones in the combination group than the control group (p<0.001) (Table 3).


## Discussion
albicans cells treated with an anti-carcinogenic drug (100 mg/kg of human serum) against . albicans ATCC 2069 can restore cell viability in vivo and exhibit protective effects against the pathogen in vitro. In this study, we showed that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum can restore cell viability and effectively inhibit the growth of C. albicans ATCC 2069 in vitro. Moreover, C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum were more sensitive to C. albicans ATCC 2069 infection. In this study, we showed that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum could restore cell viability and effectively inhibit the growth of C. albicans ATCC 2069 in vitro. Moreover, we showed that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum were more sensitive to C. albicans ATCC 2069 infection.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum could be successfully infected by C. albicans ATCC 2069 in vivo. We showed that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum could be successfully infected by C. albicans ATCC 2069 in vivo. However, C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum were more sensitive to C. albicans ATCC 2069 infection in vivo. Therefore, we speculated that the survival of C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum may be diminished in vivo.

The survival of C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum was decreased significantly, but not significantly, when the cells were transferred to 50% human serum. The survival of C. albicans cells transferred to 50% human serum was also decreased significantly, but not significantly, when the cells were transferred to 100% human serum. These results suggested that C. albicans cells transferred to 100% human serum were more resistant to C. albicans infection in vivo.

We also found that C. albicans cells treated with 100 mg/kg of human serum could be successfully infected by C. albicans ATCC 2069 in vivo. However, C.
