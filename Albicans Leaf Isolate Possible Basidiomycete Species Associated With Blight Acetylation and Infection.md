## Abstract

The biosynthetic gene expression of LFA1 was significantly reduced in the resistant strain, whereas the metabolically-enriched strain showed increased activity of LFA2, which was suppressed by the presence of bribonuclease repressio. The expression of LFA2 was significantly higher in the resistant strain, while the metabolically-enriched strain showed decreased activity of LFA1. In addition, genes involved in transport and transport of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were down-regulated in the resistant strain, while the metabolically-enriched strain showed increased activity of the second metabolite biosynthetic gene, pyrin-related protein (PRP), which is a key regulator of transport genes in the resistant strain.

Our results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in B. bilirrinum is made more difficult by the presence of bribonuclease repression and suggest that resistance to bribonuclease digestion in the resistant strain could be related to these two genes. These results provide new insight into the metabolic pathogenesis of this deadly fungal pathogen.

## Introduction
Blight is an important virulence factor of filamentous fungi, since the yeast cells can survive in these conditions for extended periods of time without invasion of host cell. In Blight, the cell wall proteins are known to mediate hyphal growth and act as barriers to biotrophic infection of host tissues, and to protect the fungal cells from host immune system defenses. These cell wall proteins are well known for their capacity to protect the yeast cells from invading host cells. For example, the yeast cell wall proteins of the dimorphic fungi, such as Trichoderma atroviride, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Cryptococcus neoformans, have been shown to be able to protect the yeast cells from the invading fungi, whereas the yeast cell wall proteins of the dimorphic fungi, such as Alternaria alternata, Penicillium marneffei and Trichosporon oleaginosus, are not able to protect yeast cells from the invading fungi.

Blight proteins are also known to play important roles in the pathogenicity of plant pathogenic fungi. For example, Blight proteins can directly inhibit the growth of Botrytis cinerea in the host, and Botrytis braziliensis is able to inhibit the growth of Mycosphaerella graminicola in the host. Blight proteins are also known to mediate the interaction of F. graminearum with a number of other plant pathogenic fungi (Dzou et al., 2005; Diman et al., 2006; Nobile et al., 2009; Lagneau et al., 2010).

The Blight proteins are known to mediate the interaction between Blight proteins and other microbes, such as hyphal cells of the phyllosphere and endophytic fungi (Dzou et al., 2005; Diman et al., 2006; Nobile et al., 2009). In addition, Blight proteins are known to directly inhibit the growth of several phytopathogenic fungi such as Sporothrix schenckii, Sporothrix brasiliensis, and Phacidium toruloides (Lagneau et al., 2010).


## Methods
expansum (Leaf Isolate) or . cerevisiae (Leaf Isolate) in the plant parts of P. expansum was determined by using a multi-well plate assay. Briefly, the prepared leaf of P. expansum was surface sterilized by immersion in 70% ethanol for 2 minutes and then washed three times with sterile 0.85% NaCl to remove the residual liquid. The surface was rubbed gently with a sterile cotton swab to remove any residual latex. The leaf was then rinsed three times with sterilized 0.85% NaCl, and dried at room temperature. The leaf was then placed in a dry ice-bath for 30 minutes. The leaf and the cell pellets were homogenized in 0.85% NaCl, centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. The plate was then placed on ice for 10 minutes. The cell suspension was then removed by adding 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol, and the supernatant was then removed by using a mechanical cell scraper. The cell suspension was then centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was removed by using a mechanical cell scraper. The cell pellet was then washed twice with 0.85% NaCl and then resuspended in sterile 0.85% NaCl. The samples were then poured on a YPD agar plate and incubated at 30°C for 4 days.

2.5. Extraction of Cell-Free Extracted DNA
The extraction of genomic DNA from P. expansum was performed using a modified version of the method of Tenney and Gomes [13] with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 µL of the sample was inoculated onto YPD agar and cultured for 4 days at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 5 minutes), washed twice with sterile 0.85% NaCl, and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then lyophilized for 2 hours at -20°C. The DNA was then extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS^TM Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.


## Results
The fungal cells were then separated by SDS-PAGE and the overall size of the lesions in the <U+0394>pmtA mutant was similar to that of the wild typ.

The <U+0394>pmtA mutant formed smaller lesions than the wild type when incubated in the presence of the AMB solution. The lesions were formed on both sides of the inoculated kernels, and the lesions on the outside of the inoculated kernels were similar in size to the lesions formed by the wild type and the <U+0394>pmtA mutant (Figure 2).

PMT Is Required to Increase the Resistance of F. graminearum to Fungicide and Black Spotting
The MIC_50 values of PMT against a range of fungal strains were compared. The PMT MIC_50 value was 1.0 µg/ml and the PMT MIC_50 value was 4.5 µg/ml for the wild type strain and the <U+0394>pmtA mutant. The PMT MIC_50 value of the <U+0394>pmtA mutant was 4.5 µg/ml and the PMT MIC_50 value of the <U+0394>pmtA mutant was 8 µg/ml for the wild type strain and the <U+0394>pmtA mutant. Therefore, the PMT MIC_50 value of PMT was 1.0 µg/ml and the PMT MIC_50 value of the <U+0394>pmtA mutant was 3 µg/ml.

The PMT MIC_50 value of PMT against F. graminearum was 1.0 µg/ml and the PMT MIC_50 value of PMT was 4.5 µg/ml for the wild type and the <U+0394>pmtA mutant. The PMT MIC_50 value of PMT against F.


## Discussion
Isolate 1 of . rubrum (T. rubrum) was isolated from the same patient and was isolated from the same patient's body fluids. We also obtained Isolate 1 from T. rubrum (T. rubrum) from a patient with acute leukemia. Isolate 1 from T. rubrum (T. rubrum) from a patient with AIDS was isolated from a patient with an AIDS and from the same patient's body fluids. Both isolate were isolated from a patient with a blastomycosis infection and were also isolated from the same patient's body fluids. We found that Isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) was also isolated from the same patient's body fluids. The patient was a patient with an AIDS and had no apparent signs of illness. We also found that Isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) was isolated from a patient with an AIDS. The patient was an AIDS patient and had no apparent signs of illness. Isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) was isolated from the same patient's body fluids. Isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) was isolated from the same patient's body fluids. However, we found that isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) was isolated from the same patient's body fluids. Therefore, we are not sure whether isolate 1 of T. rubrum (T. rubrum) is actually infected with T. rubrum or is a parasite of T. rubrum.
