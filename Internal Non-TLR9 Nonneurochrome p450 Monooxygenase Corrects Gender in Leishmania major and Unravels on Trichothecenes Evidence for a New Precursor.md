## Abstract
Fungal infections remain difficult to treat and are often refractory to standard antifungal drugs. Polyketides have been used as a therapeutic agents in the last century in diverse countries such as Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia to treat fungal infections. However, the exact nature of the chemical composition of the fungal excision needle (ER) is not always clear. This study investigated the composition of fungal excision needle (ER) fragments and determined the optimum needle size and shape to obtain antifungal drugs. Five different polyketides were obtained from six different sources, namely, ceramides, hexospermone, glycosidic compounds, glucosides, and aqueous polyketides. Pyranaldehyde and aqueous polyketides showed the best optimal needle sizes of ~6 and ~12 mm respectively. The minimum effective diameter of each polyketide was determined for ~80% of the ER fragments and ~90% of the helices. The antifungal activity of the five polyketides was assessed by the MTT method. The minimum MIC of amphotericin B and fluconazole for fungal ERs was measured using the microbroth dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration of fluconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated using the broth serial dilution method. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B against C. albicans was found to be >16.5 µg/mL. In conclusion, the antifungal activity of the polyketides was very active against Candida spp., with minimum inhibitory concentration values of >16.5 µg/mL, C. albicans, and >16.5 µg/mL against C. tropicalis and C. krusei. This study provides the basis for developing new antifungal drugs for the treatment of fungal infections.


## Introduction
In contrast, the anti-tumor activity of the anti-tumorin drugs such as TBM and AMB has been shown to be more complex and difficult to eliminate [30] and AMB can elicit a strong antibody response even after treatment with the anti-tumorin drugs [31. In addition, the anti-tumor effect of AMB has been shown to be enhanced by the presence of the hepatoprotective enzyme aminoglycoside [32]. Therefore, it is conceivable that anti-tumor activity of AMB may be a novel target for anti-leishmanial drug development. However, it is unclear whether the anti-tumor effect of AMB is an increased susceptibility to infection, whether this is a consequence of the lack of antibodies to the antibody, or whether AMB is able to rescue the infection.

Thus, although the antibody response to AMB has been investigated in both animal and in vitro models, the anti-tumor activity of the anti-tumorin drugs remains poorly investigated. In contrast to AMB, which is a simple and readily available anti-leishmanial drug, the anti-tumorin drugs are not. In addition, both AMB and anti-neuraparticles AMB and TBM have a relatively low risk-benefit ratio, making them ideal drug targets. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for alternative drug targets for the anti-leishmanial drug development.

We have investigated the anti-tumor activity of the anti-tumorin drugs AMB and TBM to investigate their potential for new therapeutic intervention. We have shown that the anti-tumorin drugs are active against the majority of clinically relevant Leishmania parasites including Leishmania major and Leishmania donovani, including both under control conditions and with resistant hosts. The anti-tumorin drugs are active against most of these strains of parasites including Leishmania major and Leishmania donovani, including resistance to antifungal drugs including fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, and posaconazole. The anti-tumorin drugs are active against most of these strains of Leishmania.


## Methods
. zonatum (S. vinifera) was transferred into a sterile tube containing a polypropylene filter containing distilled water. The tubes were then shaken for 10 min at 20 °C and the number of Fusarium zonatum spores was counted. Fusarium zonatum was inoculated in 1 ml of distilled water. The tubes were incubated at 20 °C for 7 days. Fusarium zonatum was collected by filtration using a plastic filter, and the feces were collected. The feces were removed and washed twice with distilled water, and were then frozen at -20 °C and stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction.

## Results
atroviride genome contains a number of gene models that are predicted to be involved in sexual development and spherule formation, such as a number of genes encoding for the . atroviride type-1 (TAT1) P450 monooxygenases (TAT1) family (Figure 1A), which are predicted to be essential for cell growth in the sexual dimorphic form. In addition, we identified T. atroviride T-DNA sequences with a RNG of 0.01 in the TAT1 P450 gene of T. atroviride. The TAT1 P450 monooxygenases were found in all six T. atroviride P450 (Figure 1B).

## Discussion
However, the gene is missing from the newly sequenced genomes of Unisequence, Unisequence-LRR1, Unisequence-LRR2, Unisequence-LRR3 and Unisequence-LRR. The duplicated gene copy in Unisequence-LRR1, Unisequence-LRR2, Unisequence-LRR3, Unisequence-LRR4 and Unisequence-LRR5 in the Unisequence-LRR2, Unisequence-LRR3 and Unisequence-LRR4 clades are different from those in the LRR1, LRR3, LRR4 and LRR5 genes. Thus, this gene may not be present in any other uniseptate parasites.

The gene copy in LRR3, LRR4, LRR5 and LRR6 in the LRR1, LRR3, LRR4 and LRR5 gene clusters is unique to LRR2, LRR3, LRR4 and LRR5. However, LRR3 gene cluster contains a gene encoding a protein kinase 2 (PK2) and a protein kinase 4 (PKA) gene, which is unique to LRR3. The gene is also unique in the LRR3 gene cluster to the LRR4 gene cluster. In Unisequence-LRR1, LRR3 and LRR4 genes, the gene is missing from the newly sequenced genomes of LRR2, LRR3, LRR4 and LRR5. The gene is missing from the LRR1 gene cluster to the LRR3 gene cluster. However, this gene was present in LRR3 gene cluster to the LRR1 gene cluster. Therefore, the gene may not be present in LRR1 gene cluster to the LRR4 gene cluster.

The gene cluster of the LRR4 gene clusters is unique to LRR2, LRR3, LRR4 and LRR5. The gene is missing from the LRR3 gene cluster to the LRR3 gene cluster.
