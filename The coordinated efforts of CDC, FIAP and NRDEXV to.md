## Abstract
Trichosporon asahii is the major pathogen of invasive trichosporonosis. Current antifungal therapies are either toxic, inefficient, unavailable for treating other invasive mycosis syndromes, or induce host immune response defects. Current therapies can be effectively used to treat invasive trichosporonosis by targeting gene expression, which plays a regulatory role in trichosporonosis. We examined the use of gene deletion and/or bioinformatics editing methods for targeted gene silencing in T. asahii to generate a genome-wide transcriptional inventory of the gene expression profile. We find that this inventory is enriched for genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and amino acids metabolism. We find that the gene expression of T. asahii carries a cross-link with metabolic pathways in a manner that may be related to the pathogenesis of invasive trichosporonosis. We also find a T-DNA insertion in a gene of interest, whose insertion we discuss below.

The genome-wide transcriptional inventory of T. asahii provides an insight into the pathogenesis of invasive trichosporonosis. We determined the genomic context for the insertion in a gene for interest and its possible relation to metabolic pathways. The insertion in the host gene transcriptional repressors I<U+03BA>B and T<U+03BB>B were found to regulate a number of metabolic processes. We also identify an insertion in a transcription factor involved in the synthesis of the alternate form of amino acids in response to oxidative stress.

The genome-wide transcriptional inventory of T. asahii provides an insight into the pathogenesis of invasive trichosporonosis.


## Introduction
The treatment of cancer relies on a strict safety standard and is based on the use of controlled substances, which are often toxic and are toxic reactive with other drugs, which are often non-specific and non-toxic. The use of toxic chemicals is a major problem in cancer therapy, especially in the case of leukemia and malignant lymphoma. Chemotherapeutic drugs are frequently toxic and may induce toxic shock syndrome, which has a significant impact on patient survival. Chemotherapeutic drugs are generally approved for the prevention and treatment of leukemia and cancer, while prophylactic therapy is essential to prevent the development of leukemia and cancer [1]. Moreover, cancers, especially in the case of those with pre-existing diseases, can develop drug resistance, which can bring problems in the treatment and cure of the diseases [2].

Genetic mechanisms of resistance to drug agents have been studied extensively in the last years, with the identification of several mutations that are linked to resistance to the currently used cancer drugs [3,4]. Several genetic factors, including the gene cluster, stress response mechanisms, apoptotic pathways, and other proteins, are involved in the resistance to the drug agents [5-7]. Therefore, it is important to determine the genetic background and mechanisms of the resistance to this drug agent, which can help to prevent the development of leukemia and cancer [8].

Among the factors that contribute to the development of drug resistance are the expression of the drug targets and genetic variations [9]. In the last years, a number of genes, including the efflux pump gene, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene, the promoter region of the most common human target of the drugs, the RAS1 gene, and the MAD1 gene, were identified as being involved in the resistance to this drug agent [10-12]. Recently, several genes involved in the detoxification of drugs and their inhibitors have been identified as potential drug resistance genes, which are responsible for their inhibition potential [13-17]. The inhibition of these genes may be due to the multiple drug-sensitive genes, which have been identified in the genes encoding enzymes involved in detoxification processes.


## Methods
Study design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult HIV-infected patients who were admitted to the Infectious Disease Institute Hospital (IDH) from March 2017 to March 2018 at a tertiary care center in Kampala, Uganda. The IDH is an tertiary care hospital that serves a population of approximately 1.


## Results
The genomes of diverse clades are also rich in shared genomic elements, such as DNA and RNA-DNA transporters and proteins involved in the regulation of cellular processes, cell proliferation and stress responses, and transmembrane proteins (Brancois and Gatt, 2004.

As a key component of the genome assembly and regulation, CDC and FIAP were used to probe the evolution of genome structures and to identify the evolutionary origin of each clade. As these groups have diverged and developed separately and appear to have been closely associated with each other, we used these clades as references to determine whether any of the clades or their members are diverged or distinct. The origin of the clades is currently unknown. As the clades diverged, the origin of the groups was further explored by re-investigation of clades that were located within the same clade. The origins of the clades are described in detail below.

The newly sequenced and newly sequenced genomes of E. cuniculi and B. cinerea were sequenced and assembled separately and sequenced on the same 12-gene sequencing platform. The resulting assemblies were of similar size and resolution as those of the genome assemblies for B. cinerea and the B. cinerea genome assemblies (Fig 3). The genomes of B. cinerea and E. cuniculi were sequenced separately and sequenced separately, but both had the same overall assembly quality. The genome assemblies of E. cuniculi and B. cinerea were similar in terms of overall quality and resolution. The genomes of E. cuniculi and B. cinerea were also similar in terms of resolution and overall assembly quality. The genomes of B. cinerea and E. cuniculi were both similar in terms of overall assembly quality and resolution.

## Discussion
The results presented here showed that the FLI-1 is required for the regulation of PCNA gene expression. PCNA was previously reported to be the locus for PCNA gene expression, as PCNA is a product of PCNA2, which is a serine protease that has been shown to be required for PCNA biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus [26]. In this study, we showed that PCNA regulates PCNA1 gene expression, as PCNA2 is required for PCNA biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. In addition, PCNA3 was identified as a positive regulator of PCNA gene expression. PCNA3 was identified as a negative regulator of PCNA gene expression in A. fumigatus. The overall PCNA3 expression is known to be regulated by PCNA2, which is a serine protease in PCNA, as PCNA3 is a serine protease that has been reported to be required for PCNA biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [26]. The PCNA3 is also involved in the processing of rhamnose, as PCNA is an rhamnose-sensing enzyme that plays an important role in the uptake of rhamnose, which is a key component of the fungal cell wall [27]. PCNA3 is expressed in response to rhamnose, as PCNA3 was identified as a positive regulator of PCNA gene expression in A. fumigatus. PCNA3 is also involved in the processing of rhamnose, as PCNA is an rhamnose-sensing enzyme that has been reported to be required for PCNA biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [26]. The PCNA3 is also involved in the processing of rhamnose, as PCNA is an rhamnose-sensing enzyme that has been reported to be required for PCNA biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [26]. The PCNA3 is also involved in the processing of rhamnose, as PCNA is an rhamnose-sensing enzyme that has been reported to be required for PCNA biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [26].

We also analyzed the PCNA3 in the cell wall of A.
