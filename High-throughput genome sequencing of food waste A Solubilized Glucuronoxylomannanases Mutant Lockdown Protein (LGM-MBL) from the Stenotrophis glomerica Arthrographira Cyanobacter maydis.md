## Abstract
The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a ubiquitous fungus that infects many different plants and produces a multinucleate genome that includes pathogen-targeted toxins. Plants use it as a food source, which is metabolized into high-quality xylanolytic enzymes for essential oils and other products. However, the genome of M. oryzae is very small (~100 kbp) and little is known about the genome content of this fungus. Here we report the genome of M. oryzae strain NRRL 11044, which was collected from the rhizosphere of Oreochromycota, a widespread fungus in tropical and subtropical regions. The genome is enriched for subtropical genes, including two known novel proteins, the first of which was only identified as an a-helical a-helical protein. The second gene is unique to the Rhizospheres and is shared between two separate collections of gene families, RFLP-MDR and RFLP-RFLP. The discovery of the NRRL 11044 genome enables us to analyze the genome of M. oryzae strain NRRL 11044 with a particular focus on the subtropical pathway. The genome of M. oryzae strain NRRL 11044 has a size of only 57.7 kbp compared to the corresponding predicted genome size of 98.4 kbp in predicted in RFLP-MDR analyses. The genome size of M. oryzae strain NRRL 11044 is ~340 Mb, which is ~6 times the genome size of the predicted genome. Finally, the genome sequence of this fungus has never been reported before in Oreochromycota, a group of fungi with a common ancestor ~100 million years ago. Together with previous reports of smaller M. oryzae genomes, our results suggest that the genome of M. oryzae is of a much smaller size than previously reported in Oreochromycota.


## Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells represent a subset of effected-antigen-presenting cells (ESTC) that is distinct from the effector cells that are activated upon antigen presentation. In this study, we first identified the antigenic cytokine cytokine pattern in the NK cells of experimental models of infection and death. The cytokine pattern is dependent on the patient’s cytokine concentration. The pattern of cytokine cytokines in the NK cells of patients was strongly correlated with the number of antigen-presenting cells (APC) in their lymph nodes. The APC subset was found to have increased antigen-specific antigen recognition, impaired T cell killing and impaired NK cell killing. The pattern of cytokine patterns in the APC subset was consistent with the NK cell pattern of antigen presenting cells (NPCs) expressing the antigens.


## Methods

A total of 800-bp long and 6-bp long fragments of Glucuronoxylomannanases were amplified from the genomic DNA of . nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans var. glabrata, A. nidulans var. guilliermondii, A. fumigatus, and A. terreus using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA) as described previously (14). The resulting PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and sequenced by a BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Life Technologies, USA). The sequences obtained were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (accession number PRJEB52806).

RNA-Seq
Three samples of rice plants were selected for RNA-Seq. The samples were treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Germany) to remove genomic DNA contamination and then treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen, Germany). The RNAs were extracted and reverse transcribed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). The quality of the RNA-Seq samples was controlled by spectrophotometry and RNA-Seq software (Applied Biosystems, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a RevertAid™ cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Second strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany). In the first strand cDNA synthesis, a cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the reverse transcriptase-free cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). In the second strand cDNA synthesis, the reverse transcription product was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany). The cDNA was then synthesized using the Reverse Transcriptase-free cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Finally, cDNA was isolated using the random hexamers method.

## Discussion
The results of the RNA-seq analysis show that the presence of GlcNAc and GlcNAc are not significant differences in the number of GlcNAc and GlcNAc of these proteins, as determined by an RNA-seq approac.

The lack of GlcNAc in GlcNAc proteins in the mutant mutant strain was also shown in the RNA-seq results. The lack of GlcNAc was also not significant in the RNA-seq data of the residual A. fumigatus GlcNAc (GNAC) protein in the mutant strain, indicating that the residual GlcNAc proteins in the mutant strain are still intact. This further suggests that the residual GlcNAc may be missing in the mutant strain, as the residual GlcNAc in the mutant strain was only found in the mutant cells. In contrast, the residual GlcNAc in the mutant strain was found in the wild-type cells, which is in agreement with the results of the RNA-seq analysis.

The data presented here is the first example of GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc in A. fumigatus. The main contribution of GlcNAc in the virulence of the fungus is not the GlcNAc itself, but the ability to bind GlcNAc-GlcNAc (GNA) and to utilize GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc (GNAc). In the case of A. fumigatus, the GlcNAc is also involved in host-defense against Candida albicans and the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This is also the case in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans and C. gattii. The GlcNAc is also required for the virulence of the A. fumigatus strains used in this study.

The results of the RNA-seq analysis of the residual A. fumigatus GlcNAc (GNAC) protein showed that the GlcNAc of the residual A. fumigatus strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain. The GlcNAc of the residual A. fumigatus strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain, but with an increase in the expression level.
