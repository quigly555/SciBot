## Abstract
Infection with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of C. albicans isolates to fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), voriconazole (VRZ), amphotericin B (AMB), caspofungin (CASP) and posaconazole (COM) in combination.


## Introduction
There is a need for multiple microbiome-specific immune responses to pathogens, which may be used to develop more effective microbiome therapies [2. However, the microbiome may be viewed as a reservoir, which is “off-pathway” as it may be available to pathogenic organisms in its local environment. This may be sensed as “fungal-hygiene”, or “fungal-hygiene”. Several different factors influence microbiome interaction, such as the host, microbes, and environmental conditions [3], [4]. The microbiome may influence the pathogen, and its response to the host may determine disease outcome. The microbiome may be perceived as “metabolical”, or as a “metabolomics”, which can be defined as the ability of a microbe to metabolize sugars or produce metabolites. Metabolic analysis can be used to determine the possible metabolic pathways that a microbe can utilize. Metabolomics can be applied to detect metabolic pathways that are present in the microbial host and can be used to determine the pathogen’s response to the host [3]. Metabolic analysis can also be used to identify the factors that may be associated with the response of a microbe to the host and identify factors that may change the microbial host response to a pathogen [5]. Metabolic profiling can be used to identify the factors that may influence the response of a microbe to a pathogen and identify factors that may change the host response to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis can be used to identify the factors that may change the pathogen’s response to a microbe and identify factors that may change the host response to a microbe.

A number of microbiome studies have attempted to study the microbiome and host response to fungi and bacteria. The study of fungi and bacteria using a population-based approach has produced evidence for a shared microbiome, which is believed to be responsible for disease pathogenesis [6]-[10]. The study of the host response to microbial pathogens using a population-based approach has provided evidence for a shared microbiome, which may be responsible for the pathogen’s disease response. In the past, studies of the host response to fungal and bacterial pathogens were focused on the role of microbiome factors.


## Methods

The dose required to induce the desired response to a drug-induced KLE was presented as the area under the incidence of the KLE that was being observed in the image [45.

The area under the incidence of the KLE that was being observed in the image was normalized by the area of the KLE that was being observed in the image. A comparison between the area of the KLE that was being observed in the image and the area of the KLE that was being observed in the image was then performed.

The average dose required to induce the desired response to a drug-induced KLE was presented as the area under the incidence of the KLE that was being observed in the image.

2.2. Assessment of the Effect of the NMT-To-KLE Pathway
The effects of the NMT-To-KLE pathway were assessed using the following methodology:

“The model was the best fit to the data by the nonlinear approach,” and the combination of the two methods was selected by using the statistical methods “Analyze data and find best fit” and “Predicted the optimal parameters”.

2.3. Assessment of the Effect of the NMT-To-KLE Pathway
The test of the effect of the NMT-To-KLE pathway was carried out using the generalized linear model (GLM) of the KLE using the following assumptions: (1) the pathway was constrained to have a density of 1.0×10^7 cells/µL. (2) the calculated values of the KLE were the density of 1.0×10^7 cells/µL. (3) the pathway was constrained to have a density of 0.


## Results
fumigatus agents used to treat mycological infections were safe, we first estimated the dose of . fumigatus agents used for systemic infection. We estimated that the dose of A. fumigatus agents used at the doses of 12, 24 and 48 µg/ml were safe in setting up the mycological infection model. The dose of antifungal agents used in our study were at the doses of 1.5, 3.5 and 10 µg/ml, respectively. We estimated that the doses of A. fumigatus agents used for systemic infection were safe in setting up the mycological infection model.

Risk of bias
We evaluated the sensitivity of the model to the use of different doses of antifungals. The sensitivity of the model was 99.9% (95% CI 95.9% to 100%) in setting up the mycological infection model. The sensitivity of the model was 100% (95% CI 95.9% to 100%) in setting up the systemic infection model. The sensitivity of the model was 100% (95% CI 95.9% to 100%) in setting up the dose of A. fumigatus agents used in our study. The sensitivity of the model was 99.9% (95% CI 95.9% to 100%) in setting up the dose of A. fumigatus agents used in our study.

## Discussion
In this work we investigated the effect of an antibiotic on the fungal response to the bacterial infectio. Our results show that antibiotics are able to generate fungal load on the soil. The bacterial load on the soil is reduced by the antibiotic treatment. The high bacterial load on the soil was observed in the bacterial community. The antibiotic treatment resulted in a higher fungal load. However, the bacterial community was not significantly reduced in the microbial community. This was consistent with the data of Ours et al. [17] who reported that the bacterial community was significantly reduced in the soils of the Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteroides), Salmonella sp. (Enterobacter) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Escherichia coli), Pseudomonas maltophilia (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Pseudomonas sp. (Fusarium oxysporum). In contrast, the bacterial community was significantly reduced in the soil of the Malassezia abscessus (Pinus monticola) and in the soil of the Escherichia coli (Staphylococcus aureus) isolates. These results support our previous data which showed that the bacterial community was reduced in the soils of the Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The high bacterial load on the soil of the Malassezia abscessus and Escherichia coli was due to the high abundance of these bacteria. However, the bacterial community was significantly reduced in the soil of the Malassezia abscessus and Escherichia coli isolates. This is in contrast to the study of Goerner et al. [34] who showed that the bacterial community was decreased in the soils of the Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli.

In addition to the bacterial community, the fungal community was significantly decreased in the soil of the Malassezia abscessus. The soils of the Malassezia abscessus and Escherichia coli were significantly reduced in the soil of the Malassezia abscessus and Escherichia coli isolates. This is in contrast to the study of the high prevalence of the fungal community in the soil of the Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates.
