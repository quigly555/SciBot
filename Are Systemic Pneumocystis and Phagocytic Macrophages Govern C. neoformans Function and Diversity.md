## Abstract
The impact of the microbial microbiome on healthcare and patient care has received significant attention in recent years. Microbes are increasingly found in healthcare settings, and have a strong impact on our daily lives. In this article, we focus on the possible impact of the community of non-anthropogenic bacteria living in a healthcare facility, the microbiome that is commonly found in our healthcare setting, and the mechanisms that contribute to its dysbiotic microbiome. We discuss the state of the art in this research, highlight the importance of the microbiome in healthcare, and address the potential of the microbiome in improving healthcare.


## Introduction
Protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the biological processes of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In eukaryotic cells, phosphorylation of target proteins is regulated by conserved and dynamic protein kinases, which are conserved in mammals, and which are found predominantly in mitochondria and other organelles [1,2]. In eukaryotic cells, protein phosphorylation is controlled by a complex protein kinase (PPK) complex that contains the catalytic catalytic (PKA) and regulatory (Pra) subunits [3,4]. The PkaA and PkaB subunits of the catalytic PkaB are orthologous proteins that are located in the same cytoplasmic domains of the catalytic PKA and PKAB and show similar kinetics [3,4]. In contrast, the catalytic PkaA and PkaB are orthologous proteins that are found in different eukaryotic cell types and are related to distinct processes. PkaA and PkaB are involved in protein phosphatase activity, whereas the catalytic PkaB is localized in the catalytic PkaA and PkaB domains [3]. In eukaryotic cells, the catalytic PkaB and catalytic PkaA are required for virulence of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [5].


## Methods
Strains, Media and Growth Media
A. fumigatus strain AF293 was used for fungal transformation. To study the growth and maintenance of A. fumigatus in these strains, a stock solution of 1% (wt/vol) glycerol was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -20°C before use. To measure the formation of the thiobarbituric acid phase, A. fumigatus conidia were grown on solid MM plates at 37°C for 4 days before being harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min. The thiobarbituric acid phase was collected and stored at 4°C until use.


## Results
neoformans CGH-1 is required for . neoformans virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis (Figure 4A). CGH-1 is critical for C. neoformans virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis [32]. Therefore, we reasoned that CGH-1 may be required for C. neoformans virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. We performed a murine infection with a C. neoformans wild type strain. We inoculated C57BL/6 mice with 10^7 C. neoformans cells and observed that C. neoformans CGH-1 was required for virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis. We then used a murine infection with a C. neoformans wild type strain. We observed that CGH-1 was required for virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. We found that C. neoformans CGH-1 was required for C. neoformans virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis.

We then used a murine infection with a C. neoformans wild type strain. We observed that CGH-1 was required for virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. We found that C. neoformans CGH-1 was required for virulence in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis.

CGH-1 is Required for Survival and the Phenotype of C. neoformans in the Pulmonary Lung
The survival and phenotypes of C. neoformans in the lung were examined after infection with a C. neoformans wild type strain, with or without CGH-1 treatment. Mice were challenged intranasally with a C. neoformans wild type strain, and survival and the phenotypes of the mice were compared by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR of the lung fungal burden after 7 days post-infection (qRT-PCR). We found that the mice infected with a C. neoformans wild type strain were significantly less able to survive than the mice infected with a C. neoformans wild type strain (Figure 4B).

## Discussion
The genes involved in energy metabolism, including those involved in NADH dehydrogenase (NADH dehydrogenase) and trehalose metabolism (Trehalose dehydrogenase), are essential for fungal survival in various stress conditions and also are involved in virulence in . neoformans. In addition, we found a putative TF2A transcription factor that regulates trehalose metabolism. This TF2A transcription factor encodes a protein that regulates glucose metabolism in C. neoformans [22], a process that is independent of glucose signaling and likely induced by H_2O_2 and NADH in C. neoformans [23]. In contrast, we found that the gene encoding the homolog of the transmembrane transporter HapX, which is involved in the HapX-Hap complex, is required for viability in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [16]. It is therefore possible that the transmembrane transporter HapX is required for fungal growth in the lung and lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans.

In addition to the TF2A transcription factor, we also identified a putative gene encoding a pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) gene, which is essential for fungal survival in macrophages [24]. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) gene in C. neoformans is involved in the biosynthesis of a pyruvate and pyruvate is then converted into pyruvate and pyruvate is then converted into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria and the peroxisomes [25].
