## Abstract
A 16-year-old male presented to the neurology unit of our university with a 10-day history of headache, nausea, vomiting, and gait disturbance. The patient had a 3-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or gait disturbance for which he was offered oral flucytosine. He had a 1-month history of ophthalmological abnormalities, including the ophthalmological disease ophthalmytology meeting the criteria for infectious agents. The patient was started on flucytosine treatment based on the results of laboratory testing, but his condition deteriorated and his last symptoms were realized several months later. Flucytosine was stopped after clinical response and no systemic safety problems were detected. He continued on oral flucytosine with slight visual effects and no complications. He was started on voriconazole for ocular sensitivity but discontinued due to a headache-like visual loss despite a negative CSF analysis. He had a full neurological follow-up including examination of the cranial and cerebrospinal fluid, measurement of cerebrospinal fluid glucose and blood glucose, and radiological exam and investigations of blood workup. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome after a brain biopsy and heritable lymphoproliferative endophthalmitis. He was treated with voriconazole, and his neurological status improved. However, he had no follow-up beyond the first six months following antifungal therapy, which ultimately resulted in his paralysis, which prompted a neurological referral and neurological examination. Although his neurological status improved, the patient continued to suffer from visual loss for several months. Finally, in March 2019, he was diagnosed with neuro-vascular disease (NVD), which included a left lateral sclerosis-like visual loss suggestive of a leukoencephalopathy. He responded well to treatment, and he was discharged in March-May 2019. He had no other documented neurological disease, and he was not in persistent neurologic or toxicive aspergillosis. After several months of follow-ups, he was finally diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, and his prognosis was good.


## Introduction
It is well-known that the development of an antibiotic resistance is an ongoing problem. Treatment of bacterial infections is a worldwide problem with considerable economic and humanitarian impact, and the effective treatment of infections in the global population is at present the main focus of attention of scientists and clinicians. The development of new antibiotics is an open question that has become increasingly important in the past decades.

With the development of high-tech development, new antibiotics have emerged and become important topics of science and research. Moreover, the development of antibiotics has been based on the assumption that there are no resistance mechanisms, which means there must be some underlying pathogen, which can be used to produce new antibiotics, which can be tested in vitro and in vivo, and which can be easily applied. In this context, it is well-known that the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the bacterial species, namely Streptomyces, has been reported to be a complex phenomenon [1-3]. The mechanism of antibiotic resistance in yeast and other fungi has been reported to be related to the mechanism of azole resistance, which has been observed in the development of resistance to the available antibiotics [4-7]. The mechanism of azole resistance has been associated to different mechanisms, such as multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, which are able to produce new antibiotics through the production of carbapenemases, and resistance to the carbapenem inducers, which are mostly mono- or conjugated with other drugs and can be easily developed into new drugs [8-11]. The mechanism of resistance in Candida species has been shown to be related to the production of new compounds through the conjugation of different antibiotics with antibiotics [12]. The mechanisms of multidrug-resistant yeast and other fungi (e.g., Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have been associated to the mechanisms of azole resistance, which has been observed in the development of resistance to the available antibiotics [13].

The current research work was mainly focused on the discovery and identification of new antibiotics from the soil and plant of natural environments (i.e., in the field), and on the identification of antifungal antibiotics in the soil, which have the potential to be used to improve the antibiotic susceptibility of the fungal pathogens.

## Results
Recently, a large number of studies have reported that the disease of . graminearum is mainly characterized by a virulence-related phytopathosis and limited virulence in the murine model of infection [31]. In this study, we have observed that the pathogenicity of the F. graminearum sp. strain, FGA-1, was affected by a combination of Candida albicans and FgE2, in a dose-dependent manner, when compared with that of the control (Fig 1).

F. graminearum infection is transmitted via direct contact with host organs and is further spread by direct penetration through the cuticle, skin, and blood vessels of the mouse [2]. This is very efficient, and it is very difficult to detect by the naked eye. The local animal hosts can be usually identified by the appearance of a red to green stain, which gives a red pigmented surface of the lesion and confuses the eye and causes an inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissue, which is then easily detected by the naked eye. The contrast between the visual examination of the fungal strain and that of the infected mouse tissue is very important, and it can provide a basis for a successful diagnosis of F. graminearum infection.

For F. graminearum infection, both blood and serum samples were collected. The concentration of Candida albicans was found to be higher in blood samples of FGA-1 infected mice than that of blood of FGA-1 infected mice, and the concentration of Candida parapsilosis was higher in serum samples of FGA-1 infected mice than that of blood of FGA-1 infected mice.

In addition, we have observed a statistically significant difference between the serum and blood samples of FGA-1 infected mice when comparing the wild-type strain with the FGA-1-infected strain, which were also found to be more susceptible to FGA-1 infection [32].


## Discussion

This is the first report of the occurrence of fungal infections in a hospital setting in Taiwan, as well as of the involvement of other patients, including the patients’ blood, urine, and blood sample. These observations were confirmed in several cases of fungal infections in patients with HIV/AIDS, who had no previous infection with fungi. A similar occurrence of fungal infections in patients with C. albicans and C. neoformans was reported in the present study, while in the patients with no previous infection, two cases were reported in the same hospital (Table 1). A retrospective analysis of the patients’ blood and urine samples revealed that the patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and an episode of allergic airway inflammation. This may have contributed to the fungal infection in this patient, which could not be explained by the fact that the patient’s blood was not tested in the current study. The patient’s chronicity may have been due to a chronic infection, which did not cause a fungal infection.

Our findings are in line with the previous reports of fungal infections in patients with HIV/AIDS [13,15]. This phenomenon was confirmed in this study, which showed that an African-American patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and a fungal infection. This may have been related to the patient’s previous exposure to infected soil. This patient’s condition was probably exacerbated by the stress of exposure to other people’s skin, hair, and nails. This may have been the case for several years, since it was the first time he had been exposed to fungal infections, and it was the first time he had been exposed to the fungus from the soil or soil samples. The fungus had been found in soil from soil samples collected in the same area (Mulumbu), and it was not considered to be a fungal infection until a few months later.

The results of this study show that in HIV-infected patients, the clinical signs of infection were more common than in patients with HIV/AIDS, and that the patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and a fungal infection. This was in line with the findings in the patients with HIV/AIDS, and also the findings in the patients with HIV/AIDS.
