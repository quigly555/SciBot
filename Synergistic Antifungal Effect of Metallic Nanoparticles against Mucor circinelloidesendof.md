## Abstract
Fungal keratitis and bacterial keratitis is a rare infection with relatively high mortality. Candida glabrata is the most common cause of fungal keratitis. Due to its rarity and high incidence, it is necessary to know the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment strategies of fungal keratitis and to understand its pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to perform antifungal susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of C. glabrata using SYBR Green Staining Program M38-A1. The susceptibility profile of clinical C. glabrata isolates was performed using the Kirby-Bauer procedure. The antifungal FilmArray® FilmTran was used to detect the presence of C. glabrata. The MIC of antifungal drugs was determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3 methods. The most common symptoms were observed in patients with candidemia: fever, headache, and diplopia. Thirty-six of 36 C.


## Introduction
It can cause infections in immunocompromised and often fatal infections in the urinary tract, especially in those with indwelling devices (Seddon, 2009. The most common form is vulvovaginal candidiasis, caused by the Candida spp., which is caused by the dimorphic fungus, Candida albicans. The other forms are skin lesions and oral candidiasis. In immunocompromised patients, Malassezia can spread from the skin, mucous membranes, and mucocutaneous tissues. The two most common forms are cutaneous and mucocutaneous. Cutaneous candidiasis is the most common form and it is caused by the Candida spp. The skin is most commonly affected. The oral and vaginal mucosal surfaces are the most susceptible.

On the other hand, oral candidiasis is caused by many other fungi, such as Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata. C. tropicalis is the most common yeast, accounting for about 40% of all Candida spp. infections worldwide. The other fungi are members of the Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida krusei genera, including Candida parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. kefyr, with more than 20 species classified according to the number of patients they are diagnosed with (Chapman, 2006; Djoko et al., 2006; Oses-Robben et al., 2015).

In the past, C. tropicalis was classified as yeast by the International Code of Nomenclature, but the Code was not enforced. Recently, the Code was adopted by the European Confederation of Nomenclature and signed by more than 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Germany (Barros et al., 2016). The current Code is considered to be the most effective approach to improve the diagnosis of candidiasis and to develop antifungal drug resistance in Candida spp. The European Confederation of Nomenclature (ECN) and the International Code of Clinical and Laboratory Standards (ICLS) have ratified the EC Nomenclature Standard (ECS) (ECSLT) (Romano and Coates, 2015).


## Methods
. Mucor B. cinerea Isolation and Characterization
Mucor b. cinerea (B. cinerea) was obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology of Federal University of São Paulo (B. cinerea). Mucor b. cinerea extract was obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Antifungal and Antifungal Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Federal University of São Paulo (B. cinerea). The microorganisms were cultured at 37 °C in modified Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) (BD, Brazil) supplemented with 20% glycerol at 4 °C and the pH was adjusted with HEPES at pH 7.0. The preparation was subjected to the same procedure, which was repeated at least three times. The isolated fungi were subjected to phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction. The obtained supernatant was used for the assays. The extracts were filtered, and the concentration was determined by the method described by De Saën et al. [16].

## Results
crassa Ortholog of . cerevisiae

The N. crassa ortholog of S. cerevisiae SREBP, which is involved in the sensing of environmental signals, was recently identified by a BLAST search in the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/genome.cgi). The BLAST search resulted in the identification of a novel ortholog (S. cerevisiae SREBP) in S. cerevisiae, named SreB, based on the phylogenetic placement of this strain and its homolog Sre1 (Fig 1A). BLAST searches were performed using the same protein domain of the ortholog as SreB in S. cerevisiae, as Sre1 is predicted to be a Cys residue in SreB. The SreB ortholog is predicted to be 80% identical to the S. cerevisiae Sre1 ortholog.

The N. crassa ortholog of S. cerevisiae SREBP was recently identified as the ortholog of S. cerevisiae SreB by a BLAST search in the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/genome.cgi). The BLAST search resulted in the identification of a novel ortholog (S. cerevisiae SREBP) in S. cerevisiae, named SreC, based on the phylogenetic placement of this strain and its homolog Sre1 (Fig 1A). BLAST searches were performed using the same protein domain of the ortholog as SreC in S. cerevisiae, as SreC is predicted to be a Cys residue in SreC.

The N. crassa ortholog of S. cerevisiae SREBP is predicted to be a Cys residue in SreC, which is predicted to be a conserved region in the amino acid sequence of SREB (Fig 1B). The BLAST search resulted in the identification of a novel ortholog (S. cerevisiae SREBP) in S. cerevisiae, named SreD, based on the phylogenetic placement of this strain and its homolog Sre2 (Fig 1B). BLAST searches were performed using the same protein domain of the ortholog as SreD in S.


## Discussion
These compounds were identified using the GC-MS analysis and the present report was a qualitative study, which demonstrates the antifungal activity of flavonoid.

2.1. In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Flavonoids
Flavonoids were the most active compound from the present study, with antifungal activity against a broad range of fungi, with MIC values ranging between 0.03 mg/ml and 0.25 mg/ml. It is important to mention that the antifungal activity against Candida species was much higher than that reported for plant extracts [15]. It has been reported that flavonols have an antifungal activity against several fungi, including fungi of the order Phaffomycetales, such as Candida spp., C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and also against filamentous fungi [16], [17], [18]. According to the previous reports, the flavonoid compounds showed an antifungal activity against S. aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium, with MIC values of 0.03 mg/ml and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively [19], [20], [21]. The MIC value of the flavonols for the two species of fungi ranged from 0.03 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml, which corresponds to an activity against an invasive fungal infection, according to the previous report [22].

Flavonoids had an antifungal activity against four Candida strains (C. albicans and C. tropicalis). The MIC value of the flavonols for the Candida strains ranged from 0.03 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml, which corresponds to an activity against an invasive fungal infection. The MIC value of flavonols for C. albicans was 0.03 mg/ml, which is higher than that for C. tropicalis [23]. The antifungal activity of flavonols against Aspergillus fumigatus ranged from 0.03 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml, which corresponds to an activity against an invasive fungal infection, according to the previous report [24].
