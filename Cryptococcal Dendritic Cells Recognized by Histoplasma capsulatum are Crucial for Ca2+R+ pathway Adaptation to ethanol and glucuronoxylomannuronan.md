## Abstract
We previously identified Mucorales as a lineage of the order Mucorales and used molecular genetic tools to assign an epitype to this order. The current genome sequence of Mucor circinelloides (M. circinelloides f. sp. lycopersici) provides an overview of Mucoraceae species. We used genomic data from the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA region to assign the M. circinelloides order Mucorale, and compared the genome sequence with that of the sister order Mucor. The genome sequence closely matched those of M. circinelloides in Sanjakia, but the genome size varied. We also compared the gene content of the M. circinelloides haustoria and those of other orders, and we found a high number of genes that are shared between Sanjakia and other orders. The similarity in the genome sequence between orders and their genome sizes suggests that the genome sizes of Sanjakia and other orders may be similar to those of Sanjakia. We also found differences in mating types among Sanjakia and other orders. The genome size of M. circinelloides f. sp. lycopersici was larger in comparison with the Sanjakia genome, and the mating type of the two was also identified in the genome sequence.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease caused by the ubiquitous pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex. The genus Cryptococcus includes numerous species that can cause disease in humans, including C. neoformans, C. gattii, C. deuterogattii, and Cryptococcus neoformans. The most common agents of cryptococcosis are C. neoformans, C.


## Methods
fumigatus in the lungs of mice was observed by the MDA assay [17] (Supplementary Figure S1) using MDA-FDA medium as the contro. The experiments were approved by the University of Minnesota Animal Care and Use Committee. The experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Construction of the empty vector in A. fumigatus
To obtain a non-coding RNA fragment of the A. fumigatus gene encoding the salt-regulated polysaccharide-binding protein (SCB), we used a previously described vector with the A. fumigatus gp120 ortholog as a backbone [28] in a previous study [15]. The vector (pHS2-3, conserved region in the A. fumigatus genome, pHS1-3, and pHS2-4) was constructed by digesting pHS2 with the A. fumigatus gp120 sequence and ligated with a BamHI-linearized pHS2-3 vector to obtain a vector containing a C-terminal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. The positive fusion PCR product was then transformed into E. coli DH5a competent cells (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) by biolistic transformation. The positive transformants were selected on LB plates containing 1% sheep blood (Werner Bioagents, Jena, Germany) and incubated at 37°C for 7 days. The positive transformants were then isolated and purified by standard methods.

## Results
We have shown here that the dominant pathogenicity pathways are the ethanol-induced, ethanol-induced, glucuronoxylomannuronan pathway, the glucuronoxylomannose-induced pathway, and the glucuronoxylomannose-induced pathwa. These pathways were identified as critical for ethanol-induced proliferation in fungi and the glucuronoxylomannose-induced pathway as components of the early steps of the ethanol-induced pathway.

We have shown that the glucuronoxylomannose-induced pathway, which is involved in the ethanol-induced proliferation pathway, is also required for the development of fungal virulence. To address this, we used an ethanol-induced fungal pathogenicity phenotype (EGP-OE) and a glucuronoxylomannose-induced pathogenicity phenotype (EGP-OE). We analyzed the growth phenotype of the EPE and EGP-OE in comparison to the fungal virulence phenotype of the EPE and EGP-OE. The EPE and EGP-OE strains grew on YM agar medium containing 5% sucrose as the sole carbon source and remained viable for the whole time course (Fig 1). The EPE and EGP-OE strains were able to survive in YM medium for up to 72 h at 37°C and remained viable for up to 96 h at 37°C on YM agar medium. The EGP-OE strain exhibited the same growth phenotype as the EPE and EGP-OE strains, confirming that the EPE and EGP-OE are the two main EPE/EGP pathways that are important for fungal virulence.

Expression of AOX1 is Important for Fungal Colonization and Virulence in the EAE Model
We have shown that the expression of AOX1 is important for fungal virulence in the EAE model of infection. We were interested in studying the effect of AOX1 on F. graminearum virulence. F. graminearum was used as a model for studying fungal pathogenicity and pathogenicity in F. graminearum and the virulence of fungi in this model has been demonstrated previously [14-16]. F. graminearum was used in the study because the ability of F.


## Discussion
These data suggest that the ability of LPS and DPPH to adapt to Ca2+/R+ imbalance has evolved to the yeast’s advantag.

One possible explanation for the positive effects of LPS and DPPH on C. neoformans is that it allows a more stable Ca2+/R+ balance in the cytoplasm and thus plays a greater role in fungal infection. While Ca2+/R+ is the dominant Ca^2+ channel, the ability of C. neoformans to adapt to Ca2+/R+ is crucial for growth, survival, and proliferation in a wide range of stress conditions. These data suggest that the ability of C. neoformans to adapt to Ca2+/R+ is vital to C. neoformans virulence and disease. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that Ca2+/R+ was the predominant Ca^2+ channel in the presence of LPS and DPPH. Moreover, in vitro Ca2+/R+ uptake by the host was correlated with susceptibility to C. neoformans infection, while Ca2+/R+ was not associated with susceptibility to C. neoformans infection in this study. This result is in contrast to the previous report that calcium signaling is required for the fungal survival in the host [29], which also suggested that calcium/calcineurine/H^+-ATPase is a downstream effector for Ca^2+/R+ homeostasis.

It has been previously shown that LPS and DPPH are important for the C. neoformans cell survival in the presence of nutrients and pathogens [33]. We showed that the same factors which are important for C. neoformans growth, survival, and proliferation were also present in the presence of DPPH. While this could be due to the lack of C. neoformans cell wall chitin or to the fact that the cell wall is a biopolymer of chitin and not glucuronan, it is still a possible explanation as to why DPPH did not affect the cell wall. DPPH was also shown to enhance C. neoformans virulence in mice and could be a possible mechanism for the increased virulence of the fungus in the presence of LPS and DPPH.
