## Abstract
Fungal burden in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a proxy of systemic disease. It shows that the prevalence of cryptococcosis is higher in the CNS than in the liver (H) and that treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) and fluconazole can prolong survival. But the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is unknown. We analyzed the cryptococcosis-survival in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients at a 20-year follow-up period.

CSF samples from HIV-infected patients and HIV-surviving patients were analyzed retrospectively.


## Introduction
The genomic basis of virulence is a complex process that requires the recognition of virulence factors as virulence determinants by the host, as well as the action of many different antigens upon their targets. In many infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and various fungal diseases, virulence factors are secreted into the host cells and induce host immune responses. In fact, many virulence factors have been identified in the human host, including toxins, stress-associated genes, drug-mediated cell death proteins, and other virulence factors. Some of these virulence factors are known as pathogenicity factors, while others are known as defense mechanisms. For example, many fungal pathogens have been found to have proteins that activate host immune responses (such as Toll-like receptors, neutrophil extracellular traps, and macrophage killing receptors) and proteins that promote fungal growth and dissemination (such as fungal growth factor, GPI-1a, and mucus kinases) (1, 2).

The most prominent virulence factors in fungal pathogens are the cell wall proteins (CWPs) that are secreted into the fungal cell and are involved in virulence (3-6). Many of the virulence factors found in the human host are homologous to their bacterial counterparts, and their function is regulated by the transcriptional program of the host (7-9). In addition, the cell wall proteins play an important role in virulence of pathogenic fungi. For example, Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, activates the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PkaA) and cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PkaB) and cAMP-dependent MAPK and activates cAMP-dependent MAPK kinase (MAPKK) to phosphorylate target proteins and to initiate the kinases that mediate cell wall biogenesis (7, 8, 9).


## Methods
fumigatus isolate B-1, was obtained from a patient with B-2 infection, as described previously (Vanderhorst, et a., 2010). A B-2 isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus, a clinical isolate of Aspergillus, was obtained from a patient with B-2 infection. A C. albicans isolate of A. fumigatus was obtained from a patient with B-2 infection.

Cell Culture
Gut cells were isolated from the brain of a B-2 patient with B-2 infection as described previously (Vanderhorst, et al., 2010). A B-2 isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium at 37°C. Cell density was determined by a Neubauer chamber and stored at 4°C.

Culture of Aspergillus fumigatus for B-2 infection
Five days after B-2 infection, C. albicans spores were harvested from the brain of a patient with B-2 infection. Spores were cultivated in YPD broth overnight at 30°C and then diluted to a final concentration of 10^6 to 10^8 spores ml^-1. Then, the suspension was filtered through Miracloth and then used to infect 10-day-old C. albicans strains in 100-ml conical tubes (3-mm diameter, Invitrogen). The spores were cultured in YPD broth overnight at 30°C. Then, the suspension was filtered through Miracloth and then used to infect 10-day-old C. albicans strains in 100-ml conical tubes. The spore suspension was then diluted to a final concentration of 1×10^6 spores ml^-1 in RPMI-1640 and used as a control. The fungal growth was monitored every day for 7 days, and colony forming units (CFU) were determined as previously described (Vanderhorst, et al., 2010). The Aspergillus fumigatus strain B-1 was used as the positive control.

Fungal Infections
C. albicans strains were cultured in YPD broth overnight at 30°C and then diluted to a final concentration of 10^5 to 10^7 spores ml^-1.


## Results
pneumoniae, . fumigatus, S. kluyveri, and S. kudriavzevii), the ability of the fungus to transport its spores was determined. Thus, each of the strains was inoculated on plates containing medium (i.e., RPMI or 100 rpm), an agar containing a polypropylene membrane, and a non-vacuolar medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (Fig 4A and 4B). Each strain was grown for 1 h in RPMI or RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum and the spores were isolated at an early time point (0 h) after the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (Fig 4C). The spores were tested for viability after 24 h of growth in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Although we observed no significant difference in the relative survival of these strains when compared to the non-vacuolar culture (Fig 4D), the survival of the strain in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum was markedly lower than that in the non-vacuolar culture. The strain was recovered from the blood at a significantly higher rate than in the non-vacuolar culture, which may be related to the fact that the amount of fungal cells in the blood was significantly higher than in the non-vacuolar culture. This suggests that the strain was able to persist in the blood without immunosuppression.

The ability of the fungus to transport spores is unique to its fungal source. S. pneumoniae spores are transported in the cell-cell compartment through the TCA cycle, but the fungus also uses the vacuolar environment as a storage reservoir for its spores (Fig 5). To test whether the fungus was able to transport spores, we inoculated the fungus in a medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, a condition known to be lethal to the fungus (25). This condition causes vacuolar leakage that causes the loss of the fungal cell membrane. As shown in Fig 5, the fungus was able to transport spores, and the vacuole was not changed (data not shown). These results suggest that the fungus is able to transport spores in the vacuolar environment.

To test whether the fungus was able to transport spores, we added the fungus to liquid medium containing 100% fetal bovine serum.


## Discussion
Although we were unable to analyze the transfer of the strains from the blood into the brain, the amount of Aspergillus fumigatus produced in blood was very high (approximately 30-fold), which was much greater than that in the other fungal pathogens (Table 1. In contrast, the amount of Aspergillus fumigatus produced in blood was not different between patients with C. neoformans var. grubii, C. gattii, and C. gattii strains, suggesting that this fungus may be present in the blood at low levels.

The concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus in blood is not uniform, and most isolates in blood are very high, whereas C. neoformans var. grubii isolates are extremely low, and high concentrations are common for most of the Candida spp. (19). The high concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus in blood could also be due to the high concentration of Aspergillus in the brain, because C. neoformans var. grubii is the predominant fungal pathogen in the bloodstream and can cause brain infection in humans (21, 22). The high concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus in blood may also be due to the lack of a hemolytic activity by Aspergillus, which is a non-specific component of the hemolytic enzyme system in the blood, and the increased levels of Glucuronic Acid, which can also be toxic to the brain (23).

Although the fungal strain used in the study was not highly cultured, it was able to grow in blood for 6 h, and this was the highest concentration tested for fungal bioassay. The concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus in blood was also very high, which was similar to the concentration of Aspergillus spp. in blood (8.98 µg/mL). This concentration is comparable to the concentration that has been found in urine for the treatment of Aspergillus spp. (2.26 µg/mL) (24). The high concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus in blood is also likely due to the ability of Aspergillus spp.
