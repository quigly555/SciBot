## Abstract
The genus Paracoccidioides consists of thermodymorphic fungi that inhabit the leaves of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the hosts of the deadly fungal infection Paracoccidioides lutzii. The fungus is commonly associated with human infections, yet the mechanisms governing host-parasite interactions remain largely unknown. Paracoccidioides species are difficult to identify based on the features of sporocystidia, because sporocystidia are so diverse that it is difficult to identify all potential pathogens in a species by sequence similarity or by nucleotide composition. We present a comprehensive revision of the classification of Paracoccidioides, which is based on the most recent advances in culture methods and analysis of bacterial and fungal proteomes. In this revision, we include P. brasiliensis as the only Paracoccidioides species without an additional member P. lutzii. We show that the type species P. schenckii is newly described and that it is closely related to P. brasiliensis. The genus Paracoccidioides is revised and Paracoccidioides latifolia and P. naukifolia are proposed as additional members of P. lutzii.


## Introduction
A common theme of infections caused by pathogenic fungi is the direct penetration of the host cell by the pathogen itself. Indeed, the proliferation of biofilms, the ability of the fungus to adhere to and invade the surfaces of the host cells, and the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes from infected cells have been implicated as virulence factors [1], [2]. Among these, secretion of proteases is an important virulence factor. Some of the proteins involved in proteolytic processes are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (GPI-AP) and glycoproteins (GPI-CG) [3-5]. GPI-AP are secreted by pathogenic fungi and their mammalian hosts and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of fungal infections [6], [7]. In the human host, GPI-AP are secreted by a variety of organisms, including mammals, insects, and fungi, and their cargo includes a variety of proteins, including enzymes, alkaline phosphatases, hydrolases, and proteases [6], [8]. Some of these enzymes are involved in protein synthesis, phospholipase secretion, secretion of proteolytic enzymes, and the process of cell separation of the cell wall and intracellular vesicles [6], [7].

GPI-AP are secreted by the fungus itself. After the initial release, GPI-AP are transported to the extracellular space by cell-wall-degrading enzymes, the cytoplasmic protease, Pho1 [9]. The cytoplasmic protease is responsible for the cleavage of the extracellular capsule of the fungus. The capsule is the outer layer of the cell wall and the capsule-associated proteins are secreted into the extracellular space by different pathways [10]. The latter route leads to the secretion of secreted proteins and enzymes into the extracellular space. In the former case, the proteins that make the secretory process possible are secreted into the extracellular space [9].


## Methods
The initial inoculum size was approximately 10^6 CFU/mL, and the final inoculum size was 5^5 spores/m. The inoculated mixture was prepared as follows: 5 mL of sterile 1% agar was added to 10 mL of the initial inoculum. The suspension was vortexed, and the contents were poured into a sterile Petri plate and the temperature was kept at 30 °C. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 14 days. For each of the control strains, the inhibition rate (IS) of the fungal inoculum was calculated, and the resulting fungal counts were used to determine the fungal growth rates of the control and Acinetobacter baumannii strains.

In addition, the virulence of each of the control strains was determined in vitro by using the “viable” value, which is the mean of the fungal counts obtained after 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days incubation.

3.3. Pathogenicity of the Acinetobacter baumannii Strains
The pathogenicity of the Acinetobacter baumannii strains was tested on the following C. albicans strains: A. fumigatus ATCC 10231, C. tropicalis ATCC 90028, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. krusei ATCC 6258, and C. glabrata ATCC 22019.

3.3. Pathogenicity of the Acinetobacter baumannii Strains
The pathogenicity of the Acinetobacter baumannii strains was tested on C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei strains, respectively.

3.3. Pathogenicity of the Acinetobacter baumannii Strains
C. glabrata was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar at 35 °C for 7 days. The mycelium was washed with sterile water and then crushed with a mortar and pestle and then transferred to a 2.5 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 mL of Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDA) medium. The mycelium was shaken at 200 rpm for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min.


## Results
In the complex relationship, both bacterial strains were associated with . subtilis, while Acinetobacter baumannii was associated with Bordetella sp. and B. burgdorferi. The relationship between Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella shotgunlla was also explored. In the complex relationship, Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp. were associated with ancillary Bordetella sp., whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was associated with Bordetella sp. (Table 4). The association of Acinetobacter baumannii and Bordetella sp. in a complex relationship was explored further. In the relationship between Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp. and B. burgdorferi, both bacteria were associated with the same bacterial strain, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was associated with Bordetella sp. (Table 4). These results indicate that the bacterial complex relationship between Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp. was not dependent on the strain used.

The relationship between a_a and B. burgdorferi was explored further. In the complex relationship, Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp. were associated with a_a and B. burgdorferi, respectively. The association of Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp. in a complex relationship was explored further. In the interaction between Acinetobacter baumannii and ancillary Bordetella sp., the bacterial complex relationship between the two bacteria was not dependent on the strain used.

3.3. Comparison of Relationship Between Acinetobacter baumannii and Bordetella sp. in a Complex Relationship
A study by the authors demonstrated that Acinetobacter baumannii and Bordetella sp. were associated with ancillary Bordetella sp., whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was associated with ancillary Bordetella sp. (Table 5).


## Discussion
However, the precise mechanism of the biofilm-like morphological transition remains to be determine.

Previous studies of our lab showed that Sporobolomyces and Toxobacillaris formed a biofilm-like structure, and the Trichosporon-like structures were observed in the aerial part of the species. However, the Toxobacillaris were not observed in the aerial part of the species. Therefore, we believe that the biofilm-like morphological transition of Toxobacillaris in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex was not as well characterized as the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex formed in the biofilm-like morphological transition.

Although the biofilm-like morphological transition was only observed in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex, the morphological transition of Trichosporon-like structures was also observed. In the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex, the biofilm-like morphological transition was only observed in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex and the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex. The Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex formed in Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex. Trichosporon-like structures were observed in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex and in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex. However, the morphological transition was not as well characterized as that of Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex.

In this study, the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex formed in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex. However, the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex formed in the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex was not as well characterized as the Toxobacillaris-L. longibrachii complex. Therefore, we believe that the Toxobacillaris-L.
