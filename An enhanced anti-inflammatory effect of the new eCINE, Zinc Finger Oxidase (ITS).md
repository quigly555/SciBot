## Abstract
The genus Sporothrix includes important pathogens of cereal crops, humans, and insects. We used morphological and phylogenetic analyses of LSU, ITS, tef1 and tub2 regions of nuclear rDNA and tef1 to assign the genus Sporothrix to five genetically distinct groups: Sporothrix brasiliensis (Virgo), Sporothrix globulus (Verpa), Sporothrix lindemuthianum (Morden), Sporothrix luriei (Baeomyces) and Sporothrix mitis (Berkhoof). The sporothrix subgenus Sporothrix brasiliensis was established to accommodate this group, and sporothrix gluco-, sporothrix gloeissimum-, and sporothrix voglinidum-like species were designated to distinguish them from the remainder of the Sporothrix species complexes. Sporothrix brasiliensis is a synonym of sporothrix schenckii, a genus characterized in Europe by the enlargement of the head and neck regions. The family Sporothrix brasiliensis is divided into four subgenus: Sporothrix lindemuthianum (in Norway), Sporothrix globulus (in America) and Sporothrix lindemuthianum (in America). The family Sporothrix ichthyosporum is also present in Sporothrix sclerotiorum, and several lineages of this genus are related to saprotrophic and saprotrophic fungi. Sporothrix chensile, known as a synonym of saprotrophic fungi, is found in Europe and has two epitype and a conserved typeface.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for the highest morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS patients and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in high-income countries (WHO, 2017). Estimates suggest that the TB-HIV co-infection accounts for 10-20% of HIV/AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2017) and 10-40% in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2017). Estimates for mortality due to TB in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2017) range from 24.6% to 81.2% (Bicanic et al., 2014), and the WHO estimates for the mortality caused by TB in low- and middle-income countries are in the range of 4.3 to 10.5% (Kumar et al., 2017). Despite the availability of effective treatment, the incidence of TB remains unacceptably high in low- and middle-income countries, with mortality rates up to 40.0% in low- and middle-income countries (Kumar et al., 2017). The global burden of TB has been estimated to be 9.6 million (WHO, 2017), and the WHO estimates for the mortality due to TB are estimated to be 11.6 million (WHO, 2017) and 17.9 million (Bicanic et al., 2014).

The HIV pandemic began in the late 1980s (WHO, 2017), and the HIV pandemic has been driven by two main causes: introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in sub-Saharan Africa.


## Methods
The primers ITS1F and ITS4 were used to amplify the ITS region of the ribosomal RNA gene, and the primers EF1-728F and EF1-986R were used to amplify the EF1-728F region of the ribosomal RNA gen. The PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sent to the Centre for RNA Sequencing and were sequenced. The sequence data have been deposited in the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE138794-GSE13895 [34].

RT-qPCR analysis
The RT-qPCR reaction contained 12.5 µL of 10× Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.25 µL of each cDNA template, and 6.75 µL of Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in a total volume of 25 µL. The RT-qPCR reaction was performed using the LightCycler 480 Software (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with the following thermal profile: 95°C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. The CFX manager software v. 3.1.1 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used to measure gene expression levels.

Intracellular ROS measurement
The ROS level of the E. coli Rosetta sample was measured by fluorescence microscopy at the end of the experiment. Overnight cultures of E. coli Rosetta were transformed with a pMD-18/N-terminal RNA-ligase vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and an equal volume of fresh medium, which was used for the assay. The overnight culture was diluted to an OD_600 of 0.6 in fresh medium, and grown for 2 hours. The cells were harvested, washed, and adjusted to an OD_600 of 0.3 with a 0.5% (w/v) trace metal solution. The cells were then washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS.


## Results
In the present study, three studies of six pediatric patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the CMV group showed no significant differences in the demographic, clinical, and radiological parameters.

Efficacy of echinocandins in the experimental CMV infection model
In the study by Urritu et al. (2015) and Uhrlich et al. (2018), two groups of adults were infected with different levels of CMV and three groups were infected with different doses of echinocandins. Two adults were infected with 100 µg of echinocandins and one of the adults was infected with 100 µg of echinocandins. In the control group, no significant difference in the baseline parameters was observed.


## Discussion
In this study, we identified a novel serotype in the serotype A strain B7, named ABV15, which is genetically different from the parental strain B7, and shares the same haplotypes as the parental strain B7, suggesting that ABV15 is a homozygous strain.

The first serotype of ABV15, ABV15a, is found in the genus Botrytis, and shares the same haplotypes as the parental strain B7, B7a, and A7a. The second serotype of ABV15, ABV15b, shares the same haplotypes as the parental strain B7, B7a, and A7a. The third serotype, ABV15c, shares the same haplotypes as the parental strain B7, B7a, and A7b.

ABV15c is genetically different from the parental strain B7, B7a, and A7a. The results indicated that ABV15c shares the same haplotypes with the parental strain B7, B7a, and A7b.
