## Abstract
Fungal infections are a growing problem in the developing world. In Asia, the prevalence of Aspergillus fumigatus as well as other common causes of fungal infections is increasing.


## Introduction
Ticks are obligate blood-feeding arthropods and constitute the first class of professional arthropods. According to a previous study, there are approximately 16 million tick species in the world. These arthropods are mainly composed of blood-feeding insects that feed on bacteria, fungi and parasites [1]. At least, 10 million ticks are found in the world. Many ticks move slowly and are not actively infected, thus, they are not in immediate danger of extinction. Therefore, ticks are a potential human health problem and an economic burden of almost US$ 15 billion per year [2].

The host immune response against tick-borne pathogens depends on a classical host innate immunity. At first, the microbe-bacterial interaction occurs in the lung. The immune response is activated by the tick-infected cells and triggers the activation of macrophages, neutrophils and other immune cells. Macrophages are specialized innate immune cells that are capable of phagocytosing the microbes and the immune cells [3]. During the process of phagocytosis, the tick cells come in contact with macrophages and other immune cells, which in turn phagocytose the bacteria. Macrophages are then able to kill the bacteria by releasing cytokines, which induce the activation of macrophages. Macrophages then exert their antifungal function by phagocytosis. Macrophages are able to kill the bacteria by releasing cytokines, which induce the activation of macrophages.


## Methods
neoformans ruminants were obtained from D. Jean-Baptiste Bisset (Faculté de l’École Polypética de Marseille, Marseille, France). The infection was performed with a cell suspension of C. neoformans isolate ATCC 32268 and a cell suspension of C. neoformans isolate ATCC 14052. The inoculum was prepared by using 10^6/ml of the C. neoformans strain K1, C. neoformans strain K1. The cell suspension was added to the cellophane sheets, and the paper was placed on a glass slide. After the slide was placed on the glass slide, a thin film of staining solution was applied to the slide and the slide was placed on a glass slide. The staining solution was removed, and the slide was dried in a cool box for 24 h. The dried slide was re-dried, and the film was mounted on a copper grid. The grid was covered with a thin film of glacial acetic acid, and the section of the grid with the highest concentration of glacial acetic acid was viewed by a scanning electron microscope (model JSM-7000; JEOL, Japan).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the MIC_50 (MIC_50 of tested compounds) as previously described [13]. Briefly, the microorganisms were streaked onto solid MM containing 0.5% glucose (Gibco, USA) and 0.005% peptone, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then counted, and the count was the MIC_50 value of the tested compound. The concentration of the test compound was considered as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that resulted in complete inhibition of visible growth. The growth of the organisms was monitored after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, and the MIC_50 value of the tested compound was considered as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that resulted in complete inhibition of visible growth.

For the assays of the antimicrobial activities, the MIC_50 of tested compounds was compared to the MIC_50 of the control. The MIC_50 of the tested compounds was determined as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that yielded complete inhibition of visible growth.


## Results
has been shown to acquire an adaptive immune response against its host cell by expressing a constitutive Toll-like receptor (LTR) of the Toll-like receptor family (TLR1. We found that the transcription factor LTR1 (LTR1-LTR1) is up-regulated in the absence of Cryptococcus neoformans (Fig 2A). Interestingly, the up-regulation of LTR1 was correlated with the abundance of homologous sequences of the Cryptococcus LTR1 gene (Fig 2A). In Cryptococcus, the homologous sequences of the Cryptococcus LTR1 gene were found in the C. neoformans var. grubii clade. Thus, the up-regulation of the LTR1 gene in the absence of Cryptococcus may reflect the adaptive immune response to C. neoformans.

The LTR1 gene in Cryptococcus neoformans may also play a role in mediating host cell damage in vitro and in the host. For example, we found that the LTR1 gene was up-regulated in the presence of Cryptococcus, and up-regulated in the absence of Cryptococcus. Additionally, we found that the transcript levels of the LTR1 gene in the absence of Cryptococcus were significantly higher than in the presence of the fungus (Fig 2B). In Cryptococcus, Cryptococcus-induced DNA damage and cell wall remodeling are associated with the morphogenesis of fungi, such as the fungal pathogen Candida albicans [39]. We found that the transcription factor LTR1 was up-regulated in the presence of Cryptococcus in addition to the yeast form of C. neoformans (Fig 2C). In addition, we found that the transcript levels of the LTR1 gene in the absence of Cryptococcus were significantly higher than in the presence of the fungus (Fig 2C). The transcription factor LTR1 is also involved in the signaling pathway of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans [40]. The expression of the LTR1 gene in the absence of Cryptococcus was up-regulated in the presence of the fungus, and down-regulated in the presence of the fungus (Fig 2D).


## Discussion
This might be a key factor in their ability to evade host immune cells, and is in line with other studies in . neoformans and C. albicans. Studies in C. neoformans and C. albicans have shown that Rim101 is involved in membrane trafficking and inflammation of macrophages (34). Rim101 is also involved in cell wall remodeling, apoptosis, and stress response (35). We have also shown that Rim101 is also required for the protection against macrophages from Cryptococcus neoformans (Fig 3B and 3D). Rim101 is also required for survival in the host immune system, as well as the ability to colonize and kill fungal cells (Fig 4B). Rim101 is also required for the protection against human Cryptococcus neoformans (Fig 3C).

The ability to damage and kill host cells is an important aspect of fungal infections, and the interaction of Rim101 and host immune responses is a key prerequisite for the development of a robust and effective antifungal therapy (26). In addition, the pathogen is a key component of the host defense against the fungal pathogens, including C. albicans and C. neoformans, and the interaction with host cells is a key component of the interaction between immune cells and fungi (27). This has been demonstrated in studies in C. neoformans, C. albicans, and C. neoformans, and also in C. gattii, where Rim101 is involved in the recognition of C. neoformans (6, 25). Rim101 is also required for the protection against Cryptococcus neoformans, but Rim101 is not required for the protection against C. neoformans (Fig 3E). These data are consistent with the observation that Rim101 is required for protection against C. neoformans and C. gattii (Fig 3B). Furthermore, Rim101 is not required for the protection against C. neoformans and C. gattii (Fig 3B). We speculate that Rim101 is required for the protection against C. neoformans, and that Rim101 is necessary for the protection against C. neoformans.

The ability to cause disease in the host is a key prerequisite for successful antifungal therapy, and it is a key determinant of the pathogenesis of fungal infections.
