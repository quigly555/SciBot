## Abstract
The purpose of this study was to determine whether prophylactic administration of 1,25-(OH)2-dihydroxyphenylalanine (PAD) can induce an immune response in macrophages at early stages of infection.

Mouse fibroblast-derived mesenteric lymph node (MLL-L) cells were harvested at different time points after administration of PAD and assessed for inflammatory cytokine expression. The cytokines were measured by ELISA, and associations between cytokine levels and disease-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

PAD treatment induced a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts among all treated mice. However, the relative contributions of PAD and inflammatory cytokine expression at early time points was largely unknown. In mice lacking a CD4+ T-cell marker, PAD treatment induced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, which were higher than those without PAD. In PAD+ treated macrophages, PAD induced the highest levels of CD8+ T-cell numbers.

This study demonstrated the potential of PAD in triggering the immune response in vitro.


## Introduction
Infections with Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are life-threatening infections with mortality rates of up to 90% in immunocompromised patients [1,2]. The gold standard antifungal therapy for cryptococcosis is amphotericin B, which includes flucytosine, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, and 5-flucytosine [3]. However, as the resistance to amphotericin B is present in many species of Cryptococcus, the use of amphotericin B has become increasingly limited. Amphotericin B is available for the treatment of cryptococcosis and Cryptococcus gattii infections, including amphotericin B-retaliatory antifungal therapy [4,5,6]. Amphotericin B is well-tolerated in animal models, but it is not orally bioavailable [7]. The emergence of resistance to amphotericin B and the emergence of drug resistance make treatment with amphotericin B a major challenge [6,7].

The discovery of novel antifungal agents that have antifungal activity is crucial to improve the effectiveness of antifungal agents [8]. A number of antifungal agents have shown activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, including the echinocandins [9,10]. The echinocandins are a second-generation caspofungin and micafungin class of drugs, which have demonstrated anticryptococcal activity [11]. The echinocandins inhibit ß-1,3 glucan synthase and are capable of inhibiting growth of yeast cells, Cryptococcus neoformans, and other fungi [12]. The echinocandins do not inhibit the enzyme, glucan synthase, which is responsible for the formation of the ß-1,3 glucan in the cell wall, and the echinocandins are active against a wide range of yeasts and fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii [13].


## Methods
A preliminary analysis of the MIC and MDA-DHA-2 assays was conducted in order to determine the MIC, MDA-DHA-2 concentration, and MDA-DHA-2 dose-response of . asiaticus strain CEA10 on the antibacterial and antifungal activity of cholinergic and other Aesthetic drugs. Three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative fungal species were tested, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the MDA-DHA-2 concentration were defined as the lowest concentration of L. asiaticus that inhibited the growth of the tested fungal species compared to the control strain, and the maximum MDA-DHA-2 concentration was defined as the lowest concentration of L. that resulted in no growth. The antimicrobial activities of L. asiaticus (at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) and L. asiaticus (at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) were compared in the MDA-DHA-2 assay. The assay was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 (reference document No. CLSI, 2009) for the determination of antimicrobial activity against C. albicans [16, 17].

Tolerance of Candida to L. asiaticus
To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), MDA-DHA-2 and L. asiaticus (at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) were tested against C. albicans ATCC 208821 (serotype A) and C. tropicalis ATCC 10173 (serotype A) in the microdilution test. The inoculum was prepared by mixing 10-fold the amount of a fungal suspension of C. albicans and 10-fold the fungal suspension of C. tropicalis in 50 µL of sterile saline. The suspension was then diluted with sterile saline to the desired concentration. The assay was carried out at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm and 72 h. After the initial screen, the lowest concentrations of L. asiaticus (at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) were tested.


## Results
albicans was evaluated against 12 clinical isolates of . albicans.

Inhibitory Activity of Lintosan Against C. albicans Infection and Survival
All the isolates of C. albicans were cultured in normal medium and the cultures were used to study the susceptibility of the various isolates of C. albicans to Lintosan.

## Discussion

Antifungal activity of various extracts of . tropica against Candida albicans was evaluated using murine models of invasive candidiasis. The antifungal activity of the L. tropica extracts against C. albicans was found to be higher than that of C. glabrata. The authors also observed a low MIC value of the extracts against C. albicans, which was consistent with the results of the study by Wang et al. [11].

It was observed that the extract of L. tropica had a potent effect on C. albicans, with IC_50 values ranging from 3.37 to 8.35 µg/mL against 4-18.7% of the infected cell line. C. albicans was inhibited by the extracts against 4-18.7% of the infected cell line, whereas C. glabrata was only inhibited by the extracts against 6-18.7% of the infected cell line. The IC_50 values for the extracts of L. tropica against C. albicans were 3.38 µg/mL against 2-18.7% of the infected cell line, and 1.24 µg/mL against 4-18.7% of the infected cell line.

The antifungal activity of the L. tropica extracts was evaluated on different fungal strains. The antifungal activity of the L. tropica extracts was evaluated in vitro against C. albicans. The MIC values of the extracts were found to be 3.05 µg/mL against 4-18.7% of the infected cell line, and 1.35 µg/mL against 4-18.7% of the infected cell line. The results indicated that the extracts of L. tropica had a higher antifungal activity than C. albicans.

In addition, the antifungal activity of the L. tropica extracts against C. neoformans was evaluated. The antifungal activity of the extracts against C. neoformans was evaluated in vitro against C. albicans. The antifungal activity of the extracts was evaluated in vitro against C. albicans. The antifungal activity of the extracts against C. albicans was evaluated in vitro against C. glabrata.
