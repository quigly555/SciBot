## Abstract
Wastewater effluents from the treatment plant can represent valuable alternatives to chemical and traditional chemical sanitizers. However, the entire wastewater system must be protected from toxic effects due to the presence of wastes and/or substances that are precursors for chemical and microbial sanitizers. Two approaches were used to study the potential biodegradation of the wastewater compounds from the plant smelting plant. First, the plant smelters exposed crude wastewater to the steam treatment and subsequently treated it with different concentrations of pesticides and microbial extracts. They used different strategies to obtain the wastewater compounds and then followed it up with different methods to assess its methanol and methanol-based quality. The second approach was carried out to evaluate the possible biodegradation of the crude wastewater.


## Introduction

Risk factors for invasive aspergillosis are increasing worldwide (1, 2. Many of the risk factors are associated with the host’s immune status (3). Although early diagnosis and treatment are important, the prognosis of patients with aspergillosis is poor and depends on the location and epidemiology of the disease. The most common risk factor is diabetes (4). In the developing world, the incidence of diabetes is increasing, and the prevalence of aspergillosis is increasing (5, 6). The second risk factor is the use of immunosuppressive agents, including organ transplantation (7-10). The third risk factor is a dysfunctional immune system, especially the immune system of the central nervous system (8).

The incidence of invasive aspergillosis has been increasing in several countries, including Brazil, India, China, Kenya, and Indonesia (6, 11-14). The Indian high-risk group for aspergillosis is the neonates (15, 16). Immunosuppression may increase the incidence of aspergillosis in India. It is estimated that immunosuppressive drugs have an adverse event rate of > 80% (17).

The role of the host immune system in the management of invasive aspergillosis is not well understood. The role of the immune system in the management of invasive aspergillosis is not well defined. Several studies have reported the development of different strategies to control the infection. These include (i) cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (18) and (ii) the use of antimycotic agents (19). Antibodies against cytokines and chemokines (antibodies against tumor necrosis factor, Fas, Fc gamma, and Fc gamma) are a common strategy used by the host immune system to control invasive aspergillosis. These immune cells produce antibodies that recognize the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus as a pathogen (20). The immunological response against Aspergillus is mediated by macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells (21). The neutrophils produce IL-12, which directs the development of granulocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Macrophages produce monocytes, which are characterized by the production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TNF-a.


## Methods
Fungal strains and growth media
C. albicans strains used in this study were listed in Table 1. The strains were cultured in YPD broth at 30°C, 200 rpm, except for C. albicans SC5314 (N-C) [40].

Morphological and morphological studies
Yeast cells (2 × 10^5) were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used to inoculate YPD plates and incubated at 30°C. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were re-suspended in PBS and counted with a hemocytometer.

Growth and growth curve analysis
Yeast cells (2 × 10^5) were suspended in PBS and used to inoculate YPD broth at the indicated temperature. Cells were incubated at 30°C. At indicated time points, the medium was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of YPD. The cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards. After centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The cell pellets were then incubated with shaking at 30°C for 3 h. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Growth curves were performed with a cell counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by adding a solution of 0.5 mg/ml collagenase D (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1 mM of 1,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). The cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml. The cell suspension was then incubated with shaking at 30°C for 1 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and spun down. The cell density was then adjusted to 1 × 10^7 CFU/ml. The cells were then incubated with shaking at 30°C for 5 min.


## Results
%. For most of the patients with diabetes mellitus, the incidence of invasive aspergillosis was less than 3%. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in the United States is estimated to be 5.2%. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is estimated to be approximately 1.7% [30]. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 30%. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is estimated to be 3.8%.

The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is estimated to be 11.6%. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 4%. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 5%. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is estimated to be approximately 6% [31]. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is estimated to be 5.7%. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 0.4% [31]. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is estimated to be 8.6%. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 4.6%. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is estimated to be approximately 9.5%. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with immune deficiency is estimated to be approximately 0.5% [31].

The relationship between mortality and treatment with anti-fungal agents
Infection with fungal organisms (n = 7) and fungal infections (n = 7) were the two most commonly reported cases of fungal infection (Table 1). A previous study of four patients with fungal infection showed that the incidence of fungal infection was approximately 30% in patients with diabetes mellitus [32]. The incidence of fungal infection was estimated to be approximately 10%. The incidence of fungal infection was estimated to be approximately 10% in patients with diabetes mellitus [32].


## Discussion
% [15, 16, 18. The rate of invasive aspergillosis in diabetes patients with diabetes mellitus ranges from 4.2% in the current study to 7.7% in our study.

The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis in this population (6.7%) is comparable to the reported incidence of pulmonary aspergillosis (5.7%) in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (1.7%) [16, 19, 20]. The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis has been reported in the past to be 1.7% in the present study. However, this estimate may be underestimated due to limited data regarding this population. Our study demonstrated that the prevalence of invasive aspergillosis was 1.3% in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 2.3% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and 4.6% in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis is approximately 14.6% in this population.

The incidence of invasive aspergillosis in diabetes mellitus was reported to be 0.5% in the current study. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis is 0.2% in this population. Our study demonstrated that the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in diabetes patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was 0.4% in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 0.2% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis in diabetes patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was estimated to be 0.5% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and 0.4% in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis was estimated to be 0.2% in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and 0.5% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was estimated to be 0.6% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and 0.5% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The estimated incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma was estimated to be 0.8% in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and 0.
