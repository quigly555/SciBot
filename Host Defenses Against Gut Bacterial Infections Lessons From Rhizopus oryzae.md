# Host Defenses Against Gut Bacterial Infections: Lessons From Rhizopus oryzae
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The A- and B-type lectin systems of bacteria and fungi have many commonalities and even more sophisticated antigens. The B-type lectins of yeasts, commensal fungi and some model yeasts have features like a single lectin, which in bacteria is considered to be a single fold, while in fungi is considered to have two folds: adhesion and co-ligand binding. Yeast, commensal fungi and some model yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans are members of the B-type lectin family. We studied the features of the two lectins and the protein they contain in yeast cells and found similarities between them. We discovered that, while the B-type lectin-1 is present in all the major Candida species, it is restricted to the filamentous form, in most of the Candida species. We discovered that the fungal adhesion and binding to a single lectin in yeast cells is not required for full virulence toward human cells. Instead, our results suggest that the B-type lectin-1 is involved in modulating the endocytosis of C. albicans and the subsequent cell invasion of other Candida species. We found that the addition of exogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PL) to the yeast cell membrane promotes the formation of capsular polysaccharides that are degraded when phosphatidylglycerose is incorporated in the non-polar frame of the cell. This finding is important because it points to a previously unappreciated role of cell surface phospholipids in the development of Candida biofilms. We also found that PL decreases viability of Candida biofilms, but not capsule growth. Thus, our work establishes a unique perspective in Candida biology and provides a starting point for developing more effective and efficient antifungal therapies.

## Methods
In this study, bacteria were cultured in fresh brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and cultured for 24 . Cells were filtered through two layers of sterile gauze and the suspension was filtered through sterile gauze to remove the bacterial cells. The suspension was then used to inoculate fresh BHI broth. In this experiment, bacteria were cultured in fresh BHI broth for 24 h. Cells were filtered through two layers of sterile gauze to remove the bacterial cells and the suspension was filtered through sterile gauze to remove the bacterial cells. The bacterial suspension was then used to inoculate fresh BHI broth. In this experiment, bacteria were cultured in fresh BHI broth for 24 h. The bacterial suspensions were then filtered through two layers of sterile gauze to remove the bacterial cells and the suspension was then used to inoculate fresh BHI broth. After that, the BHI broth was added to fresh BHI broth to remove the bacterial cells and the suspension was then used to inoculate fresh BHI broth to ensure that the bacterial suspensions did not interfere with the growth of the fungi.

## Results
In this study, we compared the ability of Rhizopus oryzae to resist and colonize the bacterial bloodstrea. The ability of R. oryzae to colonize the gut was compared to the ability of the protozoa to resist and colonize the bloodstream using the rat model (Figure 4). The R. oryzae inoculum was 3 × 10^6 CFU/g (n = 10) and the protozoa were inoculated in a 3-h time course of infection. In contrast, the R. oryzae inoculum was 1 × 10^6 CFU/g (n = 10) and the protozoa were inoculated in a 1-h time course of infection. The ability of the protozoa to resist and colonize the gut was higher in the R. oryzae inoculum than in the R. oryzae inoculum (2.5-fold vs. 2.5-fold). The R. oryzae inoculum was able to colonize the gut in a 1-h time course, and the protozoa were able to colonize the gut in a 1-h time course, but they were able to colonize the gut in a 2-h time course.

## Discussion
The total number of . albicans genes identified by this approach (98) is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the average number of genes in the bacterial genomes, and the total number of proteins identified in the fungi is much lower than the number of genes identified in the bacterial genomes (Table 2). The proteins identified in the fungi are clearly different from those in bacteria. The putative genes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides are different from those in bacteria.

Taken together, these data show that the fungal C. albicans genome encodes genes required for biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. However, C. albicans is not only a typical human pathogen, but also a typical fungus, which is a typical host for the infection of animal and plant cells. The biosynthesis of amino acids is not only a prerequisite for the survival of the pathogen, but also a virulence trait for the pathogen, which has also been demonstrated in Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii [59]. The fact that C. albicans has two different species of C. albicans and one of them, C. albicans, is a typical human pathogen is well-known for its virulence traits. However, the fungal species C. albicans and C. neoformans have not been extensively studied and their effect on the pathogen is still unclear.

As previously mentioned, the C. albicans genome encodes genes required for biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. However, the genes identified in the fungi are obviously different from those in bacteria. This finding is likely due to the large number of genes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids and the use of genome-wide gene expression profiling. The genetic mechanisms of amino acid biosynthesis in fungi are largely unknown, but it is known that many genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides are differentially expressed in different fungal species [60].

In this study, we have analyzed the C. albicans C. albicans genome and found that the genes that were highly expressed in C. albicans were involved in biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides.
