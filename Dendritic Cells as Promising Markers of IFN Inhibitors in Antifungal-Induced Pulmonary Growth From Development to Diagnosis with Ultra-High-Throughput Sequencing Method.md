## Abstract
The growth of bacteria and fungi in specialized niches of hosts is an ever-expanding resource for our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The pathogenic capacity of fungal symbionts of different hosts can be attributed to their ability to survive and produce and survive on diverse food sources. In this study, we found that the fungal mycobiota of the basidiomycete lichen mushroom Agaricus bisporus was significantly reduced in the inoculated mice. These results provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of the mycobiota of mice infected with the pathogenic yeasts of different hosts and suggest that the fungal community in these hosts was structurally and ecologically diverse.


## Introduction
Several important human fungal pathogens are classified as belonging to the “end-stage” group A helminths. They are not formally classified, but are carefully managed, e.g., yeast-like organisms classified in the class B pathogen, or oomycetes classified in the class C pathogen. Many of them are classified as human-like, but some are pathogenic to other animals, e.g., the yeast-like fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (C.


## Methods
Briefly, cells from . brasiliensis, P. albicans, and P. syringae were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/mL and was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. FIBU were determined by flow cytometry using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). In brief, IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>^Pulmonary-Forming Units (FIBU) were measured by flow cytometry using the flow cytometer chamber (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). In addition, IFN-<U+03B3>^Pulmonary-Forming Units (FIBU) were measured using flow cytometry using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).

In order to evaluate the ability of each method to determine the optimal percentage of fungal cells and the best ratio of FIBU to cell size, we used the CCD method. The study was conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center (UICM) Clinical Research Center. For each method, 3 wells of sterile 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates were inoculated with 0.5 mL of P. brasiliensis suspension (5 × 10^3 CFU/mL) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C, 5 h at 4°C, or 6 h at 37°C. The number of CFU/mL was calculated from the following formula: [(1 - FIBU/FIBU)/(2 - FIBU/cell size)] × 100.

## Results
albicans is conserved in fungi, we compared the transcriptional activation of two genes, . fumigatus MPA1 (Afu6g09200) and EFG1 (Afu3g10200) in response to IFN-induced growth inhibition. MPA1 (Afu6g09200) is a central regulator of innate immune response and, to some extent, of the proliferation and differentiation of murine lungs (19). EFG1 (Afu3g10200) is a cell-related transcription factor that is involved in innate immune response and differentiation of murine lung (20). We used MPA1 and EFG1 to examine their transcriptional activation in the lungs of a wild-type (WT) mouse, and the expression of these genes was quantified in response to antifungal agents, using an anti-IFN-stimulating agent, FLAG. The MPA1 gene was up-regulated in response to IFN-induced growth inhibition in a time-dependent manner, while the EFG1 gene was down-regulated in response to growth inhibition (Fig 2A and B). Furthermore, the expression of both genes was significantly increased in the lungs of a non-human prion, JEC21 (Fig 2C). In contrast, the expression of both genes was not significantly different in the lungs of the WT or the hcp2<U+0394> mutant (Fig 2D). Together, these data indicate that the transcriptional activation of genes involved in innate immune response are conserved in fungi.

IFN-induced growth inhibition in C. albicans alters the composition and composition of the lung lung mycobiota, with a significant impact on lung fungal burden in vitro (6) and the composition of the fungal community in the lungs (7). To determine the mechanism of growth inhibition in the lungs of C. albicans, we examined the respiratory status of the lungs of the mouse by measuring the fungal burden in the airway epithelium (Fig 2E). A significant (p<0.05) increase in the total fungal burden was observed in the lungs of mice infected with the WT (Fig 2E) or the hcp2<U+0394> mutant (Fig 2E).


## Discussion
mansoni in vivo model for the analysis of IFN-<U+03B3> in the pulmonary tissue and the analysis of IFN-<U+03B3> in response to IFN-<U+03B3> in viv. Our findings revealed that IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>+IFN-ß mRNA were decreased in the spleens, which have been shown to be TLR2-dependent and have a reduced ability to modulate IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>+IFN-ß mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo (Sakayama et al., 2014).

The majority of studies have used S. mansoni in vitro to study IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>+IFN-ß mRNA expression in response to IFN-<U+03B3> and to evaluate the function of IFN-<U+03B3> in vivo (van der Howe et al., 2001). In the present study, we used the S. mansoni model in a preliminary study to investigate the role of IFN-<U+03B3> in the pulmonary tissue. We found that the IFN-<U+03B3>+IFN-ß mRNA expression in the spleens, which has been shown to be TLR2-dependent, was increased in the lungs of mice infected with A. fumigatus. IFN-<U+03B3>-stimulated the spleens and spleen of mice and infected mice showed increased IFN-<U+03B3> mRNA expression in the lungs, whereas IFN-<U+03B3>-stimulated the spleens and spleen of mice infected with A. fumigatus showed decreased IFN-<U+03B3> mRNA expression in the lungs (Sakayama et al., 2014). In this study, we used the S.
