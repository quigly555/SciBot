## Abstract
The Aspergillus niger strain UCPJ1 continues to be widely used as a diagnostic tool because of its rapid diagnosis in less than a year and sensitivity and specificity compared with other available rapid flucytosine antibiotics. Previous studies that used nanoparticles and nanoparticles (NPs) to treat Aspergillus infections had very low sensitivity because of the high toxicity of these drugs. In this study, we used nanoparticles with a high-dose fluorescence payload, a polymer of a peptide of a peptideelleted Aspergillus niger glycine.


## Introduction
Disease risk-related factors are diverse and vary depending on the region and climate. They include long-term exposure to a high temperature, presence of soil amendment, exposure to extreme environments, and physical and/or chemical factors. The epidemiology of severe diarrhea is often more complex in tropical and subtropical countries where the temperature is normal or increases above minimum. The incidence of severe acute diarrhea has been reported to be as low as 0.1% in Kuwait (Kuwait is located in the Arabian Peninsula). In Kuwait, the incidence of severe acute diarrhea is less than 2% in Kuwait (Yousef et al., 2011). The annual incidence rate of severe acute diarrhea in Kuwait is about 0.30 to 0.68/kg (Daniels and Jumpponen, 2006). Kuwait is located in the south of the United Arab Emirates, which is mainly situated in the Arabian Sea and in the Gulf of Mexico. It has a tropical climate, and extreme conditions that are favorable for the growth of microalgae. The climate in Kuwait is suitable for the growth of microalgae. In addition, Kuwait is a major oil-producing country and its oil is widely available in Kuwait. The low incidence of severe diarrhea in Kuwait is reflected by the fact that over 80% of the population is exposed to the water of shallow lakes and rivers. In addition, it is estimated that Kuwait is the most humid country in the world (Hulalmi et al., 2017).


## Methods
The experimental design was to create a cross-sectional study with healthy individuals and animals from the same househol. The animals were randomly assigned to three different groups (male, female and animal). The animals were then studied at three different time points (0, 3 and 6 days) and blood samples were collected (n = 6). The data analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The animals were randomly assigned into three groups (male, female and animal). The total number of animals studied per group was 13. The experiment was repeated at least 3 times.

The animals were anaesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and the incision was made using a scalpel. The stomach was removed, the incision was closed and the gut was completely inflated with 0.9% saline solution. The contents of the gut were then removed and weighed. The weight was recorded and calculated as the mean Â± SD of the animals from the groups. The experiment was repeated at least 3 times.

Evaluation of Clinical and Laboratory Standards (CLSI)
The reference standard for all animal studies (CEFME) were the current clinical and laboratory standards, the basis of all published animal work published in the scientific literature and approved by the UK Food and Drug Administration (UKPSEA). The animal procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Committees of the University of Aberdeen (AWER) and the University of Sydney (Australia). The use of animals in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Aberdeen (UAS) under the permit number R-022/2012.

All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Coulter v3.0) of the United Kingdom Animals (UKPSEA) and the UK Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWER) under the Animal Welfare Act 1986 and all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act, 1986 and the German Animal Protection Act, 1986.

Sterile water samples (0.9% saline solution) were taken from the stomach and the exposed salivary glands of the animals were collected and washed with sterile saline solution.


## Results
As demonstrated in Figure 2A, xylT was the only transporter identified to be involved in the development of dietary fiber in human. The xylT gene was over-represented in the xylT deletion strain, and the xylT gene was over-represented in the xylT deletion strain (Figure 2A).

xylT gene expression is induced during host-pathogen interactions
To investigate the impact of xylT on host-pathogen interactions, we tested the expression of the xylT gene during host-pathogen interactions.


## Discussion
Here, we have been able to achieve both the DFS and the DFT in the same fermentation condition. The DFS was obtained in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source in this study. The DFT was obtained in the presence of fructose as the carbon source in this study. Therefore, we can speculate that the use of soluble sugars can be used as an alternative carbon source for the DFS in this study. The DFT was obtained in the presence of lactose as the carbon source in this study. In addition, the DFT was obtained in the presence of glucose as the carbon source in this study.
