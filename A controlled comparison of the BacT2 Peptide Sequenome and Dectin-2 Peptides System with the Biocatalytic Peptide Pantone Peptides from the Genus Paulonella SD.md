## Abstract
The chemodiversity of the phylum Leotiomyceta encompasses various fungi, other fungi, and other eukaryotes. Many of these yeasts are actively colonised by the fungus Candida albicans, a causative agent of superficial and life-threatening infections. In this review, we focus on the colonization and evolution of fungal communities by observing the interaction between host and commensal microbe, and we discuss the interactions between the host and commensal fungi, including the mechanisms by which host cells acquire a virulence-associated phenotype.


## Introduction
The genus Populus belongs to the family of Euchepinaceae, which contains more than 800 species [1]. Although all Populus spp. have been reported to be pathogenic to humans, the most common species are Malassezia spp., P. chrysosperma, and P. sporotrysospermum [2,3]. Aspergillus spp. are among the most common eukaryotic pathogens, with up to 70% of infections occurring in immunocompromised patients [4]. Aspergilloma is a highly prevalent eukaryotic disease, with over 200,000 new cases reported in the last decade [5]. The most aggressive form of Aspergillus spp. is A. fumigatus, which causes up to a 40% mortality rate in the first month of infection [6]. However, A. fumigatus is less susceptible to antifungal therapies, and as such is a susceptible pathogen to antifungal therapy [6]. The clinical manifestations of A. fumigatus infections range from asymptomatic colonization of the lung and skin to asymptomatic dissemination from the respiratory tract to other parts of the body [7]. The important role of Aspergillus spp. in the disease is demonstrated by the fact that the azole drugs nystatin, itraconazole, and posaconazole are most effective in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis [8]. A. fumigatus is an important opportunistic pathogen, and it has been demonstrated that the resistance to the antifungal drugs is due to several mechanisms, including the accumulation of mutations in the CYP51 enzyme, which prevents the enzyme from functioning properly, and the overexpression of the gene encoding an iron permease [8]. In addition, the iron permeases are key regulators of cellular iron homeostasis, as they can increase iron availability to the fungus by inhibiting the activity of the Mfs and Hxl iron-sulphur mutual regulators [9,10].

Iron is an essential micronutrient and has many applications in the biological activity of pharmaceuticals and drugs, including ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors [11,12].


## Methods
B database.

The two major parts of the BacT2 Peptide Sequence were separated. In the BacT2 Peptide Sequence, Dectin-2 Peptide Sequence, BacT2 Peptide Sequence, BacT2 Peptide Sequence, BacT2 Peptide Sequence, and BacT2 Peptide Sequence were added together with the following codons, which are codons previously used to sequence the whole BacT2 Peptide Sequene Peptide Sequence (the codons are used as references for comparison). Thus, for each of the three databases, the two different gene sequences of the BacT2 Peptide Sequence were compared using a codon similarity coefficient of =1.5.

DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from the culture supernatant by using a protocol previously described by Gagnon et al. [25]. For the DNA extraction, 1 g of mycelium was inoculated in 0.45 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (Gams et al. 2007). The mycelium was allowed to solidify at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.45 ml of 0.45 mM potassium phosphate buffer. The DNA was extracted from the mycelium by using a protocol previously described by Gagnon et al. [25]. For the DNA extraction, 1.0 g of mycelium was inoculated in 0.45 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (Gams et al. 2007). The mycelium was allowed to solidify at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.45 ml of 0.45 mM potassium phosphate buffer. The DNA was extracted from the mycelium by using a protocol previously described by Gagnon et al. [25].

Sequence analysis
The final Biotyper software package (version 3.7.2; PAML) was used to analyze the sequence data from the Biotyper database. The parameters for the Biotyper analysis are set as follows: sequence similarity index 0.01; sequence length 2 Ã— 10^-3; sequence variant index 0.001; the median value of the two codons, and the sum of the reads from each of the codons.


## Results
CC-1955 (S1 Table).

The number of BacT2 Peptides produced by the two different Peptide Sporidiomain Peptides from the genus Paulonella SDCC-1955 and the Dectin-2 Peptides System is summarized in Table 1. In the Peptide Sequenome the Peptide Sequences (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR) contain the two major clades (Table 1). In the Peptide System, the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR) contain two major clades, which are represented by the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and the Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR). The phylogenetic tree of the Peptide Sequencing (PS) revealed that the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR) were clustered together in the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR).

The average number of Dectin-2 Peptides per Peptide Peptide (Table 1) and the average number of Dectin-2 Peptides per Peptide Peptide (Table 2) are similar for the two Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR). However, the average number of Dectin-2 Peptides per Peptide Peptide (Table 1) is significantly different for the Peptide Sequencing (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR) (Table 2). The Dectin-2 Peptides System is distributed in two subclades, which are represented by the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and the Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR). The phylogenetic tree of the Peptide Sequencing (PS) revealed that the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR) were clustered together in the Peptide Sequence (ITS) and Dectin-2 Peptides System (IPR).

## Discussion

The phylogenetic position of the present-day BacT2 Peptide Sequenome and Dectin-2 Peptide System has been reported in other species of the genus Bacaruginum [28. However, the phylogenetic position of the genus Bacaruginum has been reported in a rather different species of the genus Bacaruginum [29]. The sequence data of the species in the genus Bacaruginum, including the Bacteroides discoideum and the Bacteroides uvarum have been deposited in GenBank [30]. In this study, the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the new sequences revealed the phylogenetic relationships of these species. The analyses of the sequences of the Bacteroides discoideum and the Bacteroides uvarum revealed two divergent groupings in the phylogenetic trees, one group showed a very close relationship with the Bacteroides discoideum and one group with the Bacteroides uvarum. The latter group is present in the species in the genus Bacaruginum, and there are two new species in the genus Bacaruginum, namely B. cyrenoides and B. trifida.

The phylogenetic relationship of the three new species of the genus Bacaruginum was reported in the two previous studies of the Bacaruginum genus. The two new species of the genus Bacaruginum (B. adiantoides and B. edulisporum) have been deposited in GenBank and are deposited in the Ustilago Conservato subgenus of the Ustilago-Clericostilbida clade, which is also a monophyletic group of the genus Bacaruginum. The phylogenetic relationships of the three new species of the genus Bacaruginum were also reported in the previous studies [31, 32]. However, the results of the phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the new sequences revealed that these species have diverged from the common ancestors of the genus Bacaruginum. The data of the phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the new sequences revealed that the three new species of the genus Bacaruginum have diverged from the common ancestors of the genus Bacaruginum.
