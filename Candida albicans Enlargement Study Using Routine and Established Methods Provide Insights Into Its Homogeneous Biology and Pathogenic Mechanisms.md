## Abstract
There is an increasing interest in studying host-pathogen interactions in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This yeast-to-yeast transition process requires hyphal growth, which is tightly controlled by both the host cell and hyphal hyphal morphogenetic signal transduction pathways. Here we report that disruption of both signaling pathways by RNAi is sufficient to dramatically disrupt the hyphal growth in C. albicans. We also demonstrate that the host cell RNAi pathway is required for both C. albicans hyphal growth and phagocytosis. We also show that C. albicans hyphal growth requires endosomal RNA engagement for hyphal morphogenesis, and this critical step in fungal morphogenetic control is essential for C. albicans infection. These results suggest that RNAi disruptants could provide a novel strategy for C. albicans infection control.


## Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major cause of death in patients with tuberculous meningitis, and it is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the São Paulo State.1,2,3 Therefore, it is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Mtb in its clinical manifestations.

The immune response against Mtb consists of a complex cascade of molecular events such as phagocytosis, cytokine production and activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, among other events.4,5 Therefore, a complex relationship exists between Mtb and the immune system. M.


## Methods
The following preparation was carried ou. For rhamnose endocytosis assay, 1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) with 100 µM of rhamnose and 0.5 µM of dNTPs was added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Then, 100 µl of 2% agarose was added and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The plates were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent organisms, and 100 µl of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was added to each well to determine the amount of rhamnose. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and washed with PBS to remove non-adherent organisms. Finally, 100 µl of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was added to each well to determine the amount of dNTPs. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

In our previous study, we have shown that Rhamnose-induced endocytosis of Candida albicans was more robust than filamentation and endocytosis of C. albicans was less robust than filamentation in the absence of rhamnose, suggesting that Rhamnose-induced endocytosis of C. albicans was also more robust than filamentation [14]. The details of the assays are presented in Fig 1 and S1.

In our previous study, we have shown that endocytosis and pathogen inhibition of C. albicans were more sensitive to Rhamnose than filamentation in the absence of rhamnose, suggesting that Rhamnose-induced endocytosis of C. albicans was also more sensitive to Rhamnose than filamentation in the absence of rhamnose [13]. The details of the assays are presented in Fig 1 and S2.

To examine the effect of Rhamnose on the killing of C.


## Results
We found that the two VNV and VNV genomes differ in their baseline metabolic parameters, and the genetic background of their progenitors and their progenitor isolates was not differen. In particular, the VNV and VNV genomes have the same set of genes that have been shown to be linked to the metabolic functions of other organisms, including plants (e.g. the virescens kinase genes). Our analysis shows that VNV and VNV have a similar metabolic profile (Fig 4).


## Discussion
albicans and . neoformans. This finding has been previously reported in a study of fungal evolution [19]. The fungal genome also contains a significant number of genes involved in various biological processes, such as cytoskeletal reorganization and DNA repair, and the gene encoding the protein kinase C subunit, which is involved in controlling the stress response in C. albicans [20]. The genome also contains genes involved in the biotin synthesis pathway, which is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in Candida albicans [21]. The gene encoding a transcription factor regulator protein (tpsA) is highly expressed in both C. albicans and C. neoformans, which may explain why C. albicans is found in the human oral cavity and C. neoformans is found in the mouse mouth. The gene encoding the virulence factor protein E (cefA) is highly expressed in C. albicans and C. neoformans, which may explain why C. albicans is found in the human oral cavity and C. neoformans is found in the mouse mouth. The genes encoding the major metabolic genes in the fungal cell wall were also significantly up-regulated. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including the glycoside hydrolases, are involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites, such as glucosides, and the biosynthesis of amino acids. These genes are also involved in the metabolism of secondary metabolites. The genome also contains genes encoding protein kinase C subunits, which is involved in the cell cycle and cell adhesion. The genes encoding the kinase A subunits, which are required for the cell cycle, and the activin-1 subunit, which is required for the activation of the cell cycle and cell adhesion, are significantly up-regulated. Genes encoding the phospholipase B subunit, which is involved in cell wall integrity, and the signaling proteins involved in the stress response were also significantly up-regulated. The gene encoding the cell wall biotin synthesis pathway was also significantly up-regulated. The gene encoding the cell wall biotin-binding protein was also significantly up-regulated. The gene encoding the cell wall biotin-binding protein, which is involved in cell wall integrity was also significantly up-regulated.
