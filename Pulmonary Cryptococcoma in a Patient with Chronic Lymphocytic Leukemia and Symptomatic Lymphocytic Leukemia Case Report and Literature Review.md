## Abstract
Autophagy is considered a non-fast-growing process that generates reactive oxygen species during budding. Staphylococcus aureus is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can cause severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. After the growth of the autophagy-promoting microorganisms such as Cryptococcus deuterogattii and Streptococcus pyogenes, their cells become exhausted and the process of autophagy becomes an irreplaceable one. At this early stage, the cells are highly plastic and there is no clear indication for the loss of autophagy-promoting microorganisms in the cells. We report the case of a male patient with severe recurrent pneumonia who presented with persistent chest pain and was found to have persistent blastosputaneous lesions that rapidly healed. The diagnostic approach to the loss of autophagy was demonstrated through the histopathological examination of the samples and the rapid cellular regeneration of the cells after appropriate biopsies. Autophagy restoration therapy may be helpful to treat such patients. The possibility of autophagy being targeted by the resistant C. deneoformans in the treatment of cancer has been suggested by the fact that it is the first cause of lung and systemic infection in human. The present study, therefore, reviews the role of autophagy in preventing or treating pneumonia and discusses the role of autophagy in the treatment of systemic mycoses.


## Introduction
. Kondrashos et al., 2014). In addition, the World Health Organization has recognized the role of Cryptococcus in certain situations. For example, in patients with HIV/AIDS, the infection is a major complication and is often associated with severe morbidity (Strobel and Daisy, 2017).

Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous fungus found in soil, air, and water. The genus Cryptococcus includes over 800 species of yeasts and more than 300 species of molds (Kontoyka and Lendemer, 2017). The yeast species vary in morphology and population density and are found in the soil and on plants, such as banana, puffballs, tilia, and rubus, and in animal and human tissue, such as in rats, dogs, cats, and horses (Ranjard et al., 2015; Kontoyka and Lendemer, 2017; Anand and Prasad, 2018).

The genus Cryptococcus is characterized by the production of the large polysaccharide capsule and melanin pigment, which are essential virulence factors in this organism (Binder et al., 2006; Eveland and Van Doren, 2014; Kontoyka and Lendemer, 2017). The cell wall is a thick layer of chitin, glucuronoxylomannan, and galactoxylomannan, that is thought to be important for the protection against host immune system. Melanized cryptococcal cells have a thick and creamy consistency, resembling a layer of rough brick, and are found in the lung, skin, and central nervous system (Cooper and Joseph, 2002). The capsule is composed of melanin and glucuronic acid, which are recognized by the immune system (Kontoyka and Lendemer, 2017).

The ability of Cryptococcus to adapt to the host immune system is essential for its pathogenesis and infection. However, the cells of C. neoformans are able to adapt to various environmental conditions, including the host immune response. Many studies have demonstrated that the cell wall structure of C. neoformans is highly dynamic and dynamic (Trompich et al., 2015; Kontoyka and Lendemer, 2017).

Melanized cryptococcal cells are found in the cells of both humans and animals. It has been suggested that the cell wall is a key component of C.


## Methods
Controls were treated as adults or childre. Patient age and gender were recorded for statistical analysis. The incidence rate of cryptococcosis was defined as the number of cryptococcal events in a cohort, divided by the number of cryptococcal events per 100,000 person-years [3].

Outcome measures
The main outcome measures were the incidence rate of cryptococcosis, defined as the number of cryptococcosis cases per 100,000 person-years, and the incidence rate of acute mycoses and cryptococcosis, defined as the number of acute mycoses/100,000 person-years. The survival rate of the control group was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test.

The treatment groups (n = 1) were given fluconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine, and the treatment and control groups were given fluconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine and flucytosine plus Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B, respectively. The treatment and control groups were given fluconazole, amphotericin B and amphotericin B plus Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B plus Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B plus Amphotericin B and Amphotericin B, respectively. The duration of antifungal therapy (ART) was given according to the principles of the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of inflammatory diseases [6].

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital of Sichuan Medical University (China). All the participants gave written informed consent.

Statistical analysis
The frequencies and percentages of cryptococcal events, defined as the number of cryptococcal events in a cohort, were calculated from the total number of cryptococcal events per 100,000 person-years. The categorical variables were as follows: survival rate, number of days after ART, and the number of days of hospitalization after ART. The categorical variables were as follows: active therapy, number of days in the hospital after ART, and the number of days in the hospital after ART.


## Results
The data were based on median age of the patient and are summarized in Table . The patient was a 48-year-old male with a mean CD4 count of 86 cells/µL. He had received chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome and cryptococcal meningitis. The patient was immunosuppressed and had a previous history of liver failure and diabetes. He had received an oral administration of oral anti-TNF-a, pro-inflammatory agents, and anti-inflammatory agents for a period of 7 years before undergoing a chemotherapy regimen. The patient was initially positive for cryptococcal meningitis in the clinical setting, and the patient was treated with antifungal agents for a period of 2 months, but died 3 months later.

Cryptococcal meningitis
Among the 91 patients who were followed up for cryptococcal meningitis, the median follow-up time was 48.5 days (range, 0.6-80.9). The patient had no previous history of liver failure or diabetes. The patient was immunosuppressed and was taking anti-tuberculous agents for a period of 2 months before undergoing chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome and cryptococcal meningitis. The patient was treated with oral anti-tuberculous agents for a period of 2 months and died 3 months later.

Laboratory Tumor Tumor Microscopy and Clinical Findings
The patient had normal laboratory values (average, 90.7±23.3 and 90.6±19.1; 95% confidence interval, 95% to 95.6%; P = 0.53) and a CSF culture was positive for C. neoformans, which was confirmed by a culture of Cryptococcus neoformans in the CSF. The patient was an HIV-negative patient and had received an intravenous drug regimen of 100 mg/day for a period of 1 month. The CSF CrAg results were positive for C. neoformans in the patient’s CSF cultures.
