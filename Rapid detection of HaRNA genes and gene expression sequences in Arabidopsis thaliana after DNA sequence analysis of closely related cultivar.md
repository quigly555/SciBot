## Abstract
Diverse pathogens are known to cause respiratory and central nervous system infection and have been reported to cause dementia in older adults. Dementia in children is not well understood and very little is known about the immune system. Our aim was to understand the pathogenicity of several common pathogens and to characterize them in detail. Two proteins, T regulatory and T regulatory neutrophil proteins, were detected in cultures of Candida glabrata, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. They co-stimulated the growth of the pathogens in vitro, but not in the in vivo model. Both proteins were detected in spleen cells of C. glabrata cells, but not in any of the other bacteria tested. In vitro, these proteins were primarily involved in degradation of polysaccharides and included the components of the MHC class I-alpha, the D-linked manganese class I and the glucose and fructose cluster. The levels of these proteins were low in the spleen cells of these pathogens and were higher in the T regulatory neutrophils of C. glabrata and in T regulatory neutrophils of other bacteria. These neutrophils are naturally resistant to killing by A. nidulans, but they failed to induce death in mice infected with these pathogens. Both proteins were also present in the spleen and central nervous system of A.


## Introduction
The genus Pseudovirillanus is composed of five species that cause human skin and mucosal infections in the Americas (reviewed in [1]). The Pseudovirillanus species cause skin diseases in humans, including skin and mucosal infections. They are usually identified by the use of light microscopy and microscopy, while some species have been associated with infections in the lower limbs and extremities (reviewed in [2]). The Pseudovirillanus species are particularly problematic due to the fact that they are the only fungi known to cause human diseases in endemic regions (reviewed in [3]).

In South America, the Pseudovirillanus species have been recorded from the Brazilian Amazon and from the northern Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In Brazil, the species are predominantly distributed in the Amazon rainforest [4] and tropical rainforest regions [5]. In Brazil, Pseudovirillanus species have been recorded from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest rainforest [6].

Pseudovirillanus species have been associated with infections in the skin, in the oral and vaginal mucosa, and in the respiratory tract in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients [7-10]. In Brazil, the majority of the patients with human skin and mucosal infections are male, mostly rural workers [11]. The most common clinical forms are rhinosinusitis, cutaneous lesions, and septicemia [12]. Other infections are seen in immunocompromised patients, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiolitis, sinusitis, and bronchiolitis in AIDS patients [13].

We describe a case of disseminated P. pseudovirulence in an immunocompromised patient, with unusual clinical and radiological features, who presented with unusual skin lesions, and a possible skin abscess.


## Methods
bicolor, . brevicola, S. lichenicola, S. guilliermondii, S. lagerhão)

DNA sequence analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana was carried out using the primer set containing ITS1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAAAAG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') for amplification of ITS and ITS rDNA, respectively. Amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µL containing 10 µL of 10× PCR buffer, 2.0 µL of 1.0 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 µL of 0.5 mM of each primer, 2.0 µL of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 0.25 µL of 1.5 mM of each probe and 1.0 µL of DNA template. The PCR program was as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified PCR product was treated with the FastAP Thermosensitive Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and sequenced using the same primers.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana
For the phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, a combined sequence of 16 genes, ITS, TEF1a, TEF1b, TEF1c, and TEF1d (Supplementary Table S1) was used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. The gene order in Arabidopsis thaliana was given in order of Crop (i) partial sequence and in order of Crop-1a partial sequence (Supplementary Table S2) and in order of Crop-1b partial sequence (Supplementary Table S3) based on the sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana as a member of the Z-family. The gene order was given in order of Crop-2a (i) partial sequence and in order of Crop-2b partial sequence (Supplementary Table S2).


## Results
In order to investigate the expression of the potential regulators of HaRNA gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, DNA sequence analysis of HaRNA gene expression sequences from Arabidopsis plants were performe. HaRNA gene expression analysis indicated that the expression of the HaROS genes was highest in Arabidopsis plants (Table 2).

In order to investigate the involvement of the ROS genes in the expression of HaRNA genes in Arabidopsis, the ROS genes were expressed in several tissues (Table 2). The expression of the HaROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. In fact, expression of the ROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. Moreover, the ROS genes were also expressed in several tissues in Arabidopsis. The expression of the ROS genes was also higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. The expression of the ROS genes was also higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. HaROS genes were also expressed in several tissues in Arabidopsis than in other plants. In fact, the expression of the ROS genes was also higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants.

According to the transcriptomic data, ROS genes are expressed at a higher level in Arabidopsis than in other plants. In fact, the expression of the ROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. Therefore, the expression of ROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants.

The expression of HaROS genes was analyzed in different tissues and tissues with the aim to elucidate the different functional aspects of the ROS genes. The expression levels of the HaROS genes were higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. In fact, the expression of the HaROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. In fact, the expression of the HaROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants.

In addition, the expression levels of the ROS genes were higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants. Therefore, the expression of the ROS genes was higher in Arabidopsis than in other plants.

## Discussion
However, none of the . clarus isolates tested were able to colonize plants from the same geographical region in Arabidopsis thaliana. These results are in contrast to those of Lin et al. [20], who demonstrated that the R. clarus isolates from wheat in China could not colonize plants from different geographical regions in Arabidopsis thaliana.

The clinical significance of the current study is that it is the first report of the isolation of R. clarus in Arabidopsis thaliana. The finding of the R. clarus isolates in Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that R. clarus could be a pathogen for rice plants. The R. clarus isolates isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited significant resistance to the fungicides for different cultivars and plants in the same geographic area. This suggests that R. clarus could be a pathogen for rice plants. The application of these two R. clarus isolates in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown promising results for the development of rice plants.

The successful isolation of R. clarus in Arabidopsis thaliana is dependent on the growth stage of the cultivar and is dependent on the host species and cultivar. However, this is not the case for the other two R. clarus isolates, which showed high resistance to the fungicides. This could be related to the different cultivars and cultivar strains that are used in the production of rice plants. The treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana with azole fungicides showed no significant effect on the growth of R. clarus. These results suggested that R. clarus might be a fungus that is more susceptible to azole fungicides than R. clarus.

The results of the current study suggested that the R. clarus isolates could be a potential candidate for rice plant infections in this region. However, the susceptibility of R. clarus was not influenced by the cultivars and cultivar strains used in the production of rice plants. This could be related to the cultivar and cultivar strains that are used in the production of rice plants. The most resistant cultivar strains in the current study were R. clarus Rv20. The cultivars of R. clarus were very similar to the R. clarus Rv3. The cultivars R. clarus Rv3 and R.
