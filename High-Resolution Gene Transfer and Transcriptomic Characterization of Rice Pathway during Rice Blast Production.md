## Abstract
Meningitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by a virus of the genus virus, including other viruses such as the fungal pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. It is commonly misdiagnosed as an asymptomatic infection, and there is a growing body of research demonstrating the diagnostic utility of imaging and molecular testing of this disease.

To analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HIV-infected patients with AIDS and other diseases, and evaluate quantitative PCR, immunophenotypic, and phenotypic parameters in these patients.

Two hundred sixty patients with AIDS and other diseases were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients (20%) were CSF specimens and included eight patients with AIDS, 10 patients with other diseases, and two patients with cardiovascular disorders.


## Introduction
All these studies show that rice pathways and their associated transcription factors play important roles in the biology of rice plants [13-16. In addition, rice pathways and their associated genes have been extensively studied in relation to host genetics and disease management in grass species [17-21].

The rice pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a widespread pathogen of rice in Asia and the Pacific [22]. It is a cosmopolitan pathogen and is responsible for the disease rot of rice in many regions of the world, including South America [23]. In the United States, M. oryzae is the most destructive agent of rice blast, a disease that causes severe and severe economic losses [24]. The rice pathogen has a complex genetic structure with long and short subunits (meiosis), variable and variable regions (variation), and various serotypes (giant and giant) [25-27]. The genotypes of the blast fungus are divided into two types, long and short subunits [28]. Genes involved in the long subunit (GR) and variable subunit (VS) signaling pathways are regulated by the specific gene expression program. The gm1 and gm2 genes were identified as major components of the genes controlling the gm1 and gm2 genes.

Genes controlling the gm1 and gm2 genes have been studied in a few fungal species, including A. oryzae (Aspergillus fumigatus) [29], A. oryzae (Scedosporium apiospermum) [30], and Magnaporthe oryzae (Pyricularia oryzae) [31]. In A. oryzae, two genes (grat1 and grat2) and a genome-wide transcriptional signature profile of three genes (grat1, grat2) were identified [32]. The GR-mediated gene expression is controlled by the GR-grat signaling pathway and is regulated by the GR-grat2-grat signaling pathway in fungi [33].

In S. apiospermum, an initial study identified a gene (sgr1) containing the GAL1 gene that encodes a transmembrane protein localized at the plasma membrane [34].


## Methods
 2016. Therefore, to identify the processes that regulate gene expression, we have previously used the following quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Huson et al., 2017a,b, 2017a,b, 2017b) method to assess gene expression levels (Chen et al., 2014). The primers and the PCR conditions are listed in Table S1. Primer sequences of target genes and the RT-PCR reactions are listed in Table S1.

The gene expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR (qPCR) using a FastQc^TM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The qPCR reactions were performed in the ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The qPCR reactions were performed in a BioRad CFX384 Real-Time System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The software program SYSTAT software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. The relative gene expression levels were calculated as the fold change over control gene (CX_50) and as the threshold for normalization.

Gene expression analyses were performed by a comparative AUC method using the comparative-C method with the same primers as for the quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) assay. The gene expression levels were normalized to the untreated control. The qPCR assays were performed in a StepOnePlus^TM Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the StepOne^TM SYBR^® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The qPCR assays were performed in the ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).


## Results
The growth and morphogenesis of the fungus was studied in the presence of cycloheximide and the concentration of cycloheximide in the growth medium of the rice blast fungu. The concentrations of cycloheximide in the growth medium of the rice blast fungus were increased from 15 to 250 µM, and from 250 µM to 1000 µM. The concentration of cycloheximide in the growth medium of the rice blast fungus increased from 300 µM to 1000 µM. The concentration of cycloheximide in the growth medium of the rice blast fungus was increased from 1000 µM to 2500 µM. The concentrations of cycloheximide in the growth medium of the rice blast fungus were decreased from 500 µM to 0.

Cultivar Growth and Growth Efficiency
To increase the growth efficiency of the rice blast fungus, the minimum number of larvae was maintained at 50% of growth rate at 4-6 h in the presence of the concentrations of cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µM) and cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µM). The maximum larvae attained a diameter of about 15-20 mm in the presence of the concentrations of cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µM). The maximum larvae attained a diameter of about 30-40 mm in the presence of the concentrations of cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µM). The maximum larvae attained a diameter of about 30-40 mm in the presence of the concentrations of cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µM). The maximum larvae attained a diameter of about 25-40 mm in the presence of the concentrations of cycloheximide (0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.


## Discussion
Tcp1 is the most frequently induced gene in wheat blast disease; Tcp2 is the second most frequently induced gene in rice blast disease; and Tcp3 is the third most frequently induced gene in rice blast diseas. To gain a more detailed insight into the differential induction of genes involved in the wheat blast response, we used the mRNA expression data of Tcp1 and Tcp2. After the RNAi approach, we found that the gene expression levels of Tcp1 and Tcp2 were not different between the three wheat blast pathogens (Fig 3, S2 Table). This is in line with previous reports that Tcp1 and Tcp2 are required for the wheat blast response.

In this study, we found that the transcript levels of Tcp1 and Tcp2 in wheat were not different between the three wheat blast pathogens (S2 Fig). It is possible that the higher mRNA levels of Tcp1 and Tcp2 may be responsible for the higher transcript levels of Tcp2 in wheat. The gene expression of Tcp3 was up-regulated at high levels in the rice blast infection and transcript levels in wheat were significantly decreased. The presence of Tcp3 at a low level in the wheat blast pathogen might explain the difference in the transcript levels of Tcp1 and Tcp2 in wheat during the infection. In fact, Tcp1 and Tcp2 were up-regulated in the rice blast infection but not in the wheat blast pathogen (S2 Fig). The difference between the two wheat blast pathogens might be due to their different evolutionary history. In contrast to wheat, the wheat blast pathogen C. neoformans had two copies of Tcp1, and Tcp2, but not Tcp3. However, the gene expression of Tcp1 and Tcp2 was significantly reduced in the rice blast pathogen C. neoformans. This suggests that the two wheat blast pathogens have evolved differently in terms of the expression of their genes.

S2A Fig shows that the transcript levels of Tcp1 and Tcp2 in wheat were significantly reduced during the rice blast infection, and the transcript levels of Tcp3 and Tcp1 in wheat were increased. The rice blast pathogen C.
