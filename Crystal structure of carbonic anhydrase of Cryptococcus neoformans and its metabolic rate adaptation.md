## Abstract
This biosynthesis could be regulated by a group of genes that are associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolis. The presence of these genes also indicates a degree of specialization within the C. neoformans heterotrophic pathogenicity pathway. This specialization could be reflected by the level of expression of genes whose products may be crucial for virulence in other pathogenic fungi. In addition, the Cryptococcus heterotroph is evolutionarily likely equipped with a gene array that includes enzymes for the C1H/IP-H-palmitoylation pathway, the dimericin-like protein Slt2, and other related proteins. These genes may be involved in the higher proportion of mycelial growth in vivo than in the mycelial-scale in vitro. Importantly, the C. neoformans genome encodes several genes that are putatively involved in the interaction with the host, such as the glover-like phosphorylceramide biosynthetic gene Wsc1. These findings offer insights into the role of genes in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans, which otherwise remains poorly understood in yeast.

Cryptococcus neoformans is an important fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we show that the C. neoformans genome encodes a number of genes that may be involved in the interaction with the host. We also show that the genes encoded by the genome are potentially involved in cell signaling pathways, especially those for cellular organization and metabolism. These data are important because they direct a public health interest beyond mere survival of the fungus and into important human health topics, such as vaccination and the prevention of human-pathogenic fungi from future spread in other countries.

IMPORTANCE The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a deadly opportunistic pathogen that causes ~400,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the immunocompromised host, the protective mantle appears to play very important roles in the host defense against this fungus. The ability of the fungus to adapt to stressful conditions in the lung after exposure to antifungal agents has been related to defects in the fungus cell wall structure and therefore to defects in virulence. We now show that the cell wall is largely intact in the lungs of C. neoformans infected mice. The two most abundant cell wall polysaccharides in the C.


## Introduction
The N-terminal amino-terminal and the C-terminal residues of the anhydrase are homologous to the key enzymes of the cysteine-lysine complex (2-5. The cysteine is one of the key enzymes in the step-wise oxidation of the large substrate protein (6). In the <U+0394>cysteine pathway, cysteine is converted into cysteine in the form of cysteine desulfurase (CysC) by the action of a cysteine desulfurase (CysD) and subsequent catalysis. Cysteine desulfurase in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway is the key enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins in the organism, which are crucial for the intracellular survival of fungal cells (7, 8).

The Cyst-Like Glycine Resistant (CGLR) gene of Cryptococcus neoformans (Cng) encodes for a protein named Cyst-Like Glycine Resistant (CGLR) (9). The CGLR gene belongs to the family of cyst-like transmembrane helicase genes (10). The CGLR gene is characterized by a C-terminal cleistothecene binding domain and a C-terminal cysteine desulfurase domain. In addition, CGLR has a C-terminal dehydrogenase domain (CDS) and a C-terminal amino-terminal acid desulfurase domain (11).

Cg is a member of the CGLR family and was isolated from a rat kidney kidney exoskeleton. Cg is synthesized by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a functional enzyme and, in addition to its use as a membrane substrate, Cg can also be synthesized from lysine in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway (12). Cyst-Like Glycine Resistant (CGLR) gene is currently expressed in mouse models of infection and disease. The CGLR gene was previously identified in the human kidney exoskeleton and demonstrated to be expressed as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Cg1 and Cg2 (13, 14).


## Methods
In brief, the pH of the cultures was adjusted to .5 by adding 1 M NaOH. The cells were incubated at 37°C and harvested when the pH reached 7.5. After the cell harvest, the cells were re-suspended in distilled water and transferred to a clean dish (15 ml) for 48 h at a density of 1.0 × 10^6 cells/ml. The cells were then washed three times with distilled water and then re-suspended in distilled water to 1.0 × 10^6 cells/ml. The cells were then filtered through a 0.45 µm nylon filter to remove non-polar substrates. The cell suspensions were then used for the subsequent experiments. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

2.5. Hydrophilic Structure Analysis
The hydrophilic structure of the chitosan-methionine complex was analysed by the structure-based approach. In brief, the lipid and membrane of the chitosan-methionine complex were analysed by the DIC-MS method, as described by Wilson et al. [7]. The membranes were analysed on a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD). The data-dependent acquisition of the spectra was performed on a capillary column (30 m × 250 mm × 0.25 µm, Thermo Scientific) in a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at a temperature of 25°C and 25°C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was controlled by a software program (version 3.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The spectra were recorded on a JASCO ESI-MS^E spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operated at a refractive index of 0.05. The peptide ions were selected according to the following mass properties: acetic, tertiary, permethylethyl, polydimethylsiloxane, and acetic acid.

2.6. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of chitosan-methionine complex was tested against various strains of C. neoformans. Briefly, the test strain was grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28°C for 3 days.


## Results

The putative anhydrase is a fungal type 1 (. neoformans) and is predicted to produce an anhydrous hemoglobin (Hb) from the hemoglobinic acid (HBA) pool of hemocytes. The hemoglobinic acid (HBA) pool is an important source of hemoglobin in the blood and is a source of pigment, pigments, and metabolites, as well as the fuel for many other functions, such as respiration, DNA repair, and growth in the presence of nitrogen or nitrogen starvation [3,8,9,11]. The hemoglobinic acid (HBA) is an essential component of the hemoglobinic acid biosynthetic pathway in C. neoformans [7,10]. The most important aspartyl proteases in the hemoglobinic acid biosynthetic pathway are the hemoglobinic acid-dependent cyclic anhydrase (Hbr) and the hemoglobinic acid-dependent cyclic anhydrase (Hbs) [7,10,12]. In C. neoformans, the Hbr and Hbs are classified as ß-actin (Hsp70), ß-actin (Hsp90), and ß-actin (Hsp90) proteins respectively [13,14]. The Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins were characterized in the present study. These two proteins are essential for the production of the hemoglobinic acid pathway. The Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins are located in the same ribosome as the Hbs, as shown by their high sequence similarity. The Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins have a conserved alpha-helix structure with the Hbs having a C-terminal signal sequence, similar to the cysteine in the amino acid sequence of the Hbs. The Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins are highly similar in structure to those of the Hbs, with a single cysteine or a single pyridine. The Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins share a similar DBD with the S. cerevisiae anhydrase (S. cerevisiae HBA) and the Hbs, with a notable DBD of about two residues. The S. cerevisiae Hbs are predicted to be expressed in the nucleus, which is typical of a S. cerevisiae HBA [14].

Taken together, these results indicate that the S.


## Discussion
 h^-1. It also showed that the formation of the enzyme-catalyzed C. neoformans alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) is a very efficient inhibitor of fungal alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) in a time-dependent manner [11]. Moreover, the structure of C. neoformans alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was highly conserved among the taxa and within the fungal genomes of A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and C. gattii, while the C. albicans alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) is a very efficient inhibitor of fungal alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) in a time-dependent manner [12]. In A. nidulans, aCPDH was the only enzyme in the enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) in a time-dependent manner [13]. However, the C. albicans alpha-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was the only enzyme in the enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) in a time-dependent manner [14]. The enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was effective against A. fumigatus at a concentration of 150 µg/mL [15]. However, the enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was ineffective against A. fumigatus at a concentration of 200 µg/mL [16]. The enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was efficient against A. fumigatus at a concentration of 200 µg/mL [17]. The enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of the enzyme beta-ketoglutarate dehydratase (aCPDH) was effective against A. fumigatus at a concentration of 200 µg/mL [18].
