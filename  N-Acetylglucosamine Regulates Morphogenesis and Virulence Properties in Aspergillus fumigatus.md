## Abstract
Fungal diversity is continuously monitored by culturing melanized conidia in living tissues, which increase their survival in the host. The use of melanized conidia has been associated to virulence traits, but the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. We report that the fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis can simultaneously preserve host fitness and transform sporulation into virulent blastospores that invade a wide range of hosts and tumors.

Melanized conidia are the primary source of infectious propagules and the primary tissue targets for invasive aspergillosis (IA), one of the most lethal fungal diseases. Melanized conidia can be killed by the appropriate antimicrobial drugs, but how these defenses are maintained in the presence of fungal life-threatening fungal pathogens remains largely unknown.

We discovered that a gene that encodes a melanized melanized conidia pathogenicity factor, PbC, could be expressed in P. brasiliensis. We generated a conditional promoter (CCG1) in P. brasiliensis and demonstrated its requirement for conidial viability in vitro. PolCer expression in the mutant melanized conidia resulted in complete disruption of the integrity of the conidial surface, a defect that was mainly responsible for cell wall sheen loss. In addition, we demonstrated a paucity of conidiation in the conidial spore phenotype as we failed to induce the death of conidia when the mutants were grown in the non-penetrating media without penetration of microorganisms into the tumor host. Furthermore, we failed to induce cytotoxicity in an ELISPOT with the same conditional promoter.


## Introduction
Fungal pathogens, including the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with impaired immunity [1-4]. Although the importance of host immunity in the control of Candida infections is well established, there has been a decline in the ability of the immune system to control infection caused by C. albicans [5-7].


## Methods

Growth of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia on PDA was assayed in liquid PDA medium by the following method [14. The mycelia of the fungi were collected by centrifugation at 5000×g for 5 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. The mycelia were collected by centrifugation at 5000×g for 5 min, and then resuspended in sterile distilled water. The mycelia were cultured on PDA slants for 7 days at 28 °C, and the mycelia were transferred to sterile polyethylene membranes, which were then incubated at room temperature for 24 h. After the incubation period, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The mycelia were finally frozen at - 20 °C. The relative humidity was maintained at - 80%.

Protein concentration determination by Bradford method
The enzyme activities of Aspergillus fumigatus were determined according to the Bradford method [15]. The crude enzyme extracts were subjected to denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of acetonitrile and then centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at - 20 °C. The concentration of the crude enzyme extracts was determined by Bradford method [15]. The crude enzyme extracts were subjected to centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were collected by centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were again resuspended in the same buffer and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The crude enzyme extracts were again subjected to denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were washed with sterile distilled water. The crude enzyme extracts were again subjected to a denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then discarded, and the pellets were washed with sterile distilled water. The crude enzyme extracts were again subjected to denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by addition of acetonitrile and centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C.


## Results
In order to test whether oligopeptides can also interact with the fungal cell surface, we performed a bioinformatics study using an MALDI-TOF MS approac. In this study, we have used the MALDI-TOF MS approach to perform a parallel bioinformatics study on oligopeptides. Using the MALDI-TOF MS, we had the opportunity to use a compound with high molecular weight (m/z 500) to identify oligopeptides that can interact with the fungal cell surface via the MALDI-TOF MS approach. Using the MALDI-TOF MS, we obtained 2,872 proteins (comprising 9.9% of the total protein) that could be identified by using the MALDI-TOF MS (Fig 5A). We compared the binding profiles of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface using an MALDI-TOF MS approach. In this study, we used oligopeptides with oligopeptide binding energies of =20 kJ mol^-1, which is a condition that should ensure that the drug does not interact with the fungal cell surface.

The MALDI-TOF MS method was applied to perform a comparative study of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface. The MALDI-TOF MS was applied to determine the binding energies of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface and the results were compared with those obtained using the MALDI-TOF MS.

When comparing the MALDI-TOF MS results with that obtained using the MALDI-TOF MS, we found that the fungal cell surface of the MALDI-TOF MS was the most active site (Fig 5B). We found that the binding energies of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface were similar to that obtained using the MALDI-TOF MS. For example, we found that the binding energies of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface of the MALDI-TOF MS were 2.54 kJ mol^-1. We found that the binding energies of oligopeptides with the fungal cell surface of the MALDI-TOF MS were 2.


## Discussion
A variety of physiological and pathological processes have been attributed to this species, including growth, development, and differentiation (4, 13, 14. Among them, the development of invasive hyphae, the development of round and globose hyphae, and the formation of cell walls that support the growth of the fungus are the major characteristics of this fungus. In addition, the hyphal growth is associated with the development of the fungus (4).

The formation of cell walls was first identified by the cultivation of Aspergillus species in a media containing 10 g/L glucose. Cell walls of several fungi are composed of ß-1,3-glucan and oligosaccharides (15). Furthermore, cell walls of Aspergillus species are composed of mannose and glucosamine residues. A number of studies have demonstrated that the formation of cell walls is influenced by several factors such as nutritional conditions, growth conditions, and light conditions (16, 17). The type of light (optic and polarized light) was selected for its ability to promote the cell wall integrity and cell wall formation (18). In addition, light has been reported to induce the formation of cell walls (19, 20). However, the exact function of the cell wall integrity and cell wall organization has not been fully elucidated. However, the addition of light to the media significantly increased the cell wall integrity and cell wall architecture of A. fumigatus. The presence of a significant amount of macromolecules (lysine, arginine, succinate and isoleucine) in the cell wall, as well as the presence of the cell wall proteolytic enzymes, resulted in the increased secretion of proteins and lipids by A. fumigatus and the inhibition of the degradation of lipid molecules (21). The increased secretion of proteins and lipids has been reported to be caused by the formation of the cell wall of A. fumigatus, which is mainly composed of mannose (22). It is well known that this cell wall is a crucial component in the fungal physiology (23).

The cell wall of fungi is composed of ß-1,3-glucan (24) and ß-1,6-glucan (25). In addition, the cell wall of A.
