## Abstract
The Saccharomycopsis tritici-producing pathogens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. graminearum, are common causes of head and neck infections in people living in tropical and subtropical countries. The disease manifestation pattern of these pathogens has been changed in the last years to avoid public health problems.

S. tritici was collected from healthy individuals in southern Brazil. To avoid public health problems, it was collected from healthcare facilities in rural areas. The clinical data of the collected individuals was evaluated, and the results were analyzed using different methods.

The mean age of the participants was 28 years (±11 years). The proportion of men and women who were infected with the pathogens was 49.1% and 49.8% respectively. The prevalence of infection was 0.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has been increasing in the past 20 years. This is due to the increase in the number of immunocompromised patients, with the introduction of new anti-fungal agents, such as the widespread use of immunosuppressants, or the use of immunosuppressant drugs [1]. The high mortality rate of IFIs is related to the high eukaryotic resistance of fungi to antifungals and to the relatively few antifungal agents available today, which poses serious problems in clinical management. This is especially true for the dimorphic fungal species Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis, which are often resistant to many of the currently used antifungal agents. Furthermore, the limited number of antifungals available, especially in the form of polyenes and azoles, makes them difficult to treat [2].

The most common fungal pathogen of humans is Candida albicans, which causes a variety of infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals, which have significant health implications. Candida species are the most common cause of mucosal and invasive candidiasis [3,4]. The most effective antifungal drug available, azole antifungal agents, have a limited clinical utility, as they are either fungistatic or fungicidal, have a low molecular weight, and are fungicidal against planktonic and biofilm cells [5]. Moreover, their fungicidal activity is considered as a quorum-sensing molecule that mediates resistance to fungicides [6,7].


## Methods
This methodology was based on the results of a preliminary evaluation of the disease burdens in animals that were sacrificed in the current study [7. This method was also adopted in the preliminary evaluation of the disease burdens in animals that were sacrificed in the current study. In brief, animals were sacrificed and the number of animals sacrificed was recorded. We divided the disease burdens into three groups: 1) Aspergillus, 2) Aspergillus, and 3) Aspergillus fumigatus. Animals that were sacrificed in the current study were considered dead and were considered as non-infectious animals. The animals were considered non-infectious if they had an active infection and could not be controlled for 10 days. Animals that showed no signs of infection were considered to be non-infectious animals. In addition, animals that were sacrificed in the current study were considered non-infectious animals.

Mice and infection model
The murine model of disseminated candidiasis was used to evaluate the impact of the BCS in the pathogenicity of C. albicans on the virulence of C. albicans. Mice were maintained under standard pathogen-free conditions, and the BCS concentrations in their blood were determined by standard methods using standard blood culture (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The animals were divided into two groups: the control group was maintained on standard blood culture (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and the dose-resistance group was maintained on standard blood culture. The animals were used at different ages (6-12 weeks) to evaluate the animals' survival. At each time point, the animals were killed, the fungal burden was evaluated, and the fungal burden in the animals was determined.

Ethics statement
The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (No. L-2019-02-003, Malaysia) and approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Tropical Diseases (No. 119-04-2014).

The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in three time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in four time-series experiments.

The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in two time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in five time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in five time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in three time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in six time-series experiments.

The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in eight time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in eight time-series experiments. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia was higher than that of the Indonesian control in five time-series experiments.

## Discussion
 million cases (for 2005 to 2013. The estimated burden is much higher than that in South Africa, where disease is estimated at more than 1.5 million cases [29]. However, we estimate the burden of fungal disease in Malaysia to be around 1.5 million cases [30], similar to the burden in Australia (1.5 million cases), and more than half of the cases of the South African National Health Base (1.3 million cases) [30]. However, the South African National Health Base has a mortality rate of 35% and a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma rate of 8% [30], making the estimates of the burden of fungal disease underestimated. The estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia is higher than that in Australia (1.5 million cases) [30]. Based on the above, the estimated burden of fungal disease in Malaysia would be similar to that in South Africa (1.5 million cases), though the disease is estimated to be higher in South Africa than in Australia.

We used the Fungal Loads Analysis to estimate the burden of fungal disease, assuming that the estimated burden in Malaysia is consistent with the level in Australia. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease in Malaysia to be approximately 2.2 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease in Malaysia to be approximately 2.1 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 2.1 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 1.3 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 1.2 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 1.7 million cases for 2005 to 2013.

The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease in Malaysia to be approximately 2.3 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 2.5 million cases for 2005 to 2013. The Fungal Loads Analysis estimated the burden of fungal disease to be approximately 1.7 million cases for 2005 to 2013.
