## Abstract

Primary tissue samples were collected from diabetes-treated primary patients and immunized mice for the acute and longitudinally time periods of 1 yea. Clinical features, biochemical parameters, and fasting glucose were evaluated and categorized into the following categories: insulin sensitivity (IG = 9.0, SD = 1.7), leukocyte chemotaxis (CC = 0.9), interleukin 6 (Ig = 1.8), high-affinity lymphocytes (CC = 1.7), and Th1 cells (CC = 1.1). The in vitro and in vivo studies were performed on kidney, heart, kidney, eye, and brain tissues of the subjects as well as control animals.

The results showed that immunization and live/cold chain combined with short-chain immunoglobulin (CSI) treatment significantly prolonged survival of diabetes-treated diabetes-fed immunized mice. In vivo, live/cold chain treatment reduced both serum and leukocyte chemotaxis of insulin sensitivity- and anti-inflammatory cytokines-dependent peritoneal macrophage activation. In contrast, the in vitro results suggested that live/cold chain treatment did not affect in vitro cytokine production and activity.

Live/cold chain treatment did not alter in vitro chemotaxis of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, or IL-18 in kidney or heart of immunized mice.

Live/cold chain treatment did not alter serum or serum IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, or IL-12 levels in control animals.

In conclusion, live/cold chain treatment did not alter in vitro chemotaxis of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, or IL-12 in kidney or heart of immunized mice. In contrast, live/cold chain treatment did not affect in vitro the activities of lymphocyte chemotaxis-dependent peritoneal macrophages or the activities of immune transcription factors.

Abbreviation: Clinical-briefing and/or Extended Adverse Reaction-short-cut prophylaxis.

Short-cut prophylaxis does not appear to be a feasible or cost-effective strategy to treat diabetes mellitus.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis, often disseminated by pulmonary infection, which is often asymptomatic or is promptly cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid (1). In patients with compromised immune system, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the most common manifestation is cryptococcal meningitis. However, with the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of cryptococcal disease has declined in HIV infected patients, which may be explained by the increased availability of antiretroviral drugs.

A primary mechanism of immune suppression by antiretrovirals is a failure in recognition of the pathogen, resulting in an impaired clearance of the pathogen by the adaptive immune response (2, 3). In contrast, IFN-<U+03B3> stimulates the production of anti-cryptococcal cytokines (4). This immune response enhances clearance of the pathogen by CD4^+ T lymphocytes, and may be activated by cell-mediated immunity, such as macrophage activation or the Th1 type responses (5, 6). The Th1 type response may be a mechanism for the immunological response to cryptococcosis. In the absence of this immune response, the pathogen can survive and proliferate inside macrophages, leading to dissemination of the infection.


## Methods
These animals were not immunosuppresse. The mice were housed in a health housing facility that had been optimized for the development of an environmentally controlled animal environment and was deemed suitable for this purpose [34]. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Minas Gerais (CEMM) and was followed by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Minas Gerais (UPM), which approved the protocol in accordance with the rules of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the UPM. The experimental protocol was approved by the IACUC and UPM in accordance with the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences (NIOSH).

Mouse infections
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after they exhibited symptoms consistent with infection and were subsequently sacrificed. Mice were anesthetized by ketamine-xylazine (200 mg/kg, orally) and xylazine-ketamine (500 mg/kg, orally) and intranasally inoculated with 5 × 10^4 CFU of the C. parapsilosis strain CpGPD1 (serotype A, MATa, originally isolated from serotype A, CpGPD1, in the form of an Oa^R) and subsequently infected with a total of 5 × 10^4 CFU of the C. parapsilosis strain CpGPD1. The lungs were removed, and the lesions were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed on a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope at a magnification of ×10,000.

RNA extraction and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from C. parapsilosis yeast cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNA integrity was verified by the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.


## Results
In the model, the kidneys of mice were treated with or without the amphotericin B for 1 h prior to infection with IFN-<U+03B3> or IL-12p4. The kidneys were subsequently subcutaneously delivered into the primary mouse model of experimental diabetes mellitus and then immunofluorescently labelled with a fluorescent antibody. Western blotting analysis was performed using the anti-IL-12p40 antibody to detect specific IL-12p40^+ cells (Fig 1A). In the primary mouse model of experimental diabetes mellitus, the IL-12p40^+ cells were detected in the kidneys of mice that were given 2.5 g/kg of IFN-<U+03B3> or IL-12p40^+ cells (Fig 1A). In the IL-12p40^+ cells, the frequency of the highest number of cells was detected in the kidneys of mice that were given 1.5 g/kg of IFN-<U+03B3> (Fig 1A). The data were further interpreted in the context of the data from the in vitro model of experimental diabetes mellitus. As shown in Fig 1B, in the in vitro model of experimental diabetes mellitus, the number of IFN-<U+03B3>^+ cells was significantly higher in the kidney of mice that received the highest dose of IL-12p40. The frequency of IFN-<U+03B3>^+ cells was also significantly higher in the kidneys of mice that received the lowest dose of IL-12p40, when compared with that of the kidneys of mice that received the highest dose of IL-12p40. Furthermore, the percentage of cells that expressed the TNF-a and IL-10 gene expression were significantly higher in the kidneys of mice that received IL-12p40 (Fig 1B).

We next next performed in vivo studies in mice to determine whether IL-12p40 induced an immune response that is specific to the liver or other tissues. Since the liver is known to be a barrier that protects against the systemic infection of E. faecalis, we first examined the capacity of the liver to produce IL-12p40.


## Discussion
However, in vitro studies using a murine model of human disease demonstrated no effect of IL-17 on CCR7 expression in the lungs [18. In contrast to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced DC inflammatory response, IL-17 treatment did not cause an increase in IL-17 production [19], [20]. In vitro studies using murine models of human pulmonary infection showed no difference in IL-17 production when compared with IL-17 alone [20]. In addition to the low susceptibility of IL-17 to human factors, we observed a decrease in its ability to cause disease in mice with an impaired ability to mount CD4^+ T cell response. The inability to mount response was associated with a decline in IL-17 production [21]. Our data showed that, in contrast to IL-17 alone, IL-17 produced by the lungs is capable of exerting protective effects against inflammatory diseases in mice.

We also observed that the development of M2 macrophages was decreased in the lung, suggesting that these cells are capable of promoting M2 polarization. We did not observe a decrease in the production of M2-type cytokines by M2 macrophages in the lungs of mice lacking IL-17, but we observed that M2 macrophages were capable of suppressing inflammatory responses in the lungs of mice lacking IL-17. This suggests that IL-17 may be able to suppress M2 polarization by promoting IL-17 production. The reasons for this phenomenon are not known, but it could be due to differences in macrophages and cytokines. In addition, we did not observe a decrease in the production of IL-10 in the lungs of mice lacking IL-17, but this effect was not observed in mice lacking IL-17. This suggests that the production of IL-10 may not be the main reason for the reduced production of IL-17 by the lungs of mice lacking IL-17.

Taken together, our data indicate that IL-17 promotes the development of M2 macrophages, but that this process requires the interaction of M2 with the environment in the lungs. It is important to highlight that our results are correlational only and not conclusive. We did not observe a decrease in the production of M2-type cytokines by M2 macrophages, but we did observe a decrease in the production of IL-10.
