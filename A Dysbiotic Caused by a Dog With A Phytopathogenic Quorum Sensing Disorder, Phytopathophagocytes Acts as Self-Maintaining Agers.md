## Abstract
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 2 dogs with aseptic meningitis. Clinical manifestations were observed on medical records for the duration of the disease. Symptoms were classified into 2 categories: generalised general pain (eg, generalised pain on chest X-ray table or prosthetic pad), painless general pain (eg, generalised pain on CSF or blood cultures), and non-specific pain (eg, generalised pain on CSF, brain CT). Clinical manifestations were classified into 2 categories: focal neurologic signs (eg, static weakness, vomiting, mental images, personality changes), and laboratory findings (eg, blood cultures, urine chemistry, urine serology, respiration, and urine deoxyribonucleic acid). We compared the clinical and microbiological features of the 2 dogs with each of the three manifestations, and we compared the results to those obtained with culture.

A total of 101 dogs were referred for medical records evaluation. The mean age of the patients was 55 years. Six dogs had generalised general pain, and 15 had focal neurologic signs. The symptoms were generally severe and included focal neurologic signs, spastic paraparesis, edema, seizures, and coma. The patient had a family history of meningitis (2 dogs each). The clinical manifestations were common, including focal neurologic signs (ie, fever, chills, and especially dark urine, and orbital pain), and non-specific manifestations (eg, green eyes, cough, diarrhea, and loss of appetite). The patient had a history of surgery, including cholangitis, oligodendrocyteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. On the other hand, 31 patients had focal neurologic signs, including focal neurologic signs, dehydration, diarrhea, and coma. On the basis of these results, 2 patients had non-specific manifestations, including spastic paraparesis, and 2 patients had focal neurologic signs.

Medical records reviewed identified a variety of clinical manifestations of meningitis, and these manifestations could be easily overlooked, so it is important to verify these in clinical practice.


## Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) a global emerging pathogen, with a high susceptibility to antifungal agents, with the highest burden in immunocompromised patients (1). In contrast, C. gattii (C. gattii) is endemic in the temperate regions of North America, Africa, and Asia (2-4). Although C. gattii is found mainly in the natural environment and in healthy individuals, its incidence increases during HIV/AIDS, where it is highly virulent (5-8). C. gattii is also present in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and the Canadian and Asian regions (5, 9-14).

C. gattii infection is acquired by inhalation of infectious propagules from the environment.


## Methods
fumigatus, and Euthanasia of . fumigatus-infected C. albicans

The presence of a phytopathogenic quorum sensing disorder (PSPD) was established as previously described [15], with some modifications. A dog was euthanized by an aerosol inhalation method using a dissecting needle. The dog was then dissected, washed with PBS, and then divided into two halves. The first half was placed in a tube containing 3% CO_2 in order to collect A. fumigatus cells. The second half of the dog was then euthanized by a aerosol inhalation method using a pipette. The two halves were separated by a vacuum filtration method, and the third was placed in a sterile Petri dish containing 3% CO_2 in order to collect A. fumigatus cells. The 2-week old female dog was sacrificed in order to obtain a final sample of A. fumigatus cells and cells were collected. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then filtered again and plated on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar to determine the presence of a quorum sensing disorder.

A. fumigatus strain ATCC^® MYA-67^® was used for all experiments. The strains were cultured in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 3 days. Then, they were plated on YPD agar for 72 h, and then, the plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Then, the yeasts were collected by filtration through a 0.22 µm syringe filter. The collected cells were then filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter to remove the excess supernatant. Then, the filtered cells were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then filtered again and plated on YPD agar for 4 days. The plates were then incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Finally, the purified A. fumigatus was plated on YPD agar for 2 days. The colonies were then counted to determine the number of CFU per gram of yeast.

## Discussion
Viral diseases are rare and treaters acknowledge only a limited number of cases. In this report, a large cohort of patients with opportunistic infections is presented. There is evidence of increased HIV prevalence in HIV-uninfected patients in the United States. The increased prevalence of opportunistic infections has been associated with an increase in HIV disease severity and mortality in this cohort. The increased number of opportunistic infections in this cohort has increased the risk of developing opportunistic infections.

The majority of opportunistic infections are acquired by inhalation of spores from infected animals.
