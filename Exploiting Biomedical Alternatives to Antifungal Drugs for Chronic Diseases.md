## Abstract
The transformation of the karyotype of Escherichia coli into the yeast form that causes septicemia is one of the main causes of mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This phenomenon is especially true for patients with weakened immune systems. For the purpose of the present, we describe the genome sequences of the three Leishmania species and compare their genomes.

Leishmania genomes are a monophyletic group of retrotransposons that are distributed in two different clades, i.e. leishmania-lysoza-2 and leishmania-spyfia-5. In addition, the Leishmania proteome is a mosaic of conserved proteins of the two Leishmania species, and we identify several proteins of interest in Leishmania proteomes. Among the proteins identified, we find two proteins of interest in Leishmania B (Leishmania blank), and two proteins of interest in Leishmania D (Leishmania protease, Leishmania D protease).


## Introduction
Disease outbreaks in the wild are becoming a major problem worldwide [1]. These outbreaks are caused by different micro-organisms and include the re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens, such as the recently described outbreak of an outbreak of wheat blast disease in western Europe [2] and of a major wheat-borne anthracnose disease in Asia [3, 4]. The complex zoonotic micro-ecological scenario has shown that such outbreaks are unlikely to occur again, and it is important to study the consequences of such outbreaks to understand how they can be avoided.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a group of microbial resistance mechanisms, which have evolved in response to environmental conditions, such as the immune response of the host. AMR is one of the major causes of crop losses and has been directly linked to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in animal and plant pathogenic micro-ecosystems [5, 6]. In humans, it is a common feature, occurring in both infections and immune responses, to cause life-threatening infections. The mechanisms used by pathogenic organisms to overcome these mechanisms are complex and involve the expression of virulence factors and other proteins, which may be important factors for resistance [7].

Protein secretion by pathogenic organisms has long been known to play important roles in host defence mechanisms [8]. In fact, the highly conserved protein secretion mechanisms between pathogens and their hosts are so well conserved that secretion of proteins containing conserved functions is considered a key mechanism of pathogenicity in pathogens [9]. In fact, the secretion of a protein with antimicrobial activity by a pathogen is thought to be the first step to its pathogenicity [10]. In fact, the immune system plays a crucial role in the pathogen defence against pathogenic bacteria [11] and fungi [12].


## Methods
This is a two-week study that involves the use of a panel of four clinical trial drugs (downloaded from Drug Resistance Program database [20] and the Laboratory of Molecular Pharmaceutics, University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) in combination with the Biomedical Alternatives program, which offers a wide variety of prophylaxis strategies for chronic disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Texas Health Sciences Center (IRB number: 2009-019-01). In addition, the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) model was performed by the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) in collaboration with the Texas Medical Branch.

In addition, the human cytotoxic agents 100 and 10, and the synthetic inhibitors of both A. fumigatus and H. capsulatum, were tested. All of these agents have been previously used in the treatment of cyclosporine-resistant A. fumigatus [20] and other pathogenic fungi [21] and were therefore included in the present study.

The A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates at 37 °C for 3 days. All of the cultures were stored at 4 °C in sterile conditions. All cultures were subcultured to the lowest concentration that inhibited visible growth of the fungus.

For the preliminary screening of the BBD model, CFUs were determined by the optical density (OD) measurements using a BD Optima Multiscan Optima plate reader (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The assay was performed by means of a previously published protocol [22]. The A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All of the cultures were grown on SDA plates at 37 °C for 3 days. At that time, they were subcultured to the lowest concentration that inhibited visible growth of the fungus. The measurements were performed by means of the BD Optima Multiscan Optima reader (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a scan speed of 600 nm with a two-hour delay to allow for the preparation of the pre-dilution broth (0.5%) of each tested strain.


## Results
aeruginosa for the development of DMTs, using two promising industrial DMT-producing compounds, the . aeruginosa antifungal agent fluconazole and diclofenac (8). Fluconazole was prepared from fluconazole and also the compound is structurally similar to diclofenac (9).

The fungicidal activity of fluconazole was tested against P. aeruginosa larvae (Figure 2A) using the i.v. method (Figure 2B) and the antifungal effect was determined using i.p. results (Figure 2C). Fluconazole was effective in killing all larvae tested (Figure 2D). The antifungal effect of fluconazole was also tested in vitro using the i.v. method (Figure 2E). Fluconazole killed a significant number of larvae (1.3 ± 0.5). Fluconazole was fungicidal when compared with diclofenac (0.12 ± 0.05), and fungistatic when compared with DMT (0.22 ± 0.07) (Figure 2E). Fluconazole was fungicidal when compared with fluconazole with a concomitant antifungal agent (0.50 ± 0.17).

Antifungal Effect of Fluconazole on the Antifungal Activity of DMT
The antifungal effect of fluconazole was further tested in vivo using a murine model of systemic infection by P. aeruginosa. After 24 h, mice were treated intranasally with fluconazole. Fluconazole caused an overall mortality of 22.4% (Figure 3). After 24 h, the animals were sacrificed, and fluconazole-treated mice died of mortality of ~34% (Figure 3). A further complication of the fluconazole treatment was the rapid reduction of brain fungal burden (Figure 4). These data suggest that fluconazole has the potential to cause brain death in P. aeruginosa.


## Discussion
In this study, a single dose of . violaceum 3 × 5 µl was administered to a healthy patient. The data showed that M. violaceum was the most effective antifungal agent for chronic fungal infection in this patient. This is in contrast to the use of other drugs such as fluconazole and amphotericin B in the treatment of fungal infections, which showed no effect.

In previous studies, the most effective antifungal drugs for chronic fungal infection were amphotericin B and fluconazole (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8). In this study, the highest concentrations of these drugs were employed in the treatment of M. violaceum infections. The most effective antifungal drugs for chronic fungal infection were amphotericin B and fluconazole (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8). In contrast, the most effective antifungal drugs were fluconazole (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) and amphotericin B (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8). In the present study, the most effective antifungal drugs for chronic fungal infection were amphotericin B and fluconazole (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).

The results indicated that M. violaceum 3 × 5 µl was the most effective antifungal agent in the treatment of chronic fungal infection in this patient. This is in contrast to the use of other drugs such as fluconazole and amphotericin B in the treatment of fungal infections.

In our previous study, we showed that the most effective antifungal drugs for chronic fungal infection were amphotericin B and fluconazole (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8). In the present study, M. violaceum 3 × 5 µl was the most effective antifungal agent in the treatment of chronic fungal infection in this patient. This is in contrast to the use of other drugs such as fluconazole and amphotericin B in the treatment of fungal infections.
