## Abstract
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a polyene antibiotic that has been used in the treatment of various respiratory diseases. However, the mechanisms of AmB resistance in some bacteria are unclear. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize resistance mechanisms in Escherichia coli.

The presence of polymorphic DNA sequences (P1-1F1, P2-1F2, P3-1F5) and large subunit sequences (ASU1-4, ASU5) in the genome of E. coli P1-1F2 P2-1F5 was analyzed. The presence of protein coding genes (PCGs) was also analyzed. P1-1F5 were differentially expressed in the P2-1F2 and P3-1F5 subunit genomes.

PCGs were located at 38 nucleotides from 4 to 19 nucleotides from P1-1F2, whereas ASU1-4, ASU5 were located at 37 nucleotides from 3 to 19 nucleotides from P1-1F2. The gene content of P1-1F5 was significantly differentially expressed in the P1-2F2 and P3-1F5 subunit genomes. The gene content of ASU1-4 was significantly higher in the P1-1F2 genome.


## Introduction

(1) Second paragrap. Is the macrolide present in the sample tested for binding? Is the macrolide in the phytoconstituents? If the sample tested was for a macrolide, the concentration of macrolide tested must be higher than the other macrolides tested. The concentration of macrolide in the phytoconstituents is not higher than the other macrolides tested.

(2) In Figure 4B, what is the mean concentration of macrolide in the phytoconstituents? The mean concentration of macrolide in the phytoconstituents is lower than the other macrolides tested.

(3) “Figure 4C shows mean concentrations of macrolides and macrolides in the phytoconstituents tested.” Some microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, have been shown to have high concentrations of macrolides in phytoconstituents, whereas yeasts such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata show low concentrations. How can these differences in phytoconstituents be reconciled? How can the phytoconstituents of macrolides be interpreted in the presence of yeasts?

(4) “Figure 4D shows mean concentrations of macrolides and macrolides in the phytoconstituents tested.” Figure 4E shows the mean concentrations of macrolides and macrolides in the phytoconstituents tested. How can these differences in phytoconstituents be reconciled? How can the phytoconstituents of macrolides and macrolides be interpreted in the presence of yeasts?

## Methods

The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants (.5 mL) were transferred to a fresh tube. The tubes were then inverted and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water to remove any residual cells. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 µL of distilled water and, after centrifugation, 500 µL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The tubes were again inverted and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water. The final pellet was resuspended in 500 µL of 5% SDS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Then, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water and then resuspended in 100 µL of distilled water. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of distilled water and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 µL of distilled water and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water. The pellets were then resuspended in 500 µL of 3% SDS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water and then resuspended in 100 µL of distilled water. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of distilled water and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water. The pellets were then resuspended in 200 µL of 3% SDS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The pellets were then washed twice with distilled water and then resuspended in 100 µL of 3% SDS. The pellets were then resuspended in 200 µL of 3% SDS and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed twice with distilled water.


## Results
The most common compound in the 4,712 samples was a-mycene hydrocarbons, with 17 compounds detected (Table 2. The most common compound was oleic acid, with a total of 6 compounds detected (Table 2). In addition, 23 compounds were identified as part of the triacylglycerols, with 18 compounds detected in the samples (Table 2). The most common compounds in the triacylglycerols were citric acid, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 3-methyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, and benzaldehyde.

In this study, 8,586 compounds were identified in the study population from samples of the same extraction method (Table 3). Among the 8,586 compounds, 88.3% (3,719 compounds) were identified as trans-covalent, with a final concentration of 1.86 mg/L (Table 3). In addition, 2,868 compounds were identified as part of the triacylglycerols, with 17 compounds detected (Table 3). Among the 8,586 compounds, 590 compounds were identified as trans-salt, with an final concentration of 2.1 mg/L (Table 3).

The most common compounds in the most commonly isolated compounds from the samples were: (1) citric acid, with 3 compounds detected in the four samples; (2) citric acid, with 2 compounds detected in the two samples; (3) citric acid, with 1 compound detected in the samples; (4) citric acid, with 1 compound detected in the samples; (5) citric acid, with 3 compounds detected in the samples; and (6) citric acid, with 2 compounds detected in the samples.

The most common compounds in the most commonly isolated compounds from the samples were: (1) citric acid, with 9 compounds detected in the samples; (2) citric acid, with 5 compounds detected in the samples; and (3) citric acid, with 2 compounds detected in the samples.

In this study, 8,586 compounds were identified in the study population from samples of the same extraction method (Table 3). In addition, 4,719 compounds were identified as trans-covalent, with a final concentration of 1.


## Discussion
The most significant compounds are listed in Table . Among them, compounds 5 and 7 are as follows: 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 13a, 14a, 15a, 16a, and 16a.

The synthesized compounds 5a-7a are mainly concentrated in the core of the thiazole ring, which may be due to the charge difference between them. In the sub-conservation of the thiazole ring of the phenyl ring, the acyl group of compound 5 can be formed by the interaction of the phenyl group with the phenyl ring of the acyl group of compounds 7a-7b. The aromatic residues of compounds 7a-7b form a hydroxyl group in the carboxylic group of compounds 7a-7d. The phenyl group of compound 7b forms a hydrogen bond to the phenyl group of compounds 7a-7d.
