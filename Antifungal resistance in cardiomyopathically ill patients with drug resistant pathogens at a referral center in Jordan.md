## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is an uncommon fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus gattii and C. neoformans. Though more than 1.5 million cases are reported annually, the cause remains unknown. This study assessed the in vitro antifungal susceptibility patterns of 58 C. gattii and C. neoformans isolates from HIV-infected patients in two Ugandan regions. Among these, 27 isolates had low MICs but were divided into 2 groups, which were black and white fluorescence microscopy results of first and second samples respectively. In the latter, the white fluorescence microscopy results were identical. In the second group, all fluorescence microscopy results were similar. The sensitivity of the white fluorescence microscopy results of the two groups was also corroborated by PCR and transposon bead array analysis. Our results suggest that C. gattii and C. neoformans differ in their antifungal susceptibility patterns and that white fluorescence microscopy cannot be used as a first line diagnostic tool.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus that can cause serious invasive mycoses in immunocompromised patients. The current standard therapy for patients with invasive aspergillosis is amphotericin B (AMB), which consists of 5-flucytosine (5-FC) and 5-flucytosine sulphonamides (5-FC) (1). The resistance of A. fumigatus to these antifungal agents is low, but this resistance is associated with serious side effects and drug resistance (2). The search for new antifungal agents has increased significantly in the last decade (3,4). In this review, we will discuss the latest advances in the antifungal therapies and the current drug development program against fungal infections.


## Methods
Fungal Strains and Growth Conditions
Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC number 070097) was used for propagation of the plasmid pRS426-GFP.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from a single colony grown in liquid YPD at 30°C for 2 days. RNA was purified from the cells using RNA-free kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA).


## Results
Table 1 shows the clinical data of 12 of the 24 patients (median, .5; range, 1.1-24). The median age was 36 years (range, 1.6-41.5) and the mean duration of follow-up was 7.2 months (range, 3.8-8.8). Twenty-four (20%) of the 24 patients had no prior history of cryptococcal disease, whereas 14 (20%) had a history of cryptococcal meningitis and 6 (10%) had an underlying disease. The median duration of follow-up was 4.3 months (range, 1.0-5.3) and the mean duration of follow-up was 8.2 months (range, 3.6-8.2). No patient received any antifungal therapy.

Cryptococcal disease was the most common cryptococcal disease in the 12 patients with cardiomyopathologically induced cryptococcal disease, with 24 (25%) patients having a median of 5 days (range, 1.4-7.5) in the follow-up. However, the median duration of follow-up was 2.4 days (range, 1.5-7.5) in patients with cryptococcal disease. The median duration of follow-up was 3.1 days (range, 2.1-4.2) in patients with cryptococcal disease.

The median duration of follow-up was 3.2 days (range, 1.1-6.5) in patients with cryptococcal disease. The median duration of follow-up was 2.9 days (range, 1.3-7.5) in patients with cryptococcal disease. Twenty-four patients with a baseline cryptococcal disease had a documented history of cryptococcal meningitis at the time of follow-up. One patient had a history of cryptococcal meningitis at the time of follow-up.

Two patients had a baseline cryptococcal disease at the time of follow-up. One patient had a documented history of cryptococcal meningitis and one patient had a history of cryptococcal meningitis. No patient had a history of cryptococcal meningitis and no patient had a documented history of cryptococcal meningitis.


## Discussion
It was suggested that this combination is advantageous for the patient, allowing the patient to overcome the initial resistance to treatmen. A recent study in a small cohort of patients with bacterial meningitis (n = 122) demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of steroids and other antifungal agents, thereby conferring a protective effect against bacterial meningitis.

In a study of patients with bacterial meningitis, it was shown that treatment of bacterial meningitis with amphotericin B increased the survival of infected mice (n = 12) [11]. In a study of 26 patients with bacterial meningitis treated with fluconazole and itraconazole, itraconazole and itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole, itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole and itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole, itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole and itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole, the survival rate was 60% and the median time to death was 19.8 days, and the median cellular concentration was 13.6 µg/mL [12]. It has been suggested that the synergistic effect of azoles and posaconazole therapy could be sustained for up to 72 h in a therapeutic regimen [13]. In a study of renal transplant patients with bacterial meningitis, itraconazole treatment increased the survival of the patients by 72 hours in 72-h mortality, while itraconazole-rifampicin was better tolerated by patients with bacterial meningitis and pneumonia [14]. In a study of HIV-infected patients with meningitis, itraconazole treatment was beneficial in improving the survival of the patients by 72 hours. In a study of patients with pulmonary fungal infection, itraconazole treatment improved the survival of the patients by 72 hours by 88% [15]. In a study of patients with bacterial meningitis, itraconazole-sulphamethoxazole was better tolerated by patients with bacterial meningitis and pneumonia [16].
