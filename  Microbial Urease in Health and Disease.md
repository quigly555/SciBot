## Abstract

One hundred and fifty patients with a CFD (36%) were selected as the CFD group and eight control. Macrophages, B cells, T cells, bone marrow, and IFN-<U+03B3> receptors (IFN-<U+03B3>R) were detected in all samples. The relative contribution of all subgroups to treatment response was unknown.

The relative contribution of all subgroups was unknown, while HIV was the most prevalent subgroup. The results of the analysis of biomarkers revealed a decrease in the serum level of poly-Ethyl propionic acid (PEP) in the CFD group and a rise in the PEP group after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The median time-updated plasma glucose was 10.1 g/dL (IQR: 9.1-19.4) with a median increase of 3.7 mmol/dL in the PEP group and 20.1 g/dL (IQR: 12.3-35.6) with a median increase of 3.9 mmol/dL in the CFD group. PEP-Group subjects had a significantly lower glucose level of 1.0 mmol/dL (P=0.02) and a significantly higher glucose level of 2.2 mmol/dL (P=0.03) in the CFD group compared to the controls.

The results of this study suggest a correlation between the effects of Cryptococcus therapy and the levels of PEP and PEP on inflammatory response and suggest that adherence to established guidelines for Cryptococcus treatment should be carefully considered in the selection of treatment regimens.

Fungi are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. In Colombia, HIV is the most prevalent clinically diagnosed fungal infection. The prevalence of cryptococcosis is decreasing among patients who are on HAART. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Cryptococcus (Crypto) has split in two. We analyzed the cryptococcal population dynamics at two locations-Santa Maria region and the other from the other part of the country. Isolation of the fungus from the environment was important for fungal population differentiation.


## Introduction

The UPR assay has been used in the fields of medicine and pharmacy as well as for the detection of several antibiotic-resistant pathogen. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are recognized by the human immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and the N-type lectin receptor (NCLR) receptors. Their ligands include TLR-2 and TLR-4, which recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharides and fungi (17, 18). The UPR assay has been used successfully to measure the virulence of various pathogens and bacteria, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and yeasts (19-21). The UPR assay has been used in the detection of a wide range of bacteria, viruses and yeasts (22-24). The detection of a number of different microbes, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, yeasts and bacteria, has shown the utility in the detection of novel pathogenic agents (25, 26). The UPR assay has also been used to detect certain yeast pathogens (27-31).

The UPR assay was developed by Schertz et al. (28, 29) and is the most widely used global screening method for the detection of antimicrobial agents. The UPR assay is widely used for the detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic agents in various clinical settings, including oncology, dentistry and ophthalmology (32-34).

The UPR assay has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, fungi and yeasts (35-38). The UPR assay has been used to detect the presence of some bacteria (39-41) and yeast (42-44). The UPR assay has also been used to detect both bacterial and fungal infections in patients with suspected antibiotic-resistant infections (45, 46). The UPR assay has been used to detect the presence of certain bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, etc.) and yeast (47, 48). The UPR assay has also been used to detect bacteria in the urinary tract and urinary catheter (49, 50) and to detect the presence of certain bacteria in the urinary tract (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, etc.) (49).


## Methods
Ramapati Murad, Department of Clinical Sciences, UPM.

The urease-producing P. brasiliensis yeast strain was used as the reference strain for the screening of clinical isolates. It was cultivated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) slants at 28 °C and 200 rpm. The yeast cells were purified using the QIAGEN S-300 nucleic acid purification column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced (Eurofins, Kraków, Poland). The sequences of the selected yeast strains were deposited in the GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the accession numbers are presented in Table 1.

Phylogenetic Analysis of Yeasts
The four yeast strains and the corresponding eukaryotic strains are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession numbers PRJEB1229-PRJEB1231 (Table 1). The sequences of the selected yeast strains are deposited in the GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the accession numbers are shown in Figure 1.

DNA Extraction and Amplification of C. albicans Urease Genes
The genomic DNA extract from C. albicans UREA3 (CALA3_F) was obtained from Dr. Ahrens Gajjar, Department of Clinical Microbiology, UPMC. The PCR reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced (Eurofins, Kraków, Poland). The sequences of the selected yeast strains are deposited in the GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the accession numbers are shown in Table 1.


## Results
Identification of E. dermatitidis Strain and E. sphaerica Strain
E. dermatitidis was recently described as a pathogen of woody plants and bark fungi in South Korea, but the fungus is also found in other forest ecosystems (Schubert et al., 2014, Cramer et al., 2015).


## Discussion
aureus strains and the role of these genes in bacterial virulence is well documente. The recent studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of BcUre6, BcUre8 and BcUre9 (AUSG_04226) in bacterial strains and the effects of the overexpression of BcUre6 and BcUre8 on S. aureus virulence were similar to those of C. albicans [23,24], indicating that the BcUre6-BcUre8-BcUre9 complex plays a role in virulence of this fungal pathogen. The expression of these genes in AUSG_04226 and C. albicans suggests that the BcUre6-BcUre8-BcUre9 complex might also be involved in pathogenesis in AUSG_04226 and C. albicans.

BcUre6 is required for the interaction with host surface ligands, such as ß-1,3-glucan and chitin, and the expression of bicentric and oligentric BcUre8 gene was found to be upregulated in C. albicans [21]. However, the interaction of ß-1,3-glucan and chitin is limited [25]. In C. albicans, the addition of l-3,4-linked mannose to the medium in an oligocellulose medium resulted in a severe phenotype [26]. These results indicate that BcUre6 may have a role in cell wall integrity and cell wall assembly of C. albicans.

The overexpression of BcUre6 and BcUre8 resulted in a severe phenotype in C. albicans. The expression of bicentric BcUre6 and bicentric BcUre8 genes was decreased in C. albicans in comparison to WT, indicating that the aUre1/ß-1,3-glucan pathway plays a role in cell wall integrity and cell wall assembly in C.
