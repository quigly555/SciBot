## Abstract
Microorganisms are known to utilize glucose as a carbon and energy source. In this study, we show that a cAMP-activated protein kinase, GrbA, plays a key role in glucose utilization. This study demonstrates that GrbA deficiency is associated with an attenuated virulence of Candida species. Moreover, the deletion of GRBA in Candida glabrata results in the attenuation of Candida species virulence. These results suggest that GrbA is required for optimal growth and survival in Candida and other yeasts, and may play a significant role in virulence by regulating the expression of genes important for stress resistance and the activation of immune responses.


## Introduction
The genus Geomyces, typified by G. graminis, is characterized by their habit of growing on dead branches of an ever-growing montium, occasionally on plants, and on dead stems of herbaceous plants. As a result, they are often overlooked in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and oriental traditional herbal medicine (OTM), and are rarely examined. In many cases, the plants are believed to be an important source of drugs or herbal products, but the knowledge of the pharmacological activities of Geomyces is limited, and few studies have been conducted on its pharmacological activities.


## Methods

Informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to any treatment, or the participants or their surrogates provided written informed consent to the study.

Study design and setting
The Cryptococcus neoformans clinical trials were carried out at the North Carolina State University Clinical Research Center and were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All participants provided written informed consent prior to any clinical diagnosis or treatment.


## Results
species with a homolog in Candida albicans (Candida lusitaniae, . albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. parviflora, C. kefyr-12, C. kefyr-18, C. lusitaniae, C. lusitaniae-7, C. kefyr-12, C. kefyr-18, C. lusitaniae-7, C. kefyr-12, C. dubliniensis, C. albicans, C. albicans-4, and C. lusitaniae) or Candida parapsilosis (Candida parapsilosis) were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis in order to identify possible genes involved in the synthesis of terpenoid and terpene compounds in the fermentation medium. The results showed that the corresponding genes (C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. kefyr-12, C. lusitaniae, C. lusitaniae-7, C. kefyr-12, C. kefyr-18, C. lusitaniae-7, and C. lusitaniae-7) showed significant expression patterns (Fig 3). The most interesting genes were identified by the RNA-Seq analysis of the corresponding genes in all Candida spp. species (Table 3).

The RNA-Seq analysis revealed that all the Candida spp. species were able to synthesize terpenoid compounds and terpene compounds. All the Candida species produced xylan, xylanene, xylenes, xyloglucan, xylanene, and xylo-lin. The xylan-concentrating strains were able to synthesize xylitol and xylitol-lacking strains were able to synthesize xylitol-lacking xylan (Table 3). In addition, the xylitol-lacking strains produced xylan and xyloglucan-producing strains produced xylan-producing xylanase enzymes. Among all the Candida spp., C. dubliniensis and C.


## Discussion
Therefore, the gene-level expression of core genes for cell wall-degradation, unfolded protein response, response to cell wall-degradation, and the control of cell wall-degradation and virulence was significantly higher in the LFE isolates than in the LFE II isolate. The gene-level expression of core genes for cell wall-degradiation, response to cell wall-degradiation, response to cell wall-degradation, and the control of cell wall-degradiation and virulence was also significantly higher in the LFE isolates than in the LFE II isolates.

Lecide fragilis has two other novel gene families, two of which encode proteins involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, a process that is required for vesicle trafficking and virulence in fungi

In fungi, the second gene family, the homologous gene family, is present in the genomes of many species, but also in other Lecide fragilis isolates, and is present in many other species of Lecide fragilis. In addition to the genes involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, the genes involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking include a putative lipid transporter (orthologs of the yeast-like vacuolar membrane ATP-binding protein (VMP) family II), a cell surface protein (vpsB), a membrane-anchored protein (cdr1), a vacuolar ATP-binding protein (vpsD), a high-affinity vesicle-flux protein (vpsF) and a protein involved in vacuolar-vacuolar vesicle transport (VvL). The vpsB gene family II is required for vacuolar vesicle trafficking. The gene VvL is also important for vacuolar vesicle trafficking. The genes VvL and VvF are required for vesicle trafficking and vesicle trafficking, respectively.
