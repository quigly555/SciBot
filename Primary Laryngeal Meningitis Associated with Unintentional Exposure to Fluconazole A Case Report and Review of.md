## Abstract
Arch Intern Med 1998;158:1043-.

A review of hospitalized patients admitted to 1st Medical Center with intentional exposure to fluconazole. Methods. We reviewed 6 hospitals. Data was abstracted and analyzed. Results. Nearly a quarter of the individuals were under admission for 1st Medical Center admission, and 24.5% were admitted due to non-adherence to fluconazole. Overall, fluconazole use was highest in the 1st and 2nd week after starting, but decreased gradually throughout the 2nd week. The proportion of hospitalized patients who had missed appointments was higher in the 2nd week after starting fluconazole (38% versus 27%) and in the 3rd week after stopping fluconazole (33% versus 21%). The most common presenting complaint was a lack of energy (p=0.02) and restlessness (p=0.04). Among those who had missed appointments, 23% had complaints of restlessness or illness (p=0.04).

Individuals who inadvertently took part in a high-dose dose of fluconazole were more likely to develop hospital admission, lack of improvement, and improve with admission. The results of this study suggest that exposure to fluconazole increases the risk of hospital admission, and fluconazole should be stopped soon to allow time for healing of the wound.

Fluconazole is a synthetic drug that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a safe and effective treatment for HIV and other immunocompromised patients. The current study assesses the safety, efficacy, and safety of fluconazole in a clinical setting at 2 hospitals in patients with suspected invasive fungal infection at 42-year-old age in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.

## Introduction
[21]

Clinical presentation: Seven patients (two males and one female) presented to the ICU with headache with both eyes closed, fever and signs of meningis. None of them were hospitalized. The patient was admitted to the hospital on day three, with no history of travel. The patient was a member of the family with no history of travel. The patient was an Indian national. He was 4 years old. He had been to a few countries including Costa Rica, Afghanistan, Iran, Kenya, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Oman, Tunisia, Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. He had not been to any of the health facilities.

The patient was not admitted to the ICU with any signs of headache, fever, rash, or changes to his physical examination. The patient's laboratory results showed that the azithromycin was inactive at baseline and was not toxic at admission. The azithromycin dose was kept at a steady state of 10 mg/kg of body weight. He was admitted to the hospital with a fever and cough. The patient was an Indian national with no known travel history. The patient was a member of the family with no history of travel.

Case Report: A 24-year-old Indian male residing in the city of Amman, Saudi Arabia, presented to the ICU with cough and shortness of breath. An examination revealed no change in the skin, hair, eyes, chest, or chest radiographs. The patient's fever was stable and the patient was in good health. The patient was admitted to the hospital on day three of his life. The patient was a member of the family with no history of travel. The patient was admitted to the ICU with a fever and cough. The patient was a member of the family with no history of travel. The patient's symptoms were indolent with fever and shortness of breath. The patient's cough and shortness of breath were not considered until the next day. The patient was discharged after 2 weeks. The patient was started on treatment with fluconazole and was on antifungal prophylaxis. The patient was discharged on day six. The patient was discharged on fluconazole and continued on antifungal prophylaxis. The patient was started on fluconazole for 5 days and continued on antifungal prophylaxis for 3 days.


## Methods
Meningitis was a new onset clinical syndrome, which was defined by white body odor that appeared on the first day or in the presence of fever, headache, or chest pai.


## Results
fumigatus Infection
Clinical data are presented in Table . Although the initial incidence of Aspergillus fumigatus infection was 1.6 per 100,000 person-years, the rate increased from 3.1 per 100,000 person-years in 2011 to 20.8 per 100,000 person-years in 2013. However, the rate remained constant at 2.3 per 100,000 person-years for all three decades.


## Discussion

In summary, our case highlights the importance of considering early diagnosis and management of any serious, life-threatening Laryngeal abscess when developing a deep cutaneous fungal infectio. For patients with a history of accidental exposure to water, irrigation water, or other contaminants, the case report suggests a risk of a serious, life-threatening, and potentially life-threatening Laryngeal abscess.

In this case, the patient’s history and/or skin involvement led us to suspect that the fungal infection may have been triggered by the patient's water use. This raised the suspicion that water may have been a contributing factor in the fungal infection. In the setting of a history of water use, the patient had a history of drinking a tap water with water being provided by the hospital, and the water source was a hot spring or groundwater. In addition, the patient had been exposed to a lot of hot water in his basement during his childhood and even before starting to clean up his basement. This has been previously described in a previous case series of a patient with Coccidioidomycosis who had been exposed to hot springs and groundwater in his basement. These studies suggested that the patient might have had exposure to water from his basement and hence was exposed to a fungal infection. The patient had not had a history of exposure to water from the basement. However, his history of exposure to water from his basement was consistent with exposure to a hot spring or groundwater. This prompted us to examine the patient’s blood and urine, and further demonstrated that he had an elevated protein concentration in urine. This was likely due to an overproduction of serum antibodies in urine, and to a likely upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood and urine.

As noted above, there have been recent case reports of fungal infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hypogammaglobulinemia (HIGD) (25-28). In these cases, there have been a number of reports of fungal infections. For instance, in a case report by Mattsson and Casadevall (29), a patient with Mucorales infections developed a fungal abscess due to Mucorales infections. The patient had been exposed to hot water in his basement, which was made up of hot water, and the water source was a hot spring or groundwater.
