## Abstract
This study evaluated the clinical and microbiological aspects of AIDS-related CM. A retrospective study was conducted among converts to HIV-1 and current or former AIDS patients attending an infectious diseases clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Anti-CD8 autoantibodies were assessed by biopsies, and cryptococcal antigen testing was performed. The study was approved by the institutional review board and approved for non-adherence to study recommendations. The microbiological findings were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 18 cryptococcal antigen preparations. A total of 126 participants were recruited, of whom 96 were HIV-infected and 65 were non-HIV-1. The mean age of the study participants was 41.3 ± 9.4 years, and 49.4% of participants were males. The prevalence of CD4+ cell (CD4+ cell) conversion was 14.9 ± 6.8 cases/100 participants. Among participants with non-HIV-1 CM, 16 were HIV-infected, and they had a low CD4 count of 46.7 ± 9.3 cells/mm3 (Table 1). Compared with HIV-1-infected participants, those with HIV-1 CM had an increased risk of developing cryptococcal antigenemia (OR 2.2 per 10-fold increase, 95%CI: 1.9-5.3; P = 0.03), anemia (OR 2.1 per 10-fold increase, 95%CI: 1.7-4.3; P = 0.01), and advanced disease (OR 0.4 per 10-fold increase, 95%CI: 0.6-0.8; P = 0.01).


## Introduction
 2017, 2018; Adhikary et a., 2018; Kumar et al., 2019).

A number of human pathogens have been shown to undergo DNA cleavage at relatively high rates and to undergo genome-wide chromosomal rearrangements, including those related to pathogen replication, chromosome loss, or overexpression (Lengeler et al., 2018). For example, Trypanosoma cruzi infection of the central nervous system (CNS) results in high chromosomal rearrangements (Duplessis et al., 2003; Olson et al., 2012; Gorre et al., 2019), while Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) infection of the liver results in substantial chromosome loss and chromosomal rearrangements (Westerberg et al., 2010). In animals, chromosomal rearrangements are also associated with the invasion of host tissues by pathogenic yeasts such as C. neoformans (C. neoformans) and Histoplasma capsulatum (C. neoformans/H. capsulatum). These two yeasts can easily be overcome by fungi, and these chromosomal rearrangements can be easily acquired by eukaryotic host cells (Jung et al., 2016). The use of genetic engineering approaches has allowed a wide array of approaches to be employed to target fungal genetic elements, and the most extensively explored is the use of the drug paracetamol, which causes multiple cellular lesions including organ involvement, hepatomegaly, and nephrotoxicity (Pappas et al., 2015).

Paracetamol is a highly potent and broad-spectrum antifungal agent (Kvitek and Schmitz, 2017) that is effective against a wide range of yeasts, including Candida, Cryptococcus, and non-Cryptococcus species (O'Connell et al., 2002). The effect of paracetamol is similar to that of the azoles, which cause severe side effects in healthy individuals, and the efficacy of the azoles against Candida albicans is limited in patients receiving amphotericin B (Hallenberg et al., 1998). In the case of C.

## Results
This set of genes was found in both the two most recent common eukaryotic genomes, . nidulans and D. melanogaster. The shared gene set of A. nidulans and D. melanogaster also included a putative transcription factor known as Ftr1, which is found in most bacterial species, and an oxidase of unknown function, suggesting that their expression may have diverged during evolution. Taken together, the data indicate that both the A. nidulans and D. melanogaster genomes have shared gene sets for lipid synthesis.

The shared gene set of these three species is unique in that it contains no orthologs from other eukaryotic organisms. However, there is one other gene (Rsc1) that is found in two other eukaryotic genomes, namely A. nidulans and D. melanogaster. It is also found in a bacterial genome (GIAM-017928) and in an alveolate (GIAM-017950) genomes. These sequences are of similar length to the gene for the Rab family protein (Rsc1), which is found in the H. sapiens and C. albicans genomes. This suggests that the Rab family protein is present in the ancestor of both eukaryotic species and is also present in the three other eukaryotic species. A. nidulans and D. melanogaster have two other unique genes (Rsc1) that are found in three different eukaryotic genomes. This suggests that the Rab family protein may have undergone horizontal gene transfer from an ancestor of these three species and that Rsc1 is present in all eukaryotic species.

The three unique genes found in these three genomes are not found in any other eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, two previously unreported genes (Rsc1 and Rsc2) that are known to be absent in eukaryotes, GASP1, GASP2 and RSC2, have been identified in A. nidulans and D. melanogaster, but no such genes are found in other eukaryotic species. The other unique genes found in these three genomes are not found in any other eukaryotic genomes.

## Discussion
The DNA binding site of the transcriptional activators varies between species, but it was not identified in . oryzae and in S. cerevisiae, which is a highly divergent species with an R. oryzae homologue. In this case, the putative DNA cleavage sites could be a copy-number effect.

Tissue segregation assays were conducted with a set of approximately 15,000 rRNA and rRNA-containing sequences in which the DNA content was determined. The results are shown in Figure 5, which shows the majority of the genetic variation in the R. oryzae genome. However, there are differences in the genome architecture among different species. For example, the genetic variation in the R. oryzae genome is much smaller than that of the R. oryzae genome. The R. oryzae genome is larger than that of the R. oryzae genome (approximately 1.4 Mb vs. 1.3 Mb). In addition, the R. oryzae genome has more genes that are involved in DNA replication than the R. oryzae genome (approximately 2.5 Mb vs. 1.7 Mb). The R. oryzae genome has more genes that are involved in DNA replication than the R. oryzae genome (approximately 2.4 Mb vs. 1.7 Mb). In the present study, the R. oryzae genome is larger than that of the R. oryzae genome (approximately 2.4 Mb vs. 1.7 Mb). Although, the R. oryzae genome has fewer genes involved in DNA replication than the R. oryzae genome (approximately 2.5 Mb vs. 1.7 Mb). Although, R. oryzae has fewer genes involved in DNA replication than the R. oryzae genome (approximately 2.5 Mb vs. 1.7 Mb). These differences could be explained by differences in the RNA-seq data. In RNA-seq experiments, the R. oryzae genome has fewer genes involved in RNA-seq than the R. oryzae genome (approximately 1.3 Mb vs. 1.2 Mb). In addition, the genome architecture of R. oryzae is much larger than that of the R. oryzae genome (approximately 1.4 Mb vs. 1.8 Mb). The genome architecture of R. oryzae is much larger than that of the R. oryzae genome (approximately 1.
