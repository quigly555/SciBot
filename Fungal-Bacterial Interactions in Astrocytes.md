## Abstract
The number of new non-Saccharomyces yeasts has increased in recent years, and these organisms often have aneuploidy and/or chromosomal instability that can complicate the development of new drugs and therapies. Here, we present the first detailed genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This genome is remarkably similar in size to Saccharomyces globosa but encodes only 1% of the total protein and encodes only 16% of the protein-coding genes reported for yeast species. A phylogenomic analysis of this species shows that the genome sequence is derived from multiple lineage-specific gene duplications that occurred in different lineages. We also identify several chromosomal and gene duplications that occurred in S. cerevisiae before the appearance of antifungal drugs, which may be related to the establishment of pathogenicity for this fungus. The genome sequence of S. cerevisiae also provides evidence for the isolation of several novel genes from non-Saccharomyces yeasts that are absent in mammals, including one gene that is involved in the response to certain fungicidal drugs. Genome instability may be related to chromosome-specific chromosomal rearrangements and could be a driving force for the expansion of non-Saccharomyces species in the Saccharomycotinae subphylum.

Invasive fungal infections are increasingly being reported in humans, with Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans being particularly at risk. Here, Simpson et al. report genome sequences for a clinical isolate of S. cerevisiae. The genome sequence is remarkably similar to the Saccharomyces globosa genome, with only one major difference. The genome of S. cerevisiae was also remarkably conserved with many exceptions, including one large gene duplicated in another genome, and one novel gene that appeared to have arisen independently in two independent lineages. The genome sequence of a clinical isolate of S. cerevisiae was also strikingly conserved, with many single-marker-like regions sharing similarities. These data show that the genome sequence of a clinical S. cerevisiae strain is derived from multiple lineage-specific gene duplications and are therefore likely to have originated independently in multiple independent lineages.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a human fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia and meningoencephalitis mainly in AIDS patients [1]. The infection can be acquired from the environment or health care workers. C. neoformans is found in avian-associated soil and bird droppings as well as soil in avian droppings [2]. Infection is most commonly observed in immunocompromised hosts such as those with sarcoidosis, leukemia, hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and organ transplant recipients [3].

The current standard of diagnosis for cryptococcal meningitis is based on microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. However, cryptococcal disease in immunocompetent individuals is more often seen in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis usually occurs in patients with sarcoidosis, who have had prolonged follow-up with high-dose corticosteroids or with long-term treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin [4].

We herein report a case of cryptococcal meningitis in an immunocompromised patient with sarcoidosis.


## Methods
albicans (ATCC 90028) was cultured in a liquid culture medium in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37°C for 24 . The supernatants were aspirated, and the cells were then washed with PBS, and the culture medium was aspirated. The cells were then suspended in PBS and the trypsin digestion was carried out by the addition of 2 M NaCl and incubation at 37°C for 10 min. The enzyme solution was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 5 min, and the supernatant was then removed. The supernatants were then collected, and the amount of ampicillin used was determined by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm. The treatment with C. albicans (2.5 × 10^5 CFU/mL) at the same pH as RPMI medium was included as a negative control. The experiments were repeated three times.

Cell Cultures in a Medium of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)
For the development of ampicillin-resistant C. albicans biofilms, ampicillin-sensitive C. albicans (ATCC 90028) cells were cultured in a 10% (v/v) glycerol-free MEM medium at 37°C in a shaker (160 rpm). Then, the cultures were transferred to the MEM medium at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells/mL and incubated at 37°C in a shaker (160 rpm). The cells were then harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cell density was adjusted to 5 × 10^5 CFU/mL by diluting the culture with 0.5% (w/v) of MMS medium. The suspension was then used to inoculate a 96-well microtiter plate containing C. albicans culture. The culture was then incubated at 37°C in a shaker (160 rpm) until it reached a turbidity of 35% (v/v) in the presence of 60 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0) and 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. The culture was then aspirated, and the media was then aspirated. The media was then collected and then centrifuged at 10,000× g for 5 min.


## Results
To test the impact of fungal-related metabolic pathways in the fungal-host interaction, we developed a model to investigate the interactions of fungal-mediated fungal pathogenicity with the host-pathogen-pathogen interactio. To that end, we studied the fungal-host interaction in terms of host-pathogen interactions. The fungal-host interaction was first examined using the following in vitro assays. First, we observed that the fungal-host interaction induced by the fungus in the host was very similar to that observed in the absence of any fungal-host interaction (Fig 2A). Second, in the presence of the fungus, the fungal-host interaction induced by the fungus was very similar to that observed in the absence of fungal-host interaction (Fig 2B). Third, we observed a difference in the fungal-host interaction between the fungus and the fungus-host interaction (Fig 2C). These results indicate that the fungal-host interaction induced by the fungus in the host is not a simple or simple interaction with the fungus. This is also consistent with the results of the in vitro experiments showing that fungal-host interactions are induced by the fungus in asexual spores (Fig 2B), suggesting that fungal-host interactions are also induced by the fungus in the absence of fungi.

To further characterize the fungal-host interaction in terms of host-pathogen interactions, we investigated the interactions of fungal-mediated fungal-host interaction with fungal-host interactions in the host-pathogen interaction (Fig 2D). In addition, we examined fungal-host interaction with fungal-host interactions in the host-pathogen interaction (Fig 2D). The fungal-host interaction induced by the fungus in the host was similar to that induced by the fungus in the absence of fungal-host interaction (Fig 2D). Finally, we found that fungal-host interaction induced by the fungus in the host is not a simple or simple interaction with the fungus. This is also consistent with the results of in vitro experiments showing that fungal-host interaction in the absence of fungi is not a simple or simple interaction with the fungus (Fig 2C).


## Discussion
This algorithm was designed to identify and understand the ability of fungal cells to interact with and colonize human macrophage. The PMID/MAFME algorithm was based on the bioinformatics analysis of protein sequences of the genus Candida, the data mining of mRNA or protein-DNA libraries and a bioinformatics analysis of the mRNA or protein-DNA libraries. We used this bioinformatics approach to identify potential interactions between fungi and Bc. The PMID/MAFME algorithm identified 16 fungal species-of interest that were significantly associated with Bc. We also identified two fungal species-Bc. bicolor and Bc. pseudomallei. This study is the first to identify fungal species that interact with Bc. This study provides an example of an interaction between Bc. bicolor and a Bc. pseudomallei isolate.

The PMID/MAFME algorithm identified eight potentially important interactions between fungi and Bc. In addition, we identified two potentially important interactions between fungi and Bc. pseudomallei. Although we have previously identified Bc. pseudomallei as a Bc. pseudomallei strain in this study, we did not find Bc. pseudomallei in the other isolates. Based on the potential interactions between fungi and Bc. pseudomallei, we identified two potential interactions between fungi and Bc. pseudomallei. The first interaction involved interaction with Bc. pseudomallei and the second interaction involved interaction with Bc. pseudomallei and the third interaction involved interaction with Bc. pseudomallei. These results suggest that the interaction between fungi and Bc. pseudomallei may be limited and may not be completely complete.

The interaction between fungi and Bc. pseudomallei was mediated by the interaction of fungal hyphae with fungal plasma membrane. As a result, we identified an interaction between the fungus and Bc. pseudomallei. This interaction was based on the bioinformatics analysis of protein sequences of the genus Candida, and the results suggest that the fungus does not need to interact with Bc. pseudomallei to initiate this interaction. However, the interaction between Bc. pseudomallei and Bc.
