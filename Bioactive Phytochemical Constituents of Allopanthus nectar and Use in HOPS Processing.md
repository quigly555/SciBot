## Introduction
Disease response of bacteria is an important factor that leads to enormous economic impact [1,2]. For example, Staphylococcus aureus causes outbreaks of infections in healthcare facilities, causing the vast majority of infections in intensive care units and even in neutropenia [3]. The bacteria are susceptible to many antimicrobials agents, such as cephalosporins, sertraline, and prochlorazan [4,5,6,7]. The rapid development of antibiotic resistance and the increase in incidence of resistance in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria makes the public health situation of healthcare environment a public health problem [8,9,10,11]. The pathogenic bacteria cause antibiotic-resistant infections and are difficult to treat. The mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance to antibiotics in bacteria are still unclear, but some pathogenic microorganisms are known to be able to produce different kinds of hydrophobic molecules, such as peptides, that are recognized by the hydrophilic molecules [12,13,14].


## Methods
Allopanthus nectar was filtered in a .45-µm filter (Pall Corp., Freiburg, Germany) and dried in a cool place in a Petri dish at room temperature. Allopanthus nectar with a concentration of 4 mg/mL was used in the experiments.

The effect of allopanthus nectar on the growth of A. nordicum (E. nordicum) and S. venezuelae (E. venezuelae) was investigated in 3-day-old liquid nectar culture, after adding 0.5% trypan blue dye to the water-insoluble nectar, the cultures were shaken for 30 min at room temperature and visually examined under a light microscope at ×200 magnification (×200).

The influence of allopanthus nectar on the growth of the N. venezuelae (E. venezuelae) was investigated in the 4-day-old liquid nectar culture, after adding 0.5% trypan blue dye to the water-insoluble nectar, the cultures were shaken for 30 min at room temperature and visually examined under a light microscope at ×200 magnification (×200).

2.4. Nucleic Acid Isolation
The nucleic acids of allopanthus nectar were extracted by using a modified method of Li and Kwon-Chung [35]. The extracted nucleic acids were dissolved in an ultra-pure water-solution-formic solution (15 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0). The precipitated nucleic acids were dissolved in ultrapure water (1 mL) and concentrated using an ultra-pure water-solution-formic solution (15 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0). The dried nucleic acid pellets were dissolved in ultrapure water and dissolved in ultrapure water and concentrated using an ultra-pure water-solution-formic solution (15 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0).


## Results
As shown in Table 2, the active constituents of allopanthus nectar, as well as allopanthus saponification and use in HOPS processing, are listed in Table . The activities of the active constituents of allopanthus saponification and use in HOPS processing are summarized in Table 3. In addition, the activities of the active constituents of allopanthus saponification and use in HOPS processing are summarized in Table 4.

Phenolic Activity of the P. nigerininin
The activity of the P. nigerinin in the extract of P. nigerininin was determined by ELISA. The percentage of activity (Figure 4) was significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.05). The extract showed the highest activity (p < 0.05). The percentage of activity (Figure 4) was significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05). The extract showed the highest percentage of activity (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.05) (p < 0.


## Discussion
The results showed that the antioxidant activity of the plant was very low, indicating that it is a very well-studied specie. The authors considered that the antioxidant activity of the plant was related to its hydrophobic properties. They also used a high concentration of the antioxidant compounds as a control.

In addition, the antioxidant activity of the plant was determined by the GC-MS, which indicated that it was a well-studied species. The results indicated that the antioxidant activity of the plant was related to its hydrophobic properties. They also used a high concentration of the antioxidant compounds as a control.

The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 of 32.29 µg/mL, which was lower than the IC_50 value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The IC_50 value obtained for this study for allopanthus was 0.95, which is higher than the value obtained in previous studies (14-21). It was also indicated that this plant has an excellent antioxidant activity. The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 of 32.49 µg/mL, which is lower than the IC_50 value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The IC_50 value for this study for allopanthus was 0.83, which is higher than the value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 of 64.72 µg/mL, which is higher than the value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 value of 16.19 µg/mL, which is higher than the value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 value of 0.46, which is lower than the value obtained in previous studies (14-21). The results of the GC-MS of allopanthus leaves showed that it had an IC_50 value of 0.
