## Abstract
The mycobiome is an assemblage of microorganisms that include yeasts, molds and molds-like fungi-that is comprised of many yeasts with a common origin and many unique morphologies-that of mammals. Members of this mycobiome are found worldwide and are constantly challenged by environmental changes. The evolution of fungal communities has been driven by changes in the environmental factors such as the changes in the abundance of different taxa and by the changes in the abundance of specific genetic material. Changes in the environmental factors that influence the abundance of fungal communities have been described for some fungi, but other fungal groups have also been studied and documented. Functional analysis of the mycobiome has shown that the mycobiome is a dynamic dynamic complex that responds to changing environmental factors and is well-adapted for their lifestyle. These mycobiome studies suggest that the composition of fungal communities has evolved in a stable pattern that is very stable and that the functional diversity of this mycobiome will be stable over evolutionary time.


## Introduction
For over a decade, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been warning of the spread of fungal infections. At the beginning, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was one of the most common opportunistic infections, and it has since been observed to occur in over 200 countries, including the USA, Europe, and in some areas of Africa, Asia, and North America (1-4). C. neoformans is a ubiquitous yeast, capable of infecting immunocompromised patients with AIDS, solid organ transplants, and cancer (5). However, with increasing use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the mortality rate of cryptococcal meningitis has declined. This decline in the overall number of patients with cryptococcal disease has been attributed to the availability of ART in the developed world, as well as the availability of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening (6-8). The CrAg screening results in >90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, and >75% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis are seen in Sub-Saharan Africa (9, 10).

However, with the introduction of ART, the number of CrAg-positive patients has plateaued, which is partly due to the limited availability of the CrAg test in sub-Saharan Africa. The available CrAg test has low sensitivity (50-90%) and specificity (50-95%) for serum and plasma samples (11, 12). Thus, the standardization of CrAg screening has been the World Health Organization CrAg test, which is an oral blood test that can detect antibodies against CrAg (13). Currently, the CrAg test has been applied in the diagnosis of various infectious diseases including cryptococcal meningitis, cryptococcemia, and cryptococcemia, and is useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis, as well as for the detection of invasive fungal disease in immunocompromised patients (14, 15).


## Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Aberdeen.

The human experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, No. 123, No. 123, dated 11 February 1990) and were conducted according to the ethical principles outlined by the Animal Welfare Act 1986 (Australia v1.91).

Fungal isolates
The clinical isolates of C. gattii were obtained from the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS-KNAW) in the Netherlands (Table 1). A total of 20 clinical isolates (22 isolates of C. gattii and four clinical isolates of C. neoformans, C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C. gattii × C.


## Results
Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis with cryptococcal meningitis had a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-3) months of follow-up (range, 2-4. Patients with primary immunodeficiency had a median (interquartile range, 0-6) duration of follow-up (range, 0-4). The median (interquartile range, 3-5) duration of follow-up for pulmonary cryptococcosis was 2 (2-4) months. Patients with primary immunodeficiency had a median (interquartile range, 1-4) duration of follow-up for pulmonary cryptococcosis was significantly lower (P<0.001) (Table 2).

Efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis
Anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to be effective in the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis (Hampel-Brestow et al., 2016; Addis et al., 2018). This may be related to the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs (see Discussion). Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis with an established history of cryptococcal meningitis with pulmonary antiretroviral therapy were included in the study (Table 3).

Of the total patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, a median of 4 (2-6) months of follow-up was required for the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis with an established history of cryptococcal meningitis with pulmonary antiretroviral therapy were included in the study (Table 3).

Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis with an established history of pulmonary cryptococcosis with an antiretroviral therapy were included in the study (Table 3). The median duration of follow-up for pulmonary cryptococcosis with antiretroviral therapy was 5 (2-8) months (range, 0-6). Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis with an established history of pulmonary cryptococcosis with antiretroviral therapy were included in the study (Table 3).

Pulmonary cryptococcosis
Of the total patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, a median of 4 (2-6) months of follow-up was required for the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis with pulmonary antiretroviral therapy.


## Discussion
A previous report by Wielke et a. (2009) also suggested a role for pulmonary cryptococcosis in HIV-1 patients. [17] The presence of cryptococcosis in HIV-1 patients is associated with the presence of intrathecal antibody, in addition to a lack of CD4 T cell activation. [17] Another study by Orenstein et al. (2011) did not find evidence of Cryptococcus spp. in HIV-1 patients. However, they did find Cryptococcus spp. in HIV-1 patients. [17] Our patient, as well as others, have been reported to have pulmonary cryptococcosis. [19]

Patients with primary immunodeficiency are more likely to have pulmonary cryptococcosis. [2] In addition, the reported prevalence of pulmonary cryptococcosis among HIV-1 patients was 1.1% in adults, and 2.4% in children. [17] This has been attributed to the ability of HIV-1 patients to be more resistant to pulmonary cryptococcosis. [19] HIV-1 patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis have been reported to be a poor prognostic marker, with a median survival of 2 weeks after the diagnosis. [2] While a low CD4+ T cell count has been reported as an immunologic predictor for HIV-1 patients, patients with CD4+ T cell counts below 100 cells/µL are at increased risk of developing disseminated disease, including HIV-1 disease. [20]

Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of HIV infection. [21] The majority of HIV-1 patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis are older than 40 years. [2] In the United States, there are no published case reports of cryptococcosis occurring in the elderly. [2]

Cryptococcal meningitis is most often caused by C neoformans, C gattii, and C neoformans var grubii. [2] Cryptococcus spp. are rare and are most frequently found in patients with an immune deficiency and immunocompromised status.
