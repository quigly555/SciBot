## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a neglected fungal infection caused by Sporothrix spp., which are soil-borne, transmitted by soil- and air-borne fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified a novel, high-affinity sporotrichism, typified by four tandem repeats, from the Sporothrix schenckii genome, which have a mean length of 640.7 kb. The genome sequence is approximately 1.7% smaller in total than the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, and the resulting genome contains a comparatively larger (407.36 kb) number of repeats (contigena). Sequencing revealed a significantly higher sporotrichism when compared to S. cerevisiae. Sporotrichism was not only found in S. cerevisiae and S. krusei, but was also found in the Sporothrix schenckii and S. krusei clonal lineages. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a complex sporotrichism of S. cerevisiae.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased significantly over the past few decades due to the increase in immunocompromised patients, changes in dietary habits, and the use of immunosuppressive agents.1,2 Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality.3 Most patients with IA present as an alveolar macrophage that may be cleared rapidly or persist in the bloodstream,3 but when the organism enters the draining draining mononucleum, the organism may be cleared quickly. The draining mononucleum may be due to a wide range of causes, but the most likely cause is microbial infection.


## Methods
2011. Therefore, we designed and applied a competitive sequence-based approach to identify and characterize the mating-type-associated mating-complexes in our analysis.

Mating-type-associated mating-complexes were defined as a complete disruption of the mating-type-associated mating-complex, as described previously (Mudji et al. 2003, Laxman et al. 2007, Balaji et al. 2008). In addition, we used a selective pressure test to test the hypothesis that a given mating-type-associated mating-complex is determined by a given proportion of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species. We tested for the presence of the mating-type-associated mating-complex in the wild type or a species with a mating-type-associated mating-complex as well as the presence of a mating-type-associated mating-complex in a species with a mating-type-associated mating-complex.

To determine the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in a given species, we used the following formula: the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in a given species is divided by the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species. For a given species, the mating-type-associated mating-complexes are the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes per species. For a given species with a mating-type-associated mating-complex, the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in a given species is divided by the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species.

For a given species with a mating-type-associated mating-complex, the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes per species is divided by the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species. For a given species with a mating-type-associated mating-complex, the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes per species is divided by the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species.

The number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in a given species is divided by the number of mating-type-associated mating-complexes in the same species.


## Results
To do so, we examined the virulence of the two smut fungi in a mouse inhalation model of pulmonary aspergillosi.


## Discussion
The increasing incidence of drug-resistant pathogens is expected to cause a need for new drugs to be developed and marketed to treat various diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, sarcoidosis, COPD and pulmonary tuberculosis. To date, there have been only few clinical trials evaluating the use of alternative drugs in patients with HIV/AIDS. In the present study, we aimed to determine the activity of HEM-O and its potential use in treating cryptococcal meningitis. We showed that HEM-O and its potential use in treating cryptococcal meningitis is highly significant. This is because cryptococcal meningitis can be a direct consequence of immunosuppression due to the increased HIV infection. Consequently, we believe that this compound is of clinical interest in treating cryptococcal meningitis. We have previously reported that HEM-O had potent anti-cryptococcal activity in HIV patients (21). Thus, it is of interest to determine if this compound could be used as an alternative drug for treating cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients.

Our previous study demonstrated that HEM-O could significantly enhance the antifungal activity of the antifungal drug caspofungin, which was used in the current study. Our previous studies showed that HEM-O could enhance the antifungal activity of caspofungin by inhibiting the sterol 14a-demethylase gene in Cryptococcus neoformans (25). This enzyme is located on the C-terminal side of the enzyme and is essential for the synthesis of a cholesterol-type sterol 14a-demethylase (C-14a). The C-terminal side of the enzyme has been reported to be involved in the synthesis of cholesterol-type sterols and cholesterol-type precursors (26). It has been reported that HEM-O, an amino acid analogue of HEM-O, may improve the activity of caspofungin by inhibiting the sterol 14a-demethylase gene in Cryptococcus neoformans (25). HEM-O has been reported to be an antifungal agent (27).
