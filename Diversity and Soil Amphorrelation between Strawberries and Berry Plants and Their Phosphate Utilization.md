## Abstract
In the last decade, the field of proteomics has witnessed spectacular explosion of advances in both large-scale use and small-scale abstraction. Advances in bioinformatics are, therefore, extremely needed in the life sciences. In this review, we attempt to synthesize a list of emerging priorities in proteomics, with particular emphasis on proteomics not only at the individual level but also with combination proteomics and geneticomics. The number of families, species, families and species involved in proteomics are being rapidly increased in the last decade, and with them the discovery of novel applications of proteomics in different fields of life sciences. The statistical analysis section deals with proteomics with a focus on “proteomics-as well as other” sets of priorities. Areas that are currently neglected in proteomics are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the recent achievements in proteomics in different fields of life sciences.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR-VR) disease that has emerged as a major public health problem in the past two decades [1,2]. MDR-VR is a disease characterized by intense drug resistance, manifested by multi-drug resistant (MDR) cells and high drug-drug interactions [3,4,5,6]. MDR-VR is a disease characterized by severe drug resistance (CDR) to the previous drug, commonly used in the treatment of TB. A clinical outcome of MDR-VR is usually related to the development of drug-resistance to the previous drug, whereas a positive outcome is due to reduced susceptibility to the new drug [7]. For example, in a study in the UK, MDR-VR was observed more prevalent in individuals with a high CDR, while a positive outcome is due to low drug-resistance [8].

In the UK, about 750,000 people with TB were treated with antiretroviral treatment (ART) and approximately half of them died [9]. Despite the prevalence of resistance to existing drugs, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the combination of fluconazole (FLC) and caspofungin (CGA) for the treatment of patients with TB.


## Methods
Animal Studies
All animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from National Institutes of Health (NIH). The use of live animals in experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the IACUC (Approval number: 2014-01-08).

Mice
Male C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the University of California, Davis (UCLA, CA, United States). Female mice were purchased from the University of Colorado Medical Center (USC), San Francisco (USA). All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free condition and provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were provided with sterilized food and water ad libitum.

C. glabrata Strains and Growth Media
C. glabrata strain SC5314 (serotype A) was used as a wild type strain for in vivo studies. C. glabrata strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The C. glabrata SC5314 strain is a generous gift from Dr. Andrew Garde, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The strain was originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, United States). This strain was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25°C.

C. glabrata Strains and Growth Media
C. glabrata strains were cultured in liquid YPD medium (20 g/L glucose, 20 g/L peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 15 g/L peptone, 15 g/L dextrose) at 37°C and 180 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL.

## Results
fumigatus strain was measured in the presence of phosphates (phosphates [P_i] (.5)) and in the presence of phosphate buffer (PBS) (0.6) and in the presence of phosphate buffer (PBS) (0.6). The P_i values for the phosphates and PBS are presented in Table 2. The P_i values for phosphate buffers and phosphate buffer were significantly higher than the P_i values for the phosphate buffer (Table 2).

The differences in phosphate utilization between the Strawberries and Berry plants are very significant (P < 0.01). In particular, the phosphate buffer was the most effective phosphate buffer in terms of reducing the total phosphorus (Table 2). The total phosphorus was reduced by the phosphate buffer by 90% (Figure 1). However, the total phosphorus was reduced by 95% (Figure 2).

In the case of the phosphate buffer, the total phosphorus was reduced by 70% (Table 2). However, the total phosphorus was reduced by 70% in the presence of phosphate buffer (Table 2). This suggests that the phosphate buffer reduced the total phosphorus by more than 90%.

The phosphorus was significantly reduced by the phosphate buffer (Table 2). This indicates that the phosphate buffer reduced the total phosphorus by more than 90%.

As shown in Figure 3, the total phosphorus was reduced by the phosphate buffer by 90% in the presence of phosphate buffer. This indicates that the phosphate buffer reduced the total phosphorus by more than 90%.

The phosphates are the most effective phosphate buffers in terms of reducing the total phosphorus by 90% (Table 2). The P_i values for the phosphates are presented in Table 2. The P_i values for the phosphates are significantly higher than the P_i values for the phosphate buffer (Table 2).

Phosphate utilization by the Strawberries, strawberry plants, and the A. fumigatus strain is not as sensitive as the phosphate buffer

## Discussion

For the two soil microorganisms, we showed that they are able to use the nutrients from the whole sugar beet as a nutrient source for their growt. In the four sugar beet varieties studied, soil nutrients were utilized at a high rate, with average values ranging from 0.31% to 0.48% of total nutrients, which were comparable to the amount of total nutrients in the roots of strawberry. Thus, these two microorganisms are able to use sugar as a nutrient source for their growth. In addition, the symbionts of the two soil microorganisms, namely, the soil microorganisms of the four sugar beet varieties, and the soil bacteria, were able to use the combined nutrients from sugar beet root (Figure 1).

The soil bacteria of the four sugar beet varieties were able to use the combined nutrients from sugar beet root (Figure 1). For the microorganisms of the microorganisms, soil nutrients were also utilized in their growth. For instance, the soil microorganisms of the four sugar beet varieties were able to use the combined nutrients from sugar beet root (Figure 1). The soil microorganisms of the four sugar beet varieties were also able to use the combined nutrients from sugar beet root (Figure 1).
