## Abstract
The black yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is the etiological agent of mucopolysaccharidosis (CSFK) which, in humans, causes the early destruction of epithelial barriers and eventually disseminates into the blood. The in vitro antifungal activity of R. mucilaginosa has not yet been investigated. In vitro experiments have shown that R. mucilaginosa serum proteins are expressed in the plasma membrane and secreted by cells of the innate immune system. In vivo experiments show that R. mucilaginosa serum proteins are essential for the development of mucosal lesions with R. mucilaginosa-like lesions. In contrast, the in vivo effects of R. mucilaginosa in a distemper lesion are not essential for the development of the disease. In this article, we review the in vitro and in vivo studies of R. mucilaginosa, and we discuss the potential for use of this fungus as a model system to study the antifungal activity of R. mucilaginosa.


## Introduction
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal infection of the skin, mucous membranes, and nails caused by the fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Paracoccidioides lusitaniae, and Paracoccidioides lusitaniae [1]. The most common agents are dermatophytes that cause localized or systemic paracoccidioidomycosis. However, other agents, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitides, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Paracoccidioides lusitaniae, may also cause localized or systemic disease [2].


## Methods

.4. Evaluation of the Antifungal Activity of E. coli X. dendrorhous
The antifungal activity of E. coli X. dendrorhous was evaluated by the method of the previously described methods [4, 30].

4.5. Plant Derivatives and Yeast Growth
A mixture of 4-hydroxy-1,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (0.3 mL) and 1,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (0.3 mL) was used as the antifungal agent. The assay was performed in 96-well plate using a microplate reader (Eppendorf). The absorbance was read at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) and the final concentration of ethanol (0.1%) was adjusted to 100% in 96-well plate. The final concentrations of ethanol (0.1%) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (0.3 mL) were added to the solution and the plates were incubated at 35 Â°C for 48 h. The optical density of the assay solution was read at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).

## Results
. Detection of C. neoformans-P_i Genes in Prokaryotic Progenitors
The BLASTp search and the UniProt database identified a total of 634,717 protein-encoding genes in C. neoformans, including 634,717 putative protein-encoding genes (Table 1). Of these, 932,848 were expressed exclusively during the early stages of the life cycle (phase 1-6), and 7,827,651 genes were expressed in at least one of the two parental strains (Table 1). After differentiation, the expression levels of genes were further analyzed to evaluate if they might be involved in the infection of host cells and the early pathogenicity of C. neoformans. The expression levels of gene encoding proteins were investigated by qRT-PCR. The C. neoformans expression levels in non-expressing strains were analyzed by real-time PCR. The results showed that the number of C.


## Discussion
.1.2). We showed that this enzyme is expressed in N. crassa. The high expression of this enzyme in N. crassa enhances the activity of this enzyme against pathogenic fungi. The enzyme, acetyl-CoA reductase, has been shown to be essential for growth of yeast, but not for detoxification of acetyl-CoA, which is a common precursor of fatty acids. This enzyme can replace acetyl-CoA reductase, which is required for fatty acid biosynthesis. In N. crassa, acetyl-CoA reductase is expressed in all analyzed strains. In the present study, we also showed that the enzyme acetyl-CoA reductase can replace acetyl-CoA reductase in N. crassa. This enzyme is expressed in all analyzed strains, which is consistent with the earlier study of A. nidulans. This enzyme is expressed in all analyzed strains, which suggests that this enzyme can be produced in the extracellular space of A. nidulans.

Saccase activity
The biosynthesis of glucose-active enzymes by fungi requires the enzymatic activity of the enzyme de novo acetyl-CoA reductase. In this study, we performed an enzyme biosynthesis study in N. crassa. Our results showed that the enzyme activity of the enzyme de novo acetyl-CoA reductase was higher than that of the enzymatic enzyme de novo acetyl-CoA reductase. The enzyme activity of this enzyme was higher than that of the enzyme from H. werneckii, which is a fungus that has been shown to synthesize acetyl-CoA from acetate. This enzyme is expressed in N. crassa. The enzyme, acetyl-CoA reductase, is expressed in all analyzed strains, which is consistent with the earlier study of A. nidulans. This enzyme was expressed in all analyzed strains, which is similar to the previous study of A. nidulans.
