## Abstract
We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a female patient with aseptic meningitis (CM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MPMS) after transplantation. She had been post-transplantized as post-operative medicine for secondary HLCT. The patient had been treated with amphotericin and flucytosine for the treatment of HLCT. A diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was made on India ink cytology, and the patient was treated with fluconazole for the treatment of HLCT. The patient was discharged after consolidation in consciousness and healing. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of disseminated cryptococcosis in post-transplant patients who have both immunodeficiency and/or meningitis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, including patients with AIDS, patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplantation, and patients on long-term corticosteroids. In these patients, the first-line treatment for IFIs is the azole drug fluconazole. However, resistance to this drug is on the rise (Brown et al., 2012; Latelena and Aggelis, 2015).


## Methods
First, the isolation of spore samples was performed from the spore sacs and the spore secretion was detected using a UV-VIS-TEC-.2 spectrophotometer (Rico Technologies, Co. Ltd., Zhejiang, China). Second, spore samples were divided into two fractions, the first one containing the spore secretion and the second one containing the spore secretion-specific fraction. The spore secretion-specific fraction of spore samples contained spore secretion from the spore sacs. The spore secretion-specific fraction of spore samples contained spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction. The spore secretion-specific fraction of spore samples contained spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction. The spore secretion-specific fraction of spore samples contained spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction. Finally, spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction was collected. The results of spore secretion-specific and spore secretion-specific fraction separations were compared with a standard spore secretion-specific fraction.

Spore secretion inhibition assay was performed using a spore secretion assay kit (Liofilchem-China Ltd., Shanghai, China) with an indicator spore secretion (D_1) and a standard spore secretion-specific fraction (D_2). The spore secretion inhibition assay was performed in duplicate, except that the spore secretion assay was performed in duplicate with the spore secretion assay kit. The spore secretion inhibition assay was performed in duplicate, except that spore secretion inhibition was observed in spore secretion inhibition from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction. The spore secretion inhibition assay was performed in duplicate, except that spore secretion inhibition was observed in spore secretion inhibition from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction. The spore secretion inhibition assay was performed in duplicate, except that spore secretion inhibition was observed in spore secretion inhibition from the spore secretion from the spore secretion from the spore secretion-specific fraction.


## Results
Sequencing of the C. neoformans-C. spermidiella-host resistance gene cluster
The C. neoformans-C. spermidiella-host resistance gene cluster (CNAG_03587) was identified in the C. neoformans genome. The C. neoformans genome encodes an enzyme in the biosynthesis of the key enzymes of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, including two putative siderophores, CNAG_00789 and CNAG_08786, and four orthologues, CNAG_06495, CNAG_06802, and CNAG_08674. The gene cluster of C. neoformans-C. spermidiella-hosts resistance contains three putative genes, CNAG_03587, CNAG_01758, and CNAG_06802. The gene cluster of C. neoformans-C. spermidiella-hosts resistance contains four putative genes, CNAG_03587, CNAG_01758, and CNAG_08674, and one orthologue, CNAG_06495, in addition to the putative siderophores CNAG_03587 and CNAG_01758. The gene cluster of C. neoformans-C.


## Discussion
pombe, . cerevisiae, and S. japonicus, were included in this analysis. The fungal community composition was dominated by the co-regulated fungi. The high levels of co-regulated fungal genes in the present analysis are consistent with previous reports that many of these fungal species have high levels of copper resistance (e.g., de Jonge et al. 2010). The high levels of copper resistance in fungi may be attributed to the copper/di-substrate transporters that are highly expressed in S. cerevisiae (e.g., Hac1, Hac2, Hac3, Hac4) that are implicated in copper transport (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Mg transporters in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans) and are often activated in response to copper deficiency (e.g., Hac1, Hac2, Hac3, Hac4) (Table 2). The high levels of copper resistance in the present analysis were also observed in other S. cerevisiae species (e.g., S. pombe) and in the presence of high levels of copper in the growth medium (Supplementary Data 1). The high levels of copper resistance in the present species could be due to the fact that S. cerevisiae is a symbiont of plants and it is the second most common S. cerevisiae species (after S. pombe), which is similar to the high copper resistance in the present species (Bai et al. 2010).

Among the co-regulated fungi, the co-regulated fungi were primarily represented by the well-characterized species C. albicans and S. pombe. The presence of this species in the core fungal community composition is a characteristic feature of the C. albicans species complex and the presence of these species has been previously observed in other fungal species (Bao et al. 2015). C. albicans is a member of the C. albicans complex and is frequently observed in environmental samples (e.g., the soil of the soybean plant that is a major reservoir of C. albicans in soybean plants) (Gao et al. 2009). C. albicans and S.
