## Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory fungal infection in HIV-infected patients and its correlation with the diagnosis of respiratory infection (RIs).

In this cross-sectional study, HIV-infected patients were enrolled in the Changhua Virtual Health Consortium (HKC) clinical research center, which included a co-payment center and a hospital outpatient clinic. The HKC was comprised of two outpatient clinics: the first in the morning and the second in the morning clinic. Patients were recruited from morning interviews with caregivers and daily cough samples to determine the presence of fungal infection. We collected respiratory samples from 54 subjects with no respiratory infection, from the first visit with a caregiver, from samples submitted to the respiratory isolation room twice daily and from samples collected from participants with suspected fungal infection. The results showed a consistent correlation between the presence of fungal infection and presence of both caregiver and patient alike, regardless of the day of visit or whether samples were submitted to the examination. The RIs were characterized by the following categories: Those with lung involvement, Kaposi sarcoma of skin, skin, lung and bone, and lung neoplasia, as well as those with acute respiratory failure.

Among the 55 respondents, 56% had a known history of respiratory failure before enrollment in HKC. The most common reasons for recruitment were abdominal pain and phlegmy cough. 27% of respondents were hospitalized due to respiratory failure; 18% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 2% had COPD and none of them were HIV infected. Respondents’ demographic and clinical data were similar regardless whether they were interviewed or not. Our evaluation showed that among the 55 participants, only 16 were hospitalized due to respiratory failure and 10 were diagnosed with respiratory failure.

Complaint processing greatly influences the choice of patients for the diagnosis of respiratory infection. Complaint processing is an integral part of the outpatient clinic evaluation process. Health Canada supports complaint processing for HIV infected patients with a diagnosis of respiratory infection, but the system is still too slow to provide definitive results.

## Methods
Patients and design
This study was performed at University Hospital of Pune, India (UNIPROT) from January 2009 to December 2011. In this study, we included the patients who underwent reticuloplasty in the Department of Pathology, Medical College of a Medical University of Pune, at the time of enrolment. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Medical College of a Medical University of Pune, and the retrospective and case-control studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical College of a Medical University of Pune, India, under the protocol number 2017-07-14.

The patients included in this study were treated at the University Hospital of Pune, India, from January 2009 to December 2011. Twenty-seven patients who underwent reticuloplasty in the department of pathology were enrolled consecutively into the study. The clinical characteristics of the patients included age at hospitalisation, gender, height, weight, chest circumference, diameter of neck, and diameter of the anterior wall of the vena cava. The rectal opening was examined under a microscope with a sterile cotton swab to confirm the results of reticuloplasty. The blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein from the male patient and collected at the time of the reticuloplasty and the time of the female patient. The blood samples were subsequently centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min to collect the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the white blood cells (WBC) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The results of both the pulmonary and the cerebrospinal fluid cultures were recorded by using standard techniques. The lung and the CSF samples were also subjected to the same techniques as the lung and the CSF samples.


## Results
A majority of patients (56/72; 80%) were on antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 weeks (Table 1.

The median time between the diagnosis and the emergence of A/B/CT/CT/CT was 8.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 8.8-19.3), with a median duration of 6.5 months (IQR: 5.3-17.1), and the median CD4+ T-cell count was 40 cells/mm^3 (IQR: 36.7-89.5). The prevalence of the other subtypes varied between 38.6% (IQR: 31.8-54.1) and 38.6% (IQR: 32.0-57.6), and ranged from 22.6% (IQR: 20.4-46.1) to 43.3% (IQR: 42.6-67.3).

Mortality
The death rate was 10.7 patients/100,000/100,000 per year (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.9-14.9), and the mean number of deaths was 20/100,000 (95% CI: 12.3-21.9). The incidence of death was 22.9% (95% CI: 18.2-32.9), and the 95% CI was calculated with Kaplan Meier Meier’s post-hoc test, and the 95% CI was calculated with the Cochrane database.

Mortality was associated with treatment failure (OR: 1.50 (95% CI: 1.39-2.52), p = 0.001) and comorbidities (OR: 2.10 (95% CI: 2.08-4.31), p = 0.003). At baseline, patients with DURs of < 1 day had significantly lower odds of death (OR: 3.50 (95% CI: 1.40-5.21), p < 0.001).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict at baseline, at 2, 4, and 6 months mortality.


## Discussion
These results suggest that BCL-A and BCL-E play an important role in the pathogenesis of CCLB/CLN/JLN in CCLB/CLN/JLN-/- mic.

The effect of BCL-D and BCL-E on BCL-A, BCL-C and BCL-D and the severity of disease in the absence of BCL-C was further evaluated in the presence of CCLB/CLN/JLN. The levels of BCL-D and BCL-E were significantly increased in the presence of CCLB/CLN/JLN-/- mice. These results suggest that BCL-D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CCLB/CLN/JLN in CCLB/CLN/JLN-/- mice.
