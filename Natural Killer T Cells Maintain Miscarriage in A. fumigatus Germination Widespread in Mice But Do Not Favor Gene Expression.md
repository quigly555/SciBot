## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that commonly causes pneumonia and meningoencephalitis. However, reports of host-induced fungal pneumonia are rare. We report the case of a 27-year-old Caucasian male with untreated lung cancer, who had been treated with chemotherapy. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple small nodules in right lower lobe consolidation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lavage fluid showed evidence of granulomatous nodular opacities in both lungs, with cryptococcal granulomatous inflammation. Antifungal therapy was initiated, and our patient improved after the administration of ten ganciclovir daily. However, within a few days, the administration of ganciclovir-etoxazole twice and flucytosine twice reduced the lung lesions and enlarged the size of the lesions, and the fungal burden in both lung mononuclear cells and macrophages increased. Thus, the administration of ganciclovir-etoxazole twice and flucytosine twice restored the lung lesions and cryptococcal granulomatous inflammation, and the cryptococcal burden in both lung mononuclear cells and macrophages increased. These findings support the therapeutic efficacy of ganciclovir in treating lung cancer.


## Introduction
The fungus resides in the vascular system and can cause disease on different plant species, including soybean, sugarcane, citrus, and other citrus fruits [2. Despite the availability of potent antifungal drugs, the majority of rice blast disease is caused by M. oryzae and the disease is considered a threat to global food security [3].

The rice blast fungus M. oryzae can also cause infection in humans and animals [4], [5]. Inhalation of conidia by the host induces the secretion of the life-cycle-inducing enzymes Fusarium tolae and tolagellate and scedula-to-to-to-to-to form a growing trama, which then propagates to form the infection zone. When the fungus is contained, the disease can spread to neighboring hosts, causing grain yield losses [6].

The rice blast fungus M. oryzae can be cultured in vitro for long periods in carbon-carbon dioxide (CO_2) and carbon-containing media [7], [8]. The CO_2 levels are controlled by the transcription factor, CO_2, which is expressed in response to the CO_2 levels [9]. Once CO_2 levels exceed threshold concentrations, CO_2 production is inhibited and then activated by a variety of enzymes, including N-acetyl-D-glucosamine dehydrogenase (NAdd1), the acetyl-coA-dependent acetylase, and the diauxic acid reductase, which converts CO_2 to acetyl-D-glucosamine. The acetyl-CoA is converted to D-galactofuranose by D-galactofuranosyltransferase (DGAT), which is expressed in response to glucose and galactofuranose [10]. D-galactosyltransferases are part of the metalloprotease complex and are critical for the transition of various proteins from glucose to galactose in M. oryzae [11].


## Methods
fumigatus, we used a well-established protocol described by Wipes et a. [9]. Briefly, 5 × 10^5 conidia/mL were inoculated into 1 mL of RPMI 1640 media and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. Subsequently, the media were harvested and washed three times with distilled water. The cells were counted by hemocytometer and adjusted to a concentration of 10^6 conidia/mL. The samples were then used to infect A. fumigatus and the suspension was inoculated on GFP-expressing conidia. The inoculated plates were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C.

FK506 and RFP Enzyme Assays
To evaluate the effect of FKBP12 and GFP on the germination of A. fumigatus A. fumigatus, we used a well-established protocol described by Wipes et al. [9]. Briefly, 10 × 10^5 conidia/mL were inoculated into 1 mL of RPMI 1640 media and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the media were harvested and washed three times with distilled water. The cells were counted by hemocytometer and adjusted to a concentration of 10^6 conidia/mL. The samples were then used to infect A. fumigatus and the suspension was inoculated on RFP-expressing conidia. The inoculated plates were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C.

Electron Microscopy
Conidia were washed three times with sterile PBS and fixed with methanol. The samples were post-fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 2 h, washed three times with distilled water and post-fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde for 4 h. The samples were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, washed three times with distilled water and post-fixed in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 h. The samples were post-fixed with 4% formaldehyde and post-fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 2 h. The samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) and critical-point-dried in a critical-point acid-urea critical point dryer (Pierce, Rockford, IL).


## Results
fumigatus-infected mice was caused by aberrant MHC-II expression, we conducted a gene expression experiment using the live H99 strain of . fumigatus. The MHC-II-CM-associated MHC-II-CM mononuclear cell line, CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells, were transfected with the GFP-tagged MHC-II-CM, and their expression was analyzed by real-time PCR (Fig 5A). The percentage of the cells expressing GFP-tagged MHC-II-CM was lower in the GFP-tagged MHC-II-CM mononuclear cell line than in the control mononuclear cells, as shown by the significant difference in the percentage of the cells expressing GFP-tagged MHC-II-CM between the two controls (Fig 5B). These data suggest that the mononuclear cell MHC-II-CM are a major target for the A. fumigatus homing signals.

In order to verify the contribution of H99 to MHC-II-CM signaling, we analyzed the expression of the MHC-II-CM-associated markers CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells in the MHC-II-CM mononuclear cell lines of the A. fumigatus-infected mice. Our data revealed that the MHC-II-CM-associated markers CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells are the most highly expressed in the A. fumigatus-infected mice, and we found that the percentage of CD4^+ T cells expressing CD8^+ T cells was significantly higher in the MHC-II-CM-associated mononuclear cell line of the A. fumigatus-infected mice than in the control mononuclear cell line (Fig 5C). These data suggest that the MHC-II-CM are likely to be a major target for the A. fumigatus homing signals.

The MHC-II-CM-associated MHC-II-CM mononuclear cell lines have been shown to be a major target for A.


## Discussion
In . fumigatus, gene expression has been shown to be highly dependent on cell cycle, asexual reproduction, and development [37]. However, although a large number of genes are involved in cell cycle, these genes are also involved in the cell cycle, and thus the results suggest that gene expression is not a determinant of germ tube development or cell growth. However, there is no clear clear evidence that gene expression is an independent predictor of germ tube development in A. fumigatus, which is in line with other studies in the Aspergillus spp. where both cell cycle and cell size are independently associated with gene expression [38]. The reason for the inconsistent results with the A. fumigatus cell cycle is not clear, however it is possible that the gene expression changes during the cell cycle. In the current study, we used gene expression data to show that gene expression is independent of cell cycle, but dependent on cell size and developmental parameters. Our data show that gene expression is independent of cell cycle, and that the results in both mating and germ tube development are independent of cell size. The observation that the results in both mating and germ tube development are independent of cell size raises the possibility that the results in both mating and germ tube development are independent of cell size.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated that the gene expression data generated from spontaneous mating and germ tube development are reliable and useful for evaluating gene expression and that the results can be used to understand gene expression and gene function. The results can be used to identify candidate genes and therefore provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms involved in gene expression regulation and cell cycle progression. However, gene expression data cannot be used for the identification of genes involved in cell cycle or cell growth. The data generated from spontaneous mating and germ tube development can be used for the identification of genes involved in cell cycle and cell growth.
