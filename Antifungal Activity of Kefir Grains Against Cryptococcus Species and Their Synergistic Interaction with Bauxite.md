## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a globally distributed fungus that is an opportunistic pathogen that has caused thousands of deaths in human disease. This fungus is typically found growing as a filamentous hyphal structure in the environment and as a cosmopolitan fungus in animals, including humans. In contrast, the sexual morphology of C. neoformans is a result of sexual transmission. Whole genome duplication in C. neoformans provides an opportunity to examine the genetic mechanisms underlying the sexual morphology of this fungus. We first identify genes involved in the sexual reproduction system in C. neoformans by comparing the genomes of 17 strains and isolates with similar mating patterns. Comparative analyses also identify novel gene clusters involved in sexual reproduction and suggest that sexual reproduction may be regulated by different genes. Surprisingly, we find that the mating type of C. neoformans differs significantly from the haploid, unisexual mating seen in C. neoformans var. grubii. Intriguingly, we also find that genes involved in stress response and the endosymbiotic gene flagellum-1 may be linked to the mating ability of C. neoformans. We conclude that the mating of C. neoformans is a major innovation that could facilitate its adaptation to biotrophic conditions in animals and help it to survive in host tissues.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcosis, an important life-threatening disease. An understanding of the mechanisms regulating mating in C. neoformans is critical for the establishment of improved treatments and drug design for the cryptococcosis caused by this fungus. The mating type of this fungus differs significantly from that of C. neoformans var. grubii (C. neoformans VNI), the closely related species, which has the advantage of mating in simpler ecological niches. To investigate the mating mechanism of this yeast pathogen, we used comparative genomic analysis to find genes involved in mating between two strains of C. neoformans, C. albicans (VGII) and C. gattii (VGIII), and two isolates of C. gattii (VGIV) with different mating patterns. Almost all genes affected by single-gene or multi-gene transcription, as well as mating in the mating of these strains, were located in the same gene pocket.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes disease predominantly in immunocompromised individuals. Inhalation of aerosolized spores or desiccated fungi is the primary mode of inoculation of this pathogen into the lungs and can result in life-threatening disease. The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system (CNS) and skin (1-3). Invasive cryptococcal disease is caused by two major species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcal species are predominantly zoonotic, and the number of deaths due to cryptococcal meningitis is unknown (4, 5). The most common manifestation of cryptococcosis is pulmonary infection and its management is not well understood.

Cryptococcosis is most commonly observed in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In the CNS, Cryptococcus neoformans is usually found in the immunocompromised population, but cryptococcosis can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals (6).


## Methods
The reduction in ampicillin was determined in Kefir broth with the Kefir Penicillin reductase enzym. The amount of reducing ampicillin (ß-ampicillin) was calculated according to the formula: [ß-ampicillin] × [ß-ampicillin] (0-100 µg/mL).

The analysis of the activities of the inhibitory activities of Kefir Grains was performed using the method of Foucet and Fegelman [28]. The method of Foucet and Fegelman was described by firstly, to determine the inhibitory effects of Kefir Grains on the viability of S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae was grown in a conical flask and was inoculated with 200 µL of Kefir broth and then kept in the dark at 28 °C for 5 h. The diameter of the flask was measured at the end of the incubation time. The decrease in the diameter of the flask was expressed as a percent inhibition of viable S. cerevisiae growth in the absence of Kefir broth. The inhibition rate (%) was calculated as the % inhibition of viable growth for Kefir broth compared with the control. The quantitative data were presented as the means ± SD.

Analytical methods
The chemical analyses of Kefir broth were performed as described by Kan and Underhill [29]. The Kefir broth was centrifuged (12,000 g for 30 min), the supernatant was collected and the supernatant was analyzed by GC and TMS using a Q Exactive Plus high performance liquid chromatograph (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The carrier gas was helium and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was maintained at 70 °C.

The analysis of the activities of Kefir Grains was performed using the method of Gargas and Srinivasan [30]. The method of Gargas and Srinivasan was performed by firstly, to determine the inhibitory effects of Kefir Grains on the viability of S. cerevisiae. S.
