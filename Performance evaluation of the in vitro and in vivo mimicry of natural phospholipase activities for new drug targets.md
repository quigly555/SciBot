## Abstract
Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen, which causes acute oral, and systemic, infections. Fluconazole (FLC) is a non-classifiable antifungal therapy used in clinical therapy. This study investigated the in vitro antifungal activity of FLC against C. albicans and its potential interactions with amphotericin B (AMB) and caspofungin.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of FLC and FLCL showed a synergistic effect against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. The interactions were observed when AMB was given for 10 min and FLC for 24 h. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of FLC and FLCL were determined after a broth microdilution assay.

FKC inhibited the growth of fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant C. albicans by a mechanism that was independent from the other studied antifungals. The MIC values for FLC and FLCL showed that these drugs had a synergistic effect when combined. FLC also exhibited a synergistic effect with amphotericin on the growth of C. albicans. The interactions were observed with AMB and caspofungin.

FKC inhibited the growth of C. albicans and was synergistic when used in combination with amphotericin. Combination with either FLC or FLCL showed a synergistic effect against C. albicans in combination. The MIC values for FLC and FLCL showed that the synergistic effect occurred when FLC was combined with amphotericin. Combination of FLC and FLCL showed a synergistic effect when combined with amphotericin.

FKC inhibited the growth of C. albicans and was synergistic when used in combination with amphotericin.


## Introduction
The ability to activate immune cells in response to microbial pathogens is an important aspect of the pathogenesis of many human diseases. In particular, the ability to sense microbial infections is essential for the development of specific innate immune responses. Infection with bacteria is a common cause of multi-organ failure (1, 2), whereas the ability to recognize foreign pathogens in the field can be lifesaving (3-5). Infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are also a common cause of death in the immunocompromised patient (6). In the infectious milieu, the most common causes of infections are Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Mycobacterium haemophilum (MT) (7). However, as well as TBM, MT is also associated with other infectious diseases including malaria, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, leukemia, asthma, and autoimmune diseases (8). The infection mechanism of MTB is related to the process of immune cell adhesion (9). However, while the role of neutrophils in MTB has been well-established, their contribution to the host defense against the pathogen is still largely unknown (10).

Neutrophils are key players in the host defense against Mtb, which can progress to tuberculosis (11). Although neutrophils have been well-characterized in many infectious diseases, their role in the host defense against MTb remains poorly understood (12). Although neutrophils can produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, the precise role of neutrophils in the defense against Mtb remains largely unknown. Histiocytes are lymphocytes that are essential for the development of innate immune responses (13). These cells are found in both monocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow. Upon exposure to Mtb, macrophages produce IL-12, and macrophages can produce IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17, which are required for the development of the adaptive immune response (14). However, the precise function of macrophages in the host defense against Mtb remains largely unknown. In this study, we have studied the function of macrophages in the host defense against Mtb, using two main approaches. First, we examined the ability of macrophages to produce IL-12 and IL-17 in response to Mtb.


## Methods
 µM of the active peptide for 24 h at 30 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH .0, and 50 mM NaCl. The wells were washed twice with sterile PBS, and the obtained peptides were diluted to 1.0 µM with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mM NaCl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm for 30 min, for the final 3 h. The reagents were removed from the wells and the peptides were again diluted to 1.0 µM with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mM NaCl. The reaction was terminated with 20% v/v Triton X-100, and the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and the amount of the active peptide in the supernatant was determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Pierce). The amount of the in vitro effect of the potential drug was calculated using the following equation: [Abs] = [(2-Abs] × (1-Abs)) / (2-Abs)]. The results were expressed as nmol/mg.

Bioinformatic Analysis
The in vitro activity of a novel protein against a clinical isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was determined using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System. The assay was performed in duplicates and the data were analyzed by the 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method. Data were analyzed using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager version 3.0. The assay was repeated three times. The internal standard curve (F-C) was used to determine the specificity of the assay. The assay was repeated three times, and the values were corrected for the background value. The relative quantification of the in vitro activity was calculated using the formula: [Abs] × [(F-abs)] × (2^-Abs)]/ (2^-abs)).

Phospholipase assays
The phospholipase activity was evaluated on S. cerevisiae BY4741. The assay was performed in duplicates and the data were analyzed by the 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.


## Results
Accordingly, we hypothesized that these peptides could potentially act as molecular mimicry agents for natural phospholipase inhibitors and further develop new drugs against phytohormone.

Phylogenetic analysis of a set of 1,5-Dichlorophenylprolyl phytohormones demonstrated that DPPH and DPPH- and DPPH-based phytohormones were functionally similar to the endogenous or endogenous phospholipid pathway (Supplementary Fig S6). To test our hypothesis that phytohormones may act in parallel with phytohormones, we investigated the in vivo activity of phytohormones as they are commonly used to treat plant infections.

Phytohormones induce plant epidermal growth and aflatoxin production
We first sought to determine the in vitro activities of phytohormones in vitro. We first determined the in vitro activities of phytohormones for the purpose of testing their in vivo in vitro in vitro ability for in vitro phytohormone and plant pathogenicity.


## Discussion

Previous studies have demonstrated that classical phospholipase inhibitors are highly potent inhibitors of cell wall synthesis and expression of genes for cell wall synthesi. The in vivo inhibitory effects of the classical phospholipase inhibitors have been attributed to their potent anti-inflammatory properties and their potent and selective anti-inflammatory activity. However, in the present study, we found that the in vitro phospholipase activity of this drug target is inhibited by C. albicans. C. albicans is a cell wall-degrading, halophilic, proinflammatory, and stress-tolerant species, which is widely distributed across the plant kingdom. In addition, it is a hyphal-stomating, non-pathogenic species that is capable of colonizing various parts of the body. However, it is also reported that it is unable to utilize cortisone, an inhibitor of the mammalian glucan synthase (glutathione reductase) pathway, in vivo and in vitro. As such, these results are expected to be interpreted in the context of the in vitro and in vivo studies.

Interestingly, in the present study, we found that the inhibition of calcineurin (CrzA) activity by C. albicans does not correlate with the anti-inflammatory activity of the drug. This is likely due to the fact that CrzA is an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor, which was originally identified in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, which encodes for both the CrzA and calcineurin inhibitor, ciclopirox, which is used in the treatment of allergic pulmonary adenocarcinoma (18). Another possible explanation for the observed effect of C. albicans on CrzA activity is due to the fact that CrzA is a known target of calcineurin inhibitors (22). However, the mechanisms of action of calcineurin inhibitors against fungal infections are still poorly understood.

The results of the present study showed that the calcineurin inhibitor CzCrzA has a potent anti-inflammatory effect. However, the impact of CzCrzA on the cellular responses to stress in C. albicans is not as well studied as the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug. One possibility is that the expression of genes for cell wall synthesis and degradation is not sufficient to arrest the growth of C.
