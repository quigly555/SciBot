## Abstract
Diseases caused by Candida species have become a global concern due to the increase in antifungal resistance and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains that are gaining popularity in clinical settings. In this study, we investigated the presence of major molecular virulence factors, morphological alterations, and the emergence of MDR strains that are resistant to fluconazole, in the fungal plant pathogen, Candida albicans. In order to understand the molecular basis of the emergence of MDR strains resistant to fluconazole, we used whole genome sequencing of the yeast Scedosporium anisophilae, the causative agent of candidiasis, and screened the genomes of 153 strains to identify genes that encode proteins associated with antifungal resistance.

We screened the genomes of 183 isolates of Candida albicans (n = 57), and selected genes that were associated with MDR fitness, including protease inhibitor 1, sterol 14a-demethylase, and sterol desaturase encoding enzymes. The results showed that the genomes of all the isolates of C. anisophilae contained two to nine genes encoding proteins associated with antifungal resistance. The genes were homologous to several proteins of the Neurospora crassa protease, which encodes a demethylase that prevents protein secretion. The antifungal susceptibility of isolates of C. albicans differed from those of other Candida species (Scedosporium), but the number of these genes was higher than that of other fungi. The gene content of the secretory pathway was similar among the isolates of C. albicans, but the genes that regulate protein metabolism were different between isolates of C. albicans. The high virulence of isolates of C. albicans did not correlate with the levels of other proteins, e.g., sterol 14a-demethylase and the SOD-like protein ENV1, which encodes a sulfone synthetase that acts as a virulence factor. We conclude that the high virulence of isolates of C. albicans is due to the ability to use different metals and to tolerate different stresses and to tolerate the availability of different sugars.

## Introduction
Infection with a fungal pathogen can be caused by a single fungus or may involve multiple fungi or multiple species in the same host. Host-mediated immunity is required to eliminate the pathogen and can lead to fungal-specific disease processes, such as tissue necrosis, adhesion, tissue invasion, or pneumonitis, depending on the fungus involved [1]. In addition to direct immunological responses, several immune responses, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, can contribute to the pathogenesis of human fungal infections. In vitro studies have demonstrated that macrophages and neutrophils, which account for a significant fraction of the total cellular immune response to fungi [2], are critical mediators of host defense against Candida spp. The ability to discriminate between fungi and commensals can be associated with the production of phagocytes that recognize pathogen-associated patterns and initiate protective responses. A number of studies have demonstrated that macrophages are key players in host defense against fungi in invasive fungal infections [3], [4]. Therefore, there is an increased interest in the role of neutrophils in fungal pathogenesis in the search for a better understanding of the innate immune response against this disease. Neutrophils contribute to the host defense against Candida spp. by mediating the host immune response against the pathogen. This ability is critical for control of pathogen-associated infection and the control of fungal pathogenesis.

The role of neutrophils in the control of fungal disease is generally attributed to their ability to produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [5]. Increased IL-17 induces increased levels of IL-17A and IL-22, which are two cytokines secreted by neutrophils in vitro. These cytokines are thought to play an important role in the control of pathogen infection [6]. On the other hand, IL-23 induces the production of interleukin-4 (IL-23), a cytokine secreted by neutrophils in vitro [7]. IL-23 has been shown to promote the killing of fungi by neutrophils and to induce neutrophil apoptosis [8]. IL-23 induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-12, IL-33, and TNF-a [9].


## Methods

The antibodies used in this study were as follows: antigens against Cryptococcus neoformans (D1 and D3), MCP-1, CD4, CD8, and CD45, as well as the antigens against Pneumocystis jirovecii (D3), Candida albicans (D3), Cryptococcus neoformans (D2), and . parapsilosis (D3), C. tropicalis (D3), and C. krusei (D3).

The organisms used in this study were C. glabrata, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis, as well as C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. krusei, C. krusei, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis. All the samples were inoculated by autoclaving at 121 °C for 60 min. The inoculated agar pieces were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serially diluted in sterile PBS. The final concentration of the antigens was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^4 colony-forming units/mL.

C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis were incubated in a 2-ml culture in 2 mL Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C for 24 h. The fungal cells were washed with PBS three times and resuspended in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 1 × 10^4 colony-forming units/mL. The culture was incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO_2 incubator. The fungal cells were washed with PBS three times and resuspended in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 1 × 10^4 colony-forming units/mL. The culture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The fungal cells were harvested and washed with PBS three times and resuspended in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 1 × 10^4 colony-forming units/mL. The culture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO_2 incubator.


## Results
Diversity of fungi and metazoan phyla
The fungal and metazoan species richness (B_EF) is calculated as the relative abundance of each of the fungal phyla represented in the B_EF of the isolated fungus, the metazoan species richness (B_M) is calculated as the relative abundance of the fungi in the isolated metazoan species, and the B_EF is calculated as the relative abundance of the metazoan species in the isolated metazoan species. The B_EF for the isolated fungal species is shown in Fig 1. The B_EF of fungi is in the range of 0.56-0.77. The B_EF of metazoan species is in the range of 0.84-0.85. The B_EF of metazoan species is in the range of 0.06-0.35. The B_EF of fungi is in the range of 0.27-0.37. The B_EF of metazoan species is in the range of 0.03-0.11. The B_EF of fungi is in the range of 0.03-0.15. The B_EF of metazoan species is in the range of 0.03-0.17. The B_EF of fungi is in the range of 0.03-0.14.


## Discussion
albicans and . neoformans was evaluated. In contrast to the synergistic effect of human antigens against C. albicans, the synergistic effect of human antigens against C. neoformans was observed in the presence of different antigens, which is in line with the result of the previous study [29]. This result suggests that the synergistic effect of antigens may be related to the morphological and immunological changes that occur in the infected skin. In addition, the synergistic effect of antifungal drugs may be due to the fact that they inhibit the growth of the fungal pathogen.

The most potent antifungal drug, voriconazole, was also evaluated against C. neoformans. The drug exhibited strong antifungal activity against C. neoformans and also showed activity against C. gattii, whereas it showed no activity against C. albicans. The synergistic effect of voriconazole against C. neoformans could be due to the fact that it was used in the treatment of C. neoformans infections.

The synergistic effect of amphotericin B against C. neoformans was demonstrated. The drug showed strong antifungal activity against C. neoformans and also showed activity against C. albicans. This result indicated that the synergistic effect of amphotericin B against C. neoformans could be due to the fact that the drug is used in the treatment of fungal infections.

The synergistic effect of fluconazole against C. albicans was also evaluated. The drug showed strong antifungal activity against C. albicans. The synergistic effect of fluconazole against C. albicans could be due to the fact that the drug is used in the treatment of C. albicans infections.

The synergistic effect of triazoles against C. neoformans was observed. The drug showed strong antifungal activity against C. neoformans and also showed activity against C. gattii. This result indicated that the synergistic effect of triazoles against C. neoformans could be due to the fact that the drug is used in the treatment of fungal infections.
