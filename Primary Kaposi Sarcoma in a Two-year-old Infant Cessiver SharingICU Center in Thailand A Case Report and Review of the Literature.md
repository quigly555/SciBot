## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the EUCAST protocol against Candida species and other pathogenic Candida species.

Nine strains were tested against ESBL and D5N9 rDNA reference strains (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and MEC) by broth microdilution method. The in vitro activity of EUCAST was determined by determining the minimum concentration (MIC) and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) at 30 min after treatment.

The MIC50 values for EUCAST were 1.0 g/mL for Candida glabrata, 1.2 g/mL for Candida tropicalis, 4.8 g/mL for Candida krusei, 4.8 g/mL for Candida dubliniensis, 4.8 g/mL for Candida lusitaniae, 4.8 g/mL for Candida guilliermondii, 4.8 g/mL for Candida duobushaemalis, 4.8 g/mL for Candida kefyr, 4.8 g/mL for Candida terreus, 4.8 g/mL for Candida glabrata, 4.8 g/mL for Candida duobushaemalis, 4.8 g/mL for Candida kefyr, 4.8 g/mL for Candida tropicalis, and 8.8 g/mL for Candida krusei.

The findings of this study indicate that EUCAST can be an effective treatment against potentially pathogenic Candida species with a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and an effective minimal side effect (MSE). However, the bacteriostatic activity of EUCAST against these Candida species was very low, and its MIC is equivalent to that of fluconazole, therefore, its use in therapy is recommended.


## Introduction
Macrophages are key players in many biological processes, including tissue remodeling and inflammation, and are important for the immune response to pathogens, particularly infections. However, it has been reported that macrophages can also activate and down-regulate immune responses, thereby promoting infection and death of macrophage-depleted mice (1-3). Macrophages can be classified into two types based on the size of their phagosome and the antigen presentation pathway (4,5). Type I macrophages, which include macrophages from the lymphatic system, are secretory macrophages that fuse with the pro-inflammatory Th1 subset, whereas type II macrophages, which include macrophages from the bone marrow, are the resident macrophages in the skin and granulomas (6-8).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of macrophage type II and type I macrophages on the severity of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis in BALB/C mice. We hypothesized that type II macrophages influence allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, while type I macrophages were associated with allergic bronchitis. In addition, we hypothesized that type I macrophages are involved in allergic bronchitis, while type II macrophages are involved in allergic bronchitis. To test these hypotheses, we tested the effect of type I macrophage on the severity of the pulmonary mycosis and the association between macrophage type I and mycosis was investigated in BALB/C mice. The impact of macrophage type I on the severity of mycosis was also examined in BALB/C mice. Finally, we hypothesized that macrophage type I and type II could be associated with the development of chronic pulmonary disease.


## Methods
Strains and media
The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were listed in Table 1. All of the strains were maintained on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) plates at 30 째C with shaking at 200 rpm.

Preparation of strains
Strains were maintained on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) slants at 30 째C with shaking at 200 rpm. Yeast cultures were prepared by growing S. cerevisiae in 10 ml YPD broth at 30 째C for 24 h, after which all of the slants were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min at 4 째C. The slants were then used for the preparation of S. cerevisiae strain CBS138C.

Construction of strains
To construct a deletion mutant of S. cerevisiae gene, we generated a deletion cassette containing the hygromycin resistance gene (hph) under the control of the wild-type gene. The hygromycin resistance gene was amplified from pCB1 [62] using primers hph-F and hph-R [63] and cloned into pCB1 [63]. The hygromycin resistance gene was amplified from pCB1 using primers hyg-F and hyg-R [64] and cloned into pCB1. The hygromycin resistance gene was amplified from pCB1 using primers hyg-F and hyg-R [64]. The deletion cassette was then transformed into the WT strain using the lithium acetate method [65].

## Results
IMAFECT-A-IV and Mycobacterium Mor.
In a Clinical Case of Infant CessivingICU Center, a Patient With Clinical Mycobacterium Morp. died within 2 weeks of admission and the cause of death was confirmed by histopathology. The patient's family is very supportive and he was in good health. The patient was admitted to a pediatric ICU, and the patient's condition deteriorated. The patient was transferred to a hospital for another analysis.

## Discussion
However, the review did not include Cessn. In this case, the patient had received Cryptococcus neoformans. This is not a case of the rare opportunistic infection Cessnn infection, as our patient was not candidemic at the time of the infection. However, a review of the literature also did not show a case of Cessnn infection in a two-year-old infant. This might be due to the different hospitalization of the patient, which was different in our setting. However, this case was not rare, and it was diagnosed as Cessnn infection. The patient had a previous history of vomiting and diarrhea and was treated with fluconazole. The patient was treated with fluconazole and itraconazole. There was no severe adverse effect. The patient was discharged with a significant prognosis. The patient was followed up for 2 years, and the patient was monitored for more than 2 years. After that, the patient was transferred to a different hospital for a further 2 years. The patient did not have any obvious comorbidities. This was a rare case of Cessnn infection in a two-year-old infant.

Infections in infants are rare and often associated with severe comorbidities, such as comorbid prostatitis and sepsis. However, there have been no previous studies that investigated the incidence and prevalence of comorbidities in infants. In our case, the patient had no comorbidities, and the patient was discharged with a significant prognosis. The patient had a previous history of vomiting, diarrhea, and severe sepsis. The patient had a previous history of vomiting, diarrhea, and severe sepsis. The patient was treated with fluconazole for 2 years, and the patient was discharged with a significant prognosis. The patient had a previous history of vomiting, diarrhea, and severe sepsis. However, there was no history of prior comorbidities. The patient was discharged with a significant prognosis. The patient had a previous history of vomiting, diarrhea, and severe sepsis.

The incidence of CMV in adults is relatively rare. However, there has been a high incidence of CMV in the United States in adults between the ages of 25 and 54. This is consistent with previous studies that have found that most CMV patients are younger than 40 years, and that the incidence of CMV in adults is approximately 2.
