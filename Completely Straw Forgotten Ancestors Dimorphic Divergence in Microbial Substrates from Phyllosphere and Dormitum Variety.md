## Abstract
Aneuploidy is responsible for chromosome segregation disorders, which are often accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. In the case of diploid chromosomes in eukaryotes, they are often inherited as unspecific blastospores. However, there is a growing body of accumulating evidence implicating eukaryotic microorganisms such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Drosophila melanogaster and Schizosaccharomyces pombe in ploidy and Down's syndrome. In this review, we provide an update on the status of the state of the art of genetic ploidy in the eukaryotes, and a brief introduction about the latest advances in therapy of ploidy-related chromosome chromosomal disorders.


## Introduction
According to the International Union of Conservationaries (IUCN) it is the most important task for humanity to unravel the interplay between fungi and plants. It is recognized that only by comprehending the ecology of fungi in their diversity can they be fully exploited as potential bioprotters, or exploited bioprosers to produce novel natural products with a greater ecological impact.

The genus Cryptococcus encompasses species that can cause diseases ranging from mild to deadly infections. These fungi are ubiquitous in nature, so are found in a wide range of habitats, such as soil, decaying vegetation, and plants. Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused mainly by C. neoformans and C. gattii, and can affect humans, domestic animals, and other warm-blooded animals. In the United States, the most common form of Cryptococcus disease is cutaneous disease with a median of 14 days for the incubation period. The main pathogenicity mechanisms of C. neoformans and C. gattii include the production of aflatoxins, the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, and the production of hydrolytic enzymes by hyphal extension (Casadevall and Perfect 2009; Tiwari et al. 2010).

In addition to their role as bioprotters, C. neoformans and C. gattii produce a wide variety of toxins that are toxic to humans. The most important of these toxins, amphotericin B, is the main agent produced by the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex (Liu et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2014). Amphotericin B inhibits growth of C. neoformans by binding to the mannose-binding pocket, which is located on the cell wall of C. neoformans. In vitro studies have shown that the inhibition of the C. neoformans/C.


## Methods
Strains and Growth Media
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The P. chrysosporium strains used in this study were maintained on glucose-yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The P. chrysosporium strain was maintained in PDA (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) medium at 25°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The yeast-compounds were obtained from PDB media (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA). Yeast cells were prepared from P. chrysosporium conidia with ethanol (dH_2O) at 25°C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and washing twice with sterile distilled water. Yeast cells were washed with sterile distilled water and resuspended in sterile distilled water and used for the experiments. The P. chrysosporium strains were maintained at 25°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24 h. The yeast cells of P. chrysosporium were grown on yeast-extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24 h. The cell-free culture medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 10 min and then cooled to 25°C with shaking.

P. chrysosporium yeast cells were prepared from conidia of P. chrysosporium strain. Yeast cells were prepared from the culture medium by culturing the cells on the cellophane of PDA plates at 30°C for 24 h.


## Results
hirsutum, . variablie, D. cormina, D. corallinum, and D. hirsutum, as well as the D. cormina (Table 4). D. hirsutum and D. cormina are also the most abundant Dormitaceae in the D. cormina subsp. hirsutum. D. corallinum is one of the most abundant Dormitaceae in the D. hirsutum subsp. corallinum, but it is also the most abundant Dormitaceae in the D. variablie subsp. corallinum. The presence of two D. variablie subsp. corallinum subspecies (Table 4) is most likely an indication of diversification of the dormitoplast. In the D. corallinum subsp. corallinum, D. variablie and D. hirsutum are well-known species. They are also well-known species in the D. corallinum subsp. corallinum. The presence of D. hirsutum is also probably an indication of diversification of the dormitoplast. In the D. variablie subsp. corallinum, D. variablie and D. hirsutum are well-known species. However, the presence of a D. cormina subspecies (Table 4) is also an indication of diversification of the dormitoplast.

The D. variablie subsp. corallinum subspecies are very common in D. cormina, but are less common in D. hirsutum, D. corallinum, and D. corallinum. The presence of two D. variablie subsp. corallinum subspecies (Table 4) is also an indication of diversification of the dormitoplast. In the D. cormina subsp. corallinum, the presence of D. variablie and D. hirsutum are well-known species. However, the presence of a D.


## Discussion
 species per 100,000 years of the life cycle [34. This is reflected in the Drosophila species richness estimated in the present study. However, the average species richness is likely underestimated, because species diversity within the same species is relatively small. The estimated number of species within each species is about one species per 100,000 years of the life cycle [34]. This underestimation of species richness reflects the potential for long-distance dispersal, which increases the evolutionary pressure for species diversity. Although species diversity within individual Drosophila species is relatively low, the range of environmental conditions that can provide a niche for species diversification was greater than that of the Drosophila species in this study. Furthermore, the species richness and species diversity of all Drosophila species were similar to that of the Drosophila species in this study. The Drosophila species richness was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. Therefore, the species richness and species diversity of Drosophila species were significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. The average species diversity was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. However, the average species diversity was not significantly different from that of the Drosophila species in this study. This indicates that the high species diversity in Drosophila species may be a result of diversification due to ocean acidification.

The average species diversity of the Drosophila species was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. This indicates that the high species diversity in Drosophila species is due to long-distance dispersal and environmental conditions that can provide a niche for species diversification. The average species diversity of the Drosophila species was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. Therefore, the species diversity of Drosophila species was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. The average species diversity was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study. Therefore, the species diversity of the Drosophila species was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study.

The species diversity of the Drosophila species was significantly higher than that of the Drosophila species in this study.
