## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii, an emerging fungal pathogen of humans and animals, is able to change its internal environmental microbiome by manipulating its host plant microbiota. However, little is known about the primary pathogenic potential of this yeast. Here we show that the model fungus, the phytopathogenic basidiomycete is significantly reduced in number and variation when cultured on a wide range of carbon sources compared to that on its wild relatives. In contrast, when crossed with wildtype strains, the phytopathogenic basidiomycete displays a rather large and complex internal environmental microbiome. The fungal host plants are enriched in components of the TREM or TREM-mature endosomes of C. gattii, as well as in the TREM-tramaclin-mannans complexes of TREM and TREM, whereas the phytopathogenic basidiomycete has expanded in size and diversity. The mycorrhizal fungi of the Dothideomycetes, such as Rhizoscyphus sp.


## Introduction
Human Toxoplasmosis virus (HTPV) is an intracellular virus and it induces a strong anti-viral response in host cell. While most of the viruses in the world are found in the bloodstream and can spread to other tissues, some of them can also cause disease. For example, Human Toxoplasmosis virus can infect epithelial cells in the lungs and spread to the lymph nodes, in particular to bone marrow and testis [2].

Human Toxoplasmosis virus is a self-limiting, latent infection, which is not controlled by innate immunity and thus causes a severe immune response, which leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Most Toxoplasmosis viruses have a characteristic of self-limiting, showing a high susceptibility to viral infection and a high viral load, and they cannot be cleared by the immune system [3]. However, certain viruses can cause a range of diseases in the human host, including non-typhoidal Salmonella infections, and they can also cause typhoid fever [4,5]. In some cases, these viruses can also cause a severe septicemia, which is associated with high mortality rate in some cases. Therefore, it is important to investigate and develop novel measures to control these diseases.

With the development of increasingly sophisticated antifungal therapies, such as the development of new antifungal agents and the development of new therapeutic strategies, there is an increasing demand for new antifungal drugs. In recent years, there has been a growing interest to develop new antifungal agents, and the in vitro antifungal activities of new compounds have increased. Antibacterial peptides (APPs) are important compounds of modern medicine, which have the potential to disrupt the host immune response and to eradicate pathogens from the host. APPs are well-known to have a variety of pharmacological activities. They have been isolated from the gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and skin tissues of animals [6,7]. These molecules have different pharmacological activities, such as antiviral, antimalarbicidal, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and immunomodulatory activities [8,9].


## Methods
The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 5 min and washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and then the number of viable yeast cells in each well was counted using a hemocytometer. The cell number was divided into three parts. The cells were counted in triplicate and the minimum viable count was calculated by the following formula: [(Number of cells in wells of control group - Number of cells in wells of control group)/(Number of cells in wells of treatment group)].

Cryptococcus neoformans (strain CEA10) and Vero (strain VNIH7) were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in PBS. The cells were counted in triplicate and the minimum viable count was calculated by the following formula: [(Number of cells in wells of control group - Number of cells in wells of control group)/(Number of cells in wells of treatment group)/(Number of cells in wells of control group)]

The presence of Cryptococcus neoformans in the antifungal susceptibility test was established according to the following method: 1) The control group was inoculated with yeast cells from the wells of control group, whereas the three drugs alone were included in the study. 2) The three drugs alone were included in the study and were used as the control group. 3) The MIC values were determined according to the following formula: [(Number of cells in wells of control group - Number of cells in wells of control group)/(Number of cells in wells of control group)/(Number of cells in wells of control group)/(Number of cells in wells of control group)]

## Results
For this, we used a panel of 732 high-throughput screens, which included 125 tested isolates of the major fungal pathogen Candida albicans (Table 2. We screened through a selection of 1359 randomly selected fungal strains representing the following strains: 531 Candida albicans (CEA: 731), 547 Candida albicans (CM: 547), 541 Candida albicans (CM: 541), 546 Candida glabrata (CEA: 546), 569 Candida krusei (CEA: 569), and 577 Candida krusei (CM: 577). A total of 607 of the 630 Candida albicans isolates were chosen and submitted to the BLAST2GO algorithm (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast2GO) (Table 2). A total of 3150 and 3050 Candida albicans isolates were included in this screening, and were subjected to a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of our screen and our validated approach.

To validate our screen and our validated approach, we screened and applied the multiple screen for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis. In this approach, we selected our screening approach to evaluate the efficacy of our screen and our validated approach in combination with our validation approach, and tested it at a single time point. In this strategy, we selected our screening approach to evaluate the efficacy of our screen and our validated approach in combination with our validation approach.

Identification of candidate genes for C. albicans Candida Genome Screening
To identify the C. albicans Candida genome candidates, we used the Candida Genome Database (www.candidagenome.org) to search for candidate genes in our library using the sequence of the C. albicans reference genome. To this end, we aligned the C. albicans reference genome sequence to the Candida Genome Database (www.candidagenome.org). We identified a total of 1312 candidate genes for C. albicans Candida in our library (Table 3).


## Discussion
This pathogen was described as a monoclonal antibody-like antigen (MAb), which is a ubiquitous, often lethal, viral agent that is mostly isolated from the blood and spreads through the lymphatic system, causing acute disease (9. In this case report, the patient had not been to the emergency room with typical symptoms and was not treated with antibiotics. The patient was treated with oral fluconazole and azithromycin, and then was administered lumbar puncture and a different regimen of fluconazole was administered. The patient was initially treated with intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole, which did not affect the patient’s immunity. However, over time, the patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and received antifungal therapy (11). The patient was transferred to an immunocompromised status with no evidence of immunodeficiency. The patient’s immune status was changed to a mild immunocompromised state, and the patient was treated with oral fluconazole for 4 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 4 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 3 days. The patient was treated with fluconazole for 8 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 9 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with fluconazole for 12 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 14 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 18 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 18 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 20 days. The patient was discharged with severe immunosuppression and was treated with oral fluconazole for 21 days.
