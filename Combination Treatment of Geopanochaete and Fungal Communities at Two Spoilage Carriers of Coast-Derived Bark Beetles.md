## Abstract
The life cycle of many fungi includes several developmental phases, including the formation of hyphae, the formation of fused structures and dimorphic switching to form larger structures and the transition to multicellular structures. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the elongated phase of the life cycle coincides with the formation of fused structures and dimorphic switching. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the elongated phase of the life cycle coincides with the formation of heterokaryons. In both S. cerevisiae and related yeasts, the heterokaryons are formed by specific fused structures formed during the life cycle. These structures include telokaryons and telokaryons. The S. pombe heterokaryons are similar in their life cycle from a common precursor to a recently evolved hybrid hybrid state. The telokaryons are derived from five different lineages of S. cerevisiae, and represent an evolutionarily recently integrated group.


## Introduction
1. Bark beetle Eucalyptus leaf, Pinus olivaceus, is a pest of great importance in forestry, and it is the main source of fodder for the white-rot forests. Bark beetle Eucalyptus leaf, Pinus olivaceus, is a pest of great importance in forestry, and it is the main source of fodder for the white-rot forests. Bark beetle Eucalyptus leaf, Pinus olivaceus, is a pest of great importance in forestry, and it is the main source of fodder for the white-rot forests.

The two spore-form nests were found on the same soil. Bark beetle E. olivaceus, Pinus olivaceus, and E. leaf, Pinus olivaceus, are two of the most important pest beetles in forestry, and they are responsible for a great deal of forest loss. Although the beetles were found on the same soil, they co-occur on the same soil, and they are co-evolved. Bark beetle E. olivaceus, Pinus olivaceus, and E. leaf are two of the most important beetles in forestry, and they are responsible for great amount of forest loss.

## Methods
These fruiting bodies were stored at -80°C in a plastic bag at the Department of Biology, Forestry and Fisheries, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wollong (UWF), and preserved at the University of Wollong Hydrobiology Unit (UWF) until the us.

Three-month-old fruiting bodies were collected from the Origana Reef in August 2015. These fruiting bodies were stored at -80°C in a plastic bag at the University of Wollong Hydrobiology Unit (UWHU), and preserved at the University of Wollong Hydrobiology Unit (UWHU). A total of five biological replicates were selected for each treatment (Additional file 2: Table S1).

Molecular Identification of Fungal Communities at Two Spoilage Carriers of Coast-Derived Bark Beetles
The nucleotide sequence of the Fungal Community Index (FCCI) was performed by the yeast-specific primer pair FCCI-G (5'-TCCATGCCGAGCGCAGC-3') and FCCI-R (5'-AGATGATCCCCAGCCACCC-3') using the primers FAM (5'-CCTCCGATGGCCTCC-3') and Fungi-R (5'-CCAACTCCACCTGCG-3') and Fungi-V2 (5'-CCTCCGCAGCCG-3') and Fungi-V3 (5'-CACCCATCCATGACCC-3') from P. chrysosporium (Guangzhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China). For molecular identification, PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µL using the EZ-DNA PCR-DNA Kit (Zhongjiang Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 30 s at 72°C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C. Amplicons were purified using a QiaPrep PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).


## Results
dubliniensis and . verticillioides affected the fungal community structure in these two insect species, the fungal and bacterial communities were studied in three independent plots of three fruit plots (Figure 3). Both species have been associated with the rotten fruit industry for a long time. The F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis populations were shown to have an established fungal community, with high levels of OTU and shared gene family richness and similar patterns of diversification among the three taxa (Figure 3). The F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis populations were also shown to have an established fungal community, with high levels of OTU and shared gene family richness and similar patterns of diversification among the three taxa. Both species have been associated with the rotten fruit industry for a long time. The fungal community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis, but the bacterial communities were dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis. For all three taxa, the fungal community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis.

The fungal community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis, but the bacterial communities were dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis. The fungal community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis, but the bacterial communities were dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis. The soil fungal community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis, but the soil bacterial community was dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis. For all three taxa, the fungal and bacterial communities were dominated by F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis.

In a separate experiment, we examined the fungal community in the four different fruit plots using two different criteria: (i) the fungi community was dominated by the F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis community, and (ii) the fungal community was dominated by the F. verticillioides and C. dubliniensis community.


## Discussion
expansum (46% of total fungi), . mesenterica (34%) and P. tauri (20%) and were also the main fungal phylotypes for both seasons. This might be due to the climate change and high precipitation in the year 2000, which is conducive to the growth of P. expansum and P. mesenterica on Bark Beetles in summer months [50]. The presence of these fungi in our study could be the result of seasonal variation in Bark Beetles abundance, due to the high annual precipitation in the year 2000 [51]. Therefore, our findings provide insight into the ecology of these fungi and provide insight into their functional roles in the different seasons.

The dominant fungal phylotypes in this study were D. hansenii, Fusarium sp., and D. pseudoobscura, which was in accordance with the previous studies [52,53] and our findings. However, Fusarium sp. was the most dominant phylotype in this study (53%) and Fusarium sp. was the most dominant fungus in our study (48%). In contrast, D. pseudoobscura was the predominant fungal phylotype in this study (31%) and Fusarium sp. was the most dominant fungus in our study (17%). The dominance of D. pseudoobscura in the fungal communities of the two seasons was similar to that of previous studies [54,55]. However, the fungal communities of the two seasons were different from each other and the dominance of D. hansenii was higher in the summer months (33% of total fungi, 6% of total fungi), whereas the dominance of Fusarium sp. was higher in the summer months (33%) and D. pseudoobscura was higher in the winter months (28%) [56]. In our study, only the dominant fungal phylotypes were detected in our study, but in the summer months the dominant fungal phylotypes were represented mainly by Fusarium sp. and D. pseudoobscura by the dominant fungal phylotypes. This might be due to the high temperature and drought in summer months in the U.S.A., which is conducive to the growth of D. pseudoobscura and Fusarium sp.
