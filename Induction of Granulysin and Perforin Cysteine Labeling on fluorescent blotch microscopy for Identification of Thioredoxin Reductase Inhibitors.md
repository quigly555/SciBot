## Abstract
We aimed to study the genetic diversity and the correlation between VdH+ cells and VdN- cells in the Basidiomycetous fungal isolates collected from a large number of patients presenting with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lymphoma. In vitro recombination of VdH+ and VdN- cells was performed between recombining parent strains and progeny strains. VdH+ cells were found in all samples and were more abundant than the parental strains, being detected in almost all samples by microscopy. The presence of dominant VdH+ cells in the present study was not detected by PCR or genetic analysis. The predominant VdH+ cells were the recombining progeny, which were mostly derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The occurrence of dominant VdN- cells was not detected by microdilution or PCR. The data suggest that the predominant VdN- cells in the present samples are not related to the clinical isolates. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying this methodology to investigate the genetic differences between VdH+ and VdN- cells in the context of RA and lymphoma therapy.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is increasing worldwide. IFIs are opportunistic fungal infections. The most common are as a result of the inhalation of spores or conidia from the environment, or from traumatic injuries. In some cases, it can be asymptomatic. The other, less common, fungi include aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and zygomycosis. The IFIs can be asymptomatic or develop in any organ or tissue. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is caused by Aspergillus species and yeast, and it is an important life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients. In the United States, approximately 1.6 million new cases and 625,000 deaths were estimated to occur in 2017. The most common agents are inhalation route of A. fumigatus and A. flavus, followed by the respiratory tract. The most common A. fumigatus species are inhaled from the upper respiratory tract and subsequently develop invasive aspergillosis (IA).


## Methods
The blot was developed in the presence of 5% BSA and 1% Triton X-10. For histochemical staining, a goat anti-rat IgG conjugate (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used. The blot was developed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100.

Western Blotting
For Western blotting, total protein from each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) by using an ECL western blotting system (E-Bin; BD Bioscience, Franklin, MA, USA). The blot was developed in the presence of phospho-p65-APC (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and calcofluor white (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) staining. The blot was developed in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100.

Nanofluorescence Microscopy (NEO)
For imaging of macrophage inflammatory cell populations, a high-resolution cell-scatter (HRCT) was performed with an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a Gatan Jena imaging software. For imaging of peritoneal macrophages, a Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a Gatan Jena imaging software was used. Images were recorded using a CMOS camera (Gatan Jena, Germany).

## Results
mackenzie. In the absence of granulysin inhibitors, the inactivation of these two enzymes was observed. In the presence of granulysin inhibitors, the production of granulysin and perforin was markedly decreased in R. mackenziei, while in the absence of granulysin inhibitors the inactivation of granulysin and perforin was observed (Fig 3A). The inactivation of the two enzymes in the presence of granulysin inhibitors was observed in R. mackenziei, and the inactivation of the two enzymes was observed in R. mackenziei-DAD-glucose-2-phosphate synthase-N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD-NADH). The inactivation of the enzymes in the absence of granulysin inhibitors was observed in R. mackenziei-DAD-glucose-2-phosphate synthase-N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD-NADH). The inactivation of the enzymes in the absence of granulysin inhibitors was observed in R. mackenziei-DAD-glucose-2-phosphate synthase-N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD-NADH). The inactivation of the enzymes in the absence of granulysin inhibitors was observed in R. mackenziei-DAD-glucose-2-phosphate synthase-N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD-NADH).

3.5. Western Blots of Granulysin and Perforin Antibodies in the Presence of Granulysin
The detection of granulysin and perforin in the presence of granulysin inhibitors was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies against these two proteins (Fig 4A and B). In the absence of granulysin inhibitors, the protein-protein interaction was observed at 2.8 µg/ml granulysin (Fig 4B). In the presence of granulysin inhibitors, the protein-protein interaction was observed at 5.5 µg/ml granulysin (Fig 4B).


## Discussion
In this case, the TB-I-1 gene was detected in the viral and bacterial cell cultures, but not in the bacterial cell culture, suggesting that TB-I-1 might not be the same as TB-I-2, which is the third and fourth gene that is expressed in humans, and TB-I-3 is the fourth gene that is expressed in a huma. It is likely that TB-I-1 and TB-I-3 are associated with the same gene.

The mouse model used in this study has been shown to be a reliable, in vivo, and in vitro, model for the detection of TB-I-1 and TB-I-2 in human, BALB/c mice [18]. The success of TB-I-2 as a marker for TB-I-1 and TB-I-2 in the immuno-compromised mice has been demonstrated, and it has been demonstrated in a mouse model [18]. In addition, TB-I-2 has been used for the detection of TB-I-2 in mice infected with Histoplasma capsulatum [19], which is a human infection [20]. In this study, we demonstrated that TB-I-2 could be detected in BALB/c mice infected with Histoplasma capsulatum, which is a human infection. The TB-I-2 gene was expressed in the viral and bacterial cell cultures, but not in the bacterial cell culture, indicating that TB-I-2 might not be the same as TB-I-1, which is the fourth gene that is expressed in a human.

The use of TB-I-2 in immunocompromised mice has been reported in a clinical trial that has identified TB-I-2 as a key marker for the detection of tuberculosis in patients with advanced HIV disease [21]. The use of TB-I-2 in immunocompetent mice has been reported in a clinical study that has identified TB-I-2 as a marker for the detection of tuberculosis in patients with HIV [21].
