## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging killer pathogen of immunocompromised humans and animals. The emergence of this pathogen necessitates a rapid response to stop the spread. This is a central dogma in the field of fungal infectious disease. The Cryptococcus gattii genome encodes a polymorphic transcription factor (TF) of around 90,000 genes, with a more than 90% identity with C. gattii VGII. To test this, we sequenced the whole genomes of two clinical isolates and two environmental isolates and studied the TF distribution in the two clinical specimens. In total, 2,344,434 (38.2%) of 2,344,434 (38.2%) of the environmental isolates and 2,344,434 (38.2%) of the clinical isolates were wild type, indicating they were circulating in the two environmental isolates. In contrast, the two clinical isolates had a haploid TF sequence. The two clinical isolates had a heterokaryon-like TF sequence.


## Introduction
The order Phylum Basidiomycota comprises approximately 15,000 described species, with more than 200 accepted and undescribed species. The order includes the order Plectosphaerella, which includes many pathogens of plants and animals, and also members of the order Hymenoptera, including a few species of which are pathogenic to insects, birds and other mammals (1-3). There are only a few known basidiomycetous taxa, including some insects, birds, mites and mitesugars. Species in the order are divided into three types, namely spherules, which include the parasitic on the hosts of insects, spherps and peduncles, and sclerotia, which infect the hosts of insects, birds and other mammals. The order contains three groups of pathogenic basidiomycetous, which can infect humans, domestic animals, mites, mitesugars, and other non-mammalian hosts. The order can infect animals either by the luring of infected insects or by transmission via the contaminated food contaminated by the spherules. Spherps are hyphomycetous, with a diameter of about 1-1.5 µm, with a diameter of more than 10 µm, and can infect a wide range of animals including humans, horses, mules and other animals.

The spherule is an inner membrane of the basidiomycetous order. It is composed of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-rich, extracellular proteinaceous outer layer and a carbohydrate-ligated inner layer (4, 5). The outer layer of the spherule consists of a well-developed outer layer which is an adhesive protein-binding pocket and includes chitin, a layer of proteins rich in chitin and chitosan, and a protein-binding pocket. The outer layer of the spherules consists of a set of chitin-binding proteins, including collagen, elastin, ß-glucan and elastoproteins (6, 7).

## Results
A previous study has provided the tools to predict the network in . albicans and several other fungi such as C. neoformans [32]. This study focuses on the observation and prediction of the proteome network using SignalP (Spinak et al., 2011). We have built a SignalP server that can predict the network based on the proteome network, as well as a KOG and DAD-like server that can predict the network based on the proteome network (Faber et al., 2014). The KOG server also can predict the network based on the proteome network. The SignalP server has two default settings. The default settings are 'red', which indicates that the network is highly likely to be classified as having low redundancy and low in-frame read mapping (Faber et al., 2014). The DAD-like server has two default settings. The default settings are 'blue', which indicates that the network is highly likely to be classified as having high redundancy and low in-frame read mapping (Faber et al., 2014). The KOG server has two default settings. The default settings are 'green', which indicates that the network is highly likely to be classified as having high redundancy and low in-frame read mapping (Faber et al., 2014).

In order to develop the SignalP server and the DAD-like server, we first built the SignalP server on the SimpleDock (SDA) server, a network-prediction tool that can predict the network based on the network-prediction tool (Figure 4). The SignalP server was designed based on the SimpleDock server that is available in most commercial and food laboratories, as well as in several laboratories (Figures 4A,B). The SignalP server was built using the SignalP server (Figure 4) and had a virtual host (Table S1). The SignalP server was written in C. neoformans (XP_00395811.1) as a web server. We developed the SignalP server using the SignalP server (Figure 4) and had a virtual host (Table S1). The SignalP server was written in C. neoformans (XP_00395811.1) as a web server. The SignalP server was written in C.


## Discussion
crassa and . commune.

Our analysis revealed a total of 7,039 novel genes and 7,045 proteins in the genome of S. commune. This is significantly higher than the number of genes predicted by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO:00084) (9,095, 9,078) [20], GO:00065 (12,831, 12,867), GO:00089 (10,556, 10,857), GO:00114 (5,428, 5,846) and GO:00117 (4,904, 4,827) (Table 1), respectively. Thus, our results are comparable to those of P. graminis, P. triticina and P. triticina. The genome of S. commune, however, still showed a large number of novel genes. The total number of novel genes in this study was comparable to that in P. graminis, but different from that in P. triticina. This result suggests that S. commune is a model for the evolution of gene families. The number of novel genes in S. commune is expected to increase over time, with the number of genes having increased frequency over time. This could be explained by the different gene expression systems in S. commune, where the gene expression levels in the low- and high-expressing genes are different, and the expression levels in the high- and low-expressing genes are similar. The genome of S. commune is predicted to have higher gene expression levels than P. graminis, and the low- and high-expressing genes are expressed at similar levels.

The number of novel genes in this study was similar to that in P. graminis, but different from that in P. triticina. This may be due to the different gene expression system in S. commune, where the gene expression levels in the low- and high-expressing genes are different, and the gene expression levels in the high- and low-expressing genes are different. This indicates that the S. commune genome is different from that of P. graminis and P. triticina. This is also the first study to use RNA-seq data to predict gene expression in S. commune.
