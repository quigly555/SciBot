## Abstract
The genus Cladophialophora includes a large number of plant pathogens of major cereal crops, namely Cladophyla asahii, C. albicans, and C. dubliniensis. The Fusarium graminearum is an early example of such a genus. Recently, Cladophialophora graminearum has been proposed to belong to a phylogenetically broad category of plant pathogens of major cereal crops, namely Cladophyla asahii, C. albicans, and C. dubliniensis. This essay considers the status of Cladophialophora graminearum and the phylogeny of Cladophyla asahii, C. albicans, and C. dubliniensis, and evaluates the applicability of the recently published multispecies clade, with the aid of a molecular phylogeny framework.

The Fusarium graminearum is found on Cladophyla asahii, C. albicans, and C. dubliniensis isolates from California, but its phylogeny cannot be confirmed. To resolve the question, we determined the phylogeny of four clades, supported by multigene molecular phylogeny.

We suggest that the clade FGS_Fungi clade is cosmopolitan, while the clade FGS_Fungi/Cladophialophora clade is less diverse. We also propose a separate clade FGS_Fungi/Cladophialophora clade, where the clade FGS_Fungi/Cladophora clade appears to have maintained stability through to the divergence of the two fission lineages. We also discuss the possible consequences of cloning the <U+0394>Fungi/Cladophyla group and the possible origin of the two clades that contain the different clades.


## Introduction
 2004)

The gene of the N-glycans (EC.10.3.24) is a glycoprotein that is present in many species of fungi. The EC3.10.3.24 N-glycans are polysaccharide capsules found in various tissues and are classified as a class II cell wall polysaccharide (Colombo et al., 2002). N-glycans are generally used in the biomedical field due to their unique properties, high structural similarity, and the presence of a polysaccharide component, which is recognized by the N-linked glycoproteins (Martel et al., 2006). This diversity of glycosylation properties is reflected in different N-glycans from bacteria to humans. In particular, the glycosylinositolphosphorylceramide (GPI) carbohydrate of fungi (FungiN) (Verbeken et al., 2011) is highly conserved and expressed in the yeast and mammalian cell, and it is recognized by the N-linked oligosaccharides from fungi (Tatovsky and Suryanarayanan, 2013). Glycans from bacteria, yeast, and mammals (such as mice, rats, and guinea pigs) bind to the carbohydrates bound to the cell membrane. N-glycans are also recognized by the cell surface receptors, such as chaperones, endocytosis factors, and phagocytes (Kozel, 2002). N-glycan interactions with host cells can lead to immune responses, such as cytokinesis, tissue remodelling, and differentiation of various tissues, such as the brain, heart, lung, skin, and eye (Eliopoulos et al., 2002).

The glycan structure in fungi is highly conserved, with the most common species being Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis jiroveci (Marcucci et al., 2011). As C. albicans, glycoconjugates from the glycosyltransferase (GT) complex are able to transfer glycoproteins, including N-glycans, to the cell surface (Marcucci et al., 2011).


## Methods
. promoter and terminator of PRK2-LC3) was employed to analyze the interaction between gene and RNA of selected, non-phagocytosed eukaryotic strains (N = 6) and the differentially expressed gene-expression of the two eukaryotic strains (N = 2).

Microscopic observation
For studying the influence of temperature, the E. coli strain BL21 was grown on an LB plate at 37째C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in PBS. The cells were disrupted by gentle shaking at maximum speed using a BeadBug (Biolab). After cell disruption, the cell suspension was mixed with a bead beater (Pierce) and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was incubated with a PBS-Methanol solution containing 0.02% (w/v) SDS at 4째C for 30 min. The SDS-extracted cell suspension was then removed by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in PBS. The cell suspension was incubated with a PBS-Methanol solution containing 0.02% (w/v) SDS at 4째C for 30 min. The SDS-extracted cell suspension was then removed by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in PBS. This procedure was repeated twice. The SDS-extracted cell suspension was then removed by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and observed in a Leica TCS SP5 microscope (Leica Microsystems).

Cell-associated RNA-mediated RNA-mediated death assay
The ability of the respective yeast strains to select the phagosome of eukaryotic cells and evaluate their expression of the two RNA-mediated genes was examined. The E. coli strain BL21 was grown in LB liquid medium at 37째C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then suspended in PBS. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in PBS. The cell suspension was then removed by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in PBS.


## Results
RNA-mediated gene manipulation of the H3 cell line was used to obtain new H3 cells by specific primers and to induce H3-type phenotypes (see Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 3, H3-type phenotypes were induced in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells. In the presence of high concentrations of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the response was relatively slow (Figure 3). In the absence of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more quickly and in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of high concentrations of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, H3-type phenotypes were induced more slowly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the presence of high concentrations of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the presence of high concentrations of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the presence of high concentrations of PRK2-LC3-H3 cells, the H3-type phenotypes were triggered more rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3).


## Discussion
In this study, we have performed a comparative analysis of the DNA and protein profiles of C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates in their natural habitat on healthy, dead leaves of a pine in an arid, temperate region of the country, Thailand.
