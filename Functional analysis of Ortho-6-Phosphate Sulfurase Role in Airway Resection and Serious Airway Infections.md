## Abstract
The incidence of Aspergillus fumigatus infections has been increasing over the past few decades. Among the different Aspergillus specificities are the anti-adrenals and their ability to boost resistance are the virulence factors. These are highly immunogenic and can cause disease in immunocompromised patients. However, the underlying disease mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study was undertaken to investigate the immunoprotective effects of hemagglutination, soluble galacturin and hemagglutin in A. fumigatus.

Twenty-one A. fumigatus clinical isolates were collected from patients with invasive aspergillosis and their plasma levels of galacturin, soluble galacturin and hemagglutinin were all below the detection limits. All were susceptible to azole and voriconazole. In addition, eight A. fumigatus isolates were also susceptible to amphotericin and posaconazole.

Hemagglutination, soluble galacturin and hemagglutination were the main Aspergillus specificities that were associated with susceptibility to azole and voriconazole.


## Introduction
The development of high-throughput DNA sequencing (i.e., sequencing of more than 5,000 genes) has recently expanded our knowledge of the eukaryotic genome. Indeed, the genome of the banana pathogen, U. maydis, has recently been sequenced (Khan et al. 2015). Similarly to the microorganism, the genome of the human pathogen, Candida albicans, has been sequenced (O'Gorman et al. 2008; Shilton et al. 2012). Similarly to the microorganism, the genome of the pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, has been sequenced (Khan et al. 2015). Likewise to the microorganism, the genome of the pathogen, the fungal plant pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, has been sequenced (Schultz et al. 2011). Similarly to the microorganism, the genome of the fungal plant pathogen, F. graminearum, has been sequenced (Shilton et al. 2012). Similarly to the microorganism, the genome of the plant pathogen, F. graminearum, has been sequenced (Schultz et al. 2011).

## Methods
sclerotiorum airway signal to the . sclerotiorum dry airway signal, we used the inter-quartile range (IQR) method (36). This method allows for the analysis of differences between two groups of data. The S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal was calculated as the sum of dry airway signal and dry airway signal ratio, and the relative contribution of the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal to dry airway dry signal ratio was calculated as the sum of dry airway signal ratio and dry airway dry airway dry signal ratio. The relative contribution of the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal to dry airway dry signal ratio was calculated as the sum of dry airway dry signal ratio and dry airway dry air signal ratio. The relative contribution of the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal to dry airway dry signal was calculated as the sum of dry airway dry signal ratio and dry air airway dry signal ratio.

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica software package (version 5.0.1, Statcorp Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Indirect calorimetry
The effects of S. sclerotiorum on the airway function were tested using the in-situ effects. The in-situ effect was estimated by the comparison of the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal with that of the S. sclerotiorum airway signal and with the airway dry signal ratio. The difference between the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S. sclerotiorum dry airway dry signal ratio was estimated using the difference between the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S. sclerotiorum dry airway dry signal ratio. The differences between the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S. sclerotiorum airway dry signal ratio were estimated using the difference between the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S. sclerotiorum dry airway dry signal ratio. The in-situ effects were estimated by comparing the S. sclerotiorum dry airway signal and the S.


## Results
In order to further assess the role of the phosphatase-encoding genes in airway virulence, we next examined the role of the phosphatase gene in airway infection.

We have previously observed that airway infection results in the formation of a large number of fungal proteins, as well as the secretion of a number of virulence factor genes such as fumonisins, pathogenicity factor (NF)-alpha and nrg proteins [27], [28]. However, to better understand the impact of the fungal phosphatase gene on virulence in vivo, we next examined the role of the fungal phosphatase gene in airway infection.

We used a model of systemic infection in which airway infection results in the formation of a large number of fungal proteins, as well as the secretion of a number of virulence factor genes such as fumonisins, pathogenicity factor (NF)-alpha and nrg proteins [27], [28]. In this model, the fungus would have a small burden of bacteria and could spread into the bloodstream and cause bloodstream infections in the form of inflammation, asthma and cardiac arrhythmia. The lungs of the infected mice would be normally healthy and normal, but we observed that the lungs of the mice infected with the fungus had a severe inflammatory response, and the lungs were severely infiltrated and the blood was clotrimazole-containing. The fungus would also cause severe respiratory failure, which would lead to the death of the mice. This type of inflammation is known to occur during in vivo infection by different pathogenic fungi [29], [30]. Therefore, we used a model of systemic infection in which the fungus would form a large number of fungal proteins and produce a large number of virulence factors.

We found that the fungal phosphatase gene was not involved in in vivo virulence. However, we found that the fungal protein secretion pathway, as well as the host defense mechanisms, were activated in the lungs of the mice infected with the fungus and the fungal growth was restricted to the host. These observations suggest that the fungal protein secretion pathway might be activated in the lungs of the infected mice.


## Discussion
aeruginosa PPD-6 is to release phospholipids from the glycolytic pathway to synthesize high-affinity carbohydrates, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP. The PPD-6-phosphatase PEP-2 (PEP-2) was originally identified in the human body and was required for normal cellular function, but in the case of P. aeruginosa it is implicated in many diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and AIDS (reviewed in [43]). PEP-2 belongs to the ÃŸ-carotene-phosphatase family, which is responsible for the production of TDP-1, PDP-2, and PDP-3, respectively (reviewed in [44]).

In our study, we identified the ortholog of PEP-2 in the pathogenic Aeromonas spp. and found that it plays an important role in the interaction with environmental factors (reviewed in [45]). It is one of the most conserved PEPs in fungi and is involved in the synthesis of a wide range of secondary metabolites [46, 47]. We did not find any orthologs in the Aeromonas species analyzed in our study. It is therefore possible that the PPD-6-phosphatase is a general PEP enzyme.

The role of PPD-6 in the regulation of the expression of a number of genes has been investigated. We found that PPD-6 was up-regulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa PPD-6, but down-regulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa PPD-6. This is in agreement with previous findings that PPD-6 was down-regulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa PPD-3 and P. aeruginosa PPD-4 [48]. In addition, PPD-6 was up-regulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa PPD-5 and down-regulated in the presence of P. aeruginosa PPD-6. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have suggested that PPD-6 plays an important role in regulation of several genes involved in the regulation of the airway response and inflammation [49, 50].
