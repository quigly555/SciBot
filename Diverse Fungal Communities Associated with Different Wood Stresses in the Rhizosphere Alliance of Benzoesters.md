## Introduction
rd.org) is an association between different wood building practices and diverse communities, which includes assemblage-based-community-wide surveys of forest floor microbial communities [7], [8]. The BRDA works mainly in association with a set of forest specialists, including physical plant-planning specialists, plant pathologists, and plant pathology specialists [9], [10]. The BRDA works mainly in association with botanists, epidemiologists, and plant pathology specialists, and also microbiologists, and also in association with farmers, breeders, and nurseries [11], [12]. The BRDA works mainly in association with urban forestry specialists, plant breeders, and urban agriculture specialists, as well as urban agriculture specialists, as well as rural farmers, breeders, and gardeners [13]. The BRDA works mainly in association with urban gardeners, urban gardeners, and farmers, as well as urban farmers and gardeners [14].

The BRDA works mainly in association with organic growers, and also with plant pathologists, urban gardeners, and urban farmers, and also with urban farmers and gardeners [15].

## Methods

Sequence Analysis of the Recombination Plots
We used the following primers to amplify the concatenated ITS1 and ITS4 regions of the concatenated fungal communities from the 12 strains of Artemisia species, including the wild type, Artemisia s., G. deuterostoma, and G. biota [17]. The ITS1 and ITS4 regions were amplified using the primers ITS1 and ITS4 [18], and the ITS2 and ITS3 regions were amplified using the primers ITS1 and ITS3 [19]. The PCR products were then used for sequence analysis using the BigDye^® Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the BigDye^® Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The sequences of the four PCR products were then assembled and edited using BioEdit v. 7.2.5 [20].

Bioinformatics Analysis of the Constrained Genes
To estimate the genomic position of the different clades of the fungi in the different trees, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the concatenated data set of the six strains of Artemisia species, which was then combined with the concatenated data set of the eight strains of Artemisia species from the wild type species. For the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species, the concatenated data set of the six strains of Artemisia species and the concatenated data set of the eight strains of Artemisia species were combined with the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species. For the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species, the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species were combined with the concatenated data set of the eight strains of Artemisia species. For the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species, the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species were combined with the concatenated data set of the eight strains of Artemisia species. The concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species were combined with the concatenated data set of the four strains of Artemisia species.


## Results
The network revealed that the number of fungal OTUs and the number of OTUs detected in each community were higher than that observed in the plant communit. For example, the number of fungal OTUs detected in the human community was significantly higher than that observed in the plant community. For the plant community, the number of fungal OTUs detected in the human community was significantly higher than that observed in the plant community. In order to visualize the possible associations of the fungal communities between the wood and the plant community, we used the Neighbor-joining tree method (Fig 6).

For each tree, the results of the two-way ANOVA test showed that the two-way ANOVA test had a significant interaction (p < 0.05), indicating that the fungal communities were associated with the wood and the plant communities, whereas the human communities were associated with the wood and the soil community (Table 2).

As shown in Fig 6, the fungal communities in all four replicates were dominated by the soil community. The fungal communities from the soil community were mainly dominated by the wood community. This could be explained by the high content of monocots and the high levels of chlorophylls (Fig 4). The soil communities were dominated by the wood community and the fungi community, which was consistent with the observation that the fungal community was dominated by the plant community (Fig 5).

The network showed that the fungal communities in all replicates were dominated by the plant community. In addition, the fungi community was dominated by the wood community and the fungi community, which was consistent with the observation that the fungal community was dominated by the wood community (Fig 4).

After analyzing the relative abundance of OTUs and the number of OTUs detected in the fungal community, the fungal community was divided into three groups: the fungal community dominated by the plant community, the fungi community dominated by the wood community, and the soil community dominated by the wood community (Table 3).

The fungal community dominated by the plant community was more similar to the plant community
Our results showed that the fungal community was dominated by the soil community and the fungi community were more similar to the plant community. Thus, the soil community was dominated by the soil community.


## Discussion
 2017. The discovery of many new and interesting new bioactive compounds in the consortium is a prerequisite for the detection of this bioactivity. However, the discovery of new species in the consortium would require a more extensive sampling and/or whole-genome sequencing, which is still not possible for this species. In addition, the new species have not been found in the consortium before. In the present work, the new species had been reported only from the Rhizosphere Alliance. The results of the present study showed that the new species was strongly related to R. fabae. Previous studies have shown that the R. fabae has a high fungal diversity and taxonomic significance (Papa et al., 2014, 2016). The study of the new species showed that the R. fabae is highly related to the plant species on which it was isolated and the fungus was phylogenetically related to S. vermiformis. The fungal community structure in the consortium has been studied before and found to be relatively stable at certain time points (Papa et al., 2014, 2016). Our study indicated that the new species could be related to the R. fabae and R. vermiformis species. The results of the present study are in agreement with previous studies, which showed that the Rhodotorula vermiformis species is closely related to R. fabae. In the present study, the Rhodotorula vermiformis species was not included in the consortium but it was the most related species to the Rhodotorula species and was related to R. fabae. Rhodotorula vermiformis has been reported to produce bioactive secondary metabolites (Ganley and Mitchell, 2005). It has been reported that Rhodotorula vermiformis can produce amyloid secondary metabolites (Luo et al., 2009). Therefore, further studies are required to confirm the relationship between Rhodotorula vermiformis and the Rhodotorula species.
