## Abstract

Two randomised, open-label, observational studies comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of three antifungal combinations in invasive candidiasi.

A total of 526 patients with proven or probable invasive candidiasis were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the survival outcome in those treated or not treated with the antifungals. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC) and the proportion with comorbidities (alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neurocognitive function and Parkinson disease) at discharge or 6 months after diagnosis.

A total of 526 invasive candidiasis admissions was observed during the 6 months study; 258 (64.1%) patients were not on induction therapy and 307/261 (84.9%) patients were not on any antifungal therapy at discharge. The proportion of patients with comorbidities improved from time to discharge or 6 months after diagnosis: 80% of the patients with comorbidities had a first comorbidity diagnosis; 83% of the patients with Parkinson's disease showed a change in their symptoms between 6 months and discharge and from time to discharge. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a greater increase in survival compared to those without Parkinson's disease.

A significant reduction in the proportion with comorbidities and a significant increase in the proportion with a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis was observed. However, the proportion of patients with comorbidities did not improve in the study period. A decrease in the proportion with a diagnostic test was also found in a study of patients with invasive candidiasis.

Although invasive candidiasis is increasingly being reported, there are still few studies investigating its clinical impact. Our findings suggest that candidiasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with invasive candidiasis when candidiasis is seen as a cause of comorbidities and a mediator of disease.

Cognitive decline and lung cancer are two important diseases in HIV-infected people, with the mortality rates being 2.7% and 607.1%. The aim of this study was to characterize the association between cognitive decline and lung cancer.

A total of 293 HIV-infected women with CD4 counts = 100/µL were followed at first visit to our hospital. CD4 count and fungal burden were collected.


## Introduction
The genus Hypericum (Hypericum aestivus) is one of the most widely distributed and important soil fungi, occurring in tropical and temperate regions and having a wide range of hosts, including some species of Citrus, Pinus, Solanum, and several other trees (Montgomery, 1952; Boerema and Adachi, 2009). Hypericum has been recorded from tropical regions, such as Papua New Guinea, Australia, Thailand, and from Costa Rica, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Uruguay (Bruneton, 1958; Rinaldi, 2009).

The genus is morphologically divided into three genera, Hypericum, Hypericum, and Lecanora based on morphological characters. Lecanora is distinguished from Hypericum by its conidial texture, which is different from that of the former. Hypericum is asexual and grows on trees of the genus Hypericum. Although some species have been described as sexual, all species are morphologically diverse and could only be identified as such based on morphology and host. Lecanora has a conidiophore with an apical germ tube, whereas Hypericum has germplasmic conidiogenous cells with a germ tube and germ banks. Thus, the taxonomy of these species is complex and remains unresolved.


## Methods
Strain and media
Cryptococcus neoformans strain SN95 (serotype A, MATa) was obtained from ATCC. Cryptococcus strains were maintained in YPD broth (20% [w/v] yeast extract, 20% [w/v] peptone, and 20% [w/v] glucose, and 20% [w/v] agar) at 30 °C. M. circinelloides ATCC 16404 was obtained from ATCC.


## Results
Amino acid composition of D-glucopyranoside extract from leaves
Amino acid composition of D-glucopyranoside extract from leaves of Eucalyptus sp. JAS-3921, treated with the lyophilin monoclonal antibody (1 µM) was determined, by LC-MS and mass spectrometry, using EDTA as a substrate. As shown in Table 1, D-glucopyranoside extract from Eucalyptus sp. JAS-3921 contained a total of 156 and 174 amino acids, respectively, at the C-terminal end of the monoclonal antibody, and a final concentration of 96.1 µM for D-glucopyranoside extract from Eucalyptus sp. JAS-3921. The total amino acid composition of D-glucopyranoside extract from Eucalyptus sp. JAS-3921 was similar to the sum of the D-glucopyranoside composition from plants that were treated with the lyophilin monoclonal antibody. In addition, the average amino acid composition of D-glucopyranoside extract from Eucalyptus sp. JAS-3921 was similar to that of D-glucopyranoside extract from plants that were treated with the lyophilin monoclonal antibody, as shown in Table 1.


## Discussion
The present case describes a patient who died of renal failure due to renal failure. The patient was an outlier in the overall mortality rate for the mortality rate of patients with renal failure.

The patient's initial symptoms and MRI revealed signs of renal failure, which was consistent with previous reports of renal failure in HIV-infected patients. However, he did not respond to treatment or ART, and his liver function and laboratory findings were negative for Cryptococcus. The patient's initial neurological exam also showed significant impairment of the left ventricular system, which was consistent with renal failure.

As a result of the initial clinical presentation and the presence of renal failure, the patient was treated with antifungal therapy and started on ART. However, the patient did not have renal replacement therapy.
