## Abstract
The coelomycete, Caenorhabditis elegans, is the sole biotechnologically and industrially producing organism. In the present study, the occurrence of different populations of Caenorhabditis in rice flours and their interactions with other fungi were studied. A total of 107 samples from 97 different samples were collected, Each sample was colonized by 106 different fungal strains. The influence of different inoculum weights (i.e. [0-100] × 106 colony forming units] on the fungal population was studied. The results showed that different inoculum weights might have different effects on the different fungal populations. In the presence of glucose, 100% of the fungal populations were dominated by Ascomycota and Aspergillus. In the absence of glucose, the relative abundances of Aspergillus, Mortierellania, and Fusarium were significantly lower than in the control rice flours. These results suggested that the interaction between A. fumigatus and its close relative A. flavus might be an important factor in the establishment of this yeast. Furthermore, the results suggested that the presence of glucose might induce the host to undergo changes in its metabolism to suit the different population sizes. Taken together, these results suggest that different genetic backgrounds and environmental factors might have a major effect on the different fungal populations.


## Introduction

Anhydrase is an evolutionary conserved amino acid sequence homologous to the enzyme of energy metabolism and (the) catalytic activity [20. It is conserved from organisms to vertebrates and invertebrates, including yeasts and mammals [21], [22]. In yeasts, there are three isoforms: N-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-2-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl and N-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-2-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl [23]. In mammals, there are six isoforms: N-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-2-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl, N-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-2-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl, and N-hexadecane-4-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl. The canonical isoforms are hydroxyl, hydroxyl, and catechol, respectively. The second isoform, N-hexadecanoyl-2-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl, is the one with two unique substitutions (N-hexadecane-4-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl) and is found in the N- and C-termini of both the N- and C-termini [24]. The canonical isoform is hydroxyl, while the N-hexadecane-4-epoxy-ß-d-glucopyranosyl substitutions are not essential for the presence of the N- and C-termini, but are necessary for the formation of hydroxyl groups on the N-termini [24]. In the second isoform, the N- and C-termini are modified and are present in the <U+0394>^6,8-d-glucan and N-hexadecane-4-epoxy-ß-d-glucan (Fig 1). The second isoform is the hydroxyl group is recognized by N- and C-terminal N- and C-termini. The N- and C-termini are short and unique.


## Methods
For the in vivo model of “Nucleotolerance”, 2 × 10^6 Candida albicans cells were inoculated in a 96-well plate (Pelletaxcell^® Cell Sorter, Cellgro, America) at a concentration of 10^5 cells/ml in RPMI-164. For the in vivo model of “Nucleotolerance”, 2 × 10^5 Candida albicans cells were inoculated in a 96-well plate (Pelletaxcell^® Cell Sorter, Cellgro, America) at a concentration of 10^5 cells/ml in RPMI-1640. In order to allow for the in vivo models of “Nucleotolerance” to continue, 1 × 10^5 Candida albicans cells were inoculated in a 96-well plate (Pelletaxcell^® Cell Sorter, Cellgro, America) at a concentration of 10^4 cells/ml in RPMI-1640. The in vivo model of “Nucleotolerance” was also performed using the above conditions. The in vivo model of “Nucleotolerance” was performed in a 24-well plate (Pelletaxcell^® Cell Sorter, Cellgro, America) at a concentration of 10^4 cells/ml in RPMI-1640.

The results obtained in the in vivo model of “Nucleotolerance” were interpreted as follows: negative (positive anhydrase assay) or positive (negative anhydrase assay) results were interpreted as follows: negative (negative anhydrase assay), positive (negative anhydrase assay), negative (negative anhydrase assay), or negative (positive anhydrase assay).


## Results
Anhydrase activity was observed in the peptide of a tetrahymena thermophila protease active site (THS) peptide for the first time in this stud.


## Discussion
 2013. The results of the current study revealed that Pentameric Anhydrase from Thermophila thermophila, in the presence of an anhydrous substrate, was able to degrade the substrate, and also to penetrate the cell wall of the pathogen. This is quite remarkable because Thermophila thermophila is an obligate symbiont for the majority of its hosts and is highly adapted to living in the environment. Its exposure to the substrate and degradation, as well as other stressors, are crucial in its pathogenesis and virulence (Lauber et al., 2008).

Thermophila thermophila infection is a highly virulent fungus in humans, with a high mortality rate (0.0005%). In addition to the fact that Thermophila thermophila is capable to utilize various substrates, such as acetaldehyde, acetate, glycerol, and myristate, it has been shown that the yeast also utilizes these substrates as a means of survival and proliferation in the human host (Oshima et al., 2004). In our study, Thermophila thermophila was treated with acetaldehyde and glycerol, and then these substrates were either added to the medium or the yeast was transferred to an agar medium. The acetaldehyde concentration in the medium was higher than that in the medium without acetaldehyde, and the growth was enhanced, but the acetaldehyde concentration was lower than that in the medium without acetaldehyde (Figure 2). This suggests that acetaldehyde, which is a fungistatic agent, is able to degrade the substrate and to penetrate the cell wall. This is in contrast to the situation in the murine model, which is a less pathogenic fungus, where the fungus can utilize glucose as a carbon source. In a murine infection model, there was a lack of acetaldehyde in the medium with acetaldehyde, but this was not observed in the medium with acetaldehyde. However, the lack of acetaldehyde in the medium with acetaldehyde resulted in a lack of fungal growth (Figure 2). The carbon source was found to be the yeast itself, which could be an interesting target for future research on the possibility of using acetaldehyde as an a means to kill microbes.

The synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, is critical for fungal growth and development. C.
