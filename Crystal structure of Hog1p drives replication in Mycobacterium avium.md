## Abstract
We aimed to determine the prevalence of fungal colonization in pigeon nests by examining the growth rate and incidence of most fungi in the early hours of light, as well as the occurrence and the diversity of Aspergillus and Penicillium species. We also examined the composition of fungal populations in pigeon nests by comparing the specimens among the same individuals at two locations in northern Thailand. Dark and light-dark microscopy images were obtained at two locations in Thailand and dark and light microscopy at the same location from three other countries in Europe. A total of 12,760 light-dark and 12,980 light-dark images were obtained. The fungal populations were assigned according to the laws of the Province of British Columbia (the Northern Mariana Islands), where the specimens were stored, and the northern and southern part of the United States. Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger were the most abundant genera. Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Penicillium spp. were the other prevalent fungi. The incidence of most fungal species was observed at early hours of light in pigeon nests but declined during the darkness of the northern part of the United States.


## Introduction
In macrophages, Hog1p is taken up by the cytoplasmic membrane and resides there at the tip of the giant cell [12,13,14. During macrophage phagocytosis, Hog1p is taken up by the vacuole and internalized by the vacuole. The vacuole then serves as the intracellular compartment where the vacuole stores the Hog1p. The vacuole then serves as the major storage site of the newly synthesized Hog1p [11,12,13].

The vacuolar compartment is comprised of a large number of proteins that are collectively referred to as vacuolar proteins. Vacuolar proteins consist of the typical polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, and protein backbone [15,16]. The vacuolar proteins are distinguished from the other proteins by their assembly into large proteins, known as small vacuoles (V-type) or large protein bodies (V-C) [17]. Small proteins are defined by the presence of an acidic amino acid sequence, which is followed by the formation of an acid-base complex and the addition of an ionic bond [18,19]. As a result, the small proteins can be separated from the larger proteins by a process known as de novo synthesis. As a result, the smaller proteins can be separated from larger proteins by an acid-base conjugation [20]. In the de novo synthesis process, the small proteins are often transferred from the cytoplasm to the vacuole where they can be further processed. The resulting products can then be re-assigned and purified to prevent the formation of large protein bodies. In the presence of the inhibitors, the small proteins are further purified, purified and purified again to ensure the protection of the protein from the toxicity of the drug. The de novo synthesis process is highly efficient in the presence of the inhibitors. Moreover, the large protein bodies are transported back and forth between the vacuole and cytoplasm via the cytoplasm to the vacuole and back again to the cytoplasm by the diffusion of small proteins [21].

Hog1p is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that is highly expressed during M. avium infection.


## Methods
glaucus) were inoculated in 500 µl of liquid MM (Luria-Bertani (LB) medium) with or without 10 mM H_2O_2 at 37°C in the dar. To observe the production of Hog1p, 100 µl of 1 × 10^6 conidia was inoculated into the medium in the dark at 37°C and examined under a dissecting microscope.

DNA extraction and PCR amplification
DNA was extracted using the UltraClean^TM Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and quality of extracted DNA was evaluated on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR primers and products of DNA extraction were treated with an EZYM Universal PCR SuperMix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) to analyze the products of DNA extraction. The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s. Amplification products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands) at Macrogen Inc. (Frankfurt, Germany).

Phylogenetic analysis of Hog1p and Hog1p in the closely related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
The sequences of the Hog1p gene and the Hog1p gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, version 3.4.1; http://www.yeastgenome.org) and from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, version 2.0.2; http://www.yeastgenome.org/index.html). The sequences of the Hog1p gene were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, version 3.


## Results
 2001; Kurtzman and Kurtzman, 2002. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis shows two different Hog1p orthologs: one ortholog of Hog1p (MAPK-PD-1) and the other of Hog1p (MAPK-PD-2) (Fig 5). These proteins are present in both yeast and human, but not in other fungi (Fig 5).

Pheromone response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
We next asked if Hog1p is involved in the regulation of the mating response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To test the hypothesis that Hog1p is not involved in mating in yeast, we constructed a strain in which Hog1p is expressed as the pheromone precursor from the promoter of MAPK-PD-1 (S. cerevisiae) (Fig 6). This strain, designated Hog1p-PD-1, contains both the wild-type (WT) and pheromone response reporter (PR) genes and is resistant to osmotic stress (Fig 6). In the absence of the pheromone precursor, the pheromone response is strongly dependent on the transcription factor pherA (Fig 6). The pherA promoter sequence is predicted to be absent in Hog1p-PD-1. As a control, we also constructed an independent pherA gene, which contains a wild-type pherA promoter, and replaced the pherA promoter in the pherA strain with the pherA promoter (Fig 6). This pherA strain is resistant to osmotic stress (Fig 6). We then tested the effect of the pherA-pherA strain on mating-type formation in wild-type, Hog1p-PD-1, and Hog1p-PD-2 strains. We found that the pherA-pherA strain (Fig 6) was defective in the pheromone response in yeast compared to wild-type (WT) strains (Fig 6). Interestingly, the pherA-pherA strain also showed a significant decrease in the expression of the MAPK-PD-1 gene compared to the wild-type strain (Fig 6). These results indicate that Hog1p is a potential target of the in vitro Pheromone response pathway.


## Discussion
This protein has been shown to be involved in the regulation of virulence in different pathogen. For instance, deletion of Hog1p resulted in the loss of pathogenicity in C. neoformans [43], but the Hog1p homolog in C. albicans [40] is required for the virulence of the pathogen, which was not observed in the wild-type strain. A second example of a Hog1p-mediated MAPK-mediated pathway is the Hog1p kinase (Hog1p) in S. cerevisiae [74], where it is activated by the Hog1p MAPK Hog1p kinase. Hog1p is a key player in controlling the formation of the two-component system in the ER, but it is also involved in regulating downstream pathways involved in ER stress and stress-induced gene expression [75].

In the above-mentioned example, we observed that the Pkc kinase (Pkc2) is involved in MAPK signaling, and the HOG1 kinase (Hog1p) and MAPK Hog1p (Pkc2) are both involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, with the Pkc2 and HOG1 proteins, as well as Hog1p and HOG1p-Pkc2-HOG1 proteins, both acting upstream of the Hog1p MAPK signaling pathway. This mechanism is similar to the MAPK pathway in S. cerevisiae, where the MAPK Hog1p (Pkc2) is activated by the Hog1p MAPK protein [76]. The MAPK pathway is activated by the HOG1 MAPK protein (Hog1p) and the Hog1p homolog (Hog1p) in the ER, but it is activated by the Hog1p homolog in the ER, which is a MAPK-type kinase. It is also involved in ER stress, ER stress-related gene expression, and stress-induced gene expression [77].

The HOG1 protein is also involved in the regulation of the ER stress-related gene expression, ER stress-related gene expression, and ER stress-related gene expression [78].
