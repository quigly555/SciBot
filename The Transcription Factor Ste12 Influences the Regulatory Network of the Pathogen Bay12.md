## Abstract
Infections of the reproductive tract can often be caused by pathogens or by other environmental insults. Research has shown that the fungal cell wall is not only the first barrier destroyed during infection, but it also provides protection from the subsequent damage, as shown by the critical role of a cell wall biopolymer compound (CBM). CMBs have two major components: the ß-glucan and the a-glucan outer chain. We recently reported the synthesis of a new CBM, designed to disrupt the ß-glucan outer chain and the fungal CBM. The CBM showed several properties, such as an efficient synthesis of CBM that was incorporated into the cell wall and released by exogenous synthesis of the fungal sphingolipid glucan, and it also produced an efficient CBM that was released by the germ tube formation and release of the sphingolipid glucan. CBMs were also able to produce the major components of the polysaccharide capsule, which is a structure that protects fungal cells from the outside world. In this review, we summarize the CBM activity and the properties that make CBMs effective CBMs.

## Methods
Ethics statement
No clinical or veterinary samples were collected from patients admitted to ICU with peritonitis or leukemia. All patients with pulmonary or peritoneal carcinoma were screened for ICU-related risks with various treatment regimens, such as amphotericin B and fluconazole, in accordance with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) guidelines. The clinical data of patients with pulmonary or peritoneal carcinoma and the microbiological data were from the National Center for Health Statistics (CHS) database.

Study population
We screened and collected information from 677 patients admitted to ICU with peritoneal carcinoma or cancer, in the first half of 2009-2010. Patients were selected for inclusion based on the following criteria: (1) body mass index (BMI) < 16.5 in the first month; (2) presence of renal disease (KD) > 16.5 in the second month, (3) age > 16 years, (4) history of active tuberculosis, (5) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (6) active liver cirrhosis, (7) antifungal therapy, (8) current or previous organ transplantation, and (9) clinical symptoms of sepsis.


## Results
dermatitidis, we employed the STE12 gene set in . dermatitidis to probe gene regulation in response to a range of environmental stressors. In a previous study, STE12 was used to predict gene expression and gene regulation in response to a variety of environmental stresses. Our previous work has shown that STE12 is essential for virulence in the P. aeruginosa model of systemic candidiasis12 and that STE12 may have a role in pathogenicity in the P. aeruginosa model of systemic candidiasis14. Our BLASTX analysis identified a set of orthologs of the Yap1 orthologs from B. dermatitidis, with high similarity to the enzymes involved in the virulence of B. dermatitidis. In addition, the STE12 orthologs from B. dermatitidis also displayed similarity to the Cdc42 orthologs from B. dermatitidis, indicating that the B. dermatitidis STE12 orthologs are highly homologous to the Cdc42 orthologs from B. dermatitidis. We also found a set of orthologs of the protein kinases that were implicated in the pathogen tolerance and virulence of B. dermatitidis15. These included the kinases Ste12 (FKBPK1), Fks1 (FKBPK2), and Uef1 (FKBPK3). All the proteins in this group were highly similar to the orthologs of the S. cerevisiae pksP, S. passeurins, and S. passeurin, with an average similarity of 81% (Table 1).

To investigate the regulatory network of B. dermatitidis, we performed an RNA-Seq-PCR to evaluate the expression of the B. dermatitidis STE12 orthologs in response to heat stress. In the heat stress experiment, the STE12 gene was co-expressed with the STE12 gene in the heat shock-induced developmental phase of B. dermatitidis (Fig 3). In contrast, the expression of the B. dermatitidis STE12 orthologs in response to heat stress was not co-expressed with the STE12 gene in the heat shock-induced developmental phase of B. dermatitidis (Fig 3). In the heat stress experiment, the expression of the B.


## Discussion
In this study, we also identified putative Ste12 homologs in . marneffei, which we have characterized in detail in detail in this manuscript. The present results indicate that the molecular basis of P. marneffei-specific expression of PpSte12 is conserved in other eukaryotes.

To further elucidate the function of PpSte12, we examined the transcriptional profile of the P. marneffei genome. The P. marneffei genome encodes a total of 39 homologs, of which 22 are PpF_2F_2 (Table S6), 5 PpF_2F_2 (Table S7), 2 PpF_2F_3 (Table S8), and 1 PpF_3F_4 (Table S9). The number of homologs was significantly higher in P. marneffei than in other eukaryotes.

PpF_2F_2 is a highly conserved transcription factor that is involved in numerous biological processes. It is essential for proper mitotic progression, cell cycle progression, and virulence in a wide range of eukaryotes (Jankowiak et al., 1999; Vassilou et al., 2001; Wiebe et al., 2007; Tayar et al., 2011). PpF_2F_2 is also essential for proper mitotic progression in other eukaryotes (Vassilou et al., 2001; Tayar et al., 2011). The transcriptional response of PpF_2F_3 is induced by pH, temperature, and low osmolarity (Wieser and Blackwell, 2000). The transcriptional response of PpF_3F_4 is induced by osmotic stress (Chao and Blackwell, 2000). The transcriptional response of PpF_3F_4 is induced by low pH (Bouza et al., 2007). PpF_3F_4 is induced by high osmolarity and low osmotic shock (Chao et al., 2007). The PpF_3F_4 is induced by low temperature and low osmolarity (Wieser and Blackwell, 2000). The PpF_3F_4 is also induced by low osmolarity and low osmotic shock (Chao et al., 2007).
