## Abstract
A significant diversity of model fungal strains, both unicellular and multicellular organisms, do not reproduce sexually, and pathogens often have a restricted arsenal of options for sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction in these organisms has been shown to involve a combination of genetic and chemical tinkering. This article reviews the current state of sexual reproduction and the problems and strategies that can drive evolution of sexual reproduction in fungal species.

## Introduction
Malassezia is a major fungal skin disorder with an estimated incidence of 0.3 million new cases of infection per year [1]. The disease is associated with a spectrum of clinical presentations and is associated with a poor prognosis [2].


## Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Los Angeles General Hospital, National Institutes of Health, and written informed consent was obtaine. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (Protocol #117/13).

All the oral candidiasis patients were screened by the Pathology Department, Los Angeles General Hospital, and clinical officers were selected from the Los Angeles General Hospital, San Fernando Hospital, and San Fernando Hospital General Hospital, respectively. The microbiology check-ups were performed at the hospital laboratories, and all the patients were clinically diagnosed as having candidiasis. The diagnosis of Candida infection was made based on a blood culture from the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage of Candida species cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) at 37°C for 48 hours. Candida meningitis was diagnosed by the detection of a yeast or filamentous sporangia on SDA at 37°C for 48 hours. Candida meningitis was defined as clinical meningitis with symptoms consistent with candidiasis and were accompanied by other symptoms consistent with Candida meningitis [17]. The clinical diagnosis of Candida infection was made based on a blood culture from the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage of Candida species cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar at 37°C for 48 hours. Candida meningitis was defined as clinical meningitis with symptoms consistent with Candida meningitis [17].

Treatment of Candida infections was categorized into three main subtypes. The first category was defined as the treatment of Candida infection, which included oral antimicrobial agents, including cyclosporine, fluconazole, and voriconazole. The second category was defined as the treatment of Candida infection with fungicides and/or any other combination of fungicides and/or fungicides. The third subtype was defined as the treatment of Candida infection with any other combination of fungicides and/or fungicides. All of the patients were treated with the combined pharmacological and antifungal drugs and/or other combination of fungicides.

## Discussion
However, at the same time, the use of Amphotericin B in combination with Glycopeptide was considered a risk facto. Our study also confirmed that Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide could be used together in combination therapy for the treatment of CNS disease.

In the present study, we showed that a combination of Glycopeptide and Amphotericin B was effective for the treatment of disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton tonsurans. In addition, we also demonstrated that this combination treatment can be used in combination therapy against disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans. It is known that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide have been described. Moreover, synergistic interactions were demonstrated in Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton tonsurans. In addition, the synergism of Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide could be due to antagonism of the two drugs and the synergism of Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide. It is known that antagonism can occur due to antagonism between Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide, which is a common side effect of Amphotericin B and other antifungal drugs. In the present study, Amphotericin B could be used in combination therapy to treat the patient with the above mentioned treatment condition.

In our study, we demonstrated that Amphotericin B could be used in combination therapy with Amphotericin B for the treatment of disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton tonsurans. The synergistic and antagonistic interactions between Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide could be due to antagonism between Amphotericin B and Glycopeptide. It is known that antagonism is caused by antagonism of glycoside-2 which is a common side effect of Amphotericin B and other antifungal drugs. Amphotericin B can be used in combination therapy to treat disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton tonsurans.
