## Abstract
There is a high prevalence of serious invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in the United States and substantial rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antimicrobial resistance, dysregulated gene expression and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics pose major threats to public health. Medical care access to these patients is improving dramatically in recent years. Invasive mycoses requires timely initiation and effective management. Unfortunately, the development of resistance to commonly used first line antifungals (antifungal antibodies) poses significant challenges. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the factors associated with the development of resistance to commonly used first line antifungals.


## Introduction
 is a native plant that is widely cultivated in many countrie. It is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases, including diabetes, toothache, cold, cough, and other skin and soft tissue infections [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13].


## Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of the Kalahariou (approval number: KAL-079/11).

Fungi and Mycelial Isolates
A collection of 16 Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates was obtained from the Microbiology Laboratory of the University of the Kalahariou (UFK), the principal laboratory of the University of the Kalahariou. All strains are listed in Table 1. Prior to fungal culture, fungal tissues were harvested from infected leaves of the same patient.


## Results
%), strongly odorless (.5%) and weak odor (0.4%) when it was touched with the cottony margin. The oil showed moderate to strong odour (0.4%) (Fig 1B) and strong odor (0.3%) (Fig 1C). The oil was shown to have moderate to strong odour (0.3%) and strong odor (0.3%) when it was touched with the cottony margin.

In vitro inhibitory activity of Piper cubeba essential oil against R. delemar
The inhibitory activity of Piper cubeba essential oil against R. delemar was examined by the activity of essential oils against R. delemar and R. delemar oil. The essential oils were tested against R. delemar at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.5 g/mL. The results showed that the essential oils were very active against R. delemar (Table 1).

## Discussion
by . by Wang et al. 2018 (Table 2).

2.2. Analysis of Oil Content
A total of 24.2 % (3,813) of the oil content was obtained from C. quadriline L. by Wang et al. 2018. The crude oil from C. quadriline L. contained almost 91 % of the oil-soluble components. The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was also able to solubilize hydrocarbons such as ethanol and glycerol. However, the oil content of the crude oil from C. quadriline L. was comparable to the crude oil from B. cinerea L. (37.1 %), which contained 42.6 % of the oil-soluble components. The crude oil from B. cinerea L. contained almost 70 % of the oil-soluble components.

2.3. Analysis of Oil Content
The crude oil from C. quadriline L. showed a crude oil content of 19.6 % (13,610) using all the three LCMS. The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was also able to solubilize H_2O_2 and hexane (Table 3). The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was also able to solubilize ethyl acetate (Table 3).

The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was able to solubilize trichloroacetane (Table 3). The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was also able to solubilize benzyl alcohol (Table 3). The crude oil from C. quadriline L. was also able to solubilize ethyl acetate (Table 3).
