## Abstract
The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a causative agent of blast disease of rice and a causative agent of fission yeast, the most common genet of the cereal and human species. The genome of M. oryzae comprises a small proportion of its chromosome that encodes <U+0394>36 BITS-aligned DNA sequence elements (DVs). DVs are polymorphic, which are often derived from a single copy of another chromosome. One such group of DVs is known as the <U+0394>36 CID-like element (DOL). This paper reviews the current understanding of the diversity of the DVs within the genome of M. oryzae and compares the diversity of genes involved in fungal DVs with those of related fungi. We also discuss the evolution of DVs within fungal genomes and the impact of the <U+0394>36 CID-like element on the evolution of fungal DVs.


## Introduction
The genus Gloeandromyces is comprised of pathogenic species that can cause infections in both humans and animals [1,2]. Infections caused by Gloeandromyces species are relatively uncommon, and the majority of infections caused by these species are attributed to the species themselves [3]. In Europe, G. gingivalis is the most common and most aggressive member of the Gloeandromyces clade, with an estimated 20% of all reported infections being caused by this group [4]. Although the majority of infections caused by Gloeandromyces are caused by other species of the genus Gloeandromyces, members of Gloeandromyces are increasingly found in the European Union (EU) as well [4].

The genus Gloeandromyces is divided into four sections: Gloeandromyces section V, Gloeandromyces section VI and Gloeandromyces section VII [5]. Section V is divided into two divisions: “Section Va and Vb,” according to the number of cells present in each division, and “Section Vc and Vd,” according to the number of cells present in each division. The division number is calculated as (1 - 2) divided by the number of divisions: “Section V: Vd,” the number of cells divided by division V, corresponds to the number of cells in each division that are present in each division. For example, the number of division V is (2,500) = 500 cells.


## Methods
To study TNFR activity in eukaryotic TNFRs, we used a control set of eukaryotic TNFRs and tested them in vitro using eukaryotic TNFR. The eukaryotic TNFRs were also tested in vitro using a control set of eukaryotic TNFRs. In order to evaluate TNFR phosphorylation in TNFRs, we used a control set of eukaryotic TNFRs and also tested them in vivo. The SLCF assay consists of SLCF and SLCF, respectively.

Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism, version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the three-point correlation. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine statistical significance, and P values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. The analysis of the relative immunogenicity was conducted using GraphPad Prism, version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Ethical Statement
This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol for the generation of N. crassa isolates was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Minnesota, and the protocol for the determination of female BALB/c mice was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This study was approved by the University of Minnesota Animal Ethics Committee (IACUC).

Fungal Strains and Culture Media
S. cerevisiae strains CBS 9082 and S. pombe strains CBS 971, CBS 9700 and S. cerevisiae strains SC5314, S. pombe strains SC5313, and <U+0394>srs1<U+0394>srs2<U+0394>srs were grown at 28°C in liquid YPD (0.


## Results
The remaining eight genes were not included in the datase. Table S5 shows the results of analyses of the three-dimensional gel plot of TNFR (fdr<0.05) and TNFR-dependent protein phosphatase (fdr<0.05) protein phosphatase (pbs<0.05) protein phosphatase (pbs<0.05) protein phosphatase (pbs<0.05) protein phosphatase (pbs<0.05)) gene expression profiles in a sera from outpatients. The data are reported in Table S6.

We identified 22 genes with a significant expression profile in outpatients compared to in controls (Table S5). Of the 22 genes, 14 were specifically up-regulated in outpatients and 18 were significantly up-regulated in in controls. The majority of these genes were found to be up-regulated in inpatients and in controls but the expression profile differed between inpatients and controls. Out of these genes, 17 were found to be significantly up-regulated in outpatients and 11 were significantly up-regulated in in controls.

In addition, we found 21 genes that are involved in the regulation of the cell wall integrity pathway. These genes were involved in the regulation of the cell wall and the adhesion molecule sphingolipid synthesis pathway, glycerolipid metabolism, and sterol metabolism. These genes were found to be up-regulated in inpatients and in controls but not in in any other group. In addition, we found 14 genes that were up-regulated in outpatients but not in in controls.

A genetic map of TNFR-dependent protein phosphatase and phosphatase activity in the sera of outpatients
The results of the three-dimensional gel plot of TNFR and TNFR-dependent protein phosphatase activity in the sera of outpatients are presented in Fig 4. The analysis revealed that the analysis of TNFR-dependent protein phosphatase and phosphatase activity in sera revealed a wide range of expression patterns that were dependent on TNFR and TNFR-dependent protein phosphatase activity.


## Discussion
benthamiana

Our results provide a novel example of a . benthamiana pathogen that is able to secrete complexed lipids that may be used for other purposes in a non-neoformans, pathogenic fungus. The ability of N. benthamiana to use lipids as a carbon source has been previously shown in other fungi such as A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae [17], [18], [41], [43]. The first example of a pathogenic N. benthamiana N. benthamiana N-glycosylation enzyme is T. melanosporum DSCC17010, which is present in the complete genome of N. benthamiana [44]. The second example is a synthetic N. benthamiana lipase, N. benthamiana LKR28054 (GenBank access number CC030714), that is present in the complete genome of N. benthamiana [45]. The third example is the lipase, N. benthamiana RGT1, that is present in the complete genome of N. benthamiana [46]. The fourth example is the lipase, N. benthamiana FKRP1, which is present in the complete genome of N. benthamiana [47].

The characterization of N. benthamiana N-glycosylation enzyme as a carbon source has previously been reported in other fungi such as A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae [17], [18], [41], [43]. The enzyme is present in the complete genome of N. benthamiana, and the N-glycosylation occurs on the glycosylated substrate, which is the glycerol that is present in the cell wall of N. benthamiana [48]. The results of this study suggest that N-glycosylation of lipids may play a significant role in the pathogenic role of N. benthamiana.

The mechanism of N. benthamiana N-glycosylation has been proposed as a key mechanism for the inhibition of several antifungal drugs. The mechanism of N. benthamiana N-glycosylation of lipids has been reported in other fungi such as A. fumigatus [17], [18], [41], [43].
