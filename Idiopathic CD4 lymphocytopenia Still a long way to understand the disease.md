# Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia: Still a long way to understand the disease
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
We report a case of a post-neoplastic central nervous system infection in a patient who presented with ileal arthromyalgia. The patient had a past medical history that included Hodgkin's lymphoma and he was treated with broad spectrum antispasmodic therapies. The patient was diagnosed with lymphocytopenia and cryptococcal meningitis. He developed poorly with subacute onset of symptoms and left arm weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed bilateral extension of the left central nervous system. Histopathology of the meninges was positive for Neosartoryin E2 antibodies. The patient was treated with rituximab and abacavir. He had a good clinical and radiological response. This case illustrates the potential for opportunistic infections in immune patients, especially those on immunosuppressive therapy, and for the need for new diagnostic methods.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is a rare entity that is typically a consequence of a neuroimmune pathology caused by traumatic injury of the brain or other body organs and is usually diagnosed by neurologic examination such as cerebral ischemia, which can occur with traumatic brain injury, ischemia, which can occur without neurologic symptoms, and so on. It is most commonly a consequence of traumatic brain injury and can occur without neurological symptoms. In the case of ischemia and stroke, the most common site is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and can be confirmed by MRI, and its location on the CSF is usually suggestive of a neurological diagnosis. Severe stroke is the most common site. Despite the importance of stroke in the development of the disease, the exact diagnosis is still difficult, and the most common neurological diagnosis is vasculopathy. Severe vasculopathy is usually caused by infectious or infectious-related causes. An infectious cause is usually found at a young age, and usually presents with multiple organ dysfunction, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a leading cause of death in children less than two years of age. The other causes include auto-immune disorders, such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), auto-Alzheimer’s disease, and myelin protease inhibitors (MPL) such as amyloid protein sulphate (APS), amyloid beta-1ß, and methylene chloride [1-3]. Stroke can also be caused by infectious causes, but the most common are caused by environmental sources such as swimming pools or environments contaminated with mold or other fungi [4,5].

The CSF is an important organ in neurological disease. Although it is the most common site of septic shock in children and adults, stroke is a common presenting abnormality in older children and adults [6]. CSF is an important source of circulating inflammatory mediators and immune cells, which can mediate a variety of other immunologic processes, including inflammatory diseases, inflammatory diseases, and auto-immune disorders [7]. CSF is also a mediator of the immune response, which can help with anti-inflammatory reactions in the host. Furthermore, it can be used as a material of immune responses, which can mediate immune responses and other important processes in the body [7,8].


## Methods
albicans has been reported in human immunocompromised patients [27.

In brief, patients were divided into three groups: (1) non-coagulated, (2) coagulated and (3) coagulated with an antigen-specific antibody. After the patients were treated, they were given fluconazole for the first time. Their symptoms were monitored by four specialists (Hsieh, K.N. and D.A.L.) who evaluated them daily, and after the patient was discharged, the fluconazole was again taken as treatment. Each group was divided into four subsets: (1) non-coagulated, (2) coagulated and (3) coagulated with an antigen-specific antibody. After the patients were discharged, they were given fluconazole for the first time.

After the patients were discharged, the blood culture was done on C. albicans by the biochemical method, and the blood culture was kept at 37°C. Then, the cells were centrifuged, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS. Then, they were re-suspended in 1 ml of 2% sheep blood and the absorbance was adjusted to a range of 540-650 nm using an optical scale. The A260/A280 ratio was calculated using the following equation:

Statistical analysis
The data was analyzed using SPSS version 14.0. For survival rate, the Kaplan-Meier method was used. For the CD4 cell count, the log-rank test was applied. For the CD4 cell count at the end of the treatment period, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was applied. For the survival rate, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 14.0. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 14.0. For the categorical variables, the <U+03C7>^2 statistic was applied.

In order to evaluate the mortality, the Kaplan-Meier method was used.


## Results

Differences in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte populations in the CNS are also being observed
In order to examine the population of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the CNS during the development of . neoformans, the population was analyzed by flow cytometry. At the early stages of infection, we found that the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in the CNS than in the early infection. However, at the late stages of infection, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were significantly lower in the CNS than in the early infection (Figure 2A). Interestingly, at the early infection stage, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were significantly higher in the CNS than in the early infection stage. The difference in the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the CNS was not significant. In order to examine whether the differences in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were due to differences in the lymphocyte population, we analyzed the composition of the CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the CNS at the early infection stage.

From the data above, it appears that the early stage of infection has the greatest effect on the CNS lymphocyte population, and the late stage of infection has the greatest effect on the CNS lymphocyte population. To examine the differences in the composition of the CNS lymphocyte population during the CNS infection, we analyzed the fungal burden on the CNS during the infection process. In the CNS, the CNS lymphocyte population of C. neoformans is significantly decreased at the early infection stage, but this is not a statistically significant difference (Figure 2B). In order to further examine the difference in the CNS lymphocyte population during the CNS infection process, we analyzed the fungal burden on the CNS during the early infection stage. The CNS lymphocyte population of C. neoformans is significantly reduced at the early infection stage, but this is not statistically significant difference (Figure 2B). In addition, we analyzed the fungal burden on the CNS during the late infection stage. The CNS lymphocyte population of C. neoformans was significantly reduced at the late infection stage (Figure 2B).

We used a flow cytometry approach to characterize the CNS lymphocyte population during the CNS infection.
