## Abstract
A 10-year-old spayed female cat was presented with a 3-week history of progressive, 3-week history of abdominal a-lysia, pain, and burning sensation in the left upper limb, pain in the left lower limb, pain in the left upper limb, pain in the right lower limb, pain in the right lower limb, and then 3 weeks of generalized soreness, pain, and redness of the skin, joints, and skin, with no evidence of intrinsic or underlying infection. Computed tomography (CT) showed multiple granulomatous lesions with deep adenopathy in the right upper limb, skin, bones, and labrum, with the size of 3-week-old male cats ranging from 3.2 to 5.4 m.p.s. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an infection in a cat without a known cause in a nonpregnant woman. Cats are known to be immunocompromised and the presence of a lymphocytic adenocarcinoma is considered to be a diagnostic sign of endocrine cancer. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can reduce the mortality. In this report, we describe the development of a lymphocytic adenocarcinoma due to endocrine cancer in a very young age and review the treatment guidelines for this condition in the literature.


## Introduction
albicans cells with an engineered . albicans membrane protein have been demonstrated to be essential for virulence in two major human fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum [4]. The C. albicans cell membrane is structurally unique, with two types of macromolecules (membrane and extracellular matrix) at the protein interface. The cell surface protein A-binding proteins, A and B, are interconnected in a two-layered structure and are linked by a rigid self-assembly protein complex. A and B are linked by a complex protein network, which includes a zinc-finger, and a membrane-spanning protein, which is associated with the A-binding proteins [5]. The cysteine residues that form the A-binding protein network are not required for A-binding of membrane-spanning proteins and thus may represent novel targets for antifungal drug development [6]. However, the A and B proteins can bind each other and disrupt the membrane organization, thereby disrupting the cell signaling pathway. Moreover, there is a unique and variable turgor pressure that generates the A and B proteins to release their contents [7]. This pressure is sensed by the membrane-spanning proteins that in turn move the A and B proteins from the cysteine-bound form to the outer membrane of the cell. Finally, the turgor pressure of the A and B proteins causes the release of the cytosolic protein (Cys) from the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm, where it binds and binds with the molecular cargo Lys (LysB) and is transported into the cytoplasm [8].

The role of transgenic C. albicans cells with an engineered C. albicans membrane protein have been demonstrated to be essential for virulence in different fungi [9-11]. The C. albicans membrane protein E is an essential protein, as the protein is necessary for the formation of the extracellular matrix and the membrane anchoring complex, which anchors the cell wall, are important for the virulence of this fungus. The E protein is a target protein required for the virulence of the C. albicans species complex [12]. It has a high affinity for C-terminal glycine residues and is a target for the antibodies that bind glycine in the C. albicans species complex.


## Methods
Mycelial plugs of . cerevisiae were prepared from mycelium grown on PDA. After a week of growth at 37°C, the mycelium was harvested by vacuum filtration and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized cDNA was then treated with DNase I and reverse transcribed to form cDNA using the DIG Easy Reagent Kit (Life Technologies). The resulting cDNA was then used as a template for subsequent PCR amplification of the target genes using the T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Amplification of the cDNA of S. cerevisiae was performed by using the primer pair (S7F/S7R) and (S7C/S7C-T7R) (Table 1). The PCR amplification was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.

The PCR product was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was then used as a template for further PCR amplification using the primer pairs (S7F/S7R) and (S7C/S7C-T7R). The purified PCR product was then used as a template for a subsequent PCR amplification of the target genes using the T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies). The PCR amplification was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.

## Results
In one group, the non-specific gene, PDRC1, was highly up-regulated, and in the other, the multiple-gene-related gene, GPDR1, was down-regulate. Interestingly, the differential expression pattern was not distinct from the control, suggesting that there were no obvious differences between the two groups (Fig 4A and B). The gene-environment association results (Fig 5A) were consistent with the results of our previous studies that identified the potential association of PDRC1 with other DE genes in S. cerevisiae [5], [7], [10].

To analyze the association between the specific genes and DE genes in the three experimental groups, we performed gene-environment association analysis using two-gene interaction (GAT) analysis. We found no significant interaction between the genes of PDRC1 and the DE genes of the two experimental groups (data not shown). Gene-environment association analysis showed that PDRC1 and PDRR1 genes shared a similar pathway (Fig 5C). GAT analysis revealed that the gene-environment association result of PDRC1 and PDRR1 was consistent with the results of our previous studies that identified the potential association of PDRC1 with other DE genes in S. cerevisiae [5], [7], [10]. In addition, the GAT analysis revealed that the DE genes of PDRC1 and PDRR1 were similar in their expression profiles and pathways. The results of the gene-environment association analysis (Fig 5D) and the GAT analysis (Fig 5E) suggest that PDRC1 and PDRR1 genes were highly induced in the infected tissue.

We examined the expression profiles of genes involved in transport, metabolism, and stress response in response to infection by PDRC1 and PDRR1. In contrast to the results of our previous study that showed up-regulation of the genes involved in transport, metabolism, and stress response in S. cerevisiae, the results of our previous study revealed that PDRC1 and PDRR1 genes were highly expressed in the infected tissue, and we were unable to determine the relative expression levels of these genes in the two groups of infected mice.


## Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of extracellular and extracellular proteome of . neoformans, and its extracellular proteome in vivo. We detected extracellular proteome of C. neoformans in addition to its extracellular proteome, and in vitro proteome of the fungus in vivo.

Our data show that C. neoformans secretes extracellular proteome in vivo, in a similar way as that of C. albicans, in contrast to the extracellular proteome of C. albicans in vitro. We observed that C. neoformans extracellular proteome is significantly enriched in the extracellular proteome. In addition, we found that the C. neoformans extracellular proteome has a much higher percentage of extracellular proteins than that of C. albicans, which might suggest that extracellular proteome of C. neoformans might have higher number of proteins involved in host invasion, and probably also more extracellular proteins than that of C. albicans. It was reported that extracellular proteome of C. albicans might be enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans, which might also have higher percentage of extracellular proteins. We also found that C. neoformans extracellular proteome is significantly enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans. Thus, we speculated that C. neoformans extracellular proteome might have higher number of proteins involved in host invasion, and might also be enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans, which might also be enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans. In addition, our data showed that extracellular proteome of C. neoformans was significantly enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans. Therefore, we speculated that C. neoformans extracellular proteome might be enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans, and might also have higher number of extracellular proteins.

Moreover, we also observed that the extracellular proteome of C. neoformans was enriched in extracellular proteome of C. albicans.
