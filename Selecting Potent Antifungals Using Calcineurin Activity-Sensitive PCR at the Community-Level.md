## Abstract
Ziziphora species and their polyketides, derived from plant, are highly valued for the production of a wide range of products. This review article focuses on recent discoveries on the synthesis of ziziphora diterpenes including natural products, which is of interest for the field and it´s potential for biotechnological use. Ziziphora species are known to be a source of natural products with several antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activity. The discovery of new natural products from these plants highlights their potential to act as a basis for the design of new antimicrobial agents and organosulfur compounds. The biological activity of natural products and their chemical structures are also discussed.


## Introduction

## Methods
The stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -20°. The stock solutions were tested by first-strand PCR using the Expand Fungal DNA Library Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified PCR products were then subjected to a second PCR using the Expand Fungal DNA Library Kit and the product was purified and sequenced in both directions. The sequences of the fungal strains used in this study were obtained from the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).

2.3. Assay of Potent Antifungal Activity
In order to identify the effect of Potent Antifungal BODIPY on the growth of P. brasiliensis yeast cells, the growth rate of the yeast was assayed using a previously described method [12]. Briefly, the yeast cells were grown at 37°C for 24 h in YPD broth (yeast extract 10 g, peptone 10 g, dextrose 20 g, agar 20 g, in 1 L of distilled water) and were washed twice with 1 L of distilled water. The cells were then adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL in 1 L of distilled water. The cells were then incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The media was then removed, and the yeast cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 L of distilled water. Then, they were resuspended in 1 L of distilled water and adjusted to a final concentration of 10^3 cells/mL. The cells were then further incubated at 37°C for 6 h in YPD broth, and the cell viability was assayed using the Candida Cell Viability Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

## Results
cerevisiae restriction enzyme (Stratagene-1, 3) and with the specific . cerevisiae restriction enzyme (SOD-1, 4) (S1 Table). The SOD-1 restriction enzyme is an enzyme that mutagenizes DNA sequences that are not well conserved in fungi and is critical for the binding of a specific protein of the restriction enzyme. The SOD-1 restriction enzyme has been shown to bind to the restriction site of the restriction enzyme of the restriction enzyme (S1 Table). Thus, the specificity of the restriction enzyme is essential to bind the specific restriction site.

The specificity of the restriction enzyme of the restriction enzyme was further tested using the specific S.


## Discussion
albicans NAC5645 gene was found to be expressed in both fungi, but only in . albicans. The C. albicans NAC5645 gene is constitutively expressed in both C. albicans and C. neoformans and the C. neoformans NAC5645 gene is constitutively expressed in C. albicans and C. neoformans, respectively. In contrast, C. albicans NAC5645 was expressed in both fungi and the C. albicans NAC5645 was constitutively expressed in both C. albicans and C. neoformans, respectively. To test if the C. albicans NAC5645 expression could be regulated by calcineurin, we constructed a calcineurin null mutant, C. albicans-CALB1, by deleting the CALB1 gene. Calcineurin was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [56], [57], [58], [59]. CAC1 expression was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. neoformans [60], [61]. CAC1 expression was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [62]. Calcineurin expression was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [63].

Calcineurin Is Regulated by CAC1 Gene in C. albicans
To test if the CAC1 gene in C. albicans is regulated by calcineurin, we tested the expression of the CAC1 gene in C. albicans by deleting the CAC1 gene from C. albicans. Calcineurin was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [64], [65]. To test if the CAC1 gene in C. albicans was regulated by calcineurin, we examined the expression of the CAC1 gene in C. albicans by deleting the CAC1 gene from C. albicans. Calcineurin was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [66]. Calcineurin was found to be regulated by CAC1 gene in C. albicans [67].
