## Abstract
In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the antifungal armamentarium to treat Aspergillus fumigatus infection in Galleria mellonella larvae. The treatment arm exhibited in vitro activity against A. fumigatus, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.03 µg/ml representing the most effective approach. The treatment arm also exhibited in vitro activity against planktonic cells, with a MIC of 0.03 µg/ml for A. fumigatus. In addition, the treatment arm also exhibited in vitro activity against free-living amoeba, an amoeba that exhibits a biphasic morphology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal armament against A. fumigatus in a fungal amoeba. The results of our study demonstrate that the armament can be used for treating A. fumigatus infection in Galleria mellonella larvae, and it can be used as a viable alternative for treatment of aspergillosis caused by A. fumigatus.


## Introduction
Pseudomonads are extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are present in cells from all three domains of life, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and can be produced in a number of different forms [1]. Some of these EVs can be categorized as cytoskeletal or non-cytoskeletal types [2]. These EVs can also be categorized as secretory or membrane vesicles. Extracellular EVs can be transported in the cytoskeleton, such as in the case of prokaryotic EVs, or in the plasma membrane, in order to interact with cell membranes, or to directly interact with internal membranes. In both cases, they may carry molecules with structural and functional properties that are essential for their functioning, and can interact with the same receptors expressed on the cell surface that are involved in the transport of molecules across the cell membrane.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotic cells, such as animals, plants, and fungi [3-6]. EVs can also be classified as membrane-trafficking EVs (MTEs), which transport molecules across the plasma membrane [7].


## Methods
1990, Petit et a. 1996, Hoekstra et al. 1997, Carstens et al. 1998, O’Donnell et al. 2000, Cox et al. 2002, Pardes et al. 2004). Alignments were prepared from the sequences of the candidate genes as described in Maier et al. (2006). Sequence data was deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers KT275251-KT275251 (KH-3D7), KT275254-KT275255 (KH-3D7), KT275256-KT275257 (KH-3D7), KT275259-KT275260 (KH-3D7), KT275261-KT275262 (KH-3D7), KT275263-KT275264 (KH-3D7), KT275265-KT275268 (KH-3D7), and KT275277-KT275278 (KH-3D7).

Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of Malassezia species, including the cytochrome oxidase genes, were retrieved from GenBank (Table S2). The protein sequences of Malassezia species identified in the present study were aligned with MEGA7 (Kumar et al. 2016) using the G-INS-i approach and the maximum likelihood (ML) method using the rapid bootstrap method (Mason-Gamer and Kellogg 1996) with the GTR substitution model. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using four independent runs of the same analysis, the first one with the lowest number of gene additions and the second one with the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. Phylogenetic trees were drawn by the PhyML-G program (http://phylip.org/) in the MEGA5 statistical environment using the GTR substitution model and the rapid bootstrap method (Mason-Gamer and Kellogg 1996). Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and the results are presented as the mean ± SD.

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research of the University of Pretoria and written informed consent was obtained.


## Results
The virulence of the first two, the members of the clade of the type and the type/type/type/type/type, was named as the clade of type/type/type/type, and was then assigned to the type/type/type/type-clad. In the type/type/type/type-clade, a homozygous deletion mutant (A549) was generated and named as A549/A549A. The other members of the type clade, A549A, A549/A549A and A549A/A549A, were named as A549A/A549A, A549A/A549A and A549A/A549A, respectively.

The virulence of Malassezia species was shown to be dominated by the type/type/type-clade, as the virulence of the type/type/type/type-clade was characterized by its virulence on C. glabrata. M. brevicollis was the first to be reported to have been isolated from a black mold, and was highly pathogenic to C. glabrata, which was the first to be reported to have been isolated from an unidentified black mold. The virulence of Malassezia species in the clinical isolates of M. brevicollis and M. clavigera, however, was severely reduced to that of the type/type/type-clade, as the type/type/type/type/type-clade was characterized by its less virulent phenotype, with the virulence being characterized by the inability to cause disease in mice [18]. Thus, the type/type/type/type/type-clade was considered to be the dominant type/type-clade in the clinical isolates of M. brevicollis and M. clavigera, as the virulence of the type/type/type/type-clade was characterized by its virulence being characterized by its inability to cause disease in mice [18].

The virulence of M. clavigera was characterized by its ability to cause disease in mice and its ability to cause disease in mice [18]. In this study, all three M.


## Discussion
Although the molecular approaches have been proven to be effective in the identification of Malassezia species, it is still possible that some Malassezia species present in . glabrata will be misidentified as Malassezia species by molecular methods. Future studies will focus on the genetic analysis of the three genetic determinants of Malassezia species. In addition to the molecular approaches, the methods have been shown to be sensitive, reproducible, and reproducible in detecting Malassezia species. The successful establishment of a Malassezia species is usually achieved by genetic approaches, but molecular approaches are still not practical in this field. The mechanism of origin of Malassezia species has not yet been studied in detail. In the present study, the molecular methods used by the authors in molecular detection of Malassezia species are available and have shown excellent reproducibility. In addition, the results of the molecular studies are consistent with those reported in the literature.

In the present study, we aimed to find novel molecular approaches that can be applied in a molecular screening study of Candida glabrata. The ability of the molecular detection methods to detect Malassezia species is of great importance in the screening of Candida strains. The successful isolation of Candida glabrata using molecular approaches demonstrated that the molecular methods can be useful for the detection of Malassezia species in Candida glabrata. The molecular methods have also shown that they can be useful for the identification of Malassezia species in Candida glabrata.

The molecular detection methods for the identification of Candida glabrata are currently limited. In this study, we have used molecular methods to detect Malassezia species in C. glabrata. Our results showed that the molecular detection methods could be useful for the identification of Malassezia species in Candida glabrata. However, our molecular methods showed that they can be unreliable in the identification of Malassezia species in C. glabrata. The molecular detection method can also be used for the identification of Candida glabrata.

The molecular detection methods also showed that they could be unreliable in the identification of Malassezia species in Candida glabrata.
