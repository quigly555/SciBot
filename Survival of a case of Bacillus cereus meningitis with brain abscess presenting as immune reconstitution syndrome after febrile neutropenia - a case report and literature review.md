## Abstract
The use of bifunctional transfer protein (ATP) junctions has been the tool for functional analysis of enzyme-protein interaction networks. ATP junctions are among the most common target proteins in eukaryotic cells, and the majority of ATPs are predicted to play roles distinct from those in the human pathogen. Targeting the function of the target protein in a major bacterial protein interacting with a putative human adhesion protein (HAP) may represent a means of altering protein function, as well as of fixing the HAP to a target partner.

We identified 14 ATP junctions in Streptomyces sp. (S. sp.) genome that are essential for growth and/or virulence. These ATPs are most critical for growth and/or the co-existence with HAPs, as they encode proteins required for the HAP binding and/or catalysis in proteases. We provide evidence that these junctions interact with a wide variety of bacterial and viral proteins, including complex metalloenzymes and putative metalloenzymes, as well as endocytobacteriophages, and peptidoglycan fragments.


## Introduction
The pathogenic fungi that infect plants and animals include Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Candida. The infection process begins with inhalation of airborne fungal propagules that disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS). From there, the infection progresses to pulmonary disease and death. Cryptococcosis is classified into two types based on the cell density of the organism (1). The pulmonary form includes those that have cells that can colonize the skin, the brain, the central nervous system, and the mucosa. The bloodstream form includes those that are able to invade the bloodstream, such as Cryptococcus neoformans (2). Although C. neoformans has many virulence factors, its most virulent form is the yeast form that can cause disease in healthy individuals. This species has been considered as a “virus of choice” because of its ability to infect both humans and animals (3). In addition to its human origin, C. neoformans can also cause disease in immunocompromised patients (4).

The ability of C. neoformans to cause disease has been well characterized. In vitro infection studies have shown that the fungus can survive in a variety of temperatures from 25°C to 37°C and can survive at temperatures between 28°C and 37°C. In vivo infection studies using immunodeficient mice have shown that the fungus can survive in acidic environments, such as the presence of NaCl and can survive at temperatures from 25°C to 37°C (5). In addition, C. neoformans can survive in a variety of environmental conditions, such as in the serum, at temperatures from 25°C to 37°C, and in a variety of body fluids, such as the spleen, liver, and heart (6).


## Methods

Ethical considerations
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Healt. All animals were handled in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Institutes of Health.

Study protocol
Following successful blood draw, animals were sacrificed by CO_2 inhalation. Corticosteroid overdose was induced in our animal model using a protocol from the animal studies group (NIAID, NIH-Frederick, MD) [8] and was clinically considered as an end-point of the experiment. A minimum of six animals were sacrificed in each treatment group. A mean of three animals was sacrificed in each group. We had sacrificed animals of both arms within two days of each other. Inoculation of spleens was performed by intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline in a volume of 100 µl. Spleens were harvested and stored in cryo-vacut until use.

Study protocol
After spleen donors were informed, spleens were harvested and stored in cryo-vacut until use. We used an immunofluorescence microscope to visualize the transverse parietal lobes, the parietal lobes, and the cerebellum. We used a laser confocal scanning confocal laser scanning microscope (L1000) to visualize the axial and parietal lobes. We used a non-destructive approach to visualize the region of interest. The whole body was stained with a confocal laser scanning microscope (L1000). We used a white cell imaging kit (LEOmax, Inc., Mountain View, CA) to visualize the gray-stained tissue (Schiff, version 4.8.0; Greiner Bio-One, San Diego, CA).

Study protocol
Blood was collected from blood donors within two days of each other. We used a written informed consent form approved by the institutional review board of the University of South Alabama Health Sciences Center (UNAM). Blood was collected from the right lobe of one donor with severe right lobe injury. We collected the cerebellum from one donor with mild damage to the cerebellum.


## Results

For the proposal of a new definition of immunocompromised patients and the proposal of new guidelines for allocating immunocompromised patients to the ICU, a case of meningitis was proposed by the NARED in the National Academy of Sciences, Clinical Institutional Reviewers (NARI) and the European Committee of Clinical Institutional Research (EUCRD. The NARED have recently proposed a new definition of immunocompromised patients (Mann-Whitney U test) [9]. The NARED suggest that this new definition includes both the definition of immunocompromised patients and the definition of ICU cases, and the NARED recommend a similar definition for ICU patients.

The NARED have proposed a new definition for ICU patients and proposed guidelines for allocating immunocompromised patients and ICU patients, but they do not recommend an ICU-based definition for immunocompromised patients.

3.2. The Use of the Confocal Microscopy System to Screen for Infection and to Appear for Infection with Cryptococcus
Having previously described the use of the confocal microscopy system (CSM) to screen for infection by Cryptococcus [25,26], the authors have proposed that the use of the CSM may be useful in screening for infection by Cryptococcus. This study suggests that the use of the CSM may be useful in screening for Cryptococcus infection by Cryptococcus.

The authors have further proposed that the use of the CSM may be useful in screening for Cryptococcus infection by Cryptococcus.

The authors have also proposed that the use of the CSM may be useful in screening for Cryptococcus infection by Cryptococcus.

In the present study, no study has attempted to screen for Cryptococcus infection by Cryptococcus, and no study has tried to screen for Cryptococcus infection by other fungi, including Acinetobacter, Candida albicans, and Enterococcus faecalis.


## Discussion

Flucytosine-resistant infections are increasingly being reported in HIV-infected patients, and the emergence of . neoformans-like resistance (i.e. C. gattii) is causing concern for the need for additional anti-fungal therapy. The occurrence of C. gattii-resistant C. gattii is relatively common (54%) in immunocompetent patients, as documented by an incidence of 6% in one case report [4]. The most common isolates are C. albicans (35%) and C. neoformans (17%), and the most common Candida species in patients with C. gattii infection are C. albicans (20%) and C. tropicalis (16%). It is unclear whether this is due to differences in the type of immune response to the two species, or whether it is due to differences in the pathogen species and the genotype of the patient.

The proportion of C. neoformans-like isolates is close to the half of the reported cases in the literature [5]. In our case, two cases of C. neoformans-like C. gattii were isolated from the same patient, and the patient was HIV-infected, with the remaining two cases of C. gattii from different hosts. The clinical symptoms of the patient had a low fever, with vomiting, erythema, and seizures. The patient had a severe neurological deficit, with impaired blood-brain barrier function, and the patient had mild generalized weakness. The patient was also treated with antibiotics for meningeal anemia. No further signs of disseminated infection were found. The patient was treated with amphotericin B, fluconazole, and ketoconazole for two weeks.

The patient was started on fluconazole, and the patient responded well to the fluconazole treatment. A history of use of fluconazole for the treatment of AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis was found. The patient was started on fluconazole, and the patient responded well to the fluconazole treatment. No further signs of disseminated infection were found.

The patient was treated with fluconazole, and the patient responded well to the fluconazole treatment. The patient was treated with fluconazole, and the patient responded well to the fluconazole treatment.
