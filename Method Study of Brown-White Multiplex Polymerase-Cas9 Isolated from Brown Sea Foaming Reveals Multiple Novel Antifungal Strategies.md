## Abstract
Mycetoma (mycetoma) is a systemic mycosis in humans and animals, and is often fatal and long associated with animal confinement/trammb of which it is the third most common cause of mycetoma after cancer and transplantation. Mycetoma incurs is an often difficult to manage complication with several outcomes, including death, which is often devastating, and its management is challenging due to the heterogeneity and often multifactorial use of various drugs. This article reviews the most common classes of antifungal agents and therapeutic strategies, including the pharmacological classes used, the mechanisms of action of antifungal resistance, and the progress made in the treatment of mycetoma, highlighting the potential of these drugs in the treatment of this potentially devastating and challenging disease.


## Introduction
Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The most common form of the infection is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but other forms can develop. The most common form is bacteremia, which is also known as acute bronchitis due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PBO). In PBO, a plasmablastic granuloma is formed in the bronchoalveolar lavage, which can develop into a chronic infection, which can develop into a lung abscess or a diffuse nodule. The size of the abscess varies between and within the size of the abscess, and the infection can spread into the bloodstream, enter the central nervous system, or end up in the urinary tract.

Pneumocystis pneumonia is caused by two different species, namely P. jirovecii and P. marinum. P. marinum is a facultative intracellular fungus that can survive and replicate inside macrophages, where it resides as dormant cells for months or years. In contrast, P. jirovecii infection can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, and is usually cleared from the lungs after 14 days of dormancy (Pjík, 2002).


## Methods
neoformans va. grubii from forming in the natural environment. In the present study, we have used the C. neoformans var. grubii strain CEA17 as a model organism for the generation of model organisms for the generation of model organisms. The method was established in two ways. First, we have identified three different models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics. For the second approach, we have identified three models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics, based on the literature. For the third approach, we have identified three models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics, based on the literature. In the present study, we have used the C. neoformans var. grubii strain CEA17 as a model organism for the generation of model organisms for the generation of model organisms for model organisms. For the fourth approach, we have identified three models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics, based on the literature. For the fifth approach, we have identified three models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics, based on the literature. In the present study, we have used the C. neoformans var. grubii strain CEA17 as a model organism for the generation of model organisms for model organisms. For the sixth approach, we have identified three models of C. neoformans var. grubii with distinct morphological characteristics, based on the literature. In the present study, we have used the C. neoformans var. grubii strain CEA17 as a model organism for the generation of model organisms for model organisms for model organisms. In the present study, we have used the C. neoformans var. grubii strain CEA17 as a model organism for the generation of model organisms for model organisms.

2.2. Materials and Methods
The agar medium (8.0 g) was purchased from Organic Fungal Research Center, Inc. (State College, PA, USA). The two Petri dishes (40.0 cm × 40.0 cm) were covered with a moist-inoculation film.


## Results
elegans
Brown-white polymers, commonly used as antifungal agents, are relatively weak antimicrobial agents, but they can be applied in different setting. In this study, we used two brown-white polymers, Phyt6 (Pfam PR00720) and Phyt3 (CUP01338) to characterize and test their antifungal strategies against C. elegans.

Brown-white polymers were first isolated from different substrates for bioreactor hydrolysis of soybean roots using polyester beads as a substrate. After bioreactor hydrolysis, the surface of the brown-white polymers was subjected to gentle adsorption and adsorption to the solvent. The adsorbed polymers were initially analyzed using DAPI (5' end), and after another step, the adsorption pattern was determined by DAPI-MS. The results show that the adsorbed Phyt6 polymers were the most effective antifungal agents against C. elegans (Figure 2).

Brown-white polymers were first isolated from a brown sea-fungus tree, and after a-galactose-induced digestion, the brown-white polymers were subjected to a-galactose-induced digestion and adsorbed for DAPI-MS. The adsorbed Phyt6 polymers were the most effective antifungal agents against C. elegans. In addition, the adsorbed Phyt3 polymers were the most effective antifungal agents against C. elegans (Figure 3).

## Discussion
In this study, we show that S. brasiliensis can colonize the human oral cavity and that it is capable of causing disease in mice. In addition, we have identified a new species of S. brasiliensis, S. kudriavzevii. S. kudriavzevii is an opportunistic fungus that is highly virulent and difficult to eradicate [13, 34]. S. brasiliensis is a member of the class of Cryptococcus neoformans. However, S. brasiliensis is not considered to be a member of this species because it has no known close relatives [35]. S. brasiliensis has been isolated from marine and terrestrial habitats [36, 37].

S. brasiliensis has been associated with oral infections in humans and other mammals [38, 39]. In the present study, we identified S. brasiliensis in mice that was susceptible to S. brasiliensis. This species is a member of the class Cryptococcus neoformans. However, S. brasiliensis was not reported to cause oral infection in humans [40]. S. brasiliensis was reported as a cause of oral candidiasis in humans.

S. brasiliensis was originally isolated from marine sediment in the Pacific Ocean and was found to be pathogenic to mice [41]. However, S. brasiliensis was recently reported to be a novel species causing oral candidiasis in mice [42]. Recently, there have been numerous reports of the isolation and identification of S. brasiliensis from environmental samples in North America and Australia [43, 44]. We therefore considered S. brasiliensis as a potential source of infection in humans.
