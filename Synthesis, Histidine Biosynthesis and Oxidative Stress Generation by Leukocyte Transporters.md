## Abstract
A 31-year-old woman with HIV was admitted to our hospital complaining of diarrhea and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive left facial and left parietal lesions. She was diagnosed as HIV-1 infection and hepatic failure. The diagnosis was made in the hospital based on imaging findings. HIV-1 antigenemia was positive in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was not detected on any other CSF. Antigenemia was also negative in brain and spleen. She was offered antiretroviral therapy (ART). At our hospital, she had a good clinical and radiographic prognosis. We reviewed the literature and found few cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome who have HIV-1 infection. This case report illustrates the importance of early detection of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients and the usefulness of rapid antigen detection. The diagnosis was made in the hospital based on CSF findings and clinico-pathological findings.


## Introduction

Myeloid T cells are cell-wall associated and, therefore, of major immune cells and serve as sites for immune surveillance and control of many diseases including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and myelodysplasia (MDS) (8-10. Bacteria, virus, protozoans and fungi can be present in the myeloid tissue and interact with the T cells, thereby modulating the immune response (11-14). Myeloid T cells play a key role in the adaptive immune response to infections, as evidenced by the ability of some bacteria to cause autoimmune disease, such as EAE, and to invade the draining lymph nodes and lymph nodes surrounding the infected area (15-19). Moreover, myeloid T cells contribute to the replication and dissemination of Bacteria in the lymphatic vessels of the lymph nodes (20), where they can influence the course of infection (21). In the case of EAE, an increase in intracellular bacteria and Myelodysplasia, an increase in bacteria-transferred viruses and MDS in the lymph nodes (21), as well as changes in the secretion of cytokines (22) imply that these two features of myeloid cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of TME.

The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of TME has recently been revealed, as evidence for their potential role in the control of TME in various conditions such as in type 2 diabetes (23, 24), oncology (25), and cancer (26). In this study, we confirmed the role of cytokines (IL-17A, IL-23 and IL-18) in the control of TME in a model of MTI and explored their role in the control of TME. We also investigated the influence of IL-17A on the pathogenesis of TME in a model of MDS. This work builds on previous findings that IL-17A was able to influence the course of myeloid TME in a model of Type 2 Diabetes (26).


## Methods
 mM EDTA and the LK2xP-pNOS-YFP was digested with .5 mM EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. The lysate was subjected to a second round of extraction with the addition of 1.5 M NaCl and the lysate was subjected to another round of extraction with the addition of 1.5 M NaCl and the lysate was subjected to the second round of extraction with 1.5 M NaCl and the lysate was subjected to the third round of extraction with the addition of 1.5 M NaCl and the lysate was subjected to the final round of extraction with the addition of 1.5 M NaCl and the final round of extraction with the addition of 1.5 M NaCl. All samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

For selection of the optimal LK2xP-pNOS-YFP assay, C. albicans LK2xP-pNOS-YFP was incubated with LK2xP-pNOS or LK2xP-pGFP in 10 mM MOPS for 3 h at 37°C. The next day, the medium was removed, and the C. albicans cells were lysed with a bead beater. The lysate was then subjected to further washing with a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the lysate was stained with a 1% Congo Red solution for 1 h. The supernatant was then transferred to a clean glass tube and analyzed with a flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).


## Results
Synthesis of the F. verticillioides polysaccharide
We successfully synthesized the polysaccharide from the polysaccharide matrix of F. verticillioides P38:FJ-L-L-N (FVN) by using a final concentration of 1,250 µg/ml. The final concentration of 1,250 µg/ml of the polysaccharide was enough to fully inhibit the growth of F. verticillioides P38.

To study the role of polysaccharide synthesis in F. verticillioides P38, the growth of F. verticillioides P38 was evaluated in the presence of 1,250 µg/ml of the polysaccharide. The results showed that FVN was able to inhibit the growth of F. verticillioides P38 at concentrations above 250 µg/ml, which is close to the concentration that was required for F. verticillioides P38 inhibition (Figure 1).


## Discussion
cerevisiae
In this study, we have demonstrated that the highly expressed homolog of the . cerevisiae SreA protein has a role in neutrophil-related responses to oxidative stress, including, but not limited to, H_2O_2. H_2O_2 is produced by neutrophils in response to other stressors. In addition, it is synthesized in the liver by alveolar macrophages and administered to macrophages to induce tolerance to H_2O_2 [43]. We have previously shown that in S. cerevisiae, the SreA protein was required for the expression of hyaluronan synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of DOPA [18]. The expression of SreA and DOPA synthase in S. cerevisiae is regulated by a variety of factors, including the nuclear localization of the transcription factor NRPS1, the transcriptional response to DOPA, and the transcriptional response to H_2O_2 [18].

We also showed that SreA was involved in the induction of the expression of the histidine kinase (HK) gene, which is involved in the metabolism of the HK protein. These results suggest that SreA was involved in the regulation of HK gene expression in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the histidine kinase (HK-1) gene is expressed at elevated levels in S. cerevisiae cells exposed to oxidative stress [18]. In this study, we found that SreA was required for the induction of HK gene expression. The induction of HK gene expression in S. cerevisiae was dependent on the location of SreA in the protein encoded by HK-1 gene. This result suggests that SreA is involved in the regulation of HK gene expression. In addition, we demonstrated that SreA was required for the induction of the expression of the gene encoding the histidine kinase (HK-2). This result suggests that SreA is involved in the regulation of HK gene expression in S. cerevisiae.

In summary, we showed that SreA is required for the induction of the HK gene expression in S. cerevisiae. We found that SreA was required for the induction of HK gene expression. The results suggest that SreA is involved in the regulation of HK gene expression in S. cerevisiae.
