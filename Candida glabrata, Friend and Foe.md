## Introduction
cerevisiae, . albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, and are more closely related to the C. albicans pathogenicity. More recently, several C. albicans-like strains, including S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. dubliniensis, have been isolated from human blood (Saito et al., 2006, Haigler et al., 2014, Vuk-Shangase et al., 2014). There is a clear distinction between C. albicans virulence factors, such as the ability to form biofilms, and its ability to invade and persist in the host tissue. Biofilm formation is a critical virulence factor that can cause infections in a variety of tissues, including the eye, respiratory tract, spleen, skin, joints, joints with underlying pathology, and the central nervous system (CNS) (Vuk-Shangase et al., 2014). C. albicans has been reported to exhibit a high degree of plasticity, and this plasticity is often linked to the ability to change shape and size in the form of change in the expression of virulence factors (Aguilar-Urdman and Heitman, 2017).

Two major cell types in C. albicans, the yeast and hypha, are distinct from the major cell types of other fungi, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Sporothrix schenckii, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Yeast cells are widespread in C. albicans infections, and they can be isolated from the skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts of patients with systemic fungal infections. They are also present in the alimentary canal, skin, and nails. Hyphae are common in systemic fungal infections, and they are found in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, oral and vaginal mucosa. The prevalence of hyphae in C. albicans infection has been demonstrated to be greater than that of Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and other fungi (Grijalva et al., 2016; Proctor et al., 2018). Moreover, the degree of Candida biofilm formation is closely related to the degree of biofilm formation, suggesting that C.


## Methods
The best hits were selected based on similarity between the respective strains and were identified based on the type of potential hits and the type of genome containing those hit. The genome of H. pylori was used as a reference. The number of sequences predicted to contain a particular hit was compared to the number of other sequences and was defined as the percent of sequences with a specific similarity. All sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 3.7 [63].

In vitro assays
The assays were conducted in three biological replicates. Bacterial strains were grown in liquid MM for 24 h, and the culture was diluted to an OD_600 = 0.05 in MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The standard suspension of 10^6 CFU/mL of H. pylori was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of S. brasiliensis was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. S. brasiliensis was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The suspension of 10^6 CFU/mL of C. albicans was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of S. cerevisiae was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The suspension of 10^6 CFU/mL of C. glabrata was added to 0.5 mL of MM and grown at 37°C for 24 h. The bacterial growth was standardized to an OD_600 = 0.5 by dilution. The suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of S.

## Discussion
destructans, and Pyricularia (Tataka et a. 2017). Our results provide important information regarding the molecular relationships between these fungi. The phylogenetic relationships between fungi and yeasts, and between yeasts and filamentous fungi, are largely unresolved (Batzer and Roberts 2013). In addition, the available data do not allow a complete assessment of the phylogenetic relationships between fungi and yeasts. Based on the available data, we believe that this study provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between the fungal and bacterial phylotypes, as well as the molecular relationships between fungi and yeasts.

The phylogeny of the fungal phylotypes in the present study is based on sequences from the Saccharomycetales, Agaricomycetales, and Dothideomycetales phylotypes (Table 1). The phylotypes of the phylotypes of the five phylotypes studied in this study belong to the phylotypes of the Agaricomycetales and Dothideomycetales phylotypes, respectively (Table 1). We have identified 16 phylotypes, which are the most common fungal phylotypes in the genus Saccharomyces. The phylotypes of the genera Mucoromycetes and Penicillium were identified as well as other genera of genera belonging to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phylotypes (Table 1). The phylotypes of the genera Aspergillus and Aspergillus were identified as well as the genera of Sphaerobasidion, Pichia, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). In addition, the phylotypes of the genera Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, and Fusarium were identified as well as the genera of Cryptococcus and Fusarium (Table 1).

Most of the fungal phylotypes are saprophytic (i.e., non-Saccharomycetes), with the exception of Aspergillus fumigatus, which is an uncommon member of the genus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus that can grow at high temperatures (e.g., 100-250°C) and which causes disease in plant hosts (e.g., apple).
