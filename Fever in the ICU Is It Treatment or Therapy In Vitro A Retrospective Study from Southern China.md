## Abstract
Fluorescent proteins are highly polymorphic molecules, with up to seven different fluorescent subunits (Fts) encoded in their corresponding protein coding genes. The higher the number of Fts, the more likely it is that each protein plays a unique role in the fungal life cycle. However, the ability of some fungal fts (flashes) to coordinate with the fungal genome remains unclear. In particular, isotopes (normal or Flu) in the same single-membrane region have been shown to have certain advantages, such as increased sequence conservation. Here we provide a comparative analysis of the number of different Fts in the genomes of different fungal taxa and the identification of those regions that are likely to form part of the fungal genome.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have been increasing dramatically in the recent decades. Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus are the most common etiologic agents, followed by C. auris and C. glabrata (Wang et al., 2014).

Besides the opportunistic and frequently fatal fungal pathogens, other potential risk factors for IFIs include diabetes mellitus, severe burns, high-dose corticosteroid therapy, radiation exposure, and invasive medical devices (Wang et al., 2014; Baumgartner and Reis e Samer, 2014). In addition, the use of antifungals and invasive devices has led to an increase in the incidence and severity of IFIs in patients, which are often resistant to therapy (Wang et al., 2014).

Treatment of IFIs is complex and varies from one fungal species to another, and is determined by multiple factors such as geographical location, clinical manifestations, host immune status, and drug resistance (Wang et al., 2014). The present review focuses on the antifungal agents, their modes of action, mechanisms of action, and management of IFIs.


## Methods
2.1. Sample Collection
M. sympodialis cultivar NO. 2908 was cultivated in SDA medium with (NH_4)_2SO_4 at an initial OD_600 of 0.2. The final cultivation was carried out in YPD medium (0.67% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose, pH 6.0) supplemented with 0.2% nitrate as carbon source.

2.2. DNA Extraction and PCR
DNA extraction and PCR was performed as described previously [21] with minor modifications. Briefly, M. sympodialis cells were grown in YPD medium at an initial OD_600 of 0.2. The cells were inoculated in SDA medium for 10 days at 24°C. In order to obtain M. sympodialis cells that were not colony forming units (CFUs), the OD_600 of the culture was adjusted to 0.4 and the OD_600 of the medium was adjusted to 0.


## Results
A total of 25,558 patients with underlying disease were enrolled in the study. After inclusion of the ICU, these patients were transferred from the ICU into the euthanasia group for euthanasia purposes.

Of the 25,558 patients, 2,826 (15.9%) patients died during the study period. The overall mortality rate was 25.9%. The proportion of patients with a death of more than 1% was 10.4% (95%CI: 1.8-15.0%). Of the 25,558 patients with a death of less than 10% (95%CI: 0.5-18.5%), 9,566 (9.4%) patients died in the ICU. The proportion of patients with a death of more than 15% (95%CI: 0.4-15.2%) was 7.8% (95%CI: 3.6-22.3%).

The survival curves of the ICU survivors are presented in Table 1. The patients who died in the ICU before the hospitalization and those who died in the ICU after the hospitalization were the same as those with the death of less than 10% (95%CI: 0.9-12.0%). The proportion of patients with a death of more than 15% (95%CI: 0.9-15.0%) was 7.5% (95%CI: 3.6-22.3%).

The proportion of patients with a death of more than 15% (95%CI: 0.9-12.0%) was 7.7% (95%CI: 3.6-22.3%).


## Discussion
The patient in this case presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis. She had neither brain, lung, nor liver pathology, and was therefore diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, we suspect that she had an opportunistic infection with C. neoformans, which was not well understood. However, the fact that Cryptococcus neoformans was considered a yeast infection (with different phenotypes), and that the patient had been on corticosteroid therapy for an extended period, supports the possibility of Cryptococcus neoformans infection.

The treatment for pulmonary cryptococcosis is mainly based on treatment with intravenous Amphotericin B, followed by oral Fluconazole for 2 weeks. However, it is still not possible to initiate oral fluconazole for pulmonary cryptococcosis. In our case, the patient had a very poor response to Amphotericin B therapy and developed a pulmonary cryptococcosis shortly after initiation of Amphotericin B therapy. The patient’s clinical status changed after Fluconazole therapy, and her symptoms and symptoms improved. Her symptoms improved and she was cured.

The patient had a long period of time from the start of Amphotericin B therapy to the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis, and was cured. As she had no evidence of infection, she also received IV fluids for Cryptococcus neoformans for 6 weeks. It was assumed that she was on Amphotericin B therapy for pulmonary cryptococcosis, and that she had a good response to Amphotericin B therapy.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis is caused by a fungus that is difficult to diagnose with traditional diagnostic methods. However, the molecular diagnosis is based on the presence of fungal cultures in bronchioles, bronchioles, and blood. Although the diagnosis is still incomplete, it is possible to differentiate Cryptococcus neoformans from Cryptococcus gattii, and that the patient had a good response to Amphotericin B treatment.
