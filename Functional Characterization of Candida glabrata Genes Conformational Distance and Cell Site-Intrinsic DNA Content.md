## Abstract
The in vitro effects of FK506 on the viability of C57BL/6 mice chronic lymphocytopenia (CLL) and the in vivo and ex vivo effects of interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) were assessed in response to the anti-fkb1 antibody.


## Introduction
The discovery of new and complex chemical structures and the increasing size of biologically active natural products and microbial products led to a need for a higher understanding of their structure and function. In the last decade, with the application of DNA sequencing techniques, the number of new natural products, mainly in the last 30 years, has increased, and new fungal and bacterial products have been discovered and are now on the market. With the development of molecular biology tools, a considerable number of novel microbial products have been discovered, including many non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans and some species of Candida auris, which are opportunistic spoilers of agricultural commodities and may cause diseases in animals and humans. As a consequence of these infections, the number of plant, animal, human and other microbial products released to the market are increasing [1,2,3].


## Methods
 of the Geneious R package (http://ww.ensemblgenomics.com/) [25] and the program SeqMan v1.7.0 (http://www.ensemblgenomics.com/seqman/) [26]. The numbers of nucleotide differences (N) and the order of nucleotide substitutions (NSS) were determined by the software BioNumerics v. 5.7 (Applied Maths, St-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The protein sequences of Candida glabrata were then aligned with the program Clustal Omega v. 1.2 (Clustal X, Cambridge, United Kingdom) [27] and the program MUSCLE v. 4.8. (Edgar, 2004) [28]. The conserved domain motifs of Candida glabrata were determined using the program NEXUS v. 4.7.2 (http://www.microbesonline.org/index.html/) [29]. The search for the predicted motifs was performed with the program Tophat v. 1.1.4 [30] and the programs Trace v. 1.5.2 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tophat/) [31], and the program Phyloseq v. 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/phyloseq/) [32]. The nucleotide sequences of all the different Candida glabrata genes were then aligned with the program Clustal Omega v. 1.2 (Clustal X, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and the program MUSCLE v. 4.8. (Edgar, 2004) [29].

Protein Structure and Analysis
The sequences of the putative protein structure of Candida glabrata were predicted using the program Modeltest v. 3.7 (http://www.expasy.org/) [33]. The structure of the p-amplicons of Candida glabrata were analyzed using the program PyMOL v. 1.3.1 (http://pymol.org/index.html) [34]. The structure of the p-amplicons of S.


## Results
glabrata cell lines and tested whether these conserved genes might be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progressio. We used RNA-Seq to analyze gene expression in the cell cycle, including both morphogenesis and mitosis. We found that genes belonging to the BCSP pathway (CDS1, BCSP1, BCSP2, BCSP3, and CDS1) and the FTR1-dependent pathway (FTR1, CDS2, FTR1, and FTR1-dependent pathway) are up-regulated in the <U+0394>cbi1 mutant, whereas genes belonging to the CDS1 pathway (CDS2, FTR1, and FTR1-dependent pathway) are down-regulated in the <U+0394>cbi1 mutant (Fig 4C). The CDS2 gene is also up-regulated in the <U+0394>cbi1 mutant. Both BCSP1 and CDS1 genes are required for the growth and cell cycle progression of C. glabrata and F. oxysporum [3,18-21]. These results suggest that the CDS2 gene may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression in C. glabrata.

CDS2 Gene Expression Does Not Influence Cell Cycle Regulates in Vivo
To further explore the relationship between CDS2 and the CDS1 pathway, we evaluated the impact of the deletion of the CDS2 gene on cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulation. The cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulation of C. glabrata was determined by measuring cell cycle parameters, including the number of cycles per kilobase of (k_cat) cycle (k_m), the number of mitotic divisions per million (Mi), and the number of cell division units (CFU/ml). The <U+0394>cbi1 and <U+0394>cbi2 mutants showed a marked reduction in the number of mitotic divisions (Fig 5A), and the <U+0394>cbi1 and <U+0394>cbi2 mutants showed a marked reduction in the number of mitotic divisions (Fig 5B).


## Discussion
glabrata has a very high gene expression profile, which is consistent with the degree of gene expression induced by common microorganism. A total of 1,078 genes were significantly expressed in the C. glabrata cells grown under laboratory conditions. The number of genes upregulated in C. glabrata cells grown in the presence of PBA (Table 3) was reduced to 1,452 in the PBA-treated cells, with a corresponding number of genes significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells, decreasing to 1,003 in the PBA-treated cells, and to 1,048 in the PBA-treated cells. This decrease in gene expression may be due to PBA treatment, as PBA causes a severe immune response in C. glabrata cells [6].

The gene expression profile of C. glabrata cells grown in the presence of PBA (Table 3) was different in the presence of PBA, and was comparable in the cells grown in the presence of PBA. The number of genes significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells was reduced to 1,476, whereas the number of genes significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells was unchanged, except for five genes (Table 3). The reduction in gene expression in the PBA-treated cells may be due to PBA treatment, as PBA causes a severe immune response in C. glabrata cells [6].

In summary, PBA treatment was effective in the induction of C. glabrata gene expression in the C. glabrata cells grown in the presence of PBA. However, the number of genes significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells was unchanged, except for one gene (Table 3), which was statistically significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells. The number of genes significantly upregulated in the PBA-treated cells was also significantly decreased. This result suggested that PBA treatment induced a significant decrease in C. glabrata gene expression.

Previous studies suggested that C. glabrata cells are highly susceptible to PBA treatment [11,14,15]. Previous studies showed that the induction of genes involved in immune response against C. glabrata infection are not decreased in C. glabrata cells grown in the presence of PBA [11,14,15].
