## Abstract
Hirsutella (Ophiocordycipitaceae: Hypocreales) is a genus of insect, mite, and nematode pathogens with a high diversity of hostiles. The main objective of the present study was to provide an in-depth analysis of the phylogeny and distribution of Hirsutella species in its common host insect fly, Pestalotiopsis, focusing on the nucleotide sequences from a total of 127 Hirsutella spp. The sequences were generated using the recently published non-redundant region-specific primers M13-28 (iRePL-M13-28) and found to be of a single aligned alignment per nucleotide sequence. The average size of the phylogeny was estimated to be in the range of four species of the Pestalotiopsis clade. The comparison of the distributions of Hirsutella spp. in two hosts and two families of insect species suggests the presence of two Hirsutella species, namely Coccomyces, the type species of Pestalotiopsis, and Cunninghamella, the type species of Pestalotiopsis. The two insect-specific primers found in this study were designed by homology modeling and compared to Hirsutella spp.


## Introduction

The ultimate factor determining the immune status of the host is the host’s gene. The normal mammalian genome contains ~50% of genes for the innate immune response and ~15-20% of genes for the adaptive immunity. The host’s genes can be expected to play many roles in determining the pathogen’s ability to invade the host. The immune system can be programmed to recognize the pathogen and promote its destruction. The host can also recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce autoimmunity/inflammation (TIP) through the activation of its own immune system. Moreover, T cells can be programmed to recognize infectious agents as pathogens and trigger a myriad of immunological responses to eliminate them. The immune system can also be programmed to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and treat them or prevent them from infection. A variety of immune cells can be programmed to recognize pathogens and trigger the immune response. The host’s immune system can be programmed to recognize PAMPs, antigen-presenting cells, and/or bacteria and upon their recognition, it can be activated/activated to produce various types of cytokines/chemokines that induce or activate a myriad of effector immune cells. The host’s immune system can be programmed to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce/activate immune responses via the activation of its own immune system. In addition, the host can be programmed to recognize pathogens, create, and kill the pathogens/pathogens upon the activation/activation of its own immune system. The host can also be programmed to suppress, or kill the pathogen, thereby preventing further infection of the host (7).

Host-induced immunity is believed to be the first factor determining the outcome of the host’s infection. The host’s immune system has evolved to recognize pathogens as they emerge from the host’s phagocytes and when the pathogen enters the phagolysosome. The phagolysosomal compartment contains a number of proteins that are able to detect pathogens and kill them (8-10). Several phagocytic proteins (Phe and Trypomol) can recognize pathogens including B. subtilis and also host-parasite interactions proteins (HIPs) and they have been identified in the phagolysosome as potential antigens (11).


## Methods
 ml of RPMI-1640 without cell-free medium, RPMI+.5 g/L, or RPMI+0.5 g/L) (control) and (2) purified culture medium (0.3 ml of RPMI-1640 without cell-free medium, RPMI+1.5 g/L, or RPMI+0.5 g/L) (control). The concentration of cell-free culture medium was set at 1.5% cell-free cell-free cell-free culture medium (concentration of cell-free culture medium = 1.0%). These were all prepared with the same cell-free cell-free culture medium as the control (RPMI+1.5 g/L) as well as RPMI+0.5 g/L (control). After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the number of dead cells was measured by microscopic counts. The percentage of dead cells was calculated by comparing the number of cells in the cell-free culture medium and the control.


## Results
2A and 2B. In the well-established human pathogenicity studies, the host specificity of the infection-associated disease model and the good, the bad, and the ugly are both important to understand the mechanisms of infection and disease progression in animal models. In the human pathogenicity studies, the human pathogenicity model relies on the host specificity of innate immune mechanisms to produce the microbial response, including the strong, the weak, and the ugly (Figs. 2C, 2D). In the human pathogenicity studies, the host specificity of innate immune mechanisms is primarily to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system, including the strong, the weak, and the ugly (Figs. 2E, 2F).

The human pathogenicity studies were also analyzed using the bacterial and fungal pathogenicity-associated immune mechanisms (Fig 3A). In both animal models, the host specificity of innate immune mechanisms for producing the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system was highest for the weak virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system. In the animal pathogenicity studies, the strong virulence-associated immune system was predominantly the host specificity of bacterial and fungal pathogenicity mechanisms to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system. In both animal models, the weak virulence-associated immune system was predominantly the host specificity of the bacterial and fungal pathogenicity mechanisms to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system. The host specificity of the human pathogenicity-associated immune system was predominantly the host specificity of the bacterial and fungal pathogenicity mechanisms to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system. In the animal pathogenicity studies, the host specificity of the bacterial and fungal pathogenicity-associated immune mechanisms to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system was predominant to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system. In the human pathogenicity studies, the strong virulence-associated immune system was predominantly the host specificity of the bacterial and fungal pathogenicity-associated immune system to produce the virulence-associated pathogenicity-associated immune system.


## Discussion

The <U+0394>Mutant-Like Pathogen Isolated At The Three-Dimensional Level
The <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen is isolated at the three-dimensional level of the cell, and its interaction with the host is a critical part of a fungal pathogen’s life cycl. In contrast to yeast and mammals, the <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen is found in cells of diverse phylogenetic species, including insects and mammals. To date, there have been no experiments to investigate the interaction of the <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen with the host. However, these experiments have shown that the <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen is able to interact with the host cells through direct penetration, and it also produces an innate immune response upon contact. This suggests that the <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen is able to regulate the expression of key virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. It also suggests that the <U+0394>mutant-like pathogen is able to form a heterotrimeric complex with other fungal pathogens.
