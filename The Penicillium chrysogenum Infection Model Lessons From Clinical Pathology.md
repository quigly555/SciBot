## Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in a variety of immune-mediated diseases and interventions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate immune responses are largely unknown. We have identified a Dicer-like miRNA (miR-D68u) and their homolog in the fungus Fusarium graminearum that is essential for pathogenesis and is also found in the human immune system. Disruption of miR-D68u caused by overexpression of the RNAi target gene, corridosterol, in F. graminearum, resulted in the development of a virulent and rapidly growing population. Our study reveals that infection of infected mice with corridosterol-producing F. graminearum results in rapid and rapid genome expansion accompanied by a depletion of miR-D68u, an important regulatory subunit of miR-D68a. Interestingly, corridosterol-producing F. graminearum also inhibits the proliferation of several pathogenic fungi in comparison with wild-type strain. Thus, our results demonstrate corridosterol-mediated pathogenesis as a novel miRNA as an important regulatory modulator of immune responses to F. graminearum in F. graminearum.

Fungi can cause disease in humans and animals, but the mechanisms by which fungi cause disease are poorly understood. Fungal diseases are collectively known as the most prevalent human diseases. Fungal disease is the leading cause of mortality globally and is responsible for more than half a million annual deaths worldwide. The most common fungal infections are caused by the members of the etiologic class of mycobacteria, which also include Candida spp., Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans and the nonautotrophs class of fungi. These fungi are characterized by lack of growth and drug resistance that can contribute to disease severity. The most common fungal pathogens that cause disease in humans are Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. The prevalence of other eukaryotic pathogens like Candida spp. and Sordariomyces spp. has also been described as a possible risk factor for human pathologies caused by these fungi.

The aim of this article is to present a comparative analysis of the epidemiology of yeast and mold infections in China. The total number of yeast and mold infections cases in China in 2009 was 376. The total number of mold infections cases in 2010 was 263. The total number of yeast and mold infections cases in China in 2009 was 70. In China, the incidence of yeast and mold infections has increased significantly in recent years. The incidence of yeast and mold infections in China has increased by 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, from 140 in 2009 to 182 in 2010.


## Methods
The first stage used the bacteria and fungi to evaluate the virulence of the cells, while the second stage used the fungi and bacteria to evaluate the virulence of the cell. The model was developed using the EVOS Suite v.1.4.1 software (Applied Maths, Saint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) and was validated by a sensitivity analysis and an empirical test of the false discovery rate (FDR). The results of the EVOS Suite are shown in Table 1.

The model was validated in a controlled environment, in which the inoculum from the first stage was diluted and then cultivated in a sterile Petri dish for 48 h at 37 째C. The plates were then inoculated with two drops of sterile suspension of the bacteria and fungi, and incubated at 37 째C for 24 h, with fungal growth at 37 째C for 18 h. After 24 h of incubation, the plates were washed three times with PBS to remove any residual fungal growth. The plates were placed in a controlled environment, in which the same inoculum was used to inoculate the cells of the second stage. The inoculum from the first stage was diluted and then cultured in the Petri dish for 48 h at 37 째C. The plates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the remaining fungal cells and the supernatant was discarded. The residual fungal cells were recovered by washing the plates with PBS three times, and the supernatants were collected. The residual fungal cells were then diluted to the appropriate concentration, and the colony forming units (CFU) were determined by plating the cells on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (2% dextrose, 0.3% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1.0% bile salt, pH 6.0) and incubating for 24 h. The fungal cells were then collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The CFU were then determined by plating the cells on Sabouraud dextrose agar.


## Results
tropicali. The infection model was then performed using the standard medium, liquid media containing 10% SDS and a high concentration of CFW. The model was then adapted from a patient who had been inoculated with C. tropicalis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. albicans using a first-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. glabrata using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C. parapsilosis using a second-line inocula from a patient who had been inoculated with C.


## Discussion
The disease activity of Penicillium chrysogenum was further evaluated in vivo by the detection of Penicillium antigens in urine samples and by inducing the fungus to grow at elevated levels of the fungal growth factor receptor 4 (FGF-4. The infection of mice and rats with Penicillium chrysogenum was previously described [17], and the effects of the fungus on human macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells were demonstrated [18]. Furthermore, several studies showed that fungal infections caused by Penicillium spp. were associated with decreased immune responses and increased susceptibility to infection with other fungi, such as Alternaria alternata [19], Histoplasma capsulatum [20], and Cryptococcus neoformans [21]. This is the first study in which the fungus has been associated with an altered immune response and an increased susceptibility to infection with different fungi.

The role of host defense against fungal infection has been widely studied. For instance, the host immune response is induced by Candida albicans, which causes invasive candidiasis [22], and Candida albicans is also an important opportunistic pathogen. Furthermore, the fungus was previously shown to be able to infect macrophages and neutrophils [22], and the yeast can also cause tissue damage in animals [23]. The latter is the main reason for the increased susceptibility of mice to Penicillium chrysogenum infections [24].

The susceptibility of mice to Penicillium infection is also well-known, and the infection of mice is associated with severe disease. This has been demonstrated in several studies, including the treatment with the fungus in mice [25, 26] and in humans [27]. This has also been demonstrated in the treatment of Candida parapsilosis [28] and in the treatment of Histoplasma capsulatum [29], and the fungus can also cause tissue damage in mice [30]. The fungus is known to be able to cause systemic infection with Histoplasma capsulatum and other fungal species [31], and the study also showed that the fungus can cause systemic infection in mice and that this infection can be controlled with the use of antifungal drugs [32].
