## Abstract
The novel generation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) is a promising biotechnological tool for the rapid and precise identification of phenotypic and novel secondary metabolite profiles in yeasts. ATMT has attracted much attention in the field of medicinal chemistry because of its easy-to-use and low cost of production compared with conventional methods.


## Introduction
 2005; Dijkshoven et a., 2006; Sampaio and Parmley, 2007).

However, our understanding of fungal communities associated with subterranean microvessels has been limited. Studies have reported that only a few fungal species have been isolated from subterranean substrates in the environment (Jung et al., 2010; Poncelet et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010; Delattin et al., 2013; Kelleher et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2013; Delattin and Moazed, 2014; Singh et al., 2014). Moreover, there are no reports on the isolation of microfungi from subterranean habitats (Jung et al., 2010; Poncelet et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010; Delattin et al., 2013; Kelleher et al., 2013). The majority of these studies reported only saprobic toads and phytoplankton, with a few other fungi associated with pebbles (Kelleher et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014). Thus, it is not clear what other ecological niches these fungi inhabit, if at all. The fungal community associated with pebbles in the environment may be very different from those associated with other substrates and from those that grow as plankton in the soil.

The first report on fungal communities associated with pebbles in the environment was published by Liao et al. (2000), who isolated eight closely related species of fungi from pebbles in the environment (Kelleher et al., 2013). Subsequent studies of fungi associated with pebbles described a higher diversity of fungi (Kelleher et al., 2013). In the past few years, a few studies have reported on the occurrence of fungi in the pebbles of a variety of habitats, including swimming pools, abandoned factories, and river orchards (Kelleher et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014; Delattin et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2014; Delattin and Moazed, 2014; Singh et al., 2014; Delattin and Moazed, 2014; Singh et al., 2014).


## Methods
latifoli. We describe the SRZs in detail in Supplementary Figure 1. For the analysis of silting of silica-stoppered soils, we employed two soil-free soils (SPH and SZ) obtained from a survey in the SB5 area. The SRZs were characterized in detail in our previous study [6]. The SRZs in this study are composed of six cores from the SRZ areas and the sub-core cores were randomly selected (Supplementary Figure 1).

To evaluate the soil structure of the SRZs and their relationships with S. latifolia, we used two plant-derived sites (S-South and S-South) in S. latifolia. The SRZs in this study are composed of five core cores from the S-South area. In the S-South area, S. latifolia plants are commonly encountered, and they are usually found in semi-dry conditions. S. latifolia plants are not susceptible to drought and therefore they are considered to be more difficult to plant than S. latifolia plants. This soil-free soil interaction might be due to the natural condition of S. latifolia soils in the SRZ areas [7].

To evaluate the relationship between S. latifolia and S. lindifolia, we used two soil-free soils (SPH and SZ) obtained from a survey in the SB5 area. The SRZs in this study are composed of five core cores from the S-South area. The SRZs in this study are composed of three core cores from the S-South area. The SRZs in this study are composed of six cores from the S-South area.

To evaluate the relationship between S. lindifolia and S. lindifolia exclusion zone structures (EZ) in the SRZs, we used two soil-free soils (SPH and SZ) obtained from a survey in the SB5 area. The SRZs in this study are composed of five cores from the S-South area. The SRZs in this study are composed of six core cores from the S-South area.

To evaluate the relationship between S. lindifolia and S.


## Results
As shown in Figure 2, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were abundant in the redox bioreactor, but only Ascomycota were detected in the redox bioreactor, indicating that the soil microhabitat had more fungal communities associated with brown and greyish tree. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 2, Basidiomycota were more abundant in the redox bioreactor than in the redox bioreactor, suggesting that the microbial communities of the redox bioreactor were more diverse.

Antifungal Susceptibility Test of Spore Germinated Plants and Erythrocytes
To test the hypothesis that the different soil microhabitats were associated with the soil microbial community, we tested antifungal susceptibility tests of the two brown-leaved trees (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3, the total fungal community of the brown-leaved trees was significantly less susceptible to itraconazole than the brown-leaved trees, and the total fungal community of the grey-leaved trees was significantly less susceptible to itraconazole than the grey-leaved trees.

Influence of Brown-leaved Trees on the Geochemical Parameters of the Response to Antifungal
To assess the influence of different trees on the response to antifungal treatment, the growth characteristics of the brown-leaved trees were compared with those of the brown-leaved trees. As shown in Figure 4, brown trees showed more pronounced growth characteristics, whereas grey trees showed less pronounced growth characteristics. The brown-leaved trees were more tolerant to itraconazole than the grey-leaved trees, suggesting that the differences in fungal communities in the different trees were not caused by differences in the fungal community in the brown-leaved and grey-leaved trees.


## Discussion
This approach was used to investigate the development of microbial communities in the Netherlands by using a combined NGS-TESSS method and NGS-RFLP (NRG-FISH) [22], [31. The analysis of microbial communities in the Netherlands was performed using three different methods: the use of two different time points (7-31 days), a complete analysis using the whole dataset (with an average of six samples per site), and the use of the combination of NGS-NRG-FISH and NGS-RFLP (NRG-FISH + NRG-RFLP). The results for the four different time points (7-31 days) and for the two different time points (7-31 days) used in the study of microbial communities are presented in Table S1. The first time point (7-31 days), the microbial communities of which were dominated by Rhodotorula, Staphylococcus, Candida, and Pseudomonas, were dominated by Rhodotorula spp., Rhodotorula reilianum, Rhodotorula gamma, and Rhodotorula guilliermondii (Table S1). The second time point (7-31 days), the microbial communities of which were dominated by Rhodotorula, Pseudomonas, and Candida were dominated by Rhodotorula spp., Rhodotorula capricola, Rhodotorula luteus, and Rhodotorula mesenterica (Table S1). The third time point (7-31 days), the microbial communities of which were dominated by Rhodotorula, Pseudomonas, and Candida were dominated by Rhodotorula maritima, Rhodotorula luteus, and Rhodotorula sp. (Table S1). The fourth time point (7-31 days), the microbial communities of which were dominated by Rhodotorula, Pseudomonas, and Candida were dominated by Rhodotorula moniliformis, Rhodotorula oxysporum, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (Table S1).

The microbial communities associated with brown-leaved depots in the Netherlands are shown in Fig 2 and Fig S1.
