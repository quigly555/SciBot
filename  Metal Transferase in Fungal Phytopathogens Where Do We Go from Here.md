## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, responsible for the majority of cases of invasive aspergillosis in humans. However, the complex interactions between fungal growth and the host immune response define its pathogenesis. Current therapeutic approaches, such as the use of immunosuppressants to treat invasive fungal infections, have been hampered by the high variability in fungal species that are polyphyletic. Combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, we developed a ‘omics-as-a-patient’ that enabled high-throughput data to be shared between research communities. This NGS platform enables for expression search of protein-coding genes between clinical trial settings and active areas, a powerful tool to facilitate the analysis of gene expression profiles in clinical trial data.

Highly active fungal isolates were identified as a result of the analysis of their gene expression in response to different antifungal treatments. This included in vitro and in vivo responses to anti-fungal drugs and fluconazole. The expression of gene products was expressed by all isolates tested, with exception for trehalose and glycogen. Comparison between active areas showed that the prevalence of polyphyletic fungi was high and that the different groups of fungi had similar phenotypes. In particular, the presence of fungal hyphal growth and the presence of pseudohyphal growth were more prevalent in active areas than in absence of fungal growth.

Highly active fungal isolates showed a different pattern of expression from the nonactive areas, which was confirmed by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The data obtained here contribute to a better understanding of the fungal diversity in active areas and offer new targets for developing improved therapeutic strategies to control invasive fungal infections.


## Introduction
The genus Cytisotrichum was proposed by Domsch et al. (Domsch et al. 1971) based on Cytisotrichum yeasts, which was then transferred to the genus Cryptococcus based on the strain CBS7. The yeast species Cryptococcus neoformans (CBS7.9) and Cryptococcus gattii (CBS6.1) were also transferred to the genus Cryptococcus based on the latter two strains.


## Methods
brasiliensis were stained with 1% agarose for 1 h, after which the stained mycelia were transferred onto a slide and covered with a cotton fabri. The slides were viewed under a light microscope.

DNA Extraction and PCR
DNA extraction was performed according to the method of [35] with the assistance of the aid of an electrician (Lücking) who was then assisted by the help of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) precipitation method [36]. The fungal mycelia were ground in liquid N_2 and the DNA was extracted using the CTAB method [37]. The extraction was carried out in liquid N_2, followed by an additional cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) precipitation step. The extracted DNA was then treated with a QIAxli (Qiagen, Germany) column and then stored at -20 °C.

Sequence Analysis
The genomic DNA of S. brasiliensis was amplified with the ABI BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the primers 341F and 806R. The PCR was performed using a PTC-100 Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). The following conditions were used: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C.

The amplification of the ITS region was performed with the ABI BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR primers ITS1 and ITS4 [38] were used to amplify the ITS regions of S. brasiliensis. The PCR amplification of the cDNAs was performed in a total volume of 25 µL, with a total of 10 µL of each PCR reaction. The primers and PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C.


## Results
The hexa-like clade is composed of an Fungal Phytopathogen, the one with the highest number of introns, and a Blastocystis-like Clade, the one with the lowest number of intron sequence. As shown in Fig 1, a putative hexa-like group has the highest number of introns, followed by the Blastocystis-like clade.

Thus, we found that the ML (blasto) and the hexa-like clade have more introns per megablast (Mb) than the mononucleated fungal lineages. In fact, the number of introns in the ML and the hexa-like clade are actually much lower than the number of introns in the fungal genus Dictyostelium. This suggests that the fungal lineages have a greater amount of intron sequences per Mb compared with the Dictyostelium lineage. The fact that the number of introns in the ML and the hexa-like clade is lower than in the fungal genus Dictyostelium suggests that the fungal lineages are less prone to intron loss. The number of introns in the ML and the hexa-like clade are also lower than in the Dictyostelium lineage, which suggests that the fungal lineages may have more introns per Mb than the Dictyostelium lineage.

The ML and the hexa-like clade have the highest number of introns per Mb (Mb) and the same number of introns per Mb as the fungal lineage, suggesting that the fungal lineage is more prone to intron loss than the Dictyostelium lineage.

The number of introns per Mb is, however, not a good indicator of intron loss. The number of introns per Mb is, however, an indication of the extent to which the fungal lineage is less prone to intron loss.


## Discussion
2015

Phylogenetic analysis of the fungal phylome of the six species, and an analysis of the fungal phylome of the fungus, has revealed that the main phylome of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota are in a different position than the most parsimonious phylome of the three major fungal phylomes (Figures 3 and 4. The phylome of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota was enriched with additional sequences of some species. The fungal phylome of the plant-fungus symbiosis has been significantly enriched with additional sequences of some species. For instance, the phylome of the soil-dwelling fungus, Eurotium perfringens, was enriched with some sequences of the two species. Similarly, the phylome of the plant-fungus symbiosis has been enriched with some sequences of some species.
