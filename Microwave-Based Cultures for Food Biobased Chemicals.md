## Abstract
We evaluated the efficacy of intranasal intranasal or intran-oral administration of LL-37 in a lung transplant recipient. We also examined the extent of suppurative and immunological complications post-tenofovulation.

All recipients received a biopsy done following the biopsy, and post-tenofovulation diagnosis was done by a pathology biopsy team.

We included 123 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who were not receiving immunosuppressive therapy, 59 of whom received a diagnosis post-tenofovulation of pulmonary tuberculosis. Median age was 49 years, and 53 were on immunosuppressive treatment at the time of transplantation. Forty-nine percent of recipients had neutropenia, 12% had severe immunodysregulation at the time of biopsy, and 33% were on immunosuppressive therapy at the time of transplantation. Seventy percent of recipients had non-necrotizing malignancy at the time of biopsy. There was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of recipients with tissue granuloma at the time of biopsy (P=0.0001).


## Introduction
Toxoplasmosis is a highly invasive fungal infection caused by opportunistic fungi. The most common species involved are Toxoplasma gondii and C. neoformans. There are approximately 200 species of toxoplasmosis which can cause infection in humans. Most of them can be distinguished from toxoplasmosis by their morphology. Toxoplasmosis is divided into two types according to their virulence: subcutaneous forms and intracellular forms. Subcutaneous toxoplasmosis is distinguished from intracellular toxoplasmosis by the presence of conidia, an ability to adhere to the tissue and invade host tissues.

The most important factor in toxoplasmosis is the host immune status. Toxoplasma gondii is obligate and can infect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. The most common form is toxoplasmosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. However, other fungi are less common in immunocompetent hosts. Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, which is also called anaerobic, is a pathogenic fungus. As an aerobic pathogen, it can also infect animals and humans. In the case of cryptococcosis, it can also infect humans. In most cases, cryptococcal infection is not seen in patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as AIDS, neutropenia or diabetes.

Infection with cryptococcal infection is mainly caused by inhalation of fungal spores.


## Methods
albicans, . glabrata, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis were grown in sterile 0.85% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 1% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) agar for 24 h at 35 °C. The culture supernatant was collected, and the pellets were dissolved in 3 ml of sterile distilled water. To prepare the inoculum, 10 ml of each culture was inoculated onto yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar, and incubated at 30 °C. The numbers of colony forming units (CFU) were counted after 48 h, and the inoculum was diluted 1:10 with the same medium to obtain a final inoculum of 1.0 × 10^5 colony forming units. The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C. The total numbers of CFUs were calculated after 48 h, and the number of CFUs per 100 µl of liquid media was calculated after incubation at 30 °C. The assays were conducted in triplicate.

2.6. Antifungal Activity of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis
The antifungal activity of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was determined using a microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 method [13]. All isolates were tested for their MIC values and MIC_50 values. For the MIC_50 of C. albicans, the MIC_50 value of C. parapsilosis, and MIC_50 value of C.


## Results
tumefaciens, seven days were chosen for culture to evaluate the effectiveness of different culture time on . tumefaciens. However, all the A. tumefaciens cultures had a better growth compared to the control culture. The maximum growth was found to be achieved on the day of inoculation of A. tumefaciens with 1 ml of 2% L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The lowest growth was found on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient. The maximum growth was observed on the day of inoculation with 5 ml of L-phenyl acetate as the standard nutrient.
