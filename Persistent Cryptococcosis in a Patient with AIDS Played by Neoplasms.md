## Abstract
The resistance of microbial strains to drugs in humans is a significant obstacle to the development of new therapies for infectious diseases. Drugs that are currently used for other conditions or treated with antibiotics have recently gained renewed interest as a source of novel therapeutic alternatives. While antimicrobial drugs have become increasingly popular, the molecules and pathways of action of these drugs are unknown, potentially hampering their efficacy. In this study, we identify and quantify novel molecules that are essential for the growth of a new, broad spectrum antimicrobial drug resistant strain of Cryptococcus neoformans. These drugs were first designed from the drug-loaded nanoparticles polylactic o-ethylene glycol (PEGC) and polylactic acid, respectively. Development of a specific PEGC strain in yeast resulted in an increase in drug resistance, whereas a non-wild-type phenotype had been observed in other non-wild-type Cryptococcus species. Furthermore, several new peptidoglycan compounds were isolated from these drug-loaded nanoparticles. These new drugs are of great interest to drug discovery researchers because they are intrinsically well-tolerated, are highly specific, and can be produced in a relatively short time using only minimal amounts of crudely solvents, such as indisoquinuclal or benzoxazinumdehyde. The discovery of drug-loaded nanoparticles as drug targets in Cryptococcus raises the possibility of developing novel antimicrobial drugs for infectious diseases.


## Introduction

Neurosurgery in the emergency department after a patient with life-threatening meningoencephalitis had a small but significant headach. An MRI revealed an extensive and diffuse neural process involving multiple subcortical structures. The patient was initially responsive to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment with caspofungin, and during the remainder of the procedure was well and completely neurologically intact. A repeat of the MRI, showing a massive bilateral intracranial mass, was not seen. However, one of the subcortical structures, containing the brainstem nodes, was confirmed to be a brain tumor-associated site. The patient was treated with flucytosine, and the patient was treated for life with intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient was discharged from the hospital on a modestly reduced and well-adjusted life-span with high-quality medical care.

Neurosurgery returned the patient with a high-grade fever, and on follow-up MRI revealed a massive right cerebellar mass, resembling a diffuse brain mass, in the right cerebellar cavity. This mass was diffuse in nature and did not contain many neurons. MRI revealed a well-defined lesion in the subcortical region. No other abnormalities were apparent. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, fluconazole, and hydromorphone. The patient was discharged on a modestly reduced life-span with high-quality medical care.

Neurosurgery continued the treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, and the patient was discharged on hydromorphone. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, hydromorphone, and cefixime, all of which resulted in a high grade headache and a significant headache attack. The patient was discharged on a low-grade fluconazole headache with moderate headache. However, this course did not last long with the patient having no apparent headaches, and the patient was finally diagnosed on cefixime, an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-based, fluconazole-based, non-albaconazole antifungal agent.

After several months of follow-up, the patient was discharged on cefixime, but with varying outcomes.


## Methods
The patients were classified as those who had an AIDS-associated cryptococcal infection, a non-specific positive CSF culture, and a positive CSF culture from a non-infectious disease, as well as those with proven or probable cystic fibrosis (CF. The patients were excluded from the study if they were already at risk of cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were excluded from the study if they were also having a malignant disease or other malignancy. The patients were classified as ‘contingent’ if they had an AIDS-related cryptococcal infection, and ‘uncontingent’ if they were non-contingent to the diagnosis of a cryptococcal infection. The patients were categorized as ‘noncontingent’ if they were unable to provide consent, or ‘contingent’ if they were unable to provide consent due to non-consent.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0. The CSF samples were compared by Student’s t-test. The data analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Pernambuco (Pernambuco, Brazil) and conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of the mean ± SD. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison test was used to compare the mean values of the samples. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison test was used to compare the means values of the samples. The data were analyzed by Student’s t-test.

Ethical Statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Pernambuco (Pernambuco, Brazil) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki.


## Results
The HIV-infected patients were significantly (P<.001) more likely to have a history of HIV infection, as measured by CSF glucose, protein, and CSF proteins (Table 2). There was no difference in the CSF protein or CSF glucose between the HIV-infected patients and the HIV-uninfected patients (Table 2). The CSF glucose of HIV-infected patients was significantly (P<0.001) higher than that of HIV-uninfected patients. As shown in Table 2, HIV-infected patients had significantly higher CSF protein than the HIV-uninfected patients, as measured by CSF glucose and protein, and CSF glucose were significantly higher than those of HIV-infected patients. There was no difference in CSF protein or CSF glucose between HIV-infected patients and the HIV-uninfected patients, and the CSF glucose of HIV-infected patients was significantly higher than those of HIV-uninfected patients. No significant differences in CSF glucose were found between HIV-infected patients and HIV-uninfected patients. The CSF glucose of HIV-infected patients was significantly (P<0.001) higher than those of HIV-infected patients. No difference in the CSF glucose of HIV-infected patients and HIV-uninfected patients was found.

A previous study on HIV-infected patients (10) showed that HIV infection caused an increase in the plasma viral load and CSF white cell count of HIV-infected patients (2.6 g/L) compared with those of HIV-uninfected patients (2.7 g/L) [15]. The results of this study showed that HIV infection caused a significant increase in the plasma viral load and CSF white cell count of HIV-infected patients compared with those of HIV-uninfected patients, as shown in Table 3. The plasma viral load of HIV-infected patients was significantly lower than that of HIV-uninfected patients. The CSF white cell count of HIV-infected patients was significantly lower than that of HIV-uninfected patients. The plasma viral load of HIV-infected patients was significantly lower than that of HIV-uninfected patients.


## Discussion
In the presentation of HIV disease, as in the case of AIDS, there is a spectrum of disease, which includes mycobacterial and fungal infections, as well as mycobacterial infections and parasitic infection. Although HIV-infected patients have a higher frequency of involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) than patients with AIDS, the CNS infection is also associated with opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jiroveci, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces marneffei, Candida albicans, and Histoplasma capsulatum [22]. However, in a study of patients with AIDS and Pneumocystis jiroveci, only 50% of patients with CNS infections had significant increases in symptoms and signs [22]. A similar finding was found in a study of HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis marneffei [23]. However, in a study of AIDS patients with mycobacterial infections, the prevalence of CNS involvement was greater in patients with Pneumocystis marneffei and HIV infection [23].

Cryptococcosis is generally characterized by persistent skin lesions with a cyst appearance. In AIDS patients, the most common lesions are abscesses, granulomas, and pustules, which are caused by bacteria and fungi [24]. Cryptococcosis can also be seen in the setting of trauma or trauma-related injuries, such as aneurysmal lesions or a traumatic lesion [25].

Although Cryptococcosis can cause meningoencephalitis, it is less common in the setting of a prediagnosed malignancy, such as the one in this case. In a study of AIDS patients with HIV infection, in cases of meningoencephalitis, 50% of patients had pulmonary involvement, and in another case, the lesion was mild or noninflammatory. In this case, the patient had significant increases in lung lesions. In addition, it is possible to have a pulmonary infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, which is associated with high mortality in patients with AIDS [26].

In this case, the patient had a history of mycobacterial infections, and the patient had been exposed to fungi. Cryptococcus neoformans was not identified in the patient’s blood cultures, but the blood cultures were positive for the organism.
