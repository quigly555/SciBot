## Abstract
The basidiomycete Wallemia ichthyophaga from the insect genus Thepinula infects. This plant species is the source of the major epidemics of W. ichthyophaga, which has led to its marginal crops, such as Linton and Zyla. In this study, we isolated a novel W. ichthyophaga isolate from Kenya and identified it as strain KUCA113. This strain displayed high sporulation frequency, showed hyphal and filaments characteristics, and was resistant to caspofungin. The W. ichthyophaga strain was more susceptible to phytoalexin (CE) than the control C. coli. We found that the W. ichthyophaga strain KUCA113 was capable of growth under caspofungin and copper. Our results indicate that the W. ichthyophaga strain KUCA113 is an interesting pathogen for biocontrol by disrupting host cell membranes. It may be useful in bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon particles.


## Introduction

We argue here that intracellular opsonophagocytosis by opsonophagocytic cells has, at least in part, a stochastic mechanism, that, although not necessarily stochastic, can be correlated with the response to environmental stimul. Although the stochastic mechanism of opsonophagocytosis is not well understood, it is clear that opsonophagy can be co-operative and that opsonophagy can be co-regulated with the response to stress. As one example, both the microbial pathogen, Candida albicans and the host immune system have evolved mechanisms that allow C. albicans to survive opsonophagic cues and, in response, C. albicans can evade opsonic immune cells by opsonophagy.

The objective of the present work was to examine the co-evolution of the opsonophagy machinery and opsonophagy in response to opsonophagocytic cells. We found that the opsonophagy machinery is co-regulated by opsonophagy and, indeed, that opsonophagy can co-exist with other machinery that are implicated in cell-mediated immunity. These findings are significant because opsonophagy is an emerging pathogen, with multiple risk-benefit studies, including those for diabetes, AIDS, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease, which all depend on the co-evolution of opsonophagy. Furthermore, the opsonophagy machinery is not the only mechanism that opsonically targets cells to death, and the opsonophagy machinery is not the only protein that opsonically targets cells to death. Indeed, the opsonophagy machinery is also involved in cell-mediated immunity, which is supported by the finding that the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is intrinsically more tolerant of oxidative stress than the host. These findings demonstrate that intracellular opsonophagy is a heterogeneous, multistep process, that can be disrupted by opsonization and immune cells. Importantly, the opsonophagy machinery is a highly dynamic and dynamic organelle, with the crosstalk between opsonophagy and immune cells during the process of opsonophagocytosis.


## Methods
The expression levels of the transcription factors were measured by qPCR using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as previously described [46. Primer pairs cbf-1/cbf-2, cbf-3/cbf-4, cbf-5/cbf-6, and cbf-7/cbf-8 were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA (S1 File). The primers for the cbf-1 and cbf-4 regions were used as previously described [46]. The PCR products were purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified products were then sequenced at the Eurofins MWG Operon-Genomics Facility (Ebersberg, Germany).

Phylogenetic Analyses
The sequences of the ITS, cbf-1 and cbf-4 regions of rDNA were deposited in GenBank (Table 1). Sequences of the ITS, cbf-1 and cbf-4 regions of rDNA were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Table 1).

The sequences of rDNA were aligned using the online version of MAFFT [47] and manually curated using the default parameters of MEGA6 [48]. All sequences of the sequences in this study were deposited in GenBank (Table 1). The phylogenetic tree was drawn using MEGA6 [48].

The software package MEGA5 [49] was used for the statistical analyses of the phylogenetic tree. The level of the support of the branches of the tree was set to 0.5 with a minimum of 1,000 bootstrap replicates.


## Results
expansum in infected CSF (Fig 4A. These results suggest that the infection of CSF with P. expansum can induce host immunity. In contrast, in the case of CSF with P. expansum, the immune response against P. expansum in the CSF was largely abrogated (Fig 4B).

To further confirm these results, we evaluated the CSF fungal burden and fungal burden in CSF and blood cultures. In order to determine whether the fungal burden in CSF and blood cultures was significantly different between P. expansum-infected and uninfected patients, we infected mice with P. expansum or PBS and then sacrificed the animals at a later time point (day 3) post-infection. As shown in Fig 4C, infection with P. expansum induced significantly higher fungal burdens in the CSF and blood cultures than in the control group, which was not statistically significant. In contrast, fungal burdens in the CSF and blood cultures were significantly lower than in the PBS group (Fig 4C). The fungal burden in CSF cultures was significantly lower than in the PBS group in the PBS group (Fig 4C).

P. expansum induces a macrophage-like cell population and macrophage-like cell adhesion molecule production in CSF and blood cultures
To determine whether P. expansum can induce macrophage-like cell adhesion molecule production, we infected mice with P. expansum and the fungal burden in CSF and blood cultures was determined by culture supernatants and by quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig 5A, the fungal burden in CSF culture supernatants increased with infection with P. expansum, while the fungal burden in the CSF supernatants remained unchanged. Furthermore, we detected a significantly lower fungal burden in CSF cultures of the infected mice than in the PBS group (Fig 5B).

We also analyzed the expression of three key virulence factors, a G-protein family member (G-protein signaling pathway), the alpha-1,3-mannosidase (beta-1,3-mannosidase), and the c-mannosidase (c-mannosidase). G-protein signaling pathway is required for fungal pathogenicity in C. albicans [20,21]. G-mannosidase activity was significantly higher in CSF cultures of P.


## Discussion

The use of MDR B cells has been increasingly recognized in patients with NTM diseas. The use of this population has been previously reported in patients with intracellular pathogens such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, and in patients with other systemic mycoses such as HIV and TB [10-13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19]. In addition to human cases, MDR B cells from patients with other CNS mycoses such as AIDS and Parkinsonâ€™s disease have also been reported in several other studies [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In the present study, we have used the MDR B cells in the murine model of NTM infection. We demonstrated that MDR B cells were a stable and potent strain in the presence of C. albicans and C. neoformans, and were able to cause disease in mice. This observation agrees with previous studies that also demonstrated the stability and efficacy of C. albicans and C. neoformans in the murine model of NTM infection [10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19]. Importantly, the MDR B cell population is an important factor for NTM disease. Our data demonstrated that MDR B cells play an important role in the immune response to NTM infection, as they were able to induce inflammation in the kidneys of infected mice. This inflammation was accompanied by increased cellular proliferation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-6 and IFN-<U+03B3>. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated the importance of MDR B cells in the pathogenicity and pathogenicity of NTM infections [13, 17, 19, 25]. Furthermore, in vitro studies have also shown that MDR B cells play a significant role in the development of drug resistance and disease in NTM patients [12, 13, 18, 19].

In addition to their ability to produce IL-12, MDR B cells were also able to induce macrophages to express IL-10, a marker of Th2 cytokine production [27].
