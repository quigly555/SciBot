## Abstract
Eukaryotic pathogens have been shown to utilize an evolutionarily conserved set of regulatory mechanisms to control their virulence. However, little is known about the role of these systems in host defense mechanisms, particularly in the non-pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. In a previous study we found that a S-phase protein complex in the yeast cell wall promotes its extracellular attachment and that this process is critical for attachment. Here we employed a structural genetics approach to identify the S-phase components of the yeast cell wall that are essential for yeast virulence. We found that the S-phase components in the wall of the C. neoformans strain C27-3 are required for attachment and that these components are coordinately regulated. The C. neoformans mutant strains <U+0394>sakA (sakAP) had defects in attachment, a different phenotype from wild-type <U+0394>cakA. SakA was also required for virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis. Our findings reveal a novel, highly conserved function for the S-phase protein Scep31, which is important for the development of invasive fungal disease.

Fungi are an important component of the human fungal infection environment. In the context of infection, the pathogenesis of fungal infections is the regulation of the immune response, either directly or indirectly, by the yeast Ustilago maydis. Here, we used a structural genetic approach to identify the S-phase components of the hyphal components of the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified them using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) and mass spectrometry. A total of 12 components were found, including the major facilitator superfamily component of S. cerevisiae, the a-mannosyltransferase, the d-aspartate dehydrogenase, and the trypanothione reductase, in the C. neoformans <U+0394>sakA mutant strain, and in the wild-type C. neoformans <U+0394>cakA mutant strain. Moreover, we found that the components are essential for survival of C.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In fact, patients with underlying disease or immunosuppression, such as transplant patients, those with cancer or AIDS, patients receiving chemotherapy, patients on corticosteroid, and those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, are at increased risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) [1].

The infection cycle of IFIs can be divided into three stages: (1) the primary route of infection, (2) secondary routes, and (3) non-specific routes of infection. The primary route is the route of infection with high mortality and is characterized by the failure to eradicate the fungus. For example, the poor outcome of the primary route of IFIs has led to the estimation that only 5-10% of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) result in death, with this mortality rate being in the range of 30-70% [2]. Although the primary route of IFIs is clearly not fully understood, it is likely that the other routes will become more and more clear in the years ahead [3].

The IFIs are not caused by common organisms. Disease caused by a single pathogen may be characterized by several common manifestations, such as a high incidence of colonization, and the ability to progress to resistance. This is true for most IFIs and is expected to be the case even in the absence of strong antifungal activity. The most common cause of fungal disease in transplant patients is Candida albicans [4]. Other causes of disease include Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The most common fungal pathogens in the immunocompromised host include Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Cryptococcus, but fungi can also cause diseases such as cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and candidiasis [5].

In spite of the increasing availability of antifungal agents, the mortality associated with IFIs still remains high. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 deaths occur each year in the United States from IFIs, resulting in 15% of all deaths in the world [6]. The mortality of IFIs is most commonly associated with the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus [7].

Data collection and analysis
The total number of patients with cryptococcosis was categorized as those with cryptococcosis or cryptococcosis of multiple isolates. This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 (CLSI, 2008).

## Results
. Wurtsch., unpublished) was submitted to the Lineweaver et al. (2008) study. Infected mice were inoculated with PBS and then the lungs were sampled 24 h later. As shown in Fig 2, WT mice infected with C. neoformans had increased pulmonary fungal burden (Fig 2C). WT mice infected with C. neoformans had a milder pulmonary infection with a median survival time of 6.3 days (Fig 2D). Moreover, WT mice infected with C. neoformans had significantly higher fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans (mean survival time of 5.2 days, Table 1). A few organs of the lungs from WT mice infected with C. neoformans displayed progressive lung lesions with pulmonary fungal burden ranging from a single lobe in mice infected with C. neoformans to multiple lobes in mice infected with C. neoformans. The lesions of organs of the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans were less than those of WT mice. The lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans had numerous hyphal lesions, with typical lesions of hyphal hyphae and a basal hyphal morphotype. The lesions of lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans were more similar to those of WT mice, with the exception of a single hyphal hyphal lesion in the lung of mouse 1 week after inoculation with C. neoformans. The histopathology of the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans revealed that the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans had granulomas, especially with the conidia producing conidia (Fig 2E). Furthermore, the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans exhibited extensive cystic infiltration of the mucosa and the surrounding tissue (Fig 2F). These findings indicated that the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans contained many features of fungal infection. The lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans were often associated with hyphal lesions, including granulomas, hyphal granulomas, and hyphal nodules. Histopathological examination of the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans revealed a major infiltration of granulomas with hyphal nodules and a basal hyphal morphotype (Fig 2G). In addition, the lungs of mice infected with C.


## Discussion
The lesion of the right pulmonary artery was obviously superficial with involvement of the liver, lungs, spleen, and brain, with pulmonary infiltrate. The patient was immunocompromised and had a history of liver and renal disease. Histological examination of the left pulmonary artery showed evidence of pulmonary infiltration. The pulmonary histological examination showed a small percentage of fungi in the lesion. The patient had no history of renal disease, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. Therefore, the diagnosis of cryptococcosis was made. The patient was diagnosed as Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (S.neoformans var. neoformans). The patientâ€™s pulmonary histological examination showed three nodules, one interstitial and one basal lung, which were nodular, and bronchiolar nodules. The patient had a history of pulmonary infection.

In the current case, the patient did not have pulmonary infection, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination of the pulmonary lesions. The pulmonary infection was ruled out by the histopathology of the lesion, and the histopathological examination showed lesions with a diameter of 2-3 mm. The patient was immunocompromised, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. Therefore, the diagnosis was confirmed.

The immunocompetent patient had no known immunodeficiency. The patient was immunocompromised, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. Therefore, the diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination of the lung lesion. The patient had no history of immunodeficiency, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. The patient was also immunocompromised and had a history of pulmonary infection.

The immunocompetent patient had no known immunodeficiency. The patient had no history of immunodeficiency, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. The patient was immunocompromised, and there was no evidence of tuberculosis or cryptococcosis. The patient had no history of immunodeficiency, and there was no evidence of lung infection. The patient was immunocompromised and had a history of lung infection.
