## Abstract
Interferon (IFN) is a cytokine that acts in multiple pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P.P.) and Haemophilus influenzae (H.I.E.) 1, despite the fact that Mtb have a reduced survival and/or drug resistance. In this study, we found that the serum levels of IFN-<U+03B3>, IFN-<U+03B3>-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>-<U+03B3> of Mtb treated patients and healthy controls were significantly higher in the serum of the treated patients compared to the uninfected patients, whereas the levels of IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>-<U+03B3> were unchanged in the uninfected patients. These findings were supported with the use of IFN tests in combination with other therapeutic regimens for Mtb which may improve adherence, drug efficacy and/or prevent drug resistance. Furthermore, the use of combined therapies in combination with other systemic anti-obesity therapies is indicated in the current study for the treatment of a Mtb-infected patient.


## Introduction
Proteins are a major component of the living cell machinery and are central to many biological processes, such as cell division, cell motility, eosinophil homeostasis, signal transduction, cell cycle progression, cell signaling and cell development. Therefore, to ensure genome stability, organisms must maintain high levels of the proteoglycans, which serve as structural units for cell membranes, as well as functional units, like the cell envelope, which are under constant attack by the proteoglycans and are subsequently sequestered in the proteoglycans. Thus, to maintain genome stability and stability, organisms must maintain proteoglycans in their genome.

The proteoglycans are present in the cytoplasm of cells, where they are mainly cleaved, forming a peptidoglycan, which can be released during proteoglycans cleavage and can then be translated by the cell. The released peptidoglycan can then be incorporated into proteins, which are then translated to complete the cell cycle. In addition, a wide range of proteoglycans can be secreted into the extracellular environment, resulting in the secretion of a diverse variety of secretory products (1). In addition to the numerous secreted proteins, peptidoglycan biosynthesis is of major interest, since they are required for the accomplishment of many important biological processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, stress response and asexual propagation (2-4). The secreted peptidoglycan is synthesized mainly by various enzymes and is a key molecule in the secretion of different secretory products (5). The secretion of secretory products can be achieved through the action of multiple enzymes.

The secretory products can be classified according to the activity of the enzymes and the peptidoglycan molecule. The secretion of secretory products is achieved by several enzymes: ß-catenin, <U+03B3>- glutathione peroxidase, pepsin, urease, and peroxidase. Proteins are highly conserved, and their activity is often linked to their role in protein synthesis (6). Proteins are mainly composed of amino acids, lipids, proteins, polypeptides and nucleic acids.


## Methods
The C-terminal region was mutated to preserve the H-terminal region and, therefore, the mutation was inserted in the region that contained the X-linked sequence to obtain the desired mutatio. The resulting mutant was confirmed by diagnostic PCR.

To generate the D1/D2 region of the protein of interest, the following mutation was introduced in the X-linked protein of the D1/D2 region of the protein of interest. The C-terminal region was mutated to preserve the H-terminal region and, therefore, the mutation was inserted in the region containing the X-linked sequence to obtain the desired mutation. The resulting mutant was confirmed by diagnostic PCR.

## Results
We then introduced the C-terminal C2H2 region of the human C2H2 complex into the murine background to assess the C-terminal C2H2 complex in murine cell. As shown in Fig 4A, after 24 h of incubation, only a single C-terminal C2H2 complex was observed in the murine cells (Fig 4A, arrowheads), suggesting that the C2H2 complex was absent in the murine C2H2 complex. However, when the murine C2H2 complex was incubated with the C2H2 complex in the presence of the fluoridated detergent N-oxide, the C-terminal C2H2 complex was observed. In contrast, when the murine C2H2 complex was incubated with the C2H2 complex in the presence of the detergent N-oxide, the C-terminal C2H2 complex was observed (Fig 4A, arrowheads). These data suggest that C2H2 complex was present in the murine C2H2 complex, and not the C2H2 complex.

The C2H2 complex is required for C. albicans hyphal growth in the presence of the phospholipase K inhibitor caspofungin and in the presence of the inhibitors kanamycin and Congo red [27]. Therefore, we next examined whether C2H2 complex is required for the growth of C. albicans in the presence of the inhibitor caspofungin. We incubated the cells with the inhibitors caspofungin and Congo red (Fig 5). In the presence of caspofungin, C. albicans cells grown in the presence of the inhibitor showed a growth phenotype indistinguishable from the wild type strain. However, when the inhibitors were added to the growth medium, the growth of C. albicans cells was severely inhibited (Fig 5). In contrast, the growth of C.


## Discussion
Therefore, the catalytic machinery that is involved in the regulation of the reactions involving the transmembrane phosphate of ATP was identifie. We showed that in all three cases, the respective substrate was to the same extent present in the cytoplasm. However, in the case of Coronarin, the cytoplasmic organelles were not connected to the mitochondrial complex (Figures 2A,B). These results are in agreement with the literature data, where the higher substrate concentration is expected for the cell’s mitochondrion. These results may be explained by the fact that the free energy of the electron-rich ATP complex is stored in the cytoplasmic organelles (C.R. Black, personal communication). It is therefore possible that the substrate is to the mitochondrial cytoplasm, and the reaction reaction proceeds in the cytoplasmic organelles. However, the fact that this is not possible for the cytosolic organelles in this model suggests that the mitochondrial cytoplasmic complex is not only a heterogeneous organelle but also contains a number of potential substrates for the reaction (Figure 2).

The proposed mechanism of the reactions involving the cytoplasmic organelles is due to the “parallel reaction” that is involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites (3). This parallel reaction is a key event in the synthesis of ATP (Table 1). In this case, the cytoplasmic organelles are interconnected with the cytoplasmic complex via a series of membrane-anchor proteins, including P3-coumarins and P6-coumarins, which are important for ATP biosynthesis (Figure 3). P3-coumarins are important for the synthesis of ATP, whereas P6-coumarins are involved in the synthesis of ATP. These structures are presented in Figure 2A. P6-coumarins are present in the cytoplasmic organelles of fungi and bacteria. However, in some species, P6-coumarins are absent (e.g.
