## Abstract
The role of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against commonly used antigens has never been examined. This study showed that mAbs from a novel strain of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (C. albicans) with a GTPase activity and characteristic polysaccharide structures (polysaccharides such as glucuronoxylomannan and glucuronoxylomannan-1) could be used as antifungal therapeutic targets. The antifungal activity of the polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan was evaluated by measuring the viability of the fungus when the fungus was treated with polysaccharide oligo and polydisulfide compounds. The antifungal activity of the oligo and polydisulfide compounds was analyzed by a broth microdilution assay. The results showed that oligo and polydisulfide compounds had an MIC of 0.04 µg/ml for C. albicans, and for C. albicans, an MIC of 0.31 µg/ml for amphotericin-B, fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. The results also showed that the polysaccharides amphotericin B, itraconazole, and nystatin had an MIC of 0.31 µg/ml for C. albicans, and 0.31 µg/ml for C. albicans, for a similar activity to fluconazole and itraconazole.


## Introduction

In addition, a Pichia anomala Salpingoides was selected for proteomic analyse.


## Methods
from . digitatum in R. glutinis were carried out by: (i) Tissue homogenisation in glass tubes (0.22 × 150 mm; Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) using 1 ml of 20% Percoll in distilled water, centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min and (ii) cell lysis using 10% Percoll in distilled water. After a series of 10 washes in cold distilled water, the homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of 10% Percoll in distilled water, centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1 min, and then centrifuged again at 1500 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of 2% Percoll in distilled water. The recombinant plasmid pJAF-ATPase was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and the resulting purified plasmid was subcloned into pGEX-2.0 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to generate plasmid pJAF-ATP. This plasmid was used to transform P. digitatum in a chemically competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and transformants were selected on lysine-free LB medium (0.35% LB and 0.35% Tryptophan, respectively) at 37 °C for 2 days. In some experiments, the plasmid was used to transform P. digitatum in a chemically competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and transformants were selected on lysine-free LB medium at 37 °C for 1 day.

Fungal genomic DNA was extracted from the hyphal-like spores of P. digitatum grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 200 µg/ml nourseothricin (Werner BioAgents, Jena, Germany). The fungal ITS1 region was amplified using the primer pair ITS1F/ITS4 (Table S1). The primer combination ITS1F/ITS4 was chosen for P.

## Discussion
 2015. The analysis of the proteome of Arthrinium provided insights into the cellular interactions of the serine protease P. seriella. The number of serine proteases in the fungal pathogen is reduced from 1,200 to 1,500 in the serine protease P. seriella, compared to 1,700 in the human serine protease (Satterthwait et al., 2017). It is possible that a large number of serine proteases in the serine protease P. seriella might have an important role in pathogenicity of the fungus.

The RNA-seq data also showed that the serine protease P. seriella was able to utilize the host plasmid (CNAG_03372) for replication (Fig 6). Similar to other serine proteases in other fungal species, P. seriella uses the host plasmid for replication. This could be a reason for the rapid increase in the number of serine protease P. seriella in the host.

The proteome analysis also showed that P. seriella harbors a large number of intracellular proteases. The number of intracellular proteases in P. seriella is relatively low compared to other fungal species. The proteome analysis of P. seriella revealed several proteins that are not found in the P. seriella genome. One of the proteins (P38A, which is a homolog of the human protease P38A of C. albicans) was found in P. seriella proteome. This protein is important for the pathogenicity of P. seriella. The cell wall protease P38 (P38A, CD36, and CD86, cell wall-anchored protein) was identified in P. seriella proteome. It is required for the virulence of P. seriella. The yeast P38 (P38A, CD36, and CD86) and the filamentous fungus filamentous fungus P38 (P38A, CD36, and CD86) were identified in P. seriella proteome. The genes coding for P38A, CD36, and CD86, are involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity, cell wall organization, and the presence of an extracellular matrix (Table S1).
