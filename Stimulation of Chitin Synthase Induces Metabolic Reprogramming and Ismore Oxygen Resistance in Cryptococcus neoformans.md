## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a globally distributed and species-poor fungal pathogen with a global geographic distribution. Here we report the genome sequence of the clinically important yeast C. gattii strain MBWH12, which is a clinical isolate from an HIV patient with a possible compounding problem.


## Introduction
 2016. Although C. neoformans contains two Cys2 enzymes, they share characteristics that make them different from those of other pathogenic yeasts such as a high O_2 (18:4 ATP) requirement, and a high degree of regulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (Santos and Melo, 2014). The catalytic triad is a conserved enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of the glycosaminoglycan cycle in C. neoformans (Schrettl et al., 2004). It is a very common enzyme, and it is reported that C. neoformans has an equivalent number of Cys2 and Cys3 in its genome (Vogel and Schrettl, 2011). C. neoformans has a single enzyme, Cys2, that converts O_2 into oxygen. When the species of the genus Cryptococcus are mixed, the two oxygen-producing species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, are inhaled, and the organism will rapidly metabolize oxygen to CO_2. In addition, C. neoformans contains a conserved enzyme, chitin synthase (Chs), that converts the available oxygen to glucose and N,N-bisphosphate. Chs is a homolog of the mammalian chitin synthase (Chs3) and plays a crucial role in the catalytic cycle of C. neoformans (Santos et al., 2014). Chs is a protein with high sequence similarity to mammalian chitin synthases (Chs3) and is found in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotes, including humans (Liu et al., 2000). It is found in the mitochondria, as well as in the cytoplasm of most fungal species, and can be activated by the chitin synthase system (Chs3) (Liu et al., 2000). Chs is a key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and its role in cellular regulation is still unclear. However, there is a literature demonstrating the importance of Chs for the functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Bovers et al., 2014).

In this study, we investigate the role of Chs in the mitochondrial respiratory chain by using a synthetic library of compounds that were isolated from C.


## Methods
neoformans strain H99 using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA. For ChsTs, the PCR product was cloned into the NotI site of pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The ChsTs were cloned into pET-28a with the hph-S-cloning vector. The ChsTs were amplified and cloned into pET-28a. The PCR product was cloned into pET-28a, and the ChsTs were cloned into pET-28a. The ChsTs were confirmed by sequencing the amplification product. The PCR products were cloned into pET-28a, and the PCR product was cloned into pET-28a. The recombinant plasmids were isolated from the cell suspension by use of QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH5a cells. The cells were cultured in induction medium (IM) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) containing 200 µg ml^-1 ampicillin, 100 µg ml^-1 kanamycin, 10 mM glucose, 20% glycerol, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.25 mM l-glutathione, 5 mM sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium deoxycholate, 1% glycerol, 100 µg ml^-1 streptomycin sulfate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% Tween 20, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.1 mM sodium nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 1 mM sodium nicotin, 10 µg ml^-1 streptomycin sulfate, 0.1 mM sodium nitrate, 0.01% Tween 20, 10 mM sodium polysaccharide, 1 mM sodium pyrophate, 1 mM sodium thiocholine iodide, and 1% glycerol.


## Results
cerevisiae [5,10. Chitin synthase activity is independent of the transcription factor IL-4 and is controlled by the transcription factor GRX2, which is dispensable for chitin synthesis. Therefore, we studied the influence of Chitin synthase activity on the expression of chitin synthase genes by Chitin Data Analysis (ChiD) analysis. We found that Chitin synthase activity was regulated by the chitin regulatory element HmgA in a concentration dependent manner. The highest Chitin synthase activity was detected in the mycelia grown in medium containing 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA, but lower activity was detected in the growth of the mycelia grown in medium containing 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA (Fig 3A). The expression of genes related to chitin synthesis was induced by P. aeruginosa as shown in Fig 3B. We also observed a relationship between Chitin synthase activity and chitin synthase activity in Cryptococcus neoformans. We tested the inhibitory activity of chitin synthase in the mycelia grown in medium containing 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA. The highest chitin synthase activity was detected in the mycelia grown in medium with 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA. However, we found a relationship between chitin synthase activity and chitin synthase activity in the mycelia grown in medium containing 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA (Fig 3C). The results showed that Chitin synthase activity and chitin synthase activity were regulated by the transcription factor HmgA in a concentration dependent manner. Chitin synthase activity is regulated by the transcription factor GRX2, which is dispensable for chitin synthesis. Therefore, we investigated the influence of Chitin synthase activity on the expression of chitin synthase genes by ChiD analysis. Interestingly, the highest Chitin synthase activity was detected in the mycelia grown in medium containing 0.5 M PDA or 0.2 M TGA (Fig 3D). The highest Chitin synthase activity was detected in the mycelia grown in medium with 0.


## Discussion
neoformans, including the plasma membrane, are exquisitely sensitive to stress and pathogens are dependent on their own adaptation to the environment, including exposure to environmental stressors [4. In Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungal cell wall contains multiple proteins involved in the regulation of various metabolic pathways. Our previous study demonstrated that chitin synthase 1 (CnS1) is essential for fungal virulence in a murine inhalation infection model [20]. We examined whether CnS1 was essential for survival of C. neoformans inside macrophages and found that macrophages treated with anti-cryptococcus IgG inhibited the growth of C. neoformans in vitro [21]. Importantly, we found that anti-cryptococcus IgG was able to reduce the proliferation of C. neoformans in vitro and in vivo. However, we did not find any significant difference in virulence between mice and wild type cells or infected mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that the CnS1 protein was involved in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans and the protective effect of anti-cryptococcus IgG was dependent on the fungal cell wall proteolytic enzymes. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that anti-cryptococcus IgG did not increase the phosphorylation of GTP-S-Glyc-ATPase (GATPase) to decrease the ability of Cryptococcus to survive inside macrophages and result in increased fungal burden [22].

The cytosolic chitin synthase A (ChsA) is required for cell wall and membrane integrity, and the cell wall proteolytic enzymes are involved in the regulation of cell wall biogenesis and cell wall remodeling [23]. In Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungal cell wall contains three chitin-like cysteine residues (CysM, CysN, and CysR) and chitin-like ß-1,3-glucan (CnA) [24]. The cell wall proteolytic enzymes (CnA, CnB, and CnD) are involved in cell wall and membrane integrity [25,26]. The cell wall proteolytic enzymes (CnA, CnB, and CnD) are required for cell wall biogenesis and cell wall remodeling [27].
