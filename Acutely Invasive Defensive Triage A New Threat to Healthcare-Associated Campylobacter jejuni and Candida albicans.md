## Abstract
We report the case of a 79-year-old woman with a disseminated histoplasmosis who presented with respiratory symptoms. She was not immunocompromised or under immunosuppressive treatment. She had a past medical history that included both systemic and mucocutaneous mycoses. She had received amphotericin B and flucytosine. She presented to the hospital with a 3-week history of coughing, malaise, and fevers. She had not recently changed and no stool or blood were found. Skeletal sputum analysis was consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis. Antibiotics were started but she developed acute pneumonia complications and died. Autopsy revealed disseminated histoplasmosis. This case suggests that there may be an immunocompromised-human immunodeficiency virus in this case. Physicians should consider disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with disseminated mycosis who present with acute respiratory failure.


## Introduction
Fungi are often found on the surface of plant leaves and decaying wood, but the role of these fungi in the decomposition of plant materials remains poorly understood (Wilson et al. 2015). In recent years, the release of DNA-based information on fungal taxa has greatly increased, and the ability to accurately document the phylogenetic distribution of fungi has made it possible to perform multilocus DNA sequence analyses. For example, the release of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences showed that these fungi had high diversity across all fungal phyla, but few patterns were observed (Carrillo-Muñoz et al. 2013).

The release of LSU and ITS sequences from Illumina technology platforms revealed that plant-associated fungi were most abundant in the LSU and ITS regions (Carrillo-Muñoz et al. 2013). The release of LSU and ITS sequences from the Trichoderma reagenti and the LSU sequence database were also used to produce multilocus phylogenies (Carrillo-Muñoz et al. 2013). With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the production of multi-gene phylogenies is achieved using a large number of samples (Carrillo-Muñoz et al. 2013). In contrast to the ability to accurately document the phylogenetic distribution of fungi, the ability to accurately document the fungal taxa distribution has only rarely been studied. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the main fungal taxa in four different plant litter types, namely, ‘chalk leaf’, ‘leaf litter’, ‘cumberland’ and ‘landing hair’ (Figure 1). The distribution patterns of fungal taxa were then compared with those of saprotrophic and plant-associated fungi. This study was performed in three plant litter types (echalk, chalk tea, and wood) and was conducted in three different plant litter types (echalk tea, chalk tea, and wood). The analysis of the distribution patterns of fungal taxa in three plant litter types revealed high diversity, and the ability to accurately document the phylogenetic distribution of fungi.


## Methods
 Altoona, CA, USA) was adopted for the MALDI-TOF MS/MS, which is described belo. Briefly, C. albicans (ATCC 90028), C. glabrata (ATCC 90028) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were used as target species. A stock suspension of each tested strain of C. albicans (5 × 10^5 colony-forming units/mL) was prepared in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, USA) with L-glutamine without sodium bicarbonate (Gibco BRL, USA). Fungal cells were added to the culture media in the ratio of 1:10 in order to obtain a final inoculum of ~1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. To determine the effect of the following changes on the growth rate of C. albicans, a stock of 10^3 CFU/mL of C. albicans were used in the MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The MALDI-TOF MS/MS was performed in triplicate, and the growth rates of each strain were calculated by a linear regression analysis of the growth rate and by the area under the curve (AUC) for each growth rate, and a standard curve was calculated by the same method.

3.4. Biological Activity Testing of C. albicans Against Candida albicans
C. albicans (ATCC 90028) was used as a quality control strain for the MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The cells were prepared by adding 10^4 CFU of the tested strain to the RPMI-1640 media in a final volume of 200 µL. The media was buffered with 2-mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and the pellets were resuspended in 100 µL of fresh RPMI-1640. The samples were then mixed, and the assay was performed as previously described.


## Results
In order to make the health care system more efficient, the application of antimicrobial agents should be encourage. Currently, the literature shows that antimicrobial agents have promising promising results in terms of reducing the incidence of serious infections and enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics in treating fungal infections (17). Recently, a single-site study showed that the antimicrobial agents used in the current treatment regimen were of high safety and efficacy (4). The key to the improvement of the antimicrobial efficacy of antimicrobial agents is the systematic assessment of the efficacy of the most promising agents. The antimicrobial treatment regimen should be defined to reduce the incidence of serious infections. There is a need for a systematic and systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of the most promising agents. In this context, the effectiveness of the most promising antimicrobial agents should be evaluated by the evaluation of their pharmacokinetics. The best antimicrobial agents are well-known for their synergistic effects with antimicrobials, especially against bacterial and fungal infections. There is a need for an evaluation of the synergistic effect of antimicrobial agents against the most promising antibiotic agents. The results of this study suggest that the most promising antimicrobial agents are effective against several bacterial and fungal infections. These antimicrobial agents are mainly used to treat infections and prevent the formation of infection in patients. It is important to take into account that these drugs are not only anti-bacterial, but also antimicrobial agents.

2.3. Pharmacokinetics of AMPs
In the present study, the most promising antimicrobial agents were the lof-a-L-lactate (L-LA), a-L-lactate (L-LA), and caspofungin. Both lof-a-L-lactate and caspofungin are antimicrobials used to treat infections (9). The highest concentrations of lof-a-L-lactate (320 µg/ml) and caspofungin (200 µg/ml) are of high efficacy against the most promising antimicrobial agents. L-LA and caspofungin have high inhibitory concentrations against the most promising antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the most promising antimicrobial agents are in line with the literature.

## Discussion
A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous pathogen causing invasive infection in humans, and is frequently found in environmental samples. The development of Candida albicans in blood, urine, and other bodily fluids has been reported in various studies. [9], [10], [11] In this study, we evaluated the growth and morphological characteristics of A. fumigatus in the blood, urine, and blood of healthy individuals. In addition, we found that A. fumigatus was able to colonize the hemolymph of the renal epithelium.

Our findings showed that A. fumigatus was able to colonize the hemolymph of kidneys and that the hyphae were able to grow into the kidneys. Although we did not investigate the growth of A. fumigatus in the hemolymph, we believe that this organism may be able to colonize the hemolymph and survive in the kidneys of the patients with sepsis.

A. fumigatus is a non-albicans pathogen, which is also commonly found in different organs of the body. A.
