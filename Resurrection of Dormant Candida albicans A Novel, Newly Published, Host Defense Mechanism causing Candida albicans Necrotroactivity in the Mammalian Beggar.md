## Abstract
Epidemiological data of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis in Brazil have been scant. Current knowledge of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and treatment is of interest to inform cutaneous drug-drug interactions.

A retrospective study was conducted among 227 patients with suspected primary pulmonary cryptococcosis who had contact with schoolchildren between November 2014 and January 2015. Clinical, demographic and treatment data were collected and analyzed using Epi-Info and clinical trials data were conducted using Epi-Verse.com.

A total of 89 patients were diagnosed with cryptococcosis; 44.5% were male, 31.8% were female and 3.7% were not classified as such by the presence of clinical features. The median time from onset to diagnosis was 4.5 years (IQR 1-9). Forty one (7.5%) patients had underlying underlying immunosuppression; 10 (5%) patients had active disease. The most common underlying diseases were cryptococcosis (26.2%) and tuberculosis (14.3%). One (2.6%) patients had underlying chronic diseases such as Crohn's Disease (9.9%) and colitis (4.3%). Three (2.6%) patients were allergic to coccidioidomycosis.

Infections and other fungal infections were the most common presentations among patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. The main risk factors were poor immunosuppressive regimens, high grade Bile salts and steroids, and recurrent contact with Crohn's Disease, Crohn's Disease-associated (CRAD) and CRIME-related (CRIM). One third of patients were treated with amphotericin B and one (3.9%) received fluconazole.


## Introduction
Vitamin D is a key micronutrient mediator and is also involved in many immune responses, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of leukocytes (1, 2). In the primary human form of the human host, macrophages form primary polarized macrophages with neutrophils and macrophages in the primary polarized macrophage phenotype are named myeloid cells (3). However, it is becoming increasingly recognized that macrophages also form secondary polarized macrophages, which are termed myeloid cells because of their capacity to produce phorbolates (4). Primary polarized macrophages can be divided into two types: classically activated macrophages (also known as polarized macrophages), which are activated by oxidative stress and high-molecular-weight radicals, and alternatively activated by ROS and other types of molecular damage (5, 6), which are thought to contribute to disease progression and disease progression of macrophages (7, 8).

The myeloid cell lineage is characterized by the production of ROS, reactive oxygen species (ROS), low-molecular-weight DNA damage and DNA repair (9). In the first stages of macrophage development, macrophages can differentiate between classically activated and alternatively activated macrophages (7, 8). Classically activated macrophages have the capacity to produce ROS and reactive oxygen species and can differentiate between these and alternatively activated macrophages (9). Macrophages can differentiate between classically activated and alternatively activated macrophages and can actively induce and respond to oxidative, interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-2 (IL-2), as well as non- oxidative (RA5) ROS and oxidative stress (10).

In the second phase of macrophage development, the ability to differentiate between classically and alternatively activated macrophages, the capacity to induce and respond to ROS and reactive oxygen species, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TNFa, and the ability to differentiate between conventional and alternative activated macrophages are thought to be important factors in the development of macrophage polarization (11).

## Results
pratense in the host is complicated by the transient production of the cell wall-associated and antimicrobial peptides Doxycycline and Calcium B (see below. Doxycycline also inhibits the secretion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata.

In the venom of D. pratense, Doxycycline significantly inhibited the production of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata (Fig 4A). The secretion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata was also inhibited by Doxycycline (Fig 4A), which indicates the importance of Doxycycline in the secretion of these cell wall-associated bacteria and fungi. In addition, D. lanceolata also significantly inhibited the secretion of Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata (Fig 4A). Doxycycline also inhibited the secretion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata (Fig 4A). Thus, Doxycycline selectively inhibited the secretion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata, while it inhibited the secretion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata, which is consistent with the antimicrobial activity of Doxycycline. In addition, D. lanceolata inhibited the secretion of Dectin-2 by D. lanceolata, which indicates that Doxycycline is also effective against D. lanceolata.

In vitro Studies
The antifungal activity of Doxycycline against the yeasts of D. lanceolata and D. pratense is shown in Fig 5. The Doxycycline-treated yeasts exhibited a significant inhibition of their growth (P < 0.05), and the growth inhibition was inhibited by a high concentration of Doxycycline (10 µM). The inhibition of growth was also also accompanied by the growth inhibition by Doxycycline (10 µM). In addition, the growth inhibition by Doxycycline was also accompanied by the growth inhibition by Doxycycline (10 µM).


## Discussion
In the mouse, Beggar's end disease model, mice infected with Candida albicans were significantly more susceptible to infection with a normal mouse than mice infected with . albicans (17). In our study, we demonstrated that D. melanogaster and D. discoideum were genetically susceptible to D. melanogaster infection. In contrast, in other mouse model, mice infected with D. discoideum were significantly less susceptible to infection with D. melanogaster (17). D. melanogaster infected with D. melanogaster showed significantly reduced survival and survival in the mucosal and vaginal epithelial cells (17). D. discoideum infection was also significantly reduced in the human colonic epithelial cell line (17). Our findings confirmed that D.
