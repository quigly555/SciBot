## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging fungal pathogen that has caused several invasive infections in chickens and humans. A genome-wide association study of C. gattii has been conducted to understand its biology and population genetics. This study therefore performed a metaanalysis to determine the chromosomal location and load in a range of C. gattii strains. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the majority of C. gattii strains (n = 8, 48%) are polymorphic, homologous to other fungi. All strains were found to be harboring the PbC region, which encodes the mating type locus.


## Introduction
2009; Aptroot et a. 2013).

From this point of view, the application of lysine-modified enzymes in the biosynthesis of plant biomass could be examined. As a part of our efforts to discover lysine-modified enzymes, a very promising enzyme was screened for the biotransformation of lysine from a plant biomass into lysophospholipids (LPS) (Kontoyian et al. 2009; Aptroot et al. 2013). The LPS pathway, which is characterized by the formation of a complex lysophospholipid bilayer and the inhibition of hydrolase activity, is attractive for new lysine-modified enzymes. The above-mentioned lysine-modified enzymes are also attractive for the biotransformation of lysine from plant biomass into lysophospholipids (LPS) or biomass into lysophospholipids (PP) by lysine-modified enzymes, and for the biotransformation of lysine from plant biomass into lysophospholipids (PP) by lysine-modified enzymes (Aptroot et al. 2013).

The biosynthesis of lysine in fungi is mainly governed by two primary pathways: the intermediate step, which catalyses the first step catalysed by lysine, and the second step, which catalyses only by lysine. The latter pathway has been mainly studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has been able to generate lysine-modified lysophospholipids from lysine by the intermediate steps (Lepelletier et al. 2002). The biosynthesis of lysine and its derivatives in S. cerevisiae is well known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the biosynthesis of a-amylase (a-catenin) and ß-amylase (ß-catenin) in S. cerevisiae is well known in Aspergillus niger and A. parasiticus (Aptroot et al. 2013).

In the present work, the biosynthesis of lysine and a-amylase in the biosynthesis of a-amylase, a-catenin, from lysine was studied.


## Methods
For the construction of pCAMBIA-INR-32, the enzymes were used, as described in [15. The first reaction of the enzyme was performed using the system of n-hexadecanamide (M-H_2O) as the substrate. The second reaction was performed using a commercial method, using N-hexadecanamide as the substrate. The reaction mixture contained: (1) p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNP)-1-methylene chloride (pNPH), (2) n-hexadecanamide (M-H_2O) and (3) ß-d-N-hexadecanamide (M-H_2O) [29]. The reaction mixture was heated at 100°C for 2 h and then cooled down to 35°C. The reaction was completed by adding 3 M sodium acetate, 2 M sodium bicarbonate and 1 M HCl, then the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 55°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M sodium hydroxide and 2 M NaOH. The reaction mixture was heated at 60°C for 15 min and then cooled down to 40°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M HCl and 2 M NaOH. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M NaOH and 2 M NaOH. The pellet was collected, washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 40°C. The dried pellet was weighed.

The fragments of pBH-BUB-3, pBH-BUB-8 and pBH-BUB-10 were separated and the crude enzyme product was purified by silica gel column chromatography. The crude product was concentrated and then stored at 4°C until further use. The purified enzyme product was subjected to HPLC and HPLC-MS analysis to ensure purity.

4.2. Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Analysis
The crude product was extracted using a mixture of hexane, dichloromethane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated and the dry residue was transferred to a clean glass tube. The sample was dried under reduced pressure, then subjected to GC-MS analysis and GC-MS analysis of the crude product was performed as described in [30]. The crude product was identified by GC-MS analysis.

Differentially expressed proteins
Analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis using GO-term prediction tool (Chang et al., 2014) identified high similarity between the phospholipids P-type ATPase and the phospholipid E4-type phosphatase (Table 1). The enrichment of the phospholipids P-type ATPase for all the GO terms was confirmed by enrichment analysis (Table S1). The GO terms related to phosphate-modification (e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphatase), cytosolic phosphatase, and the phosphatase superfamily were significantly enriched in the GO term analysis (Table 1). The GO terms related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, phosphatidylserine phosphatase), DNA replication (e.g., DNA replication and repair), and nucleotide metabolism (e.g., nucleotide sugar metabolism) were significantly enriched in the GO term analysis. The GO terms related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, phosphatidylserine phosphatase), nucleotide metabolism (e.g., nucleotide sugar metabolism), and DNA replication and repair were significantly enriched in the GO term analysis (Table 1).

Differentially expressed proteins
A total of 14 genes were differentially expressed between the P-type ATPase and the phospholipid E4-type phosphatase. Of these, 14 were differentially expressed between the P-type ATPase and the phosphatase superfamily. In the GO terms related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, phosphatidylserine phosphatase), nucleotide metabolism (e.g., nucleotide sugar metabolism), and DNA replication and repair, these genes were significantly enriched (Table 1). The GO terms related to amino acid metabolism (e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, phosphatidylserine phosphatase), nucleotide metabolism (e.g., nucleotide sugar metabolism), nucleotide modification (e.g.


## Discussion
The up-regulation of genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis in response to low pH and pH-mediated carbon starvation suggests that . expansum can utilize carbon as a carbon source. The cellulose biosynthetic pathway is highly conserved among fungi, plants, and animals and is also conserved in plants and animals. It is essential for the fungal cell wall as the carbon source for the fungal growth [30], [31]. The carbon metabolism in the fungal cell wall is highly conserved among fungi and was also found to be highly conserved in Aspergillus niger [32]. In addition, a gene encoding a putative homolog of the glycolytic pathway, a key enzyme in the glycolysis of hemicellulose, was up-regulated in P. expansum. This pathway is essential for fungal cell wall biodegradation. Therefore, P. expansum must be able to synthesize a variety of sugars to produce cellulose and cellulose-derived secondary metabolites.

P. expansum strains grown in the presence of G. mellonella had a significantly higher rate of cellulose-producing than the control strain (Table 3). In contrast to the non-acid-fast strain, P. expansum strains grown in the presence of G. mellonella had a significantly higher rate of cellulose-producing than the control strain (Table 3). This suggests that P. expansum can utilize carbon as a carbon source, and could thus potentially utilize carbon from glycolysis.

The inability of P. expansum to synthesize cellulose was associated with the high cellulose-producing capacity of the biomass. The biomass of P. expansum was able to assimilate over 200 g/L of cellulose, which is approximately one-third of the concentration required for biosynthesis of glucose and glucose-3-phosphate. In the absence of the glucose-3-phosphate pathway, the fungal cell wall was severely damaged and the fungus could not assimilate this carbon source. As a result, P. expansum grew well in the presence of glucose and glucose-3-phosphate.

In summary, this study shows that P. expansum can utilize carbon as a carbon source to produce secondary metabolites, which are required for fungal cell wall biodegradation.
