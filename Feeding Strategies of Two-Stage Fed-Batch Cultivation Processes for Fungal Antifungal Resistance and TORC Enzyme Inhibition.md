## Methods
glutinis and for the generation of mutants of the glutathione mutants in the yeasts [55. For the IS method, we used a semi-flexible, semi-natural medium. For the TORC assay, we used 1% of starch, 0.25% of glycerol, and 0.2% of distilled water. For the production of the carboxylic acid, we used 2% of ethanol and 0.5% of chloramphenicol. For the production of the lipase, we used 2% of ethanol and 0.4% of glycerol. For the determination of the inhibitory effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on the inhibition of fungicidal activities, we used 1% of potassium phosphate, 0.5% of bicarbonate, and 0.5% of ammonium sulfate. The spectrophotometric data were obtained on an ELISA reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at a wavelength of 540 nm and a flow rate of 1 mL/min.

For the growth inhibition assays, we used a semi-flexible, semi-natural medium. For the growth inhibition assays, we used 2% of glucose, 0.5% of peptone, 0.5% of yeast extract, and 0.2% of glucose. For the cell-permeability assay, we used a semi-flexible, semi-natural medium. For the cell-permeability assay, we used 1% of yeast extract, 0.5% of peptone, 0.5% of yeast extract, and 0.2% of glucose. For the cell-permeability assay, we used 2% of yeast extract, 0.5% of peptone, 0.5% of yeast extract, and 0.2% of glucose.

A second IS method for the generation of mutants of the glutathione mutants was used to assess the drug resistance of the yeasts. We used the same medium as above, but we used 1% of ethanol and 0.1% of glycerol. We used an oil-immersion-system for the first IS assay. We used the same medium as above, but we used 1% of ethanol and 0.1% of glycerol.


## Results
The fungal biomass was collected at the end of the incubation period, and the amount of DNA recovered from the culture was used to construct a library for further analysi. The DNA library was prepared using primers DATP-FLAG-TCR, DATP-FLAG-TLR, and FK506. These primers were designed to be specific for the DNA isolated from the yeast cultures obtained in two-stage dual-stage cultivation process (Figure 1). Both primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the DNA fragment from the wild-type strain. These primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the mutant strain. The DATP-FLAG-TCR primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the wild-type strain. The FK506 primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the mutant strain. The DATP-FLAG-TLR primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the wild-type strain. The PCR primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the wild-type strain. The primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the mutant strain. These primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment of the wild-type strain. The control DNA was used as the negative control (Figure 1).

The second stage of the dual-stage dual-stage cultivation process using yeast and yeast-derived mammalian cells was first followed by a second stage of the cultivation with mammalian cells. The fungal biomass was collected at the end of the incubation period, and the amount of DNA recovered from the culture was used to construct a library for further analysis. The DNA library was prepared using primers DATP-FLAG-TCR, DATP-FLAG-TLR, and FK506. These primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment of the wild-type strain. These primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment of the mutant strain. The DATP-FLAG-TLR primers were designed to amplify the amplified fragment of the amplified fragment from the mutant strain.


## Discussion
There is increasing evidence that fungi are the most common cause of invasive fungal disease, which is due to the overexpression of the MAPK, TOR, and the . albicans MAPK pathway in the brain and causing brain fungal infections. In addition to the fungi, other pathogenic microorganisms, such as C. neoformans, which has an important role in antifungal immunity and immune responses, may also cause fungal infections. C. neoformans is a member of the Ascomycota and other basidiomycetes, which is a member of the order Ophiostomatoidae. The strains of the order Ophiostomatoidae are classified into three families: the order Ophiostomatoidae, the Ophiostomatoidae, and the Ophiostomatoidae. It has been reported that the order Ophiostomatoidae, the Ophiostomatoidae, and the Ophiostomatoidae are pathogenic, but this order is also known to be a risk factor for infection in patients with underlying conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and organ transplants [7,28]. In addition to the Ophiostomatoidae, the Ophiostomatoidae are also known to be pathogenic in humans, causing disease in the lungs, spleens, and other tissues [29,30]. These fungi have also been shown to be virulence factors, and their ability to cause disease is due to their ability to utilize the available carbon source. Therefore, the Ophiostomatoidae may play an important role in the pathogenic ability of these fungi in humans.

In our study, the fungicides, including azole, chlorpromazine, and chloracetic acid, caused severe fungal infections in three different dosages, with no fungal burden in animals. However, fungal infection was observed in the kidneys of animals with no fungal burden. This is the first report of the presence of fungal infections in animals and humans. In addition to the fungicides, we observed the presence of fungi and yeast in kidneys of animals. However, this is the first report of fungal infections in kidneys of humans.
