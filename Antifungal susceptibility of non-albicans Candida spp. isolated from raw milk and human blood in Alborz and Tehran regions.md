## Abstract
In the laboratory, the influence of iron on the proteome of murine peritoneal macrophages was investigated. The phagocytosis activity of the macrophages was assessed by measuring the activity of antibodies against iron. The uptake of iron from peripheral blood or urine of infected and wild-type mice by Giemsa, B, or C lymphocytes was assessed using a surface plasmon resonance assay. The proteome was analysed using bioinformatics and the galactomannanase activity assay. The gene expression of members of the Th17/22 superfamily was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The interaction between macrophages infected with Th17 cells and non-Th17 cells was analyzed by checkerboard assay. The in vitro activity of iron chelation antigens against Th17 cells was studied. The iron chelator-binding protein complex ÃŸ-D-galactofuranose (DF-AFN) was identified as a direct target for the iron chelator, ferricrocin and copperase.


## Introduction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a complex lung disease characterized by the accumulation of air in the airways, often with obstructive airways (1). COPD can be diagnosed by various means, including the histological and microbiological examination, chest X-ray, bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Various chest X-ray assays are commercially available, and the chest X-ray assays are usually sensitive and specific for bacteria (2, 3). The bronchoalveolar lavage is a low-dose, noncontrast-based, bronchoalveolar lavage that can be performed at a routine level. It is also considered as the most sensitive and specific X-ray, because it is designed to detect bacteria (4).

The bronchoalveolar lavage is usually obtained by resection, and its sensitivity and specificity are excellent (5). The sensitivity of the bronchoalveolar lavage is higher than that of the bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL), because it is obtained through a lower pressure of aspiration. The BAL is obtained by centrifugation, and the centrifugation is performed by a tube located above the waterlogged lavage fluid. The sensitivity of the BAL is approximately 90%.


## Methods
Morphology
Photographs were taken from different zones of the country. The spore samples were placed in clear plastic bags and kept at room temperature. Prior to the experiment, the spore surface was washed with water and the materials were dried. The dried spores were weighed and the number of spores in a spore sample was determined.

The spore morphology was recorded after 48 h of incubation at room temperature. The observations were made on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a SPOT CCD camera and software. The details of the measurements are shown in the figure legends.

The spore measurements were performed in triplicate, and the results were recorded in the form of color charts.

## Results
. cerevisiae and C. albicans were most susceptible to all of the three razidiazidi antifungal agents tested, and a high number of isolates were susceptible to both AgNPs and AgNPs + AgNPs [Table 2].

Among the four strains isolated from raw milk, three strains were selected as new agents. Three of these strains (AgNPs + AgNPs) had a strong susceptibility to AgNPs, the other two were resistant to AgNPs + AgNPs, and AgNPs were more active than AgNPs + AgNPs. These data suggest that AgNPs are better than AgNPs, but the affinity between AgNPs and AgNPs is lower than in AgNPs.

In addition to susceptibility to AgNPs and AgNPs + AgNPs, the other Candida spp. isolates isolated from raw milk were also susceptible to AgNPs + AgNPs. Four Candida spp. were resistant to AgNPs + AgNPs, whereas AgNPs + AgNPs were more active. These data suggest that AgNPs and AgNPs are the most efficacious agents to induce plant tolerance in Candida spp.

The AgNPs are active against the most resistant Candida spp. strains
The antifungal activity of AgNPs against most Candida spp. strains was assessed against the most susceptible Candida spp. strains tested. For each Candida spp. strain, all tested AgNPs were tested with agarose beads. As shown in Table 3, AgNPs were less active than AgNPs + AgNPs, and AgNPs + AgNPs were more active than AgNPs + AgNPs.

The antifungal activity of AgNPs against all Candida spp. strains was assessed by the concentration of AgNPs + AgNPs, the concentration of AgNPs + AgNPs, the concentration of AgNPs + AgNPs, and the concentration of AgNPs + AgNPs.


## Discussion
This study shows that exposure to such pathogens in raw milk of Iranian children is associated with an increased susceptibility to these pathogens and an increase in . neoformans mortality. This might be due to the use of raw milk as a source of milk in our setting.

According to some studies, C. albicans is the most prevalent species in Iranian raw milk. In this study, C. albicans was the second most prevalent species in raw milk samples of Iranian children. C. albicans is an invasive yeast which has emerged in Iranian children. It has been reported in Iranian raw milk from 1984 to 2005. This fungus has been associated with various diseases such as otitis media, skin and nasal infections, and among others [25]. It is also reported in raw milk from Kuwait [26].

According to some studies, C. albicans has been found in human blood and genital milk samples of Iranian children and adults [27], while in human blood samples from children and adults, C. albicans was found in feces of Iranian children [28]. C. albicans is the most prevalent species in raw milk of Iranian children and adults [29]. In this study, C. albicans was the second most frequent species in the human milk samples of Iranian children. In this study, C. albicans was the second most frequent species in the human milk samples of Iranian children. This may be due to the use of raw milk as a source of raw milk in our setting.

The isolation of C. neoformans was reported in human blood samples from Iranian children [30]. In this study, C. neoformans was the second most common species in human blood samples from Iranian children. This might be due to the use of raw milk as a source of raw milk in our setting.

The association of C. neoformans with HIV infection is very common. In this study, it was the third most common species of human with HIV infection. This could be due to the use of raw milk as a source of raw milk in our setting.

In this study, C. neoformans was the third most common species of human with HIV infection. This might be due to the use of raw milk as a source of raw milk in our setting.
