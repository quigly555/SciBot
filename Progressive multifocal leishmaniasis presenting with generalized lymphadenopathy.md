## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger encounters carbon starvation in nature during several important industrial processes. Developing new strategies to survive in this harsh environmental niche, as well as the enormous available resources for scale-up experiments, is a prerequisite for finding novel ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. However, the standard of carbonation is still somewhat rusty, so improvement of this level is necessary. In this study, we used a novel medium consisting of 1.5% glycerol and 0.5% cornigest, which has been widely used in industrial microbiology. This mode of carbonization reduced the carbon dioxide emissions by a factor of over 10 to 2 orders of magnitude over the medium, and provided the sphingolipid, as well as the sphingosine secreted in response to the reduction of CO2, an antagonist. The results obtained are evidence of how a facile carbon fixation strategy can enhance survival of A. niger, as well as the specificity of the mode of carbonization, and suggest that this strategy can be used to expand the use of biocontrol agents for industrial applications.

Aspergillus niger is a major industrial fungus. Increasingly resistant to carbon dioxide, and an increase in resistance to growing in excess concentrations of CO2 has become a serious global concern.


## Introduction
Microorganisms have been used as food and feed since antiquity. They are regarded as one of the most important food and feed in the world. The main functional activities carried out by microorganisms include fermentation, biosynthesis of bioactive compounds, fermentation, detoxification, degradation and growth [1,2,3]. With the increasing of world population, the need for more abundant and more valuable natural resources, natural products, and consumable oils, the use of microbes as feed sources has increased enormously. The use of microbial oils as food is under way due to the development of microbial biofilms.

The role of microbial oils in food production is also to be found in the production of flavors and aromas, flavors and fragrances, nutraceutical and fragrance products, spices, meats, dairy products, fermented foods, and raw materials [4,5,6].

The ability of microbial oils to modify the taste of food and in the production of food products is also a factor of production, as well as in food industry, which has been reviewed in the past [7]. The essential oils, which are mainly obtained from yeast and filamentous fungi, are obtained by fermentation of the most important plant pathogen, Aspergillus species, and are fermented by the accumulation of two or more strains, i.e., A. flavus and A. niger, or a combination of these two species [8]. The production of essential oils depends on the microorganisms that inhabit the food, the metabolites that they produce, and the product substances produced by these microorganisms [9].

## Methods

A total of 39 patients who were referred to the hospital between January 2006 and June 2009 were enrolled into the stud. The primary outcomes of interest were HIV infection, fungal burden and outcomes of disseminated cryptococcosis. Data on fungal burden and fungal load on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected retrospectively, and the CSF was performed by lumbar puncture in the exclusion of patients with suspicion of CNS infection. HIV load was not reported. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the University Hospital, Hefei, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal studies were approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number A016-12-01.

Ethics statement
This study was conducted with the approval number of the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number A016-12-01. This study did not involve endangered or protected species.

All the animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. The procedures utilized for the animal experiments were approved by the IACUC (protocol number 03-02-08) and the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number 01-04-09).

Growth and morphology of C. gattii in liquid culture
All the mycelial colonies obtained from YPD liquid cultures were picked up and cultured in YPD medium at 30°C for 48 h. Mycelia were harvested, washed, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were lyzed in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. The frozen cell suspension was subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% agarose gel and stained with uranyl acetate (100 µl/ml), and the samples were examined by light microscopy.

For DNA extraction, the mycelial cells were harvested, washed, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.


## Results

Concerning the diagnosis of advanced multifocal leishmaniasis, it was diagnosed by assessing the score of the IM-positive serum albumin (SFA), which was used to determine the CD4+ T-cell coun. The blood CD4+ T-cell count was below the limit of detection in 1 of the 2 patients. The diagnosis of advanced multifocal leishmaniasis was established by examination of the thrombocytopenia, CSF protein, CSF neutrophils, and neutrophils in the blood. The diagnosis was made by performing a blood culture of the patient. The patient was admitted to a central venous catheter (CVC) with CSF for blood culture. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) for blood culture and was given fluconazole for more than 2 days. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a positive blood culture (positive CSF sample) and was referred to the hospital for further testing.

Inspections of clinical features of advanced multifocal leishmaniasis
The patient was initially thought to be at a high risk of developing advanced multifocal leishmaniasis. He was initially positive for the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6, but after a 5-day course of antifungal agents, he developed advanced multifocal leishmaniasis, with a score of 17.5 (Table 3). He was taking posaconazole and was taking fluconazole as well as voriconazole as the initial diagnosis of advanced multifocal leishmaniasis. The patient was suspected of having a fungal infection and had a CD4+ T-cell count of >400 cells/µL. The patient was admitted to a central venous catheter (CVC) for blood culture and was taken to the ICU for further testing. The patient was admitted to the ICU for antifungal therapy, and was subsequently transferred to a CSF culture for further testing.

Inspections of clinical features of advanced multifocal leishmaniasis
The patient was initially suspected to be having a glomerulopathy. He was initially diagnosed with glomerulopathy in the early time point (8 weeks after admission) and was subsequently transferred to a CSF culture for further testing.


## Discussion
T cell-mediated immune responses, however, are poorly understood [34. Although T cells are activated by IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF, and IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a are also activated, the former are not sufficient to suppress the latter [35]. This is important in T cell response to opportunistic infection because IFN-<U+03B3> alone can cause an immune response to IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a to IFN-<U+03B3> [36]. The patients with FLC-treated T cell lymphoma have previously been reported to have impaired T cell responses to IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a [37], but the patients were not as impaired as patients with FLC-treated lymphoma. The patients with FLC-treated lymphoma also had increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-13, IL-4, and IL-13, compared to the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. IL-13 was significantly upregulated in the T cell population when T cell-treated lymphoma was compared to T cell-treated lymphoma, and the upregulation was found to be increased in the T cell population. The patients with T cell-treated lymphoma had a higher level of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-<U+03B3> compared to patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. IL-13 was increased in the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma compared to patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. TNF-a was increased in the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma compared to patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. However, the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma had an increased level of TNF-a compared to the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. Patients with T cell-treated lymphoma had increased levels of IL-10 compared to the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma. However, the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma had an increased level of IFN-<U+03B3> compared to the patients with T cell-treated lymphoma.
