## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. The recent emergence of fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Parvoviruses has created an urgent need for new antifungal agents to counter their negative effect. Cryptococcus neoformans is a life-threatening human fungal pathogen that is currently being rapidly cleared from hospital environments. The global expansion of drug resistance coupled with the rising AIDS pandemic and increasing resistance to the available drugs makes the development of novel antifungal strategies an important priority. Here, we present a review of the current antifungal arsenal and propose the future strategy for antifungal resistance. In spite of the advances in antifungal drug design in recent years, the current antifungal arsenal remains a challenge to be solved. Novel antifungal strategies must be developed to overcome the inherent and often overwhelming resistance of these fungal pathogens against the tested antifungal drugs. The development of new antifungal strategies requires the timely identification of the most promising drug targets and the immediate selection of well-designed compounds to improve their tolerability. The development of new antifungal agents should increase the current antifungal resistance of fungal pathogens and should result in a decrease in the overall number of life-threatening fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction
Proteins are a powerful source of functional genetic information, and they can be divided in two broad categories: exosomes and endosomes. The exosome is composed of a lipid bilayer of a-helical membranes and contains cysteine residues and proteins. The endosomal membranes are enriched in proteins, with exosomes containing proteins that are thought to be originated from the external environment. These membranes can be of various sizes, and therefore, can be characterized by their composition. In addition, exosomes can be synthesized by membrane fusion or by a variety of transporters and endosomal transporters. Endosomes can be secreted or non-exchangeable. Endosomes can be released by cells into the extracellular space. Non-exchangeable exosomes can be secreted or released by cells into the extracellular space. In fungi, the two main secreted processes are cell-cell fusion and cell-endosome association [1]. In fungi, secretory exosomes are involved in pathogenicity [2,3]. Although the role of secreted proteins in fungal growth and virulence are well known, the secretome is also important in fungal pathogenicity. In a recent review, Exosome-related genes have been identified in fungi and fungal pathogens, and the secretomes of some fungi are reviewed. This review will focus on the role of Exosomes in fungal growth and virulence.


## Methods
Cells were pelleted and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% (vol/vol) TFA and 1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) to give a final concentration of .5 × 10^4/ml. Cell density was determined by using a spectrophotometer (Biotek). Non-triton-bromocyanine (TCNB) was added to the medium to maintain a constant pH of 7.0. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium and stained with calcofluor white (CFW) to visualize intracellular vesicles (IPCs). An IPC was defined as a fluorescence intensity less than or equal to that of the untreated control.

For staining of extracellular vesicles with calcofluor white, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v). After staining with calcofluor white, the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and stained with DAPI to visualize intracellular vesicles (ICVs).

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C, washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and stained with DAPI.

Intracellular vesicle staining
The staining protocol was based on the methodology described by Geisler et al. [17]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in medium without Calcofluor White (0.


## Results
oryzae extracellular vesicles were excised from the infected (WT) and WT infected (MGG) mouse lungs, stained with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and visualized with an antibody anti-GFP and a Ni^2+-coated SDS-Sepharose bead. M. oryzae extracellular vesicles were loaded onto the SDS-Sepharose beads and stained with an antibody against GFP. The dye was dispersed in the extracellular vesicles (Figure 5A, lanes 5-7) with the concentration of 10 ng/ml (Figure 5B, lane 8). In contrast, no extracellular vesicles were detected in the WT lungs (Figure 5C, lanes 3-6). In contrast, all WT and MGG mice showed a clear round-shaped vesicle, with the two major components showing the same appearance as the WT vesicle (Figure 5D, lanes 7-9).

The extracellular vesicles were detected in the WT lung by time-lapse microscopy, and the infected WT and MGG mice also presented the same round-shaped vesicles. However, the WT and MGG mice presented a more round shape, and the infected MGG mice presented more round vesicles (Figure 5E). In contrast, the WT and MGG mice presented a distinct round-shaped vesicle, which appeared to be round-shaped in M. oryzae, with a central column (Figure 5F).

In contrast to the WT and MGG mice, the infected MGG and MGG mice presented the WT and MGG virus particles (Figure 5H). We further evaluated the surface morphology of the infected MGG and MGG virus particles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using the MGG virus particles as a reference (Figure 5I). MGG virus particles showed a uniform distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 5J). MGG virus particles also appeared to be distributed in the cytosol (Figure 5K), and they were also distributed in the perivascular space (Figure 5L). The distribution of MGG virus particles in the cytoplasm was more distinct in the MGG infected mice, as MGG virus particles appeared to be spread throughout the perivascular space (Figure 5K).


## Discussion
It is likely that high triterpenes concentration can provide enough effect to overcome the cells membrane perturbation, thus providing a stronger adhesive effec. It is important to note that the extract from the bacterial strain used in the present study was metabolically active only against V_max of 1,450, a concentration of vesicles that has been reported to be over 1,000 times higher than that observed for vesicles from other bacteria [50].

The cell wall is composed of a complex mixture of mainly monosaccharides, such as glucuronic acid, mannitol, and mannitol; and a complex mixture of glycolic acid and ethanol; and a complex mixture of glycolipids and terpenes. It is important to note that the structure of the cell wall of R. toruloides is very similar to that of the other two bacteria, since there is no obvious difference in the structure of the cell wall between these two bacterial strains. The cell wall of the bacterial strain could be more similar to that of the R. toruloides strain, since the cell wall is composed of the cell wall glycolipids and ethanol. This could explain the higher vesicle sizes and the higher activity of the extract from the bacterial strain against V_max of 1,450.

In the current study, the extract was effective against V_max of 25 µg/mL and V_max of 1,000 µg/mL, respectively, against E. coli. These results suggest that the extraction of triterpenes from the extracellular vesicles in R. toruloides may be useful in the treatment of bacterial infection. The activity of extract against E. coli was not detected by HPLC-MS in the present study. The extract showed activity against E. coli but activity against other bacteria was lower.

In a previous study, the extract from the E. coli strain used in the present study showed activity against S. aureus ATCC 25930 and C. jejuni ATCC 4978. The extract showed activity against S. aureus ATCC 25930, C. jejuni ATCC 4978, and E. coli. The extract showed activity against E. coli but activity against other bacteria was lower.
