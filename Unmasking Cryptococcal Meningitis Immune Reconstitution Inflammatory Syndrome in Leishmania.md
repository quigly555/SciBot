## Abstract
The ability of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans to undergo co-receptor -independent growth under iron-limitation regimes makes it an attractive pathogen for studies of antiviral and antifungal drug resistance. However, the exact mechanisms involved in growth as a “opportunistic” fungal pathogen are largely unknown. We have previously reported that C. neoformans adheres to iron-limiting nutrient deprivation regimes while simultaneously growing as a opportunistic pathogen. Here we show that the adaption of C. neoformans to low nutrient conditions is dependent on both the interaction with iron (FeCl3) and its interaction with a low-membrane Fe transporter. The adaption of FeCl3-deficient cells to iron starvation was also investigated. We observed that the virulence of C. neoformans was affected by the presence of a low-membrane FeCl3, which was also dependent on a low-FeCl3. The absence of the low-FeCl3 also abrogated the antiviral ability of the fungus. Furthermore, our data suggest that the adaption of FeCl3-deficient cells to low nutrient conditions may rely on a novel antifungal mechanism involving interaction of an unknown FeCl3 with the antifungal drug FK506. These data illuminate the molecular mechanism of adaption of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus.


## Introduction
Laccases are enzymes that convert reactive lignin to food grade aromatic compounds. The lignin is the main source of aromatic compounds, such as phenols and aromatic amides. In nature, they are abundant in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments. They are the second most abundant lignin in the world after wood, and they play a role in all processes that take place within the bio-chemical processes. They are also present in many materials such as paints, fabric, and textile fibers. Among these materials, plastics and polyesters are the most abundant and the most abundant of all aromatic compounds, with a billion tons per year worldwide (www.e-baker.org). Laccases are among the most abundant enzymes that are highly biotechnologically and industrially relevant.


## Methods

In this study, we excluded patients with clinical features of pulmonary aspergillosis (lung abscess, bronchus, skin rash, pleural effusion, and hyperparathyroidism) and those without any of the abov. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, the ethics committee of the University Hospital, and the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Nablus, and the informed consent was obtained from all the patients. All patients were followed up for at least 2 months.

2.2. Analysis of Cryptococcal Meningitis
The number of Cryptococcus neoformans in each patient was determined by a haemocytometer and the IC50 (IR_CPM) value. The haemocytometer and the IC50 were considered as negative values. The IC50 value of each patient was calculated as follows: IC50 value = IC50 value- IC50 value [10].

2.3. Antimicrobial Agents
A. baumannii ATCC 25923 and A. terbinae ATCC 90028 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and clinical isolate of Meningitis (M-1), respectively. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital, the University Hospital of Nablus, and the ethical committee of the University Hospital of Nablus, and the use of the ATCC plates was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [11].

2.4. Antimicrobial Agents
A. baumannii was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 28°C for 24 hours. The fungal colonies were then scraped from the SDA plates, which were then inoculated with 10^7 CFU of M. baumannii and then cultured for 24 hours at 28°C. The fungal cells were counted and the MIC values of the tested compounds were determined. The MIC value of the tested compound was defined as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that prevented fungal growth.

2.5. Antimicrobial Chemicals
Two control organisms, C.


## Results
Identification of N. aculeans bZIP-b-regulated proteins
To identify putative N. aculeans bZIP-b-regulated proteins, we performed a BLASTP search of the N. aculeans genome sequence (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using a collection of putative bZIP-b-regulated proteins (named NBD) previously identified in the B. dermatitidis genome. The NBDs were identified using a BLASTP search using a previously identified BLASTP search with the NBDs, as well as using the known and highly conserved domains of N. aculeans (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and S. cerevisiae (http://www.mirbase.org) as queries. The NBDs were clustered using a V-ATPase domain and BLASTP hits against the predicted NBD proteins. Of the NBDs, the NBD proteins of the B. dermatitidis genome (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were the most abundant (Table 1, Fig 1). The NBDs were also identified in the B. dermatitidis genome (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the B. dermatitidis bZIP-b-regulatory protein (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/B.dbl.


## Discussion
This finding is similar to that described in a previous study in a model of cryptococcosis [16], and may be due to a lack of response of immune cells to this infection, as has been seen in previous studies [16. The absence of protection to Leishmania infection in the absence of Leishmania-specific CD4^+ T cells may reflect the inability of Leishmania to kill macrophages by the action of CD4^+ T cell-mediated killing [16].

Fungi are a major source of infectious fungal infections in humans [27]-[29]. Furthermore, these fungi are a major cause of AIDS in humans [30], [31]. This study demonstrates that fungi in the human host are the most abundant fungal pathogen. Fungal detection in the blood and mucosal surfaces of mice infected with L. amazonensis strain E3 was not detected in the blood or mucosal surfaces of mice. These results demonstrate that leishmaniasis is a primary fungal infection in humans, and that the fungal burden is likely to be a consequence of the innate immune responses generated by the host. This study is the first to demonstrate that the fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with L. amazonensis strain E3 was significantly higher than that of mice infected with other leishmaniasis-associated strains, including L. donovani, L. braziliensis, L. major, L. braziliensis, and L. major, and that L. amazonensis was the most frequently found fungal pathogen in mice. This result may reflect the complex interaction between the innate immune system and the opportunistic fungal infection.

The infection process is most similar to that in other human infections, such as central nervous system infections and disseminated infection in the brain [32], [33]. L. amazonensis infection is most similar to that in humans, with lung infection of L. major, which is more similar to that in mice. L. major infection in the lungs is similar to that in mice, but the disease itself is more similar to that in mice. This may reflect the greater ability of L. major to cause disease and the immunologic and pathological responses in lung tissue.

The L. amazonensis strain was resistant to phagocytosis and was able to invade the lung tissue of mice in the absence of lung tissue.
