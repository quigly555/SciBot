## Abstract
Infection with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic pulmonary aspergillosis to multisystem organ failure and death. The fungal cell wall is a dynamic structure that provides the outermost layers with structural integrity and protection from the elements. Fungal cell walls are essential for multiple cellular functions, and the cell wall is the first point of contact between the host and the fungus. The important role that the cell wall plays during infection is illustrated in the recent review by two new studies. First, the importance of melanin in virulence was demonstrated, demonstrating that the melanin molecule is required for the survival and morphogenesis of A. fumigatus in a murine model of aspergillosis. Second, the use of biosurfactants that target the cell wall had an effect on the interaction with A. fumigatus. In summary, the current review focuses on how to exploit the indispensable role of the cell wall and shed new light on how the A. fumigatus pathogen is able to survive in a host that esteems fungal pathogens.


## Introduction
 2017; Sobol and Sobol, 2017. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that the host immune system’s response against Cryptococcus neoformans is also affected by C. neoformans, and that the activation of this immune response is associated with the phagocytic activity of the innate immune cells.

We have previously demonstrated that C. neoformans is able to modulate the host immune response against C. neoformans and that these effects are associated with the activation of macrophage and neutrophil-mediated killing mechanisms (Yousef et al., 2017). We have also demonstrated that C. neoformans modulates host immune responses by modulating macrophage polarization, which is a critical component of the innate immune response against C. neoformans (Garcia-Bache et al., 2016). Recently, it was demonstrated that phagocytosis of C. neoformans is dependent on the complement system (Garcia-Bache et al., 2016). However, a major drawback of these studies is that they focus on the interaction of C. neoformans with the macrophage. In fact, the phagocytic activity of macrophages is not affected by the presence of C. neoformans. Indeed, upon phagocytosis by macrophages, C. neoformans is expelled from the phagolysosome and does not cause a macrophage-independent phenotype. However, upon macrophage phagocytosis, C. neoformans does not cause a macrophage-independent phenotype. Moreover, C. neoformans does not cause a macrophage-independent phenotype when the phagocytosed C. neoformans is sequestered within a vacuole, a feature that is absent in the macrophage-dependent phenotype (Garcia-Bache et al., 2016). The macrophage-dependent phenotype observed with macrophage phagocytosis may be due to its sequestration in a vacuole, rather than a phagosome.

The macrophage-dependent phenotype observed with macrophage phagocytosis may be due to the sequestration of the C. neoformans within a vacuole, rather than within a macrophage. For example, the sequestration of the C. neoformans by macrophages is not dependent on the presence of C.


## Methods
albicans strains was evaluated by a previously described method (. albicans ATCC 90028, ATCC 76462). The yeast cells were cultured in 5 mL of Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The supernatant was then collected, and the cell pellet was washed twice with PBS. Then, the cell suspension (1.0 mL) was inoculated on SDB plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h, and the plates were checked every 24 h for Candida albicans growth. The antifungal activity was determined by a previously described method (C. albicans ATCC 90028, ATCC 76462). The yeast cells were cultured in 5 mL of SDB at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The supernatant was then collected, and the cell suspension (1.0 mL) was transferred on a polypropylene filter paper to a 15 mL round bottom flask. The filtrate was collected, and the cell suspension (1.0 mL) was inoculated on SDB plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h, and the Candida albicans growth was recorded.

## Results
The survival rates of the control, BALB/c mice and the two mice infected with . albicans were studied in 24 h. As shown in Fig 1, the mice infected with C. albicans had significantly lower survival rates than those infected with C. neoformans, but not C. albicans alone. In contrast, the mice infected with C. neoformans and C. albicans alone had significantly higher survival rates than the controls (Fig 1C).

C. neoformans is capable of causing infections in humans and animals. In order to test the ability of the two compounds to improve the virulence of C. neoformans in the host, the mice were infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone. The survival rate of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone was examined in 24 h. As shown in Fig 2, the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone had significantly higher survival rates than the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone, whereas the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone had significantly lower survival rates than the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone.

The in vivo efficacy of the two compounds in C. neoformans infection was evaluated in a murine model of cryptococcal infection. As shown in Fig 3, the survival rate of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone was significantly higher than that of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone, and the survival rates of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone were significantly higher than those of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C. albicans or C. albicans alone. In contrast, the survival rates of the mice infected with C. neoformans, C.


## Discussion
Moreover, an established case of TBM in the setting of TNF-a deficiency has been reported (48.

The clinical manifestations of TBM include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. Most patients present with headache, vomiting, and altered mental status. In our case, it is possible to attribute the symptoms to TBM as the presenting symptoms occurred despite the administration of various treatments.

The presence of lymphadenopathy and lymphopenia in the lymph nodes of the lymph node aspirate was reported by Arruda et al. (48). The lymphadenopathy was the commonest symptom in TBM and was mainly associated with lymphopenia. The lymphopenia and lymphopenia were also present in many other cases in the setting of TBM.

Lymphopenia was reported in a TBM patient, but it was not seen in any other patient.

Hyperintense proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-2, and IL-13) and Th1 cytokines (IL-17, IL-13, and IL-4) were described as important mediators of the immune response to TBM (49). IL-17 and IL-13 are potent cytokines that suppress tumor cells and can enhance the immune response (50).

IL-17 and IL-13 are the most potent mediators in the induction of Th1 cytokines (51). IL-17 can stimulate and stimulate IL-8 and IL-9 production, respectively, in the T cell response (52). In addition, IL-17 is a key cytokine that plays an important role in the T cell response, as well as in the innate immune response (53). The T cell response plays a crucial role in the initiation of adaptive immunity in response to infection and in the defense against infection (54).

IL-13 is a potent cytokine that can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-15, IL-18, and TNF-a) and promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, IL-23, and IL-18) (55). IL-17 can induce IL-23R and IL-18R production in the T cells (56). IL-17 can also stimulate and stimulate IL-23R and IL-18R production (57).
