## Abstract
This genome-wide comparative analysis revealed that Paracoccidioides brasiliensis possesses a richer and more complex metabolom. The differences in the PbCwP profile were significant in terms of GC content and amino acid metabolic rates. A total of 3,898 genes were identified with up to 38% similarity between the PbCwP profile and the genome-wide PbCwC profile. The pathway of the PbCwP metabolome was differentially regulated by the three PbCwP metabolism pathways. The PbCwP metabolome was differentially regulated in three pathways associated with fat metabolism: <U+0394>cad4, <U+0394>flp1 and <U+0394>ffh1. The PbCwP metabolome was characterized by quantitative proteomics, identification of differentially regulated subsets and characterization of particular proteolipids. The PbCwP transcriptome data are useful for dissecting the underlying metabolism and providing an integrated view of the differential regulation of differentially regulated pathways by the PbCwP metabolome.

Proteome profiling of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, P. brasiliensis, P. oleae and P. oleae exposed the metabolic pathways of the PbCwP and its metabolite,,,, the metabolites to be examined in the future. These metabolite differences among PbCwP and PbCwC may be instrumental in the regulation of other metabolic pathways, especially the metabolism of certain amino acid metabolism pathways.

We report the first fungal genome-wide comparative analysis of the PbCwP and PbCwC. Our results reveal that the PbCwP metabolome is enriched by two pathways and that the PbCwC metabolite-mediated pathway is notably differentially regulated. The PbCwP metabolome is in a unique position relative to other metabolic pathways that provides a unique view of the differential regulation of differentially regulated metabolic pathways. We find similarities in the PbCwP profile and its metabolite profile in more detail and propose that the PbCwP metabolome of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been shaped by metabolic changes and may be undergoing a dynamic transition.


## Introduction
The yeast Rhodotorula glutinis is a dematiaceous, psychrotrophic fungus found in the soil worldwide and has a wide range of antifungal activity [1]. Rhodotorula glutinis has been used as a model host for the study of host-parasite interaction and host-pathogen interactions [2], [3]. This fungus is a biotrophic fungus and can grow on organic matter and is able to overcome environmental stress conditions [4]. The ability to grow on organic matter is a key advantage in the study of host-parasite interactions and host-pathogen interactions [5].

Although this fungus is a heterotrophic fungus, it has the potential to produce spores. This ability is a prerequisite for the growth of this fungus [6]. Several mechanisms allow this fungus to grow on organic matter and it is able to overcome stress conditions. This fungus can cope with various environmental stresses such as high temperature, hypo- and cold, high osmotic pressure, oxidative and nitrosative stresses, and solar ultraviolet radiation [7].

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a family of proteins with seven members (HspA, HspB, HspC, and HspD) found in eukaryotes, plants, animals, protists, and fungi [8]. HspA is a member of the type I heat shock proteins (HSPS) family, and HspB is a member of the type II heat shock proteins (HSPS) family [9]. HspA and HspB are two major types of Hsps, and they share a common ancestor approximately 150 million years ago [10].


## Methods
Briefly, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil (PBS) was prepared by evaporation of Paracoccidioides s. oil from the cellulose acetate solidified with 0.02% Tween 80 at 70°C for 30 min. The compound was dissolved in methanol and filtered with 0.45 µm paper filter. The concentration of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil in the solution was adjusted to 100% with methanol using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The crude extract was kept in the dark at room temperature until use.

Biological activity of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil
For biological activity analysis, three biological replicates were prepared for each isolate. The experiments were performed in triplicate and performed in triplicate in triplicate in the Proteomics Unit of the Botanische Staatssammlung, Oberkochen, Germany. All the assays were conducted in triplicate. The biological activity of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil was measured by the method described by Welch et al. [19]. Briefly, the fungal cells (1 × 10^7) of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolate 1-2 were mixed in a 96-well plate (200 µl) with the oil. The plates were incubated at 35°C for 2 h. Then, 100 µl of 10% (v/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to the wells and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 h. After incubation, the absorbance was measured at 492 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) and the means of absorbance of each replicate were calculated.

Chemical and physiological analysis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil
The colorimetric activity of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil was determined by the method described by Welch et al. [19]. Briefly, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis oil (PBS) was prepared by evaporation of Paracoccidioides sp.


## Results
It is known that these constituents occur in the aliphatic alcohols, among which sodium hydroxide is the most abundant [19. The longknot complex was obtained from the fermentation of strains of C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans with sodium hydroxide and (NH_4) 2% (v/v) BCS.

For the studies, the chemical composition was determined by different methods (Figure 2). In the concentration of the concentration of sodium hydroxide, the low-inhibitory concentration of sodium hydroxide did not affect the growth of the strains, whereas the high-inhibitory concentration of sodium hydroxide (1.7-2.3 M) caused a severe growth inhibition of the strains. The moderate-inhibitory concentration of sodium hydroxide, which was higher than the concentration of BCS, did not affect the growth of the strains. The sodium hydroxide concentration of 1.5 M did not influence the growth of C. neoformans, C. albicans, or C. neoformans with respect to the other studied strains. This concentration was comparable to the concentration of BCS for the same strains. The sodium hydroxide concentration of 1.5 M did not influence the growth of C. neoformans, C. albicans, or C. neoformans with respect to the other studied strains. In addition, the sodium hydroxide concentration of 1.5 M did not affect the growth of the strains. The sodium hydroxide concentration of 1.5 M did not influence the growth of C. neoformans, C. albicans, or C. neoformans with respect to the other studied strains.

From the analysis of the data, the concentration of sodium hydroxide of 1.5 M did not affect the growth of the strains. The sodium hydroxide concentration of 1.5 M did not affect the growth of the strains. The concentration of sodium hydroxide of 1.


## Discussion
The a-pinene has been reported in other plant species and in other enzymes including a-pinene, geranial, and terpenoid [36. In this study, the presence of a-pinene at the reaction was observed in the a-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino, ß-pinene-coumarin, and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions, whereas the presence of a-pinene in the a-pinene-coumarin reaction was observed only in the a-pinene-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin reaction. In the ß-pinene-coumarin reaction, a-pinene was also detected as the main compound, while the a-pinene-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin reactions were only in the ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions.

The two main compounds of the a-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions were found in the a-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions, respectively. The presence of a-pinene in the a-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions was observed in the a-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino and ß-pinene-coumarin-ß-methylamino reactions.
