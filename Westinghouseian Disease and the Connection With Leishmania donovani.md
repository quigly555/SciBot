## Abstract
The genomes of four species of filamentous fungi, Acanthamoeba histolytica, Blastocladiomycotina, Blastospora blakesleei, and Cronartofolius graminis, encode small, heat-resistant and often photosynthetically useful polyketide proteins with diverse, wide-spread domain domains and high energy costs. Here we present the first comparative genomic study of the three filamentous fungi and review the functional and structural features of unique, heat shock, and response surface motifs in these proteins. Functional characterization of particular isoforms may help to explore the properties of these proteins in the context of the metabolic pathways of filamentous fungi, which may contribute to the metabolic versatility of filamentous fungi and their ability to produce high amounts of secondary metabolites.


## Introduction
Toxoplasmosis is a broad term that refers to a wide range of infections caused by oomycetes, such as Aspergillus spp. and fowleri, and the number of patients affected by these infections is increasing. ^1-3 The most common oomycete species include A. niger, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. nidulans and A. nidulant. ^4,5-7 However, there is an increase in the number of non-Aspergillus-like oomycetes that is related to the increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals. ^8,9 In addition, the increased susceptibility of certain oomycetes to certain therapies is associated with an increased incidence of respiratory infections and septicemia. ^8,10

Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic mold that is found in soil and bird excreta, especially in the avian sources such as chickens and guinea pigs. It causes a wide range of diseases in immunocompromised patients. ^9,11 The infection starts with inhalation of conidia from the respiratory tract of an aspergillus. As the conidia adhere to the tissue, they develop into hyphae that invade the respiratory tract and invade the blood vessels. Once the hyphae reach the lung tissue, they differentiate into the pathogenic yeast phase and the nonpathogenic yeast phase.


## Methods
1) [16.

Infection
C. tropicalis isolates were obtained from clinical specimens of cats (n = 6) and dogs (n = 5). For infections, 5- to 6-week-old cats (n = 3) and dogs (n = 2) were infected with 1 × 10^7 C. tropicalis spores by using the spreader method [17]. For the control of infections, the infected cats were kept in plastic cages with clean clothes. The cat in the bottom half of the cage was not allowed access to food and water. The infected cats were euthanized by exposure to sterile water. The infected cats were then kept in plastic cages. The cats were given food and water ad libitum by their owners. The cats in the bottom half of the cage were treated according to the recommendations of the National Veterinary Services of Canada (VPSC) and the VPSC guidelines.

Data Collection
The data collection included the frequency of the infection and the frequency of the infected cats within the first week after euthanasia. The data collection included the frequency of the infection and the frequency of the infected cats within the last week after euthanasia.

Data Collection
The data collection included the number of infected cats per day (in the last 24 h) and the number of cats infected by the next day (in the last 12 h). The data collection included the number of cats infected by the third day after euthanasia (in the last 24 h) and the number of cats infected by the last day (in the last 12 h).

## Results
was found to be associated with a broad range of clinical manifestations including diarrhea, ulcerative skin lesions, dermonecrosis and disseminated systemic candidiasi. Mycobacterium Acinetobacter spp. was isolated from the skin of the larval skin of the larvae, where it appeared as a white, powdery, powdery-like substance (Fig 1). The specimen of the larval skin of the infected larva was a colorless, thin-walled, brownish, cream-colored substance with white-to-cream margin and ascospore cysts (Fig 1A). The ascospores were usually ellipsoidal, oblong, and ellipsoidal with three or four septa (Fig 1A). The ascospores were completely dry, round, and fusiform, with three to four distal septa (Fig 1A). The ascospores were thick-walled, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal, with a median septum of 2.7-3.5 µm. The ascospores were somewhat darker than the skin of the larvae, which was not less than 20 µm in diameter (Fig 1B). The ascospore morphology was confirmed by direct microscopic observation of the development of the germ tube and the onset of the septum. The germ tube of the larvae was germ tube-like, cylindrical, and initially hyaline, then gradually darkening to a dark brown appearance (Fig 1B).

Asexual morph of Acinetobacter spp.
The examination of the colony morphology revealed that the larvae had conidia produced on the surface of the mycelium (Fig 2). On the other hand, the growth of the conidia of Acinetobacter spp. was associated with an unoccupied and circular colony of hyaline, smooth, ellipsoidal to ellipsoidal, smooth, filiform hyphae (Fig 2). The colony was the most abundant color in the larvae, with an abundance of blue, green, and red colonies, which were formed in the lower part of the larval skin (Fig 2). The conidia of Acinetobacter spp. were not found in the larval skin of the larvae, which is not unusual in the case of fungal infections of the larval skin.


## Discussion
The presence of many different fungal isolates in the . avium complex suggests that these fungi may have been previously isolated from mixtures of various fungal isolates.

In this study, we found that the C. albicans complex is part of a network of extracellular and extracellular vesicles produced by macrophages and Dectin-1 to influence cell wall and cell membrane integrity [37]. The virulence of the C. albicans complex has been reported previously by our group [18] and others [45]. We found that the fungal cells in the complex responded differently to different stresses. For instance, C. albicans complex cells were able to survive high-temperature (7,500 °C) and low-temperature (30 °C) stress and were also able to produce arginine (15.64 mg/mL) after 24 hours of incubation in the presence of high concentrations of H_2O_2. The C. albicans complex was able to produce arginine (15.64 mg/mL) after 24 hours of incubation in the presence of H_2O_2. The C. albicans complex produced arginine after 24 hours of incubation in the presence of H_2O_2 [16]. The C. albicans complex has been reported to produce arginine-to-ß-D-glucose (1.65 mg/mL) after 24 hours of incubation in the presence of high concentrations of H_2O_2 [15].

Our results suggested that the C. albicans complex is involved in cell wall integrity and in intracellular replication and release of ROS. Our findings are in agreement with the findings of earlier studies [18] and others [44]. The C. albicans complex produced arginine (15.64 mg/mL) after 24 hours of incubation in the presence of high concentrations of H_2O_2. This arginine is one of the main compounds produced by C. albicans and is important for its antioxidant activity [46]. This compound could play a role in C. albicans cell death and could be a cell wall component that is required for efficient cell wall synthesis in C. albicans.
