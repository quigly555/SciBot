# Skin cryptococcosis in an HIV-infected patient: An experience from a tertiary center
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The fungal capsule of Cryptococcus gattii is composed mainly of several polysaccharides, including galactofuranose and galactofuranose-1-monosaccharides (GFCs). The characteristic structure of this fungal cell is the association with carbohydrate glycans, as well as the elucidation of its carbohydrate composition and carbohydrate-fattyping characteristics. Glucose and galacturonic acid are well-known components of Cryptococcus cell walls, as glucosylceramide is a well-known component in Cryptococcus and Cryptococcus gattii genomes, and glucose and galacturonic acid have been characterized in detail.


## Introduction
The hypercysticercosis subtype of hypersaline phosphoribosuccinate (HP) is a skin disease caused by the hypercapnia and/or hyperkeratosis that are commonly found in hypersaline phosphoribosuccinate (HP) mixed environments. HP is mainly caused by hyperkeratosis, which are known to occur in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments. However, an increasing number of cases are also caused by fungal infections, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, in immunocompromised individuals, as well as by Toxoplasma gondii, AIDS-defining illnesses, and others (Aguirre et al., 2010; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Peñalva et al., 2015). The most common forms of hypercapsular infections in these patients are tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea cruris, tinea crurigena, tinea crurigatum, tinea pedis and tinea capitis, with rare cases of cryptococcus neoformans infection (Mendes et al., 2002; Matur et al., 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2013; Salac et al., 2015; Peñalva et al., 2015; Manchau et al., 2016). In contrast, most hypersaline phosphoribosuccinate-related cases occur in healthy individuals, and the infection is usually asymptomatic (de Oliveira et al., 2015; de Oliveira et al., 2016). In patients with normal immune function, the infection is usually asymptomatic or non-responsive to treatment (de Oliveira et al., 2015).

Cryptococcosis is the most common systemic mycosis caused by Cryptococcus species, which are mainly found in freshwater and marine environments. The infections occur in a range of immunocompromised patients, such as HIV/AIDS patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy or undergoing solid-organ transplants, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy, and individuals on long-term anti-tumor necology (Rodrigues et al., 2013; Monterrat et al., 2014; Sanchez-Perez et al., 2015).


## Methods
The study was approved by the University Committee for Clinical Research (CCLR) of Seoul National University Hospita. All subjects gave informed consent, and written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants prior to the study.

The analysis included data from patients who were treated for HIV-infection at the University Hospital of Seoul. The treatment group consisted of healthy individuals with HIV-infected patients, which included those who were treated for the same disease at the University Hospital of Seoul. The groups of patients included in this study were all HIV-infected patients with CD4 < 100 cells/mm^3, and those without CD4 < 100 cells/mm^3. All HIV-infected patients had a positive culture at least once in the past month. The study was approved by the University Committee for Clinical Research (CCLR) of Seoul National University Hospital, and all participants gave informed consent.

To identify the most common microbiological conditions in HIV-infected patients, the following samples were used: blood, lung, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, skin, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL). All samples were subjected to microbiological procedures and included an environmental sample (bath salts) and specimen collection (riboflavin).

2.1. Isolation and Characterization of Microbial Strains
The microbial strains were isolated from blood, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and blood using the method described by da Silva et al. [28]. For the purpose of this study, the following pathogens were isolated from blood, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and blood: C. albicans ATCC 9002, C. krusei ATCC 6258, C. glabrata ATCC 14803, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. krusei ATCC 6258, C. tropicalis ATCC 90022, and C. glabrata ATCC 90021.

2.2. Microbial Strains of Serotype 1
The yeasts C. albicans ATCC 90022 and C. krusei ATCC 6258 were identified by the screening method.

2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis
The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with the rapid bootstrap method [29].


## Results
Previously, we performed an evaluation of the efficacy of HIV-infected patients in HIV-infected patients (4. In this study, the patient enrolled in the study was HIV-negative with a CD4+ T cell count of 140 cells/mm^3 and received intravenous fluconazole and amphotericin B (Fig 1). He had been infected with HIV for 10 months, and he was a worker in a rural hospital. In this hospital, he had received polyene-prosthetic compound (PEP) treatment (31) and a second episode of oral candidiasis. The first episode was of the highest order of severity with hematologic malignancy, and the second episode was of mild to moderate to severe toxicity with renal involvement. After treatment, he was admitted to the same hospital and received antiretroviral therapy. The first episode was characterized by a slow, transient increase in the first two months of follow-up and a prolonged period of observation. The patient was also taking oral fluconazole (n = 5) and amphotericin B (n = 2) for a period of 10 weeks before starting antiretroviral therapy. The patient was finally admitted to the hospital on a second regimen of fluconazole and amphotericin B therapy and received a second episode of oral candidiasis. The patient was receiving polyene-prosthetic compound (PEP) treatment and was not receiving antiretroviral therapy. He was receiving oral fluconazole and amphotericin B (n = 1) and was receiving a second episode of oral candidiasis. The patient was receiving polyene-prosthetic compound (PEP) treatment and was not receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Histopathologic Findings in the Last 2 years of the Study
We initially identified the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in the first 2 years of the study by our survey. We found that the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients was comparable to that in HIV-uninfected patients. The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients was significantly higher than that in HIV-negative patients (Table 1).


## Discussion
However, in other studies, it was rarely reporte. In this study, we found that Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common Cryptococcus species among HIV-infected patients in South Africa. The study included patients with HIV infection and those with cryptococcal meningitis. In our study, we found that cryptococcal infection was the leading cause of death in South Africa, with a mortality rate of 74%. The study also found that cryptococcal meningitis was the most common cause of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients in South Africa.

We found that the median CD4 count (38 cells/µL) in HIV-infected patients in this study was significantly lower than that in HIV-uninfected patients in the same study. The difference could be due to an increase in CD4 T cell count during HIV infection, which is associated with the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, or because the CD4 counts of the patients in this study were lower than those of the patients in the study. This study had limitations. It was only a small study and this result could not be compared with the results from a large study in HIV-uninfected patients in South Africa. However, we found that the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is similar among HIV-uninfected patients in this study.

A previous study by Schoch et al. [14] reported that the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in South Africa was higher than that in the same study. In this study, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients was 52% than that in the same study. In the same study, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was 32% in the patients in whom Cryptococcus neoformans was the most frequent Cryptococcus species. However, in this study, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was significantly higher than that in a study conducted in HIV-uninfected patients. In the study conducted in HIV-uninfected patients, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was 27% compared to 20% in the study by Schoch et al. [14].
