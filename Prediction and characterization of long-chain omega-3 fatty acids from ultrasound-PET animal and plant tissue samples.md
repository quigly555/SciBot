## Abstract
We report the case of a 62-year-old man with HIV presenting with fever and headache for 9 months. He had been on antitubercular therapy and poorly controlled diabetes, dysglycemia, and hypothyroidism.


## Introduction
Toxoplasmosis is a severe opportunistic fungal infection caused by the Toxoplasma gondii species complex. The disease is considered to be the most common fungal form of toxoplasmosis and the second most common bacterial infection in HIV patients, both among HIV and non-HIV patients (1). There are 2 reported cases, which together represent about half of all cryptococcal meningitis cases and about one-half of all cryptococcal pneumonia cases. In this report, we present a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with cryptococcal pneumonia and a cryptococcal pneumonia. We also describe the clinical features and laboratory findings.


## Methods
We used the dogs for the comparative analyse. For the comparative analysis, the control group was kept in a sterile, -20°C area of the animal house and treated with sterile distilled water. All animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation at different time points post-inoculation. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council.

Morphology
Morphological characteristics of the mice were observed daily and measurements were made on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with a DS-Qi1 camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and a 63×/1.40 oil objective. A Nikon Coolpix 5500 camera was used for stereoscopic imaging, and the Nikon software NIS-elements 4.30 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was used for image analysis. For microscopic observations, the apparatus was sterilized by immersion in 0.1% Tween 80 for 15 min at room temperature. Colony morphology was observed with a Nikon E600 stereoscope, and the animals were observed with a Nikon E600D camera. Pictures were taken with a Nikon DS-Qi1 camera. The colony characteristics were described with reference to a control group.

Isolation and purification of algal phase
The algal phase was isolated from the lung tissue by incubation for 48 h in 20% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde at 25°C. The algal phase was collected and resuspended in 1 ml of sterile, distilled water and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 rpm. The supernatant was then transferred to a sterile tube, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile, distilled water. The algal phase was recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water. The algal phase was collected and subjected to the extraction and purification steps as previously described [13]. Briefly, the algal phase was concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed.


## Results
The total and delta-9 fatty acids were analyzed by the MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF-NMR spectrophotometric analysi. The overall concentration of total and delta-9 fatty acids was 1.13 g/L and 0.98 g/L, respectively. The total and delta-9 fatty acids were the most abundant metabolites in human and plant tissue samples, which had the highest concentration of total and delta-9 fatty acids (0.05 g/L and 0.04 g/L, respectively) and the highest concentration of delta-9 fatty acids (1.63 g/L and 0.03 g/L, respectively). Moreover, all the metabolites except delta-9 fatty acids (1.63 g/L and 0.03 g/L, respectively) showed a significant increase in concentrations of total and delta-9 fatty acids, which was consistent with previous reports on long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from human and plant tissues [16, 18, 21].

2.4. Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial activity of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was determined by the LC-MS/MS method. The enzyme activity assay showed that the total fatty acids from human and plant tissue samples, including delta-9 fatty acids, were able to inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus. The antibiotic activity of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from human and plant tissue samples was highly significant (P<0.05). Among the total fatty acids, delta-9 fatty acids and delta-9 fatty acids showed a significant inhibitory activity against the Gram-positive bacteria and Bacillus anthracis, which was more significant than the activity of delta-9 fatty acids against the bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. The bacterial activity of the delta-9 fatty acids was also higher than the activity of delta-9 fatty acids. These results showed that the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids were able to inhibit the growth of the bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus.

## Discussion

In this study, we have used a combined TEM-FAS-TEM and TEM-FPT-TEM to investigate the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid profile of the tetracycline-induced TNF-a and IL-4-induced TNF-a production in TNF-a, IL-4-induced TNF-a and IL-13-induced TNF-. The results from TEM-FPT-TEM and TEM-FPT-TEM were consistent with previous reports that the presence of a long chain omega-3 fatty acid increases the TNF-a and IL-4-induced TNF-a production in TNF-a- and IL-4-induced TNF-a- and IL-13-induced TNF-a- and IL-13-induced TNF-a- cells [25, 26]. The TEM-FPT-TEM and TEM-FPT-TEM were sensitive to the presence of long chain omega-3 fatty acids and could not differentiate into the TNF-a or IL-4-induced TNF-a and IL-13-induced TNF-a cells. The results of the TEM-FPT-TEM and TEM-FPT-TEM showed that the TNF-a and IL-4-induced TNF-a and IL-13-induced TNF-a production could be detected in the tissues of TNF-a- and IL-4-treated mice. Moreover, the TEM-FPT-TEM could differentiate into TNF-a- and IL-13-induced TNF-a and IL-13-induced TNF-a cells in the TNF-a- and IL-13-treated TNF-a- and IL-13-treated mice. These results showed that the TEM-FPT-TEM could differentiate into the TNF-a- and IL-13-induced TNF-a and IL-13-induced TNF-a cells in the lungs and TNF-a-treated TNF-a- and IL-13-treated TNF-a- mice.
