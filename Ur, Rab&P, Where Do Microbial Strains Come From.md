## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immune compromised individuals. The yeast is typically found in the environment and has a high propensity for pathogenicity. However, when encountering this yeast in the human host, C. neoformans can undergo morphological transition, leading to the formation of the virulence factor capsule. Capsule formation is a prerequisite for infection by C. neoformans. In this study, we determined the roles of two capsule isoforms isoforms 1 and 2 in cryptococcosis. Capsule size was measured in two independent strains of C. neoformans: one strain with a larger capsule and the other with a smaller one. The capsule isoforms 1 and 2 did not affect the flow of C. neoformans into the brain in the mouse model of meningoencephalitis. However, when the mice were injected with a capsule that was larger than 0.5 micrometre, the pulmonary mycoses increased in size. These data suggest that capsule isoforms in Cryptococcus can promote cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
With the advent of modern medicine, many diseases have been known to affect humans, including neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and neoplasms. In recent years, the incidence of these diseases has increased substantially, and the frequency of the most common malignancy in HIV/AIDS has dramatically increased in the Western world (Rajasingham et al., 2017). Neurological disorders are characterized by a wide range of symptoms that mimic aphasia, seizures, focal deficits, apraxia, sleep disorders, and other forms of altered mental status. In addition, HIV/AIDS patients may develop a variety of neurological complications, which are often due to an underlying inflammatory condition, autoimmune disease, and/or neurological disease secondary to autoimmunity (Rajasingham et al., 2017). Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the uncontrolled and recurrent infections of the skin and the nail, and the development of inflammation of the blood vessels and synovial nerves. The inflammation in these conditions is often triggered by microbial infections, and the infection can be caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites. Autoimmunity is a clinically and genetically inherited disease caused by a single nucleotide mutation of the immunodeficiency virus (HIV), of which the recessive mutations are retroactive (Hoffmeister et al., 1988; Cushnie et al., 1997).

Neurocysticercosis is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system, which is often characterized by the appearance of white matter lesions and spinal cord dysfunction. The spectrum of neurocysticercosis is diverse, and patients often present with multifaceted clinical manifestations, including progressive dementia, stroke, and behavioral disorders (Blair, 2006). These symptoms are often secondary to an underlying malignancy, and it is important to recognize them.


## Methods
 2012. However, the sequence data were insufficient for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. We therefore assembled the sequences of the strains into a single set of sequences (Supplementary Table 1). These sequences were chosen as representatives of the strains in the previous study (Vastrup et al., 2012). In this study, the strains were classified into five subgroups according to their position in the genome sequence. In this analysis, the strains were identified based on the results of the alignment of their genomic sequence, which showed that they belong to the three subgroups C, D, E, and F. Moreover, the strain H11 was identified as one of the strains belonging to subgroup C. Therefore, this subgroup is considered to be of the subgroup C, which is the reference strain from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The strain E was also identified as one of the strains belonging to subgroup F. Therefore, this subgroup is considered to be of the subgroup F.

PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS region
The ITS region was amplified with the primers ITS-F (CTCATCCGTTCTCATC) and ITS-R (CTCATCCATCTCATCATTAC) and the following program: 1 cycle of PCR, 30 s at 94°C, 30 cycles of PCR, 30 s at 98°C, and 30 s at 60°C. The resulting amplicons were purified and purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sequence data were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI (SRA) database with accession numbers PRJNA579548, PRJNA579549, and PRJNA579550.

The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v3.


## Results
However, the latest study of our group [31] on the number of microorganisms in the soil and groundwater in Antarctica and California was very limited in the number of microorganisms, which is in agreement with previous studies [7,24,32. The present study gave the highest number of microorganisms in the soil (19.2%). The final total of 20,219,904, 5.2% of the total number of microorganisms, which represents an average number of 5,847.86, for the entire study period. The average number of bacteria was 2,092.03, which is a difference of 3.12%. These values were higher than those from other studies [7,24,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. The total number of bacteria in the soil was similar in the present study to the previous study, although the number of bacteria was lower in the present study (Table 4).

In terms of the total number of microorganisms, the total number of bacteria in the soil was higher than that in the sea. The total number of bacteria in the soil was higher in the present study than in the previous study.

## Discussion
We found that the microbial communities of the two forest locations were more complex than those of the forest locations of the same site in a similar geographical locatio. This suggests that differences in soil properties and microbial communities are more significant for forest locations than those of the same site in the same location. This is consistent with previous studies that found that differences in soil properties and microbial communities are more significant for forest locations [48]. Our results also show that the microbial communities of the two forest locations were more diverse than those of the forest locations in a similar geographic location.

The soil microbial communities of two forest locations were dominated by bacteria (Figure 2) and fungi (Figure 3). The difference in the relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the two forest locations was not significant (Figure 2), indicating that the differences in soil properties and microbial communities in the two forest locations were not as significant as the differences in bacterial communities (Figure 3). Our results suggest that the differences in microbial communities in the two forest locations are not only important for the forest locations, but also for the rhizosphere communities, which are also important for the rhizosphere communities. The bacterial communities of the rhizosphere communities are dominated by bacterial OTUs in both forest locations. We also found that the relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities was higher than that of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities. This suggests that the rhizosphere communities of the two forest locations are more important for the rhizosphere communities.

We also found that the relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities was higher than the relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities. This suggests that the rhizosphere communities of the two forest locations are more important for the rhizosphere communities. Our results also suggest that the rhizosphere communities of the two forest locations are more important for the rhizosphere communities.

The relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities was lower than the relative abundance of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere communities. This indicates that the rhizosphere communities of the two forest locations are more important for the rhizosphere communities. Our results also suggest that the rhizosphere communities of the two forest locations are more important for the rhizosphere communities.
