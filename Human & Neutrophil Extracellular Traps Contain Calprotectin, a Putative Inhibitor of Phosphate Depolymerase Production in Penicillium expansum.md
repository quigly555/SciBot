## Abstract
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a commonly encountered paradox of infectious, autoimmune and malignant behavior in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients. The underlying disease causes IRIS and paradoxical worsening of CD disease in CD patients after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We report a case of IRIS paradoxical response in a patient with CD and CD immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are increasing in frequency due to an increase in the population of patients with compromised immune system, such as HIV/AIDS, solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, and patients with haematological diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hematological malignancies, and neoplasms) [1-3]. The current treatment of fungal infections is limited by the phenomenon of side effects, including cytotoxicity, toxicities, and hepatotoxicity [4-7].


## Methods
In addition, in addition to its other analogues, . albicans SC5314 was recently isolated from S. cerevisiae cells by using Candida albicans SC5314 [19], as a selection agent for the synthesis of glutathione reductase and chitin reductase, respectively [20]. In addition, the structure of C. albicans SC5314 is shown in Figure 1A.

C. albicans SC5314 was also isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as shown in Figure 1B. In addition, C. albicans SC5314 was isolated from Candida albicans, as shown in Figure 1C. The C. albicans SC5314 structure was also obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as shown in Figure 1D.

The ability of C. albicans SC5314 to produce glutathione reductase and chitin reductase was assessed by using the previously described method [21]. In addition, C. albicans SC5314 was also used as a control for the production of glutathione reductase, as shown in Figure 1E.

Phagocytosis Assays
To evaluate the influence of C. albicans SC5314 on the morphology of C. albicans, yeast cells were treated with H_2O_2 for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Then, a volume of 200 µl of yeast suspension was applied on the top of a coverslip (2.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.01% glycerol, 0.1% bromocresol purple, and 0.1% Triton X-100) [22]. The coverslip was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and the samples were mixed with 200 µl of PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and the coverslip was removed. The samples were rinsed with PBS and the coverslip was removed again. The coverslip was removed and the samples were allowed to air dry completely. Finally, the samples were rinsed with PBS and the coverslip was removed again.


## Results

The inhibitory effects of penicillin-conjugated penicillin on the phage production of . expansum were also tested in vitro. No inhibition of phage or mycosis was observed in the same concentration of penicillin-conjugated penicillin-conjugated penicillin-conjugated penicillin, indicating that the compound did not interfere with the phage-mediated production of P.


## Discussion
 2012. This drug, was recently shown to possess an inhibitory effect on sporadial production of a fungal pathogen, M. sympodialis (Mao et al., 2014).

The phenotypic alterations observed in the mutant strains were most evident in the formation of the hyphae and the appressorium, and the production of the primary melanin pigment, melanin-like pigment, melanin-like pigment, and the production of secondary melanin (Figure 6).

Because phenotypic and biochemical studies are insufficient to determine the functions of microorganisms in a natural environment, the molecular basis of the observed alterations in the mutant strains was further investigated. A representative example of the phenotypic alterations is the formation of new cell wall polysaccharides (Figure 6). The deletion of the MDR5 gene in M. sympodialis (Henriques et al., 2012) resulted in a reduction in the cell wall polysaccharides, a phenotype which can be attributed to the disruption of Mpdr5, a gene with conserved functions (Henriques et al., 2012). The deletion of Mpdr5 also resulted in an increased susceptibility to the fungus (Henriques et al., 2012).

The combination of M. sympodialis and M. tuberculosis, and the presence of the toxin MdmS (Figure 7), together with the cell wall polysaccharides, results in the formation of new cell wall polysaccharides, melanin-like pigment, and the production of melanin-like pigment (Figure 6). This gene was also shown to be involved in the pathogenic activity of M. sympodialis (Henriques et al., 2012). The high level of MdmS expression was observed in the strain ATCC 46230, and the expression level of the mutant strain was significantly increased (Figure 7). These findings indicate that the altered cell wall polysaccharides, melanin pigment, and melanin-like pigment production in the mutant strains are associated with M. sympodialis and M. tuberculosis, respectively.

To further elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms of M. sympodialis mycelium-like development, we compared the mutants to the wild type (WT) and the mutant strains.
