## Abstract
Fungi are known to prefer the red color to the blue color of their products. Since bacteria have a crucial role in light sensing, it is of importance to analyze their preferred color experimentally. Here we show that the light-sensing fungus Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is able to thrive in the presence of the blue color but not the red one. Moreover, the fungus is highly sensitive to the red-to-red balance, and finding the right balance between the two colors is important for its discrimination between the red and red- colors. In contrast, the blue-to-red balance was found to be optimal for the fungus in the presence of the red-to-red balance, which is optimal for its fungus survival. Our results indicate that B. amyloliquefaciens is able to survive the blue color stress and is the most robust fungal species. Moreover, the red-to-red balance seems to enable the fungus to perceive the blue-to-red balance and use different strategies to overcome the stress. This indicates that the blue-to-red balance is the optimal stress-sensing color experimentally.


## Introduction
The endophytes, or microorganisms, of plant organs and tissues have been known to be produced from the rhizosphere, root system, or in extreme environments such as sea water, soil, and plants [20,31,32,33. Although few studies are available about the endophytic microbiota of plant organs and tissues, it is known to be present in several tissues, including leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, and seeds, and have been documented in association with endophytes [20,32,34,35,36,37,38]. In general, endophytes are able to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, bioactive metabolites, and lipids [40,41]. Endophytes can also act as biofilm, colonize plant cells, or form biofilms [42,43,44,45].

Endophytes are characterized by their ability to produce a wide spectrum of metabolites, which include metabolites with anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-bacterial activity [46,47,48]. Some of the most important important biochemicals include polyphenols, such as flavonoids, anthocyanidols, and phenols, and phytic enzymes, such as phospholipases and chitinase [47,48,49,50].

Phytic enzymes are enzymes that convert the hydrolytic activity of enzymes into a secondary metabolism [51,52]. Phytic enzymes are classified into different families based on their size, composition, substrate specificity, and catalytic mechanism. Small enzymes, such as ß-d-glucosidase, chitinase, and chitosanase, have a substrate specificity similar to that of large enzymes [53]. Small phytic enzymes can be more active than large phytic enzymes, and their activity is regulated by chitin and chitosanase [54,55]. Large phytic enzymes can be active at concentrations that are too high, or at concentrations that are too low, and they can inhibit chitinase and chitinase at the same concentration.


## Methods
The endophytic fungi were identified as . albicans (12), C. dubliniensis (12), and C. parapsilosis (12). The endophytic fungi were isolated from fungal material, and were identified as the endophytic fungal species C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The sequencing data was deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) database under accession number PRJEB8938 (CEF_007672) and EMDF7424 (EMBL_011078).

Extraction of amino acids from plant extracts
The whole leaves of C. albicans (20-50 mg) and C. dubliniensis (10-100 mg) plants were extracted using the same method, except that the plant extract was dissolved in methanol. The methanol extract (5 g) was mixed with 1 ml of chloroform (1:1, v/v) and 0.2 ml of HCl (2.85:1, v/v). The mixture was heated to 60°C and then cooled down to room temperature. The hexane phase (0.1 ml) was removed with a syringe, and the hexane layer (1.5 ml) was transferred into a flask containing 2 ml of methanol. The hexane layer was filtered (0.22 µm) and then the hexane layer was transferred into a vial, and the hexane layer was transferred to a glass vial, and the hexane layer was transferred into a tube. The hexane layer was then mixed with a syringe, and then 0.5 ml of methanol was added. The hexane layer was then heated to 100°C and then cooled down to room temperature. The hexane layer was then removed with a syringe, and the hexane layer was then transferred into a vial, and the hexane layer was then transferred into a glass vial, and the hexane layer was then transferred into a tube. The hexane layer was then removed with a syringe, and the hexane layer was then transferred into a vial, and the hexane layer was then transferred into a tube.


## Results
These changes in pH can occur in three steps: initial acidification, acidification at initial pH and subsequent alkalinizatio. In order to determine the pH of the lipids in the lipids at different times, we extracted lipids from two microbial endophytes and found that the pH of the lipids increased from 4.0 to 7.0 in two lipids isolated from S. hydrophila (Table 2). In addition, the pH of the lipids in the lipids from S. hydrophila was also increased from 6.0 to 9.0 in two lipids isolated from S. hydrophila (Table 2). The pH values for lipids from S. hydrophila were similar to those for lipids from S. paradoxus and S. pumilus (Table 2). The overall pH values of the lipids from S. paradoxus were 5.7 to 7.4 in two lipids isolated from S. hydrophila, which is within the range of pH values for lipids from other endophytes (Table 2).

The pH of the lipids from the lipids from the endophytes were lower than those from S. paradoxus and S. pumilus, although the differences were not significant. The lipids from the endophytes did not show any significant difference in pH values compared to the lipids from S. paradoxus or S. pumilus.

The pH of the lipids from the endophytes was higher than those from S. paradoxus and S. pumilus, but lower than that of the lipids from S. paradoxus and S. pumilus (Table 2). In addition, the pH values of the lipids from the endophytes were lower than those of the endophytes of S. paradoxus and S. pumilus, but higher than those of the endophytes of S. paradoxus and S. pumilus. The pH values of the lipids from the endophytes were also lower than those of the endophytes of S. paradoxus and S. pumilus. In the endophytes of S. paradoxus, the pH values of the lipids from the endophytes were lower than those of S. paradoxus and S. pumilus. The pH values of the lipids from the endophytes of S.


## Discussion
The association between low oxygen and altered lipid metabolism in fungal endophytes is known [19. In this study, we examined the effects of microbial communities in grape must by analyzing endophytes in a sugar beet plantation. The diversity of endophyte communities was significantly increased in the sugar beet plantation, which provided a protective barrier to root exudate and plant defenses against pathogens.

The composition of endophyte communities in the sugar beet plantation has been shown to be associated with the physicochemical properties of the sugar beet in general [20]. The composition of endophytes in sugar beet plantations varies between different taxonomic groups. For example, endophytes in S. alba and S. minispora have been associated with the root exudate, but not with the plant immune system [21]. These endophytes are a group of endophytes that grow on the leaves of the sugar beet fruit and produce bioactive compounds that may be beneficial in the suppression of pathogens by their saprophytic lifestyle [22]. The diversity of endophytes in sugar beet plantations is highly influenced by the taxonomic groups associated with sugar beet fruit ripening, but we found that endophytes in sugar beet plantation are significantly different from other taxa associated with the same sugar beet fruit.

The diversity of endophytes in the sugar beet plantation was significantly different from the diversity of other fungal taxa in the sugar beet plantation. The fungal diversity in the sugar beet plantation is influenced by the different physicochemical properties of the sugar beet fruit. For example, the endophytes of R. solani, R. solani-repentis, S. alba, and S. minispora are all classified in the endophytic class that are saprophytic fungi, and the endophytes in these taxa are members of the fungal endophyte group. The endophytes of the other endophytes are saprophytic fungi, which are known to be saprophytic in nature. The endophytes in the other endophytes are members of the phylum Ascomycota. The fungal diversity in the sugar beet plantation is influenced by the taxonomic groups associated with sugar beet fruit ripening, but we found that endophytes in sugar beet fruit are significantly different from other taxa associated with sugar beet fruit.
