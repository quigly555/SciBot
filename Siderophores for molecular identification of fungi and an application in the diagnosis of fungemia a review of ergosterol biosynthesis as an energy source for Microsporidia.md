## Abstract
The well-characterized activity of the polyketide synthase (PKS) ß-amino acid synthase (ALK) is a key enzyme in the activation of a range of physiological and microbial targets in response to a variety of environmental and host stresses. Here, we analyze the homology of the two AMPK enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine their homologs in regulation of these metabolism states. In S. cerevisiae, the amino acids in the K + D branch are required for the biosynthesis of the PKS ß-amino acid. In S. cerevisiae, the amino acids in the C branch are necessary for the biosynthesis of the PKS + ß-amino acid. In contrast, the C branch is only found in S. pea, the only other yeast species that requires these two amino acids for biosynthesis. In the present study, we analyzed the differential regulation of the PKS ß-amino acid synthase in the following proteins were identified: the cytochrome P450 (CYP51), the S-acyl carboxylase (CAL), and the S-acyl tau ABC transporter (TSN). The S-acyl tau protein was necessary for PKS activation, whereas the S-acyl carboxylase was dispensable for activation of other cellular processes. In particular, the S-acyl tau protein was required for PKS induction of a variety of S. cerevisiae pathogenicity related genes including the virulence attributes of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida auris. Our results shed new light on the evolution of PKS enzyme regulation and suggest that the two enzymes could have different roles in the regulation of metabolism or secondary metabolism.


## Introduction
The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen of the human body, causing superficial and invasive infections, which can disseminate into the bloodstream and cause life-threatening candidiasis. The colonization process by Candida albicans starts with dormancy in the human host, but soon after, the pathogen can cause systemic infection and death by the formation of multisystem organelles known as biofilms, which are embedded in extracellular matrix, which protect the fungus from immune attacks [1]. C. albicans biofilm formation is regulated by several factors including factors such as host immune status, tissue tropism, biofilm size and biofilm formation [2,3].

C. albicans biofilm formation is regulated by factors such as host immune status, including type of immune response, patient age, type of infection, time of incubation and immune status of the patient [4]. Biofilms are defined as an extracellular matrix that has been cleared by the immune system and is capable of forming multiple layers of cells. C. albicans biofilms are usually cleared by the immune system and can be maintained in the host [5]. The mechanism of C. albicans biofilm formation is based on two major factors: the host-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and the pathogen-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) [6]. The ECM protects the fungus from invasion by host cells and is a key barrier to pathogen entry [6,7]. The ECM is composed of protein aggregates, which contain several molecules that can interact with and damage the ECM [8].

The ECM is a complex network of microdomains and interfaces that support the cellular activity of the fungus [9]. The ECM is composed of numerous proteins, which interact with and promote the formation of biofilms. The molecular mechanism of the biofilm formation has been extensively studied in C. albicans [10]. It has been reported that the ECM facilitates the spread of Candida spp. [11]. In addition, the ECM network can be broken down to smaller networks that are more hydrated and more resistant to immune attacks [12]. The ECM is a complex network with multiple components, including proteins, hydrophilic and hydrophobic proteins [13]. The functional properties of the ECM are related to the extracellular matrix [14].


## Methods

[untitled sec/p]
We used the total genomic DNA extracted from fungal colonies growing on the Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) at 25 °C for 7 day. PCR products were purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and used to perform a homologous recombination PCR by using primers specific for the eukaryotic gene for the first time in our experiment. The sequences of the primers used in this study are available in Table 2. The primers are listed in Table 3. The PCR program used for amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA gene was as follows: initial denaturation for 10 min at 98 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 3. The PCR program used for amplification of the ITS region of the ribosomal RNA gene was as follows: initial denaturation for 10 min at 98 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 53 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.

## Results

Our results indicated that a compound, syringomycin, which was identified as a potential new agent in our study, was also active against both fung. The compound was then tested against two other strains of F. graminearum, a U. maydis strain and a pathogenic fungus, F. verticillioides. In the compound assay, we found that compound was more active than other compounds. Interestingly, the compound was more effective than the fungicide, voriconazole, as it was more potent than that of the fungicide, itraconazole (Fig 3).

According to the literature, itraconazole is an inhibitor of the voriconazole enzyme [4, 5, 14]. We identified that compound as a potential new drug target. In this study, the compound was further tested against three other strains of F. graminearum, a U. maydis strain and a pathogenic fungus, F. verticillioides. The results showed that compound was more potent than other compounds, but not the fungicide, voriconazole. In the compound assay, we found that compound was more potent than other compounds. The compound was more active than the fungicide, itraconazole, as it was more potent than the fungicide, itraconazole (Fig 3).

The comparative analysis of the compound and compounds against F. graminearum and F. verticillioides strains showed that compound was more effective than the fungicide, itraconazole, as it was more potent than the fungicide, itraconazole (Fig 3). In addition, compound was more active than the fungicide, voriconazole, as it was more potent than the fungicide, itraconazole (Fig 3).

Effect of compound on the fungal growth and conidiation in response to light and UV radiation
In the F. graminearum cultures, the presence of cell wall damage caused by the UV light treatment was evaluated after UV irradiation for 10 h. The results showed that the compounds showed a dose-dependent growth and conidiation inhibition (Fig 4).


## Discussion
The main finding of this study is that, based on the results from previous studies, the clinical response of patients with invasive Candida infection is dependent on the type of the fungus and the time of infection, as well as on the underlying molecular mechanisms (Pierce et al., 2012).

Candida spp. are highly virulent and can cause invasive fungal infections in humans (Barrett et al., 2006). A recent study showed that fungal infection in patients with underlying conditions (such as HIV, diabetes mellitus, or the use of antiretroviral therapy) is significantly higher in patients with normal immune function (Fernandez-Ponce et al., 2015). However, this study did not show that patients with C. albicans were significantly more likely to die or to develop other diseases such as cancer or other infectious diseases in comparison to those with C. tropicalis. The more time period during which Candida infections occur in patients with C. tropicalis, the higher mortality rate, and the higher incidence of candidemia, among other findings, are consistent with previous reports that C. albicans infections are associated with increased mortality in HIV patients (Arzúrit et al., 2009).

Although C. albicans is a common agent of invasive Candida infections in HIV patients, the clinical responses to C. albicans infection are highly dependent on the type of the fungus and the time of infection (Hassett et al., 2010). Several studies have shown that C. albicans infections are associated with increased mortality in patients with HIV (Hassett et al., 2010). Previous studies showed that the mortality rate of HIV-associated cryptococcosis is significantly higher in patients with normal immune function than those with C. albicans infection (Hassett et al., 2010). Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the clinical responses to C.
