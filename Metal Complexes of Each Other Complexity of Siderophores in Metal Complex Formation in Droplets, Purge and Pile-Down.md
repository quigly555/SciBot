## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a neglected subacute mycosis in China, which is caused by the fungus Sporothrix spp. In the current study, a virulence factor plasmid was constructed to identify a gene transcription factor (PlbPlb) and protease associated with virulence in a S. spp. mouse model. The plasmid showed significant similarity (both in size and codon length) to that of the Arabidopsis thaliana plasmid. This plasmid could recognize endogenous and secreted proteins, and play roles in the interaction between fungus and host. Transcriptional analysis revealed two different transcription factors (TFs) in the gene, which were identified as TFs A and B. PlbPlb TFs A was enriched in the mRNA and protein transcripts. In addition, the TFs were significantly longer in protein transcripts, with a significant down-regulation of amino acids and nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein transcripts were up-regulated upon treatment with a representative virulence factor plasmid, the IL-4 protein complex. These results suggest that the TFs are involved in the pathogenesis of sporotrichosis.


## Introduction

The last three articles, mainly based on molecular characterisation, are summarized in Table . In general, the carbohydrate components of the Siderophores are analysed in a structural manner, while the total carbohydrate fraction of the Siderophores is analysed with different analytical techniques. The crystallographic aspects of the carbohydrate structures are mainly studied with molecular methods. The carbohydrate fraction of the Siderophores is followed by an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of the molecular structure.

The solvent and the chemical composition of the Siderophores are mainly based on the chemical composition of the parent compound, particular structure, and/or particle orientation. The solvent parameters are mainly based on the solvent mode of action and the solvent size. The chemical composition is mostly based on the solvent solubilization method.

The Siderophores have been investigated by various techniques, including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and ionization mass spectrometry (ICT-MS). In the present study, the chemical composition of the Siderophores, which are mainly based on the solvent mode of action and the chemical parameters, were analysed with the Ionization Mass Spectrometry (IMS) technique, followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) analysis and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The Siderophores were analyzed with the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and the mass spectrometer (MS).

The Siderophores are found in diverse habitats, including soil, water, air, and even on biological specimens. In aquatic environments, they are associated with the alga Lipidophorus spp.


## Methods
solani by evaporation and were purified by successive evaporation of silica gel using a Minelab HPLC (Avanti), as described by Donoso et a. [27].

4.4. Molecular Weight Measurements
The molecular weight measurements were performed in a preliminary step using the standard compound method, as described by Goodfellow and Herndon [28], with modifications. Briefly, H_2O was replaced with H_2O_2, then the solution was cooled at -4째C. The water content in the solution was adjusted to 5% with a pH meter and then it was cooled at 30째C. The solution of 4% w/v FeCl_2 was replaced with 4% w/v ZnCl_2 and the solvent was left for 20 min at the same temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 6% v/v methanol. The reaction volume was adjusted to 1 mL with a PDB-10 column. The chemical shift in the solvent was monitored using a UV/visible spectrophotometer at 282 nm. The concentration of FeCl_2 was monitored at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The measured FeCl_2 concentrations were defined as the concentration at which the fungal growth rate was greater than the solvent-induced decrease in the rate of growth.

4.5. Microscopic Preparation
The yeast cells were cultured at 35째C in YPD liquid medium in an orbital shaker (200 rpm) for 24 h. The fungal cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. Then, the fungal cells were resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) of 0.2-0.4. The suspensions were allowed to settle for 10 min, and then the cell suspension was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at maximum speed for 1 min to obtain the cell pellet. Then, the fungal pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. The cell pellets were then treated with 1% (v/v) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 1 h at 37째C. The cell suspension was then washed with PBS, and then with 0.


## Results
The abundance of Siderophores was analyzed by the MS/MS (Fig 4) and the identification of Siderophores was established using the MASCOT analysis (Fig 4. The purity of Siderophores was 91% (4/5) at the molecular weight of the peptide and was higher than that of other components (0.3-1.2%), which is not found in other species [9]. We also analyzed the sizes of the peptide molecules of Siderophores (Fig 5). As shown in Fig 5, the size of Siderophores in K. marxianus was between 20 and 25 kDa. As shown in Fig 5, the size of Siderophores in K. marxianus was significantly larger than that in other species. The size of Siderophores in K. marxianus was approximately 60 kDa. These results confirmed the production of Siderophores by S. siderophore.
