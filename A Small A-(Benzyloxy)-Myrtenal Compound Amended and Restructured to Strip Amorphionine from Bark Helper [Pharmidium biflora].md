## Abstract
In (3) isomers and N-(1-aryl-2-isopropyl)-4-(4-isopropyl)-6-(6-chlorophenyl)-3,6-diamine (H<U+03B3>) are of (1. Compound (3) and its derivative, (4) of (1). In (3) isomers and N-(1-aryl-2-isopropyl)-4-(4-isopropyl)-6-(6-chlorophenyl)-3,6-diamine (H<U+03B3>>>) are removed by NaOH and AMPH. The behavior of amides in N-(1-aryl-2-isopropyl)-4-(4-isopropyl)-6-(6-chlorophenyl)-3,6-diamine (H<U+03B3>>> in the presence of amide permeabilization is determined by spectroscopy, FTIR, 1H NMR, and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and chemical analysis of the isolated compounds by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The amide behavior of the amide derivative, (2) of the benzyloxy group in this structure, is compared with the benzyloxy group of (1).


## Introduction
Chlamydial phaeohyphomycosis (CPH) is a rare and life-threatening infection caused by a filamentous fungus, Chlamydia trachomatis. The association between it and other chlamydial infections has rarely been reported, but the co-infection of chlamydial tissue with other invasive infections is increasingly reported. The distribution of the fungus in the environment is varied, with disease incidence varying from asymptomatic colonization to disseminated disease, which may be associated with changes in the microbial community composition, morphology, and/or DNA content. For example, it has been implicated as a possible reason for the high rates of drug resistance in certain clinical strains of the Cryptococcus genus and some other genera. The genus Chlamydia includes 16 species, which are all part of the family Lophiotidae. Of these, seven species are known to cause disease in humans. The most common human infections are as a complication of infectious conditions such as Mycetoma, where the causative agent is Chlamydiae, followed by pneumonia. The most frequent etiological agents are members of the family Lophiotidae, with Chlamydiae being more common than other Chlamydial species. The most frequent clinical manifestations are meningoencephalitis and pulmonary or central nervous system infection, as well as lymphadenopathy and central nervous system abscess. The mortality rate is as high as 60% in the absence of other predisposing conditions. In some cases, the disease is fatal, while other conditions may be associated with the disease, such as immunodeficiency disorder, corticosteroid therapy, or other immunosuppressive drugs.

In the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated a clear association between chlamydial infections and immunocompromised patients, especially those with diabetes, AIDS, nephrotic and hematologic diseases, and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1, 2].


## Methods
The following procedure was used to prepare the compound: the fraction (5 mg) was subjected to fragmentation of amide sulfuric acid by HPP (10:1. The yield of compound (20 mg) was obtained by linear dilution procedure with HPP and ammonium hydroxide (10:1).

4.6. Inoculum Preparation of Microbial Suspensions
A. baumannii Af293 (serotype A) was grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at room temperature for 5 days. The mycelia of A. baumannii were harvested by filtration, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then lyophilized. The mycelia of A. baumannii were also harvested by filtration. The mycelia were then lyophilized. The suspensions were filtered using a 0.22-µm membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. The mycelia were then washed with sterile distilled water to remove the insoluble material and then the cells were resuspended in sterile distilled water to obtain the cell-free fraction. The cells were then disrupted in a mortar with a pestle and mortar, and then dried and adjusted to pH 6.5 with distilled water. The fractions were then added to a 1-mL microfuge tube containing 0.5 mL of n-hexane-acetone (NTA) and then vortexed for 1 min. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The obtained pellets were suspended in 0.5 mL of distilled water, and then kept in the dark at room temperature for further analysis.

4.7. Microbial Identification
The strains were identified using standard methods as follows. The genomic DNA of each strain was isolated using the QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolates were stored in -80 °C and were kept in culture at 4 °C. The strains were identified using standard methods as follows.

4.8. Molecular Diagnosis
The bacterial strains were characterized according to standard methods as follows. The strains were identified using the standard methods as follows.

## Discussion
The best-studied species of yeasts in this genus are the Malassezia spp., which were isolated from various habitats [11, 12] and from marine sediments in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia [13]. The Malassezia species are usually found in terrestrial environments, including soils and algae. However, in the present study, the species Malassezia navei was isolated from the marine environment, which suggests a possible ecological role. The isolates are multilocus (13,000 to 19,000 genes) and have been reported in different locations, but none in the entire range of 15-35,000 genes [14]. In addition, the isolates are not related to any known species, and therefore cannot be considered as new species, as they are considered to be human-associated.

The isolates belonged to five genera: Malassezia, Metschnikowia, Kluyveromyces, Cryptococcus, Kluyverinella and C. tropicalis. The four species are morphologically similar to other Malassezia species, except in the presence of different morphological characters. The species are multilocus (3,000 to 6,000 genes) and have been reported in diverse habitats. However, their ecological roles remain unclear. For example, the authors of the genus Malassezia are currently studying the biological and ecological significance of the Malassezia spp. in the ocean. The results of the present study showed that the genus Metschnikowia may be a new species, but the phylogenetic analysis may not be complete.

Pseudohyphozyma species are among the most common genera in Antarctic soils.
