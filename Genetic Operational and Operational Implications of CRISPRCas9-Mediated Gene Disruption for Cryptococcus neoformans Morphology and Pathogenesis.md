## Abstract
Infection with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is an important component of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Fluconazole (FLC) is a commonly used antifungal drug with wide-spectrum activity against A. fumigatus. However, FLC toxicity and efficacy have been reported to be problematic. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of FLC against Aspergillus terreus and other serious fungal pathogens.

Antifungal 1,2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine furfurales and flucytosine were selected as the antifungal compound. The in vitro antitumor activity of FLC was determined in broth microdilution assay against A. fumigatus.


## Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the leading causes of death in HIV-infected patients and represents the third leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients [1]. It is estimated that the global burden of Mtb infection is approximately one million cases annually, resulting in over 700,000 deaths each year, with an estimated 2.7 million HIV-related illnesses in untreated patients [2]. The majority of HIV-infected patients are members of the immunosuppressed and have a low cellular immune response and no access to effective antiretroviral therapy [3].

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that the global tuberculosis burden is approximately 250,000 new cases annually, with an estimated 1.3 million deaths resulting from tuberculosis in the first six months of the epidemic [4]. The World Bank reports that tuberculosis accounts for approximately $12 billion in annual gross domestic product [5].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that HIV/AIDS patients are the most vulnerable groups for tuberculosis treatment, with about 15% of the worldâ€™s population contracting the disease from untreated HIV-associated infections [6]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of three main approaches for the management of Mtb: the first-line therapy of tuberculosis, which includes the combination of amphotericin B with flucytosine, fluconazole with posaconazole, and the combination of amphotericin with flucytosine [7]. However, few studies have focused on the treatment of Mtb, and no standard recommendations have been established to guide the management of its treatment.


## Methods
The OMP1 gene encodes a gene encoding a proline-binding protein (PBP) fused to a hydroxyl transferase (HTR) gene that includes a single native promoter (CAG) and a second hydroxyl transferase (HTR-PBP. The OMP2 gene encodes a PBP fused to a hydroxyl transferase (HTR) gene that includes a second native promoter (CAG-PBP) and a second hydroxyl transferase (HTR-PBP). The OMP3 gene encodes a gene encoding a proline-binding protein (PBP) fused to a hydroxyl transferase (HTR) gene that includes a second native promoter (CAG-PBP) and a second hydroxyl transferase (HTR-PBP).

The coding sequence of the OMP1 and OMP2 genes was obtained from genomic DNA extracted from a Cryptococcus neoformans strain (MATa) by standard protocols described in the genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) [45] and subsequently amplified by PCR. The PCR primers OMP1 and OMP2 were used to amplify the OMP1 and OMP2 genes from the genomic DNA of a Cryptococcus neoformans strain (MATa) and the genomic DNA of a C. neoformans strain (S. cerevisiae). The sequences of OMP1 and OMP2 were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the genomic DNA. The following primers were used to amplify OMP1: OMP1-5F, OMP1-5R, OMP2-5F, OMP2-5R, OMP3-5R, OMP3-5R, OMP4-5R, OMP5-5R, OMP6-5R, OMP6-5R, OMP7-5R, OMP8-5R, OMP9-5R, OMP12-5R, and OMP13-5R.


## Results
We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic insertional mutagenesis to determine the effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on the morphological and pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoforman. Strains were introduced by gentle addition of 1 mg of the recombinant drug CRISPR/Cas9 (S3 Table). Both strains were used to treat at least 3 weeks after the first incident of symptoms. Fungal growth was monitored every 3 days. A moderate sensitivity was observed, with no growth at the highest concentration of CRISPR/Cas9. The number of CFU in the lungs was evaluated every 2 weeks. This sensitivity was followed by the elimination of the infection by a rechallenge of the same strain every 3 days for 2 weeks, and a negative log-rank test every 3 weeks. All strains were viable at the end of the study.

The M. tuberculosis strain BL21A1 was the only strain that demonstrated a robust growth and virulence phenotype at CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome insertional mutagenesis. The isolate was confirmed as M. tuberculosis in the first episode of this study. The second episode was an adult patient with significant histological evidence of tuberculosis infection in the lungs and brain. Two of three patients in the second episode had pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary cryptococcal infection, respectively. One patient had a CSF smear but no histological evidence of tuberculosis infection. Two patients had pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary cryptococcal infection in the lungs and one patient had a CSF smear but no histological evidence of tuberculosis infection. A third patient had pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary cryptococcal infection in the lungs and brain and a fourth patient had pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary cryptococcal infection in the lungs and brain. The remaining two patients had pulmonary tuberculosis and pulmonary cryptococcal infection in the lungs and brain and were not treated with the rechallenge of the isolate.


## Discussion
The genome of this strain is now available for download at NCBI BLAST server (ww.blat.il.fr/BlatGenU/index.html) (Figure 2). The genome sequence of this strain is available at GenBank (NCBI) for download at NCBI: SSN05826, SID13, and SID20 (accessed June 24, 2013). The genome sequence of the C. neoformans strain is available at GenBank (GenBank accession number: XP_00276219.1). The sequenced genome of C. neoformans strain is also available at GenBank (GenBank accession number: XP_00276215.1). The C. neoformans strain is the result of a highly successful successful recombination between the two S. cerevisiae strains (C. neoformans and S. cerevisiae) and is therefore reproducibly obtained in C. neoformans, C. gattii, and S. cerevisiae. The recombination between the two S. cerevisiae strains is also reproducibly observed in the C. neoformans genome. The recombination between the two strains can be observed in the C. gattii genome by an increase in the level of recombination in the sexual mating type. An increase in the level of recombination in the sexual mating type is also observed in the S. cerevisiae genome by a decrease in the level of recombination in the mating type. The C. gattii genome also contains the same mating type locus as the C. neoformans genome. In addition to the mating type locus, the DNA is also the major source of recombination in C. neoformans. The gene for recombination between two genetically identical S. cerevisiae strains is Sre1p and Sre2p (GenBank accession number: XP_00276219.1) (Figure 3). Genome sequencing of the C. gattii strain is available at the GenBank (XP_00276220.1) (Figure 3). The genome of C. neoformans strain is also available at GenBank (XP_00276216.1).
