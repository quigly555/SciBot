## Abstract
Fungal infections have been increasingly reported due to the advent of the immunocompromised population, resulting in more severe clinical outcomes. This can be associated to several factors, including the presence of immunodeficiency, age, immunosuppressive treatment, corticosteroids use, chronic steroid use, and the use of other immunosuppressors and/or therapeutic interventions. This review aims to summarise the main pathogenic fungi infecting humans, focusing on the main mechanisms of pathogen transmission, infections, and resistance/resistance within the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and highlighting the main factors that make a pathogen spread across human and plant tissues.


## Introduction

7. The authors raise the possibility of “carcinodidialysis”, a possibly less invasive option, as a treatment option for cryptococcal meningitis. This would provide a similar opportunity to patients with advanced mortality. The authors should clearly state this possibility and specifically emphasize this possibility.

8. In addition to the above mentioned issues, the authors should state that they have evaluated the manuscript carefully, with an objective and appropriate set of clinical and microbiological features, including microbiology and cytology, microbiology and genotyping, in addition to the statistical analysis. The authors clearly demonstrated that they have adequately addressed all of the relevant aspects of the manuscript.

Reviewer #3:

The manuscript by the author is very well written and provides valuable insight into the human microbiome. The manuscript has strong opinions about the research topic and its strengths. However, I strongly disagree with the decision to conduct the study and recommend that the following statements be written in the concluding paragraph of the discussion section be addressed:

The findings presented in the manuscript may be considered to be “probable human-microbe interspecies transmission”. This is based on studies that have demonstrated that human microbiota have no effect on the virulence of C. neoformans.

This concern is based on a lack of focus on the relationship between the human host and microbial flora. The study results in a functional microbiome study and are well performed and do not distract from the main topic. In addition, the study is a longitudinal study and the findings are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the human host microbiota is a primary factor in C. neoformans pathogenesis.

The authors should also state that they have demonstrated that the human host immune response is necessary for the control of cryptococcal infection. This has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo using a murine model. The host immune response can be defined as a host immune response, which includes phagocytic cells and T-cell mediated killing of Cryptococcus. The host immune response can be defined as the microbicidal capacity of the host and its ability to control cryptococcal infection.


## Methods
The HIV status was defined as HIV-positive or HIV-negative [42. The median lethal time (LTE) of cryptococcal anaemia was calculated by the following formula [43]: LTE = (CD4^+ - CD4^-)/(CD4^- - CD4^-), where CD4^+ is the time from the initial cryptococcal anaemia diagnosis to death [43]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by log-rank test.

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nairobi University Hospital, Kenya and was performed in accordance with the ethical principles laid down by the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Preparation and inoculation of cryptococcal agar
Cells of interest (C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. krusei ATCC 6258) were grown in MMcM media (BD) supplemented with 20% glycerol at 37°C. The culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was suspended in PBS. The suspension was then filtered through 0.2 µm-pore-size nylon filters (0.45 µm, Millipore) and then stored at -20°C.

C. albicans and C. krusei were incubated with 20% glycerol at 37°C for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended and inoculated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma). The cells were kept on ice and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and transferred to a fresh tube. The pellet was washed with PBS, and the cells were suspended in PBS. The cell density was measured by optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) and the cell suspension was adjusted to 5 × 10^6 CFU/ml.

The inoculated C. albicans (1 × 10^6 CFU/ml) were incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) in PBS at 37°C for 3 h.


## Results
Identification of the Gene Family
The gene set of 30.3 Mb of exons contains 735 predicted genes and is encoded by a single gene in the PRC_CYC, and a gene in the PRC_CYC is duplicated in several organisms. In total, 21.3% of the exons were predicted as being from one to four paralogs. The duplication events that occurred in the exons of PRC_CYC, PRC_CYC_E and PRC_CYC_E were analysed in detail. The PRC_CYC gene was found to have a single paralog in S. cerevisiae. Its loss resulted in a loss of approximately 5 kb in a single paralog, and in this case was also verified by PCR amplification using a primer specific for PRC_CYC.


## Discussion

We also found that the HIV-1 infection-related mortality was significantly higher in patients with cryptococcal anaemia and that the mortality was significantly higher in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia and that the mortality was significantly higher in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia than in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemi. This may be explained by the differences in the HIV-1 infection-related mortality between the two groups, as it was reported in African patients [26].

The study included two patients with AIDS-associated C. neoformans infections, one with HIV-1 infection, and the other with HIV-1 infection, which is a primary immunosuppressive condition in African patients. The study was also conducted in a larger population of HIV-infected patients with HIV-1 infection, and all the patients were healthy and in stable condition.

In this study, there was a higher overall mortality in patients with HIV-1 infection. There was a significant difference in the mortality in patients with cryptococcal anaemia and other C. neoformans infections in the two groups. The mortality in patients with C. neoformans infection was significantly higher in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia than in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia. This may be explained by the lower baseline CD4 count and higher cryptococcal anaemia in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia compared to patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia. This could also be a result of the less severe immunosuppression in HIV-1 infected patients in the two groups. The only HIV-1 associated C. neoformans infection was diagnosed in two patients with cryptococcal anaemia and one patient with C. neoformans infection, which was diagnosed in one patient with cryptococcal anaemia and in one patient with C. gattii infection. This could be a result of the higher baseline CD4 count in the two groups and the higher serum C. gattii infection positivity in patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia compared to patients with HIV-1 associated cryptococcal anaemia.

There was no difference in the mortality between the two groups in patients with cryptococcal anaemia. The main reason for the difference in mortality was the higher median CD4 count in the two groups.
