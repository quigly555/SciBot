## Abstract
Melanins are highly conserved throughout the eukaryotes but are also found in fungi, helminths, plants, algae, nematodes, choanoflagellates and crustaceans. Melanin is synthesized by the cell wall matrix proteins Clp1, Clp3, and Clp4, which are glycosyltransferases that direct the modification of the cell wall matrix. In fungi, the first and second largest subunits of the glycoproteins binding protein family, respectively, gave rise to several epitope-specific recognition motifs on the surface of the outer and inner membranes, suggesting that these two subunits of the glycoproteins are key players in the interaction between the fungal and host immune cells. Since most of the fungal species studied used a combination of glatiramer-mediated type complement assays and enzyme expression profiling, we tested the expression of some of these motifs on the surface of the fungal cells in order to better understand their role in host defense and infection. We found that the surface glycoproteins had a significant effect on the surface expression of some of the glycoproteins. Furthermore, we observed that the surface-expressed glycoproteins were able to protect the fungus against killing by human monocytes.


## Introduction
 2000; Schlötterer et a., 2002; Schwarzmüller et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2007; Cai and Johnson, 2009; Núñez and Johnson, 2010). The genus Dermatophytophorax was proposed by Schroeder and Schroeder (2000) based on the type species D.phalloides (Schroeder et al., 2000). Dermatophytephorax agalactiae has been found in tropical and temperate regions (Schroeder et al., 2000; Schwarzmüller et al., 2006) and is considered to be an economically important pathogen that causes disease on a wide range of plants including Eucalyptus and Citrus spp. (E.C.H. Schroeder & M.A. Curtis, USA) (van der Werf et al., 2009). Dermatophytes are primarily saprophytic on a wide range of plants including Ficus spp. (S.J. Reynolds, D.G.M. Reynolds, J.P. DeBevisch and P.G.M. DeBevisch, USA) (Núñez and Johnson, 2010; Zeng et al., 2011). The infection is a part of the warm-blooded animals, such as birds, domestic animals, horses, cats and foxes, as well as the common birds such as pigeons, turkeys, etc. (van der Werf et al., 2009; Sampaio and Sampaio, 2012). Dermatophytephorax agalactiae is generally regarded as a soilborne pathogen that causes disease on a wide range of plants including Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Núñez and Johnson, 2010), Eucalyptus spp. (P.G.M. DeBevisch and P.G.M. DeBevisch, USA) (Aguirre et al., 2013), Ficus spp. (J.P. DeBevisch and J.P. DeBevisch, USA) (E.C.H. Schroeder et al., 2000), Ficus spp. (S.J. Reynolds, D.G.M. Reynolds, J.P. DeBevisch and P.G.M. DeBevisch, USA) (Aguirre et al.


## Methods
Penicillium ophiostoma. The endophytic species are reported from the genus Prathophyte. Plant species are also discussed.

Phylogenetic trees
The best-fit substitution model for each gene partition was estimated by Bayesian inference. We used the model of evolution from HKY85 (Dion, 2009) with the Jukes-Cantor model and the uncorrected (p) method. All substitution models were independently estimated for the remaining 6 partitions. The results of Bayesian inference were analyzed using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and the best-fit substitution model was estimated by the PhyML software v. 8.1.6 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2003).

Phylogenetic trees
The evolutionary model was determined using the Kimura-2 method. In addition, the topology of our dataset was investigated by comparison of the number of species in each partition (C, C_N, C_C, C_A, C_A_N, C_A_C, and C_A_N) and the number of phyllosphere, shrub, mesocycline, and cystidia species (C, C_C, C_A, C_A, and C_A_N). The topology of the phylogenetic tree was estimated using the neighbor-joining method and the bootstrap values were calculated with 1000 bootstrap replications.

Phylogenetic trees
The evolutionary model was determined using the maximum-likelihood method. The tree was rooted with the model of evolution from the DendroPyk tree in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2003). The bootstrap values were calculated with 1000 replications.

Phylogenetic trees
The topology of the phylogenetic tree was investigated by comparison of the number of species in each partition (C, C_N, C_C, C_C, C_N, C_C, C_N, and C_C). The topology of the phylogenetic tree was investigated by comparison of the number of phyllosphere, shrub, mesocycline, and cystidia species (C, C_C, C_A, C_N, C_C, and C_A_N).


## Results
 we decided to analyse the fungal community of Dermatophyte s. in order to understand the functional divergence between the yeast genera in Dermatophyte sp.

Phylogeny of closely related yeast genera in Dermatophyte sp.
The average number of genes in all fungal genera in Dermatophyte sp. was 1.8 × 10^-5, with an average of 2.9 × 10^-5 for the genus Dermatophyte sp. In the genus Dermatophyte sp. the average number of genes was 8.2 × 10^-5 (Table 2). All fungi belonging to the genus Dermatophyte sp. shared a common set of 102 genes, and only 1 of them shared with the genus Dermatophyte sp. The most common fungal genes were encoded in the exonic region of the coding sequences.


## Discussion
orientalis and . germinatoria share similar patterns of phylogeny and community structure. The former species formed closely related clades with lower number of members, but higher number of members in the former group. The genus Ophiostoma is represented by two species, O. hansenii and O. germinatoria, but the latter species formed different clades with higher number of members in the former group. The genus Ophiostoma is represented by four species, O. germinatoria, O. orientalis and O. germinatoria. However, only O. germinatoria formed in O. orientalis. Members of Ophiostoma are also found in the genus Dermatophyte (Wendland et al. 2007). Furthermore, the genus Dermatophyte is represented by two species, O. germinatoria and O. germinatoria. Dermatophyte germinatoria is closely related to Dermatophyte sp. (Wendland et al. 2007). Dermatophyte germinatoria is closely related to Dermatophyte sp. (Wendland et al. 2007), while Dermatophyte germinatoria is closely related to Dermatophyte sp. (Wendland et al. 2007). Therefore, we conclude that O. germinatoria and O. germinatoria form distinct species group of Dermatophyte in Dermatophyte spp. (Wendland et al. 2007).

Antifungal activity of aglycone and pyrrolidine derivatives against Candida spp.
The activity of three terpenes, pyrrolidine (C1), pyrrolidine (C2) and pyrrolidine (C3), was evaluated against five Candida spp. based on MIC values and the bioactivity of each compound against a panel of yeast strains (Table 2).

Antifungal activity of aglycone and pyrrolidine derivatives against C. alb. and C. neoformans
The antifungal activity of the aglycone derivative, pyrrolidine (C1), was evaluated against a panel of C. alb. and C. neoformans strains.
