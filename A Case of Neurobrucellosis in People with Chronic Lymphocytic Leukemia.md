## Abstract
Candida auris is an emerging yeast pathogen of great concern among the scientific community because it causes life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients and it is causing an increasing number of hospital outbreaks. In recent years, it has been proposed that C.


## Introduction
The development of the clinical strategies for infectious diseases was shaped by epidemiological, clinical, and industrial considerations. Infectious disease has emerged as a major public health problem, and at the same time there is an enormous economic burden on the health systems of developing countries [1,2]. The emergence of drug resistance, the resulting problems of the control of infectious diseases, and the growing use of antibiotics have made it increasingly difficult to control diseases [3,4].

In addition, the emerging resistance of microbes to drugs has a negative impact on human health, which has become a strong challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. To reduce the emergence of resistance, the use of antimicrobial agents is essential [5,6]. The development of new approaches for the treatment of infectious diseases is urgently required. In this context, the development of new antimicrobial agents is urgently needed.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important public health problem which involves the multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes in the genus Streptococcus. Among these, S. aureus is one of the most common etiological agents and the most common causative agent of life-threatening infections. The emergence of AMR in humans has been mainly due to the multidrug-resistant (MIC) S. aureus [7,8]. The development of new antibiotics and antiviral drugs, which are effective against the multidrug-resistant S. aureus, has been extensively reviewed [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].


## Methods
Strains, plasmids and growth media
The C. neoformans var. grubii strain H99 (serotype A, MATa) was used in this study. The plasmid pYES-CEN (pYES-MATa) was used for the gene replacement of the open reading frame (ORF) of the CEN-deficient mutant of H99 [55]. The plasmid pNEO (pNEO-CEN) was used to transform the prototrophic mutant of CEN [56], and the plasmid pLAL (pLAL-CEN) was used to transform the resistant, CEN-deficient strain of CEN [57]. The vectors pYES-CEN and pYES-CEN-C were constructed by transforming the prototrophic mutant of CEN [56]. The prototrophic mutants were transformed with the vector pYES-CEN-C.

Virulence assay
The virulence of CEN was determined in a previously described murine model of cryptococcosis [58]. Briefly, mice were infected with 1×10^7 CEN cells via the tail vein by intranasal inoculation with 1×10^7 CEN cells. The numbers of CFU were counted after 48 h of infection. To confirm the virulence of CEN cells, the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice was determined in the same way as for the mice. Mice were sacrificed on the seventh day post-inoculation and lung tissues were removed, weighed and homogenized in sterile PBS to obtain the homogenate. The homogenate was plated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates to enumerate CFUs.


## Results

In order to test whether the proliferation of the two Leishmania species was an indicator of their susceptibility to Leishmania infection, we inoculated mice with . parvum by intranasal injection and the spleens were dissected. We observed a significant reduction in L. parvum virulence when the mice were infected with L. parvum only (Fig 2). However, when the mice were infected with L. parvum alone, the virulence of L. parvum was significantly reduced (P<0.05) (Fig 2). These results are in line with the findings that both the L. parvum and L. pneumoniae are the most common forms of L. parvum infection.

In order to further analyze the role of L. parvum in Leishmania infection, we isolated bone marrow-derived macrophages from the spleens and determined the number and phenotype of these macrophages.

In the macrophages isolated from the spleens, L. parvum was associated with more neutrophils and less leukocytes than L. pneumoniae (Fig 3). In contrast, L. parvum was associated with significantly fewer neutrophils and less leukocytes than the other two Leishmania species, and the virulence of L. parvum was significantly reduced (P<0.05) (Fig 3). In this study, the number and phenotype of L. parvum macrophages were similar to those observed in the cell cultures of other Leishmania species.

L. parvum also colonizes the bloodstream in mice
We next determined whether L. parvum was a pathogen of humans or of mice.

In the absence of a positive PCR assay, L. parvum can colonize the bloodstream through the endocytic pathway. Therefore, the initial detection of L. parvum in blood was not possible. We also tested the ability of L. parvum to colonize the blood of mice. We observed that L. parvum colonized the blood of mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight (p<0.05). However, L. parvum was not detected in the blood of mice in the presence of other pathogens.


## Discussion

In a case of neurobrucellosis in a person with HIV, the symptoms included seizures and cranial nerve palsies and seizures were secondary to lymphadenitis and hydrocephalu. The symptoms of neurobrucellosis were characterized by a rapid increase in serum CSF protein, CSF glucose, and CSF glucose and potassium. In our case, the patient was an immunocompetent adult with HIV and was on hemodialysis. The patient had a history of smoking and had a history of renal failure.

Clinical and Translational Allergy Immunology (CLAI) is a diagnostic method that can be used to diagnose neurobrucellosis, and is based on clinical and a radiological evaluation of the brain. The CLAI results in response to multiple signals, including a positive or a negative interventional signal, and a shift to a diagnostic marker can be seen on a positive blood cultures, and in response to CNS signals such as elevated ochratoxin level, elevation of leukocyte or macrophages, and elevated serum serum cytokine levels. There are many similarities between CLAI and other diagnostic methods such as sputum or CSF analysis. The results from the CLAI results can be used to determine the patient's condition and the response of the immune system to the patient's clinical condition. It is important to note that the CLAI results are based on the clinical and a radiological evaluation of the patient's condition and the response of the immune system to the patient's clinical condition. In our case, the patient had a history of renal failure and a history of smoking.

In conclusion, the patient was diagnosed with neurobrucellosis based on a blood culture result, a radiological result, and a CSF analysis result. The patient had a history of renal failure and was on hemodialysis. The patient had a history of cigarette use and was on hemodialysis. The patient had a history of neurobrucellosis and was on hemodialysis. The patient was a cancer patient with high immunologic and molecular evidence of neurobrucellosis. The patient had a history of renal failure and was on hemodialysis.

Therefore, it is possible that the patient had neurobrucellosis secondary to neurobrucellosis. This is similar to the case described in the literature review in the patient with neurobrucellosis.
