## Abstract
The Aginestre dell’Aquila region (Eau Calabria province) is a small principale province in the principale to toto class of the Toa World. The province’s forests are among the most important resources for the production of alcohol. Surveys of the effects of various alcohol densities (H&P ratio, H&P ratio, H2AX/3-hydroxy or <U+03B3> propidyl alcohol content, H&P ratio, H&P concentration and H&P freeze-deterrents have been conducted. The results of the current study support the theory that the province harbors the best potential to develop the potential of native Toa wine making from this tropical region with the possibility of development into a world-class production.

The objectives of the study were to: (i) to determine the H&P ratio, H&P concentration and H&P freeze-deterrents concentration of the four major alcoholic solvents, H2AX/3-H2H2H2 and H2AX/3-H2H2H2; (ii) to determine the percentage of potential foraging for new wine producing regions; (iii) to describe the socio-economic, cultural and environmental effects of the new production region on the Toa World.

The sample of 612 new vintages produced in 12 weeks was analysed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the potential for using the wine varietal, yeast and yeasts as controls for determining the H&P ratio, H2AX/3-hydroxy or <U+03B3> propidyl alcohol concentration and/or the percentage of potential foraging for new vineyards.

The highest potential for new vintages was recorded in a region where the yeast population increased by more than 20% during the growing season. This was supported by the existence of the highest potential for new vintages in the region, where the yeast populations are dominated by the type of yeast species, namely, Wyeast yeasts and Caenorhabditis sp., with similar populations to that in the region. The region harbors the best potential for developing the potential of native Toasts, with the highest potential for H&P ratio of 34.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common and deadly chronic fungal disease in humans, and it is responsible for an estimated 1.6 million deaths every year [1]. T. tuberculosis is responsible for 15% of TB cases and 10% of TB-related deaths in the world, with over 180,000 deaths occurring annually [2]. This is in contrast to other multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and Blastomyces (also called Mycobacterium haemophilum) [3]. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) is considered TB-HIV co-morbidity, with TB accounting for around half of all TB-related deaths and is the third most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/TB co-infected patients [4]. According to WHO, TB is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection and 10% of TB-related deaths are estimated to be AIDS-related [5]. The African continent, however, is the largest TB-HIV co-morbidity region, with an estimated 3.1 million deaths per year [6].

Previous studies have shown that HIV infection has a strong impact on the immune system, with high levels of TNF and IFN-<U+03B3> production and cytokine-activated cell death (CARD) associated with HIV infection [7-10]. These findings are corroborated by the association between HIV infection and severe CD4+ T-cell-mediated IFD in patients with TB and low levels of TNF and IFD in HIV-infected patients [11]. In addition, an increased frequency of HIV RNA in the liver of HIV-infected patients correlates with higher levels of IFD and/or IFD-mediated immunological responses [12].


## Methods
The collection of data was approved by the University of Pretoria Institutional Ethics Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from patients or their surrogat.

Methods
Forty-three patients (n = 19) were included in the study. Among these, three patients had previously been treated with fluconazole, which was not applied to this study. The samples were collected in the South African National Council for AIDS Control (ANC) with a qualitative questionnaire, in order to verify the availability of samples. In addition, five patients were excluded from the study due to their disability. The samples were collected from a very active HIV-associated culture on the right side of the eye and from a very active HIV-associated culture on the left side of the eye. The HIV-associated fungal emboli in this study was identified using the protocol of recently published human microorganism and parasite identification system [2]. A CD4 cell count of 3×10^5 cells/µl was taken from the spleen and examined by flow cytometry. The data from the flow cytometry was analyzed using the FlowJo v. 7 software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). The samples were collected at the median time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 days after the procedure. The treatment status of the patients was documented.

Methods
A total of twenty-five patients (n = 16) were included in the study. The patients were included if they had previously received fluconazole at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day and had been treated with the antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 18 months, and the patients had received either the fluconazole or the ART at a dose of 64 mg/kg/day for at least 3 months. The patients were excluded from the study if they had any serious adverse events. The study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Review Committee (No. 3, April 2013).

Methods
The antiretroviral therapy was started at the indicated time points (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 2.5 weeks after the procedure.


## Results
The mean age was 3.3 years (range, 9.3 - 85.3) and 69.7% were male. There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic group, including age, sex, CD4 count, HIV viral load, CD4 count, or age with regard to any other clinical condition. The mean duration of HIV infection was 17.5 years (range, 1 - 70) and the mean duration of HIV infection was 1.4 years (range, 1 - 27) in the cases with pulmonary emboli compared with HIV infection.

In the population with pulmonary emboli, the mean time to HIV infection was 13.5 years (range, 1 - 63) and the median HIV infection was 2.4 years (range, 0.4 - 4) in the cases with pulmonary emboli. There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic group, including age, sex, CD4 count, HIV viral load, CD4 count, or HIV viral load with regard to any other clinical condition.

Diagnosis and clinical features
In the 18 patients with pulmonary emboli, the most common diagnosis was cryptococcosis (88.3%), followed by HIV infection (55.1%) and hepatitis B (4.5%). The majority of the patients had pulmonary emboli (84.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic group, including age, sex, CD4 count, HIV viral load, CD4 count, or HIV viral load with regard to any other clinical condition.

Clinical and clinical features
The median (range, 0 - 101) duration of HIV infection was 17.2 years (range, 0 - 75.2) and the median duration of cryptococcal meningitis was 0.9 years (range, 0.0 - 7.2) in the cases with pulmonary emboli. The median duration of HIV infection was 17.0 years (range, 0.0 - 101) and the median duration of cryptococcal meningitis was 1.1 years (range, 1 - 20) in the cases with pulmonary emboli. There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic group, including age, sex, CD4 count, HIV viral load, CD4 count, or HIV viral load with regard to any other clinical condition.


## Discussion
The increased prevalence of cryptococcosis in south Africa may have been linked to the introduction of anti-infective drugs in the late 1990s [40, 41] and to the emergence of other fungal infections [42], including C neoforman.

The percentage of patients with CD4 counts of <250 cells/µL was increased from 17.8% in 2005 to 38.6% in 2017, the highest ever recorded. It has been argued that this low proportion of patients with CD4 counts of <250 cells/µL is not a reflection of the advanced nature of the disease, but reflects the reduced accessibility of effective antiretroviral therapy in most patients. There is an increasing trend in the frequency of HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis in the African context [43, 44] and therefore a trend towards an increase in the proportion of patients with CD4 counts of <250 cells/µL.

The proportion of patients with CD4 counts of <250 cells/µL increased from 5.4% in 2005 to 9.9% in 2017. There has been a declining trend in the proportion of patients with CD4 counts of <250 cells/µL in recent years, with the proportion of patients with CD4 counts of >250 cells/µL increasing from 15.9% in 2005 to 21.8% in 2017. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in the African context has been reported to be declining [45, 46]. However, this is the first time that a CD4 count of less than 250 cells/µL has been reported in South Africa. This increase in CD4 count is likely to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of HIV infection and cryptococcal disease. The high proportion of patients with CD4 counts <250 cells/µL is also likely to be associated with the introduction of immunosuppressive therapies.

The proportion of patients with CD4 counts >350 cells/µL decreased from 2.8% in 2005 to 1.4% in 2017. There has been a declining trend in the proportion of patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/µL in recent years.
