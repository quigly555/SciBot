## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HIV and inflammatory and inflammatory response diseases in a general population sample of patients with CD4 counts =150 cells/µL, with a focus on the mastoid phas.

A total of 52 patients were enrolled (53.8%). HIV status was diagnosed on clinical and laboratory records and was classified as HIV-negative (GNRH), HIV-positive (non-GNRH), HIV-repro-/-, HIV-0/0 (non-GNRH). Their CD4 was cytotoxic and the CD4 cell count was =50 cells/µL. Their clinical symptoms were evaluated on clinical and laboratory examinations. The HIV prevalence was estimated using standardized methods, and the association between HIV and inflammatory and inflammatory responses was estimated by statistical tests.

Among the 63 patients with CD4 <100 cells/µL, 37 (56.9%) had CD4 counts between 200-309 cells/µL. The prevalence of HIV was 41.2% (34 of 53) in non-HIV/non-HIV patients, and 55.4% in GNRH patients. In patients with CD4 100-350 cells/µL, the prevalence of HIV was 17.4% (4 of 51) in non-HIV/non-HIV patients, and 13.7% (6 of 51) in GNRH patients, while the prevalence of CD4 350-499 cells/µL was 12.0% (3 of 5) in non-HIV/non-HIV patients and 13.4% (4 of 5) in GNRH patients.

The prevalence of HIV and inflammatory and inflammatory responses in non-HIV/non-HIV patients was significantly higher in non-HIV/non-HIV patients with CD4 200-350 cells/µL than in non-HIV/non-HIV patients with CD4 350-499 cells/µL. This difference might be related to the rapid suppression of CD4, as opposed to CD4 350-1/2 cells/µL of HIV-positive patients.


## Introduction
The parasite, Toxoplasmosis, is the world’s leading cause of tinea corpora, a serious and life-threatening opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Toxoplasmosis is a disease that occurs when the tsetse fly does not migrate away from its host within a few days, and the infected fly experiences a profound reduction in respiratory activity. When the hemopoietic system is established, the infected vertebrate produces a mass, called the parasite’s load, which causes several hundred thousand deaths every year [1]. An important factor that contributes to the pathogenesis of Toxoplasmosis is the immune status of the host, the consequence of a complex balance of innate and adaptive immunity. However, in healthy hosts, the immune system is confronted with pathogens that evade host immunity. In the absence of the innate immunity, such pathogens can proliferate within the hemopoietic system and cause the development of an infection called an acute infection [2].

The acute infection of the CNS is characterized by the gradual paralysis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the breakdown of the barrier between the blood-brain and brain tissues. The ability of pathogens to proliferate within the CNS is referred to as intracellular pathogenesis (IP) [3]. The CNS is the main target for the development of antifungal drugs that are effective against Toxoplasmosis, as the phagolysosome of Toxoplasma does not inhibit the activities of the host immune system [4].


## Methods

In the present study, we performed a retrospective study on the clinical, laboratory, and clinical data from the patients admitted to the hospital for ICU admission in 200. The study involved the patient demographics and the causes of admission. We compared the clinical and laboratory data from the patients with the untreated treatment. The data included the presence of acute lymphadenopathy (ALL) and white blood cell count (WBC). The study was approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Review Board (IRB) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Review Board (IRB) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients with IACD were identified based on their medical history, documented clinical signs and symptoms, and positive blood cultures from their respective sites. The patients with confirmed IACD were identified based on clinical signs and symptoms consistent with IACD. The patients with proven IACD were identified based on positive blood culture results. The patients with proven IACD were identified based on the clinical signs and symptoms consistent with IACD. The patients with proven IACD were identified based on the clinical signs and symptoms consistent with proven IACD.

Data analysis
The data included age, gender, CD4 cell count, history of CM, and CD4 cell count at admission.


## Results
The incidence of mastoid or hyper-PD and PD-CD4 lymphocyte in the 1960s was 1/200, 1/200, 2/200 and 1/200 in the 1970s, respectively [38. However, no scientific literature exists on the effect of CD4 lymphocytes on any patients with PD. We therefore compared the incidence of mastoid or hyper-PD CD4 lymphocyte type in the population of Hispanic patients in the United States during the Vietnam era. The incidence of PD-CD4 lymphocyte type in the Vietnamese population was 1/100, 1/100, 1/100 and 1/100 in 1970, 1970, and 1980, respectively [38]. Thus, PD-CD4 lymphocytes type was the most common PD type in Vietnam and is associated with the most prevalent PD-CD4 lymphocytic cell phenotype in the population.

## Discussion
There are a number of possible ways by which the two C. gattii strains could be detected on cell cultures: (1) DNA extracted from infected mice by flow cytometry, which is method that has been widely used in the study of Cryptococcus spp. isolation [18], [19]; (2) DNA extracted from infected neonates by flow cytometry, which is method used in several studies of C. gattii isolation [22], [23]; (3) DNA extracted from blood or sputum of infected mice, which is method used in several studies of C. gattii isolation [24], [25]; (4) DNA extracted from blood from patients, which is method used in several studies of C. gattii isolation [26], [27]; (5) DNA extracted from sputum of infected mice, which is method used in studies of C. gattii isolation [28]; (6) DNA extracted from sputum of infected mice, which is method used in studies of C. gattii isolation [29], [30]; and (7) DNA extracted from blood or sputum of infected mice, which is method used in studies of C. gattii isolation [31], [32]; and (8) DNA extracted from infected organs by flow cytometry, which is method used in studies of C. gattii isolation [33]; all of these methods have been reported in the literature.

The former method has been applied to detect and quantitate the C. gattii strain in two different studies, which resulted in the detection of three C. gattii strains (C. gattii var. gattii and C. gattii var. gattii) in the same patient [34]; the latter study was conducted in an immunocompetent mouse model and only one patient was infected with C. gattii.

The second method, which has been reported in a few other studies [35], is the analysis of the C. gattii isolates in blood from the same patient, which allowed for the identification of three strains (C. gattii var. gattii, C. gattii var. gattii and C. gattii var.
