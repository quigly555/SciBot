## Abstract
Fungi are known to attack vertebrate embryos and to invade blood vessels in various developmental stages. In vitro infection studies have suggested that Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii may also be able to cause intracellular fungal infection, and our previous studies have suggested that fungal mutants of Cryptococcus spp. may increase susceptibility to antifungal drugs. We have therefore examined the impact of genes in the T-cell receptor gene cluster (TCR) on the ability of C. neoformans and C. gattii to cause intracellular infection in vitro. We show that TCR-mediated intracellular growth in yeast is dependent on a TCR-mediated expression of a CsrG subunit, and the reason for this is not known. We also demonstrate that CsrG affects the ability of C. neoformans and C. gattii to infect murine phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that the TCR pathway is a promising target for new antifungal drugs.


## Introduction
The family of members of the Chlamydiales includes Amphisphaeriales and Chlamydiales (Chlamydiaceae), and their sexual morphs are distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere. The Amphisphaeriales are monomorphic (amphisphaeriales are not distinguished from other Chlamydiales), and have a common sexual morph, but are morphologically distinct. Amphisphaeriales are also related to the Chlamydiales by morphological and genetic differences, and are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Species of Amphisphaeriales are found in the phylum Amparagaceae (1), and some are polyphyletic, although the taxon circumscription is complex (2).

Chlamydiales are primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, including Australia, South America, Mexico, New Guinea, and South Africa (3). The distribution of Amphisphaeriales has been described as a taxonomically complex and multi-factual system based on morphological characters, and the absence of detailed records in terrestrial and aquatic habitats (3). Species of Amphisphaeriales are known to occur mostly on lowland tropical areas, and are known from the southern hemisphere only (3). Amphisphaeriales are also commonly known from the northern part of the temperate zone and the west from the Ganges (4-6). The range of the Amphisphaeriales is limited to the tropics (e.g., northern Brazil) and subtropics (e.g., Italy, the Philippines, and China) (7-9). The species are heterotrophic, and their sexual morph is the sexual morph of Amphisphaeriales (10).


## Methods
Ethics Statement
Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Duke University Medical Center.

Pseudohypha isolates
Pseudohypha isolates P1 and P2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained on SDA at 37 °C in the dark. The isolate of P3 was obtained from the ATCC and was maintained on SDA at 30 °C in the dark.

S. cerevisiae
The P.


## Results
S-ITS2-ITS4-ITS5-ITS6-ITS7-ITS8 sequence. We obtained the sequence of the ACT1-5.8S-ITS2-ITS4-ITS5-ITS6-ITS7-ITS8 sequence in the blood samples (Additional file 2), and the ACT1-5.8S-ITS2-ITS4-ITS5-ITS6-ITS7-ITS8 sequence in the blood samples (Additional file 2). The sequence of the ACT1-5.8S-ITS2-ITS4-ITS5-ITS6-ITS7-ITS8 sequence in the blood samples was not sufficient to confirm the pathogenicity factor identification.

Identification of Fungal Pathogenicity Factor Genes in the Blood Samples
To investigate whether the pathogenicity factor genes could be identified in the blood samples of the five infected patients, we performed RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing on the samples, which yielded a total of 15,014 (1,357-fold-per-gene) candidate genes, which were predicted to encode different pathogenicity factors (Additional file 3). This number of candidate genes was higher than the number of proteins predicted to encode proteins of other fungi (Additional file 3). The gene sets of candidate genes are listed in Table 4. The predicted proteins encoded by the candidate genes are listed in Additional file 3. The gene numbers are the percentage of the total number of genes encoded by the candidate genes in the corresponding gene set. The number of candidate genes in each gene set is represented in Additional file 3.

The candidate genes in the blood samples were selected based on the following criteria: (1) the candidate genes were located in the same locus in the five infected patients; (2) the candidate genes were present in at least two copies in the five infected patients; (3) the candidate genes were present in two copies in the five infected patients; (4) the candidate genes were present in one copy in the five infected patients; and (5) the candidate genes were present in three copies in the five infected patients.


## Discussion
Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare, but apparently important, example of a fungal pathogen. The typical mucocutaneous manifestations of this disease are subcutaneous (13-16%), disseminated (11-14%), and paraneoplastic (3-5%) (4-7). Cryptococcus neoformans is thus an uncommon cause of cryptococcoma.

A systematic review showed that C. gattii is the most common agent in the Vancouver Island outbreak of cryptococcal meningitis (19). Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common agent of cryptococcal meningitis in the United States (20, 21). The majority of cases are caused by C. gattii and C. neoformans (15-17).

Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare but extremely rare cause of cryptococcal meningitis in the United States (22, 23). Cryptococcus neoformans is found in areas of high infection and in association with severe immunosuppression (24). The infection is usually acquired by inhalation of aerosols of a pathogenic yeast or by exposure to solid or liquid components of the skin or mucous membranes (25).

Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast. However, the species is also found in many other forms of human disease (26). The most common forms of C. neoformans are encapsulated, encapsulated and yeast-like, with the former occurring in the bloodstream and the latter in the lungs (27). The latter has also been isolated from a variety of immunocompetent hosts, including patients with AIDS and in immunocompromised patients (28, 29). The species has been isolated from the respiratory tract of immunocompetent individuals (30, 31). The species has also been isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with AIDS (32).
