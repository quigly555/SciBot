## Abstract
In the past few years, the fungal community in terrestrial ecosystems has experienced a significant shift. The transition from the tousan and the tousan/tumor phases have been characterized as essential processes. Here we present a rare study on the diversity and structure of fungal communities associated with lichenized plants in Kongsfjellv, South Africa. The lichen communities were retrieved from individual leaf spots on ten different days, and the tousan and the tousan phases were determined by mycological tests and 16S rDNA sequencing. The lichen communities were sampled at their most restricted sites using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The relative abundance of various taxa was assessed by hierarchical clustering based on the similarity of their protein expression data. The dynamic distribution of the lichen communities was visualized by reconstruction of the lichenosphere. The relative abundance of some fungi was significantly reduced on the tousan-phase days, and these decreased significantly during the tousan phase when compared to the tousan phase. Furthermore, the lichenosphere communities of lichens were more stable than the tousan-phase communities, suggesting that the lichens may be able to adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the fungal diversity associated with lichenized plants in a terrestrial environment. Indeed, the study was carried out in a semi-arid climate, with moderate moisture and fluctuation, which might have played a role in the lichenosphere adaptation to changes in the surrounding environment.

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a life-threatening disease that is primarily caused by two major species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcus neoformans causes the most infections of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is associated with approximately 600,000 deaths per year. Although it is an opportunistic pathogen, the vast majority of cryptococcosis cases are caused by C. neoformans species. As an opportunistic pathogen, it can cause diseases ranging from self-limiting cryptococcal meningitis (CML) to disseminated cryptococcosis (CMC) in immunocompromised individuals. CMC is characterized by the presence of an acute phase of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and the subsequent production of acute phase macrophage inflammatory disease (AID) upon T cell activation.

CMC has been reported in healthy individuals and has been associated with immunosuppression, although this association has not been confirmed by the clinical presentation. In contrast to the better-known cases, the incidence of CMC has been relatively low in the literature, and the most common manifestation of CMC is associated with immunosuppression.

Cryptococcosis can be caused by a variety of species, including Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii, and Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. However, most cases are caused by C. neoformans species, and infections by these species are now known to be rare. Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental organism that usually manifests as meningitis, pneumonia, or meningoencephalitis. However, cases due to C. gattii have been reported worldwide.

This article is an overview of the current knowledge of cryptococcosis, its clinical manifestations, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes in HIV patients in Kuwait.


## Methods
The research was approved by the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Kolkata and was conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by National Institute of Medical Sciences, India [19.

Microbiological analysis
The macroscopic and microscopic features were observed from the specimen with a microscope and the microscopic morphology was observed using a light microscope. The macroscopic morphology was observed with a light microscope and the microscopic morphology was observed using a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse E600). The microscopic features were observed with a light microscope and the morphology was observed using a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse E600).

In situ optical methods
In situ optical methods were performed by immersion in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at room temperature for 20 min. The procedure was carried out in the presence of a vacuum pump (Supelco, Fisher Scientific, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) in the presence of a vacuum pump (Supelco, Fisher Scientific, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA). The suspension was then prepared by mixing the sample with PBS (2% w/v). The suspension was filtered through a 0.45 Âµm nylon filter (Millipore, USA) and then diluted 1:10 in PBS. The suspension was then placed in a tube and the volume of the suspension was adjusted to 1.5 ml using a hemocytometer. Then, the sample was placed on a glass slide and the optical techniques were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope.

In situ optical methods
The staining of dermatophytes was performed using a standard solution of dermatophyllin (DAPI) [20], which contains a mixture of three fatty acid methyl esters, namely, 1,3-bromo-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (BHB), and 1,4-bromo-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (BHB-CAA), and a hydrolytic activity of the cell wall fraction of dermatophyllins (DAPI) [21]. The procedure was carried out with the aid of a solution of 1% DMSO. Then, the sample was applied to a slide (NIKON Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and the stained specimens were observed using a light microscope.


## Results
In these two methods, the in vitro images are used to stimulate fungal cells and to evaluate the in vivo appearance of fungal cells in the patien. The in vivo examination of the in vivo image of fungal cells and fungal cells by in vitro/imaging is the basis of the ongoing in vivo observation of the fungal cells in the patient and by in vitro/imaging methods. To this end, we utilized in vivo imaging techniques for the in vitro detection of fungal cells in the patient by in vitro/imaging. We used the in vivo imaging techniques to evaluate the in vivo appearance of fungal cells and to evaluate the in vivo appearance of fungal cells in the patient by in vitro/imaging.

In contrast to the in vitro imaging technique, the in vivo imaging technique used to examine in vitro fungal cells in the patient using the in vivo imaging techniques. The in vivo imaging technique utilizes the in vivo imaging technique to visualize in vitro and in vivo fungal cells in the patient using in vitro/imaging techniques.

## Discussion
However, the authors did not identify the fungal culture medium used for the screening of CNB-L. Thus, we selected the liquid medium used for the screening of CNB-L1.

The CNB-L1 assay was performed in serum and in serum-fixed mice. The results showed that the CNB-L1 assay identified C. neoformans and C. gattii, and the CNB-L1 assay detected C. gattii. The results of the PCR assay identified C. neoformans and C. gattii, and the PCR assay detected C. neoformans and C. gattii. The results of the RNA-seq study identified C. gattii and C. neoformans, and the results of the RNA-seq study identified C. neoformans and C. gattii, respectively. These results confirm our findings.

The results of the RNA-seq study identified C. neoformans, and the results of the RNA-seq study identified C. gattii, C. neoformans, and C. gattii, respectively. The results of the present study indicate that the screening of CNB-L1 in serum, serum-fixed mice, and serum-reared mice is a useful tool to detect CNB-L1.

In order to further confirm the results of the CNB-L1 assay results, the results of the RNA-seq study were performed using BLT7D2 and BLT8R1 primers. The results showed that the CNB-L1 assay detected C. gattii and C. neoformans, and the CNB-L1 assay detected C. neoformans and C. gattii, respectively. The results of the BLT7D2 assay confirmed the results of the RNA-seq study. The results of the RNA-seq study confirmed the results of the RNA-seq study.

In conclusion, the CNB-L1 assay demonstrated that the CNB-L1 assay detects C. neoformans and C. gattii, and the CNB-L1 assay detected C. gattii and C.
