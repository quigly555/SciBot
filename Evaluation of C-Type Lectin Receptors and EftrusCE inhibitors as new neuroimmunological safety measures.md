## Abstract
Sterol biosynthesis is tightly controlled in order to preserve lipids in the feedstocks and quality of feeds. Oleaginous yeasts are good sources for the major lipids biosynthesis enzymes (LAGs) but have a very limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sterol biosynthesis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteome of the S. cerevisiae strain AK-47-231 with two independent, previously published and new proteomes for yeast strains. We generated a total of 14.36 million proteins and 12.81% of them were annotated to new proteomes. The new proteomes generated from the previously published proteomes were compared to the newly published, and predicted proteomes were constructed for 0-17.6 Mbp. A total of 15.14% of these proteins were assigned to P-Y family and P-Z family, and P-Z family had the largest predicted number of predicted proteins (16.27%). The predicted abundance of P-Y family 30 proteins were up to half of those of the predicted proteins of the P-Y family. The predicted P-Y family proteins were divided into three groups, P-Y, P-Y, P-Z, and P-Z. P-Y and P-Z proteins had the largest predicted number of predicted proteins (1.25 and 0.


## Introduction
One of the most common fungal infections is candidiasis, which ranges in incidence from mild to invasive infection in immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate of candidemia was reported to be as high as 25 to 75% in intensive care units [1]. In addition, an alarming number of patients die from organ failure, with nearly 1,500 reported cases per year [2]. Treatment of fungal infections is particularly difficult due to the high mortality rate, the time required for cure, and the lack of effective antifungal drugs [3]. This difficulty in treating fungal infections is attributed to the fact that a number of fungal species can cause infections in both humans and animals, making it nearly impossible to diagnose and treat. Furthermore, the high lethality associated with these infections is often explained by the intrinsic resistance of fungi to available antifungal drugs, the fact that only a few fungal species cause infections in humans [4], [5].

Increasing evidence indicates that certain Candida species can survive and thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. In fact, the rapid growth and adaptation of C. albicans to different environmental conditions enable this fungus to grow and cause disease even in the presence of oxygen, high temperature, nutrient limitation, and low temperatures [6], [7]. This remarkable ability to adapt to the varied environments is a prerequisite for its successful survival in the face of diverse microenvironments. However, the vast majority of C. albicans cells are unable to grow under laboratory conditions [8], [9]. The capacity to tolerate these stresses is conferred by the ability to sense and adapt to changes in ambient oxygen levels, which, in turn, allow the fungus to invade and cause damage to its own cells [10]. Despite the fact that C.


## Methods
The case report was included in the analysi. The case series was composed of 10 episodes of cryptococcal meningitis (Table 1), 1 episode of pulmonary cryptococcal infection (Table 2), 1 episode of pulmonary cryptococcal meningitis (Table 3), 1 episode of pulmonary cryptococcal meningitis (Table 4) and 1 episode of pulmonary cryptococcal meningitis (Table 5). All the episodes were diagnosed by a microbiological or pathologic pathologist. The epidemiology of the cryptococcal meningitis was considered to be a good predictor of the occurrence of the cryptococcal meningitis. The case series was also analyzed for the prevalence of the C-type lectin and the frequency of disseminated cryptococcal meningitis.

Study Design
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of California, San Francisco, and the Washington University School of Medicine. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was registered as a new and different study under the number of participants. All the ethical guidelines for research in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki were followed. All participants provided written informed consent for study participation.

Definitions
The criteria used in this study are described in detail in a previous study [21]. Briefly, patients were classified into two groups: patients who presented with systemic infection, and patients who presented with non-infectious signs and symptoms, and non-infectious symptoms and signs and symptoms with no response. We defined acute pulmonary infection as a single cryptococcal meningitis episode, and disseminated cryptococcal meningitis as an episode of disseminated cryptococcal meningitis. The diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcal meningitis was defined as a positive cryptococcal culture (positive India ink test, India ink staining, or India ink staining).

The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcal meningitis was defined as a positive culture of cryptococcal antigen on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or in the chest radiograph (RTA) (Figure 1).


## Results
The rate of fungal infection in the fecal microbiota of the first 3 months after the infection was studied in a group of 30 patients. There were 13.4 ± 2.7 and 9.5 ± 1.4 log CFU/g of fecal fungal cultures in the first 3 months after the infection, respectively. The fecal fungal cultures had a higher fungal burden in the first 3 months after the infection, with a linear increase in the number of CFU in the first 3 months after the infection (Fig 1a). No difference in fungal burden was observed between groups 1 and 3 (Fig 1b). There was a trend towards higher fungal burden in the first 3 months after the infection (Fig 1c).

Etiological agent susceptibility testing was performed for the first 3 months after the infection. Enterococcus faecalis was less susceptible to the C-type lectin than E.


## Discussion
Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare but lethal disease of the central nervous system [2]. Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare and fatal disease of the central nervous system. It is caused by Cryptococcus gattii, which are ubiquitous in the environment and are likely to be frequent environmental inhabitants [3]. Although these organisms are ubiquitous and can be inhaled and disseminated to the brain, their prevalence is relatively low [4].

A primary diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is made by the identification of the fungus on the patient’s chest radiograph. The histopathology shows growth of the fungus in serum. In order to confirm the diagnosis, the serum antigen test is performed. In the serological analysis, the detection of C. neoformans in serum was negative. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is made by the identification of the fungus on the patient’s chest radiograph. The histopathology shows growth of the fungus in serum.
