## Abstract
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is the second cause of fungal meningitis in humans. Its ability to grow at temperatures up to 50°C, and to colonize specific environmental niches with minimal to no nutrient limitation, makes it an attractive model for studying pathogenic fungi. Despite the availability of various culture media and isolation techniques, C. glabrata has remained poorly utilized in studies focused on the study of the physiology of the human host. The growth ability, the metabolic activity and the ability to proliferate at this temperature are critical parameters in determining the pathogenicity of this important fungal pathogen. Our study indicates that C. glabrata can grow at the culture medium used by human subjects but it has been demonstrated only in the most minimal form, in quantities that are minimal for growth on minimal growth medium (MLSM), in amino acids that would preclude their use as drug assays. Our results illustrate the power of the mycobiome to determine the physiology of the host and demonstrate that differentiation is determined by several factors including temperature and MLSM. These data are important to gain a better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions in C.


## Introduction
Fungi can produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites, and they are known as pathogenic microorganisms.


## Methods
Strains, media, and culture conditions
The Cryptococcus neoformans strain H99, the control strain, was used in this study. The Cryptococcus neoformans H99-hmp-BADP-CXCR-URA-3 and H99-hmp-CYSI-URA-3 derivative strains were cultured in YPD (2% glucose, 1% peptone, and 1% yeast extract) media at 30°C for 24 h. The mycelium was harvested from 0.5% agar plates, washed with sterile distilled water, and resuspended to a concentration of 10^6 spores/mL.

The mycelium was cultivated in 500 mL of YPD at 30°C for 24 h. The mycelium was collected by filtration and lyophilized. The mycelium powder was filtered by two layers of Whatman #13 filter paper, and stored at -20°C until use.

Morphological analysis of H99-hmp-CXCR-URA-3
The H99-hmp-CXCR-URA-3 strain was maintained on solid YPD media at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelium was harvested and washed with distilled water and resuspended in sterile distilled water. The mycelium was collected and washed with distilled water and resuspended in 0.9% saline solution. The mycelium powder was filtered by two layers of Whatman #13 filter paper, and stored at -20°C until use.

## Results
 2006), the fungus . glutinis produces a typical pheromone receptor, pheromone receptor G (PGR, Pfam), and pheromone receptor V (PKR, Pfam), which are characterized by the presence of a signal peptide (Sangkari et al., 2001). In addition, a pheromone receptor (PKR) and a pheromone receptor (PKR) were identified in the R. glutinis genome, as well as the pheromone receptor (PKR) and pheromone receptor (PKR) genes, respectively. These pheromone receptors are found in R. delemar (Grignard et al., 2009), R. soli (Chao et al., 2014), and R. globosa (Zhang et al., 2008), and are characterized by a PGR, Pfam, or PKR gene, respectively. In addition, the pheromone receptors (PKR and PKR) are found in the R. glutinis genome, as well as in the R. delemar genome. These pheromone receptors are involved in virulence, mating, and mating-type determination in Toxoplasma gondii (Smith et al., 2006; Schmieder et al., 2006; Zasz et al., 2011; Natarajan et al., 2013). The pheromone receptors in R. glutinis are well conserved in other fungi (Smith et al., 2006; Zasz et al., 2011), but the pheromone receptors in R. delemar, R. soli, and R. globosa are highly diverged (Smith et al., 2006; Zasz et al., 2011; Natarajan et al., 2013). Therefore, the pheromone receptor genes in R. glutinis were not expected to be essential for virulence. In contrast, the pheromone receptor genes in R. soli and R. globosa were predicted to be essential for mating (Zasz et al., 2011).

The pheromone receptor genes in R. glutinis and R. soli are likely to be involved in mating, with mating-type determination (Smith et al., 2006; Zasz et al., 2011). In contrast, the pheromone receptor genes in R. glutinis and R.


## Discussion
We have shown that there is a clear enrichment of fungal-specific gene expression differences in the fungal species used in our analyse. We also have observed that the strains used in our analyses are highly efficient at killing pathogens, whereas the strains used in our analyses are very efficient at killing intracellular pathogens. Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting that strains of the major fungal pathogens, S. commune, C. albicans, C. neoformans, C. gattii, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis are highly efficient in killing intracellular pathogens (18, 19, 39, 42).

We have found that the production of Toxoplasma gondii-specific gene expression changes in the Toxoplasma gondii mutant background are similar to those observed in other fungal species. We have also shown that the yeast strains used in our analyses are highly efficient in killing intracellular pathogens, but that they are highly efficient at killing intracellular pathogens. In this regard, our results are consistent with previous studies that the yeast strains used in our analyses are highly efficient at killing intracellular pathogens (18, 19, 40-42). In addition, our findings suggest that Toxoplasma gondii-specific gene expression changes are not restricted to the Toxoplasma gondii mutant background and are associated with a more general response to intracellular pathogens.

In summary, we have identified novel gene expression profiles for Toxoplasma gondii mutants and their gene expression patterns are similar to those of other fungal pathogens in the human fungal kingdom. We have shown that there is a clear enrichment of fungal-specific gene expression differences in the fungal species used in our analyses. We have also observed that the strains used in our analyses are highly efficient at killing intracellular pathogens, whereas the strains used in our analyses are very efficient at killing intracellular pathogens. These findings are consistent with other studies reporting that strains of the major fungal pathogens, S. commune, C. albicans, C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C.
