## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infection, particularly in AIDS patients. Currently, there is very little information on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of this disease. The aim of this study is to explore the association between viral load and the outcome of the main outcome measures measured in our study, namely the Glasgow outcome scale (GA).

Two hundred and thirty four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with scores >4.0 and 4.1 points, by HIV and cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing. The Glasgow outcome scale was used to measure the association between serum cryptococcal antigen (AgA) titers and the Glasgow outcome measure, namely the Glasgow white blood cell (WBC) count. Glasgow regression analysis was performed to determine the association between serum AgA titers =4.0 and the Glasgow outcome measure, namely the Glasgow white blood cell (WBC count), was used to predict the outcome.

We found a positive interaction between AgA titers =4.0 and the Glasgow outcome measure and a positive interaction between AgA titers =4.1 on the Glasgow regressione (P < 0.01) or categorical variable (P = 0.03) as well as a positive correlation between the Glasgow regressione and the Glasgow categorical variable Glasgow white blood cell (WBC count) count (P = 0.01).

Although the Glasgow outcome scale was initially predictive of a positive outcome, the positive association between AgA titers and the outcome was not statistically significant.

## Results
In the present study, we have detected tumor cells in a mouse model of disseminated infection, however, the cancer cell model is a new field of interes. To characterize the tumor cell profile of the human cancer model, we used a whole-cell chromatographic analysis of cell walls of the lung homogenates. We investigated the cell wall structure of the tumor cell line H99, which has been used as a model for human cancer [18]. The cell wall of H99 is composed of two major types of glucan: glucan-1,6-phosphate and glucan-1,6-phosphate [19]. The type of glucan-1,6-phosphate is glucan-1,6-phosphate, whereas the type of glucan-1,6-phosphate is glucan-1,6-phosphate. In addition, the type of glucan-1,6-phosphate is glucan-1,6-phosphate, whereas the type of glucan-1,6-phosphate is glucan-1,6-phosphate. We hypothesized that the lung cancer cells are subjected to the cell wall degrading activity of glucan-1,6-phosphate, as the glucan-1,6-phosphate is degraded.

The total glucan-1,6-phosphate (G-1) is the major type of glucan-1,6-phosphate found in human cells [20]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the cell wall of H99 is subjected to the degradation activity of glucan-1,6-phosphate. We performed an in vitro cell wall degrading assay using an isothermal heat-exchange (IHE) assay. The IHE assay is a well-established method for analyzing the chemical nature of a protein [21]. In order to determine the extent of degradation of a protein, we used an IHE-binding protein assay. The IHE assay allows the detection of G-1 and G-2 glucans in the whole cell by using the fluorescence-labeling dye, which is localized to the cell surface [22]. The IHE assay detects G-1 glucans in a subset of the cell wall of a given cell, which is a typical feature of the cell wall of a cell.


## Discussion
Cryptococcosis is an encapsulated yeast-like fungus caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii. There are two main subtypes of cryptococcosis in humans. The primary fungal infection occurs in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV and those who use corticosteroid therapy. The second fungal infection occurs in patients with an underlying immunocompromised condition and those who are receiving corticosteroids. The diagnosis is made through the use of serological and culture studies.

Cryptococcosis is a mild, non-neutropenic, disseminated disease. It usually affects immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS, solid organ transplants, organ transplants, and solid tumors. There is a high burden of infection in immunocompromised individuals, and cryptococcosis is often fatal. Cryptococcosis can also be caused by inhaled spores, which are encapsulated fungi that can be difficult to isolate and culture from the environment. In addition, cryptococcal species are often isolated from environmental sources such as soil or bird droppings. The most common source of exposure for these fungi is inhalation of pigeons.
