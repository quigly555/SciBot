## Abstract
In this study we explored whether caspofungin (CAA) exerts fungicidal activity against the C. albicans complex. CAA treatment of C. albicans induced the death of wild type (WT) and complemented C. albicans in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that treatment of CAA-treated cells with the drug reduced the number of mycelial foci and induced the death of WT cells in an in vitro model of the central nervous system (CNS). In vivo, CAA treatment reduced the death of C. albicans cells in the acute phase of infection, whereas the recovery phase of infected mice was more protracted than in the acute phase. CAA treatment also induced the death of WT cells in the peritoneal cavity of mice infected with C. albicans. These data indicate that CAA has fungicidal activity against the C. albicans complex.


## Introduction
Dectin-1 and its receptor, Dectin-2, are both expressed on both myeloid and T lymphocytes of T cells and play a role in the immune response to parasites. Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are the key enzymes in the synthesis and degradation of the TCR, which is secreted by most parasites, and is associated with a substantial degree of immunopathology and innate immune responses. The high levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)I expression in T cells and the high IgG content in the T cells of T cells contribute to the importance of Ig in the immune response to parasitic infections. Dectin-1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of phagocytosis, B cell activation, and cytotoxicity of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. The receptor is expressed on macrophages, macrophage stromal cells, and neutrophils. Dectin-1 and its receptor, Dectin-2, have been shown to play a role in the regulation of macrophage activation and phagocytosis. Dectin-1 was demonstrated to be important for the induction of apoptosis of macrophage stromal cells. Dectin-1 was shown to be a potent anti-parasitic receptor.

Sample collection and isolation
Samples were collected from five different communities in different locations in the Rift Valley region of India. The first three communities were located in the Ganges, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal states (Table 1). Samples were taken from these communities at four different times, in November, December, January, and February of 2016. The first three communities were located in the Ganges, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal states. Samples were collected from these communities at four different times, in April, July, August, and September of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at three different times, in November, December, and January, and from March, April, July, August, and September of 2016. The fourth community was located in the West Bengal region, and samples were collected from three different communities, in April, June, and July, and from May, August, and September of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at four different times, in April, June, and July, and from June, July, and September of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at three different times, in October, November, and January, and from March, August, and September of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at three different times, in February, September, and November of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at three different times, in November, December, and January, and from November, January, March, August, and September of 2016. The fifth community was located in the West Bengal region, and samples were collected from three different communities, in June, September, and October, and from June, September, October, November, and December of 2016. Samples were collected from these communities at four different times, in June, September, and October, and from June, September, October, and November of 2016.


## Results
spg.org/ABVE_F/ARV2020/index.jsp) provided an overview of the implications of climate change on the health of rural and urban Indian populations. The emerging science of the ARV2020 study clearly identifies key recommendations for public health. The recommendations include a series of recommendations on ensuring that the levels of incidence of human-animal interactions (HIV) were not over-interpreted in the model-based research based on the studyâ€™s results. The authors recommend that the HIV/AIDS epidemic be managed in a country where the incidence of HIV/AIDS be high.
