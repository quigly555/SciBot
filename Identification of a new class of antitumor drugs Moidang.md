## Abstract
The objective of this study was to analyze the composition of microflora of the soil at Kochi Nandi, Kochi Vidyasagar, and Kochi Vidyasagar using Microplate Quest (MQ) software for high-throughput data analysis. The analysis was conducted using Microplate reader (MP) and D-class scanner (DSU-50-T). The total composition of the microflora was classified according to the types of soil species (area, by-soil, by-soil, by-soil). Statistical analysis was done using the SAPANDA algorithm. A total of 350 variables were analyzed in the analysis.


## Introduction

Although most drugs are expressed as single-pass conjugates, many antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, fungicides, growth-inhibitory compounds (IN), and inhibitors of DNA synthesis, share a common mode of action, which is linked to their penetration into the cell membrane and their destabilization in the host cell membrane (Cogoni and Bergman, 2007. Some drugs are also expressed as multiple-pass conjugates, which allow their rapid uptake in the cell and their wide variety of activities, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), bacteriocins, enzymes, enzymes involved in cell wall remodelling, apoptotic or oxidative processes, cell wall remodelling, oxidative stress response, and DNA damage (Eyre et al., 2006; Feeney et al., 2013; Saito et al., 2013; Lebeaux et al., 2014; Amann et al., 2014; Mora-Montalcabena et al., 2015; Aamer et al., 2015; Espinal et al., 2016; Figueiredo et al., 2018). The dual modes of action of antifungals include binding to DNA and penetration, as well as inhibition of the DNA replication machinery (reviewed in Figueiredo et al., 2018).

C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes fatal meningoencephalitis, mainly in immunocompromised hosts. The global burden of cryptococcosis ranges from 40% to 75% (Chaffin, 2012), and it is the most common cause of adult meningoencephalitis in sub-Saharan Africa (Chaffin, 2012). The major virulence factors of C. neoformans include the ability to grow at 37 °C (Coyne and Orr, 2003), the capacity to produce melanin pigment in the presence of SA (Esteves et al., 2007), and the ability to adhere to the host cell walls in order to damage it (Coyne and Orr, 2003). The most studied virulence factor of C. neoformans is the melanin pigment (Larsson and Orr, 2006), which consists of a polysaccharide capsule, composed of three interconnected polysaccharides, a polysaccharide-rich outer layer and a cell wall-associated melanin.

## Results
Antifungal drugs are presented in Table 4 for a detailed overview of the new classe.

The most promising new compounds, including Moidang-2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5, showed promising activities. The antimicrobial activities of Moidang-2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5 were also in the range of M_1-M_2, M_3-M_4, M_5-M_6, M_7-M_9, and M_8-M_12. In addition, M_3-M_4 and M_5-M_6 showed promising activities. The antifungal activity of Moidang-2 was also in the range of M_1-M_2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5 were also in the range of M_3-M_4 and M_5-M_6. The antifungal activities of Moidang-2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5 were also in the range of M_1-M_2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5.

Antifungal activity of new drugs against M. sympodum
As the antifungal properties of the new antifungal drugs are in the range of M_1-M_2, M_3-M_4, M_5-M_6, M_7-M_9, and M_8-M_12, a potential novel drug combination against M. sympodum is proposed. The antifungal activity of Moidang-2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5 against M. sympodum was also in the range of M_1-M_2, Moidang-3, and Moidang-5.

To evaluate the potential anticandidal activity of the new antifungal drugs against M.


## Discussion
albicans was shown to be the first report of such a cyclophilin as a potential antifungal drug against . albicans (Fig 2). We found that the Moidangin A-like cyclophilins bind to C. albicans cell wall components and that their binding is dose-dependent and/or involves the hydrophobic domain of C-type cyclophilins (Fig 3). The Moidangin A-like cyclophilins are known to bind to the GPI anchor of GPI-anchored GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-anchored proteins), and their interaction with this structure also increases the accessibility of the GPI anchor to the inhibitor (Fig 4). These results suggest that the cyclophilins bind to C. albicans cell wall components and that the cyclophilins may interact with GPI-anchored GPI-anchored proteins.

The Moidangin A-like cyclophilins, which bind to the C-terminal of the cyclophilins, were also found to be active against C. neoformans (Fig 4). It has been shown that Moidangin A-like cyclophilins are able to bind to the cell wall and to the cell membrane (Zheng et al., 2015). In addition, the binding of the Moidangin A-like cyclophilins to the cell wall of C. neoformans (Fig 4) was also shown to be dose-dependent and therefore requires a pH-dependent interaction with the cell wall component. In this study, the Moidangin A-like cyclophilins were found to bind to C. neoformans cell wall components.

The mode of action of Moidangin A-like cyclophilins against C. albicans was determined by their activity against C. neoformans (Fig 5). Moidangin A-like cyclophilins were active against C. albicans at a concentration range of 0.8-8.0 µg/mL and showed activity against C. neoformans at a concentration range of 8.0-10.0 µg/mL. This suggests that the cyclophilins inhibit C. albicans growth.
