## Abstract
The increase in the number of opportunistic pathogens and the limited number of antifungal drugs available represent one of the main reasons for the current restrictions on their development.


## Introduction
2008, Gorod et a. 2013, Zhou et al. 2014). They produce a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds including the traditional sugars, phenols, flavonoids and carotenoids that are essential for the growth of the most important fruit crops, such as fruit, vegetables, fruit juice, fruit products, and other food products (Djungblad et al. 2008, Zhou et al. 2014). They are able to hydrolyze the major sugar alcohols such as glucose, fructose, oleic acid, fructose and galactose (Coutinho et al. 2002, Gorod et al. 2013). These compounds have been found in the phytosanitary of fruits, however, it is often not known how the biosynthesis of these compounds occurs (Vermout et al. 2014). Thus, some researchers have focused on the microbial diversity of fruit-juice tasters. However, no study has yet conducted so far to compare the microbial species present in different varieties and levels of sugar alcohols.

Bacteria, yeasts, and fungi are found in most of the fruits and vegetables (Djungblad et al. 2008, Zhou et al. 2014). Bacteria are mainly present in the inner tissues of fruit. They are also present in the leaf tissue, however, it is usually not known how these microbes are found in the food industry (Djungblad et al. 2008, Zhou et al. 2014). Yeasts are mainly present in the outer tissues of the fruits. They are usually present in the outer leaf tissue or the leaf itself. Yeast strains that are commonly found in the outer leaf tissue of vegetables tend to be of low abundance in the food industry (Kaur and Singh 2009). Yeast species present in fruits tend to be more abundant than those present in vegetables (Djungblad et al. 2008, Zhou et al. 2014). Most of the species present in the outer leaf tissue are of low abundance. They tend to be isolated from natural environments. However, a few species have been reported in artificial environments like food, water, air, and even in certain industrial processes (Shikaki et al. 2002, Zhou et al. 2014).


## Methods
. Study Area and Site
The study was carried out on the grasslands of Jumloisi, the former Indian Oceanic (O) and Antarctic (A) Oceanic (O) and Antarctic (A) Marine (A) Oceanic (A) Marine (A) Oceanic (A) Marine (A) Oceanic) state with a mean annual temperature of 12.5Â°C and a mean annual rainfall of 11.945 mm in January 2011. The location was located in the Thirteen River Plate Region of the Antarctic (O) and the Antarctic (A) area is approximately one hundred and fifty-six km from the nearest French Antarctic Ocean port and the area is composed of ices (N, T, N, O, P, S) and basaltic permafrost. The sampling area is situated in the Thirteen River Plate Region and has a mean annual temperature of 15.


## Results
01. The most abundant genus Microsporidia was found in the red fruit and red wine samples (Fig 4). Dothideomycetes was found in both red and red fruit samples (Fig 4). The Dothideomycetes was found in both red and red wine samples. The Dothideomycetes was found in red wine samples and was found in red wine samples. The only exception was the red wine samples that were found to contain the species Dothideomycetes. All the red and red wine samples were not found to contain the species Dothideomycetes.

The number of OTUs (100%) in each of the three replicates were 0.064 in red, 0.065 in red, and 0.046 in red (Table 2). The OTUs were assigned to the class Microsporidia (Fig 5). The most abundant class Microsporidia was found in the red fruit and red wine samples (12). The most abundant genus Dothideomycetes was found in the red fruit and red wine samples (19). The most abundant genus Dothideomycetes was found in red wine samples and was found in red wine samples. The most abundant genus Dothideomycetes was found in red wine samples.

For each of the three replicates, the total number of reads was analyzed by using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing technology. The total number of reads in the red, red, and red wine samples was compared for each of the three replicates, and the results are presented in Table 2. The total number of reads in the red, red, and red wine samples was found to be high (mean 0.238, 0.230, and 0.036 reads, respectively). The total number of reads in the red wine samples was low (mean 0.89, 0.96, and 0.12, respectively). The total number of reads in the red wine samples was low (mean 0.72, 0.34, and 0.11, respectively). The total number of reads in the red wine samples was low (mean 0.30, 0.19, and 0.068, respectively).


## Discussion
A previous study of sugar beet fruits revealed the presence of 38 genera, 18 species and 17 species of fungi, and there were 36 species of microorganisms in sugar beet fruits (Abe et a. 2014). In this study, the occurrence of yeasts and bacteria was higher than in previous studies conducted in sugar beet (Table 1). The differences between the sugar beet fruit samples were found to be as follows: (i) the yeast-positive strain, including strains of Pichia, Cryptococcus, Aureobasidium, and Rhodotorula, was detected in the strawberries samples, and (ii) the yeast-positive strain, including strains of Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhodotorula and Rhodotorula sp., was detected in the strawberry samples, but not in the strawberries samples. The genus Rhodotorula (Yarrowia) was found to be the predominant genus in the samples collected in sugar beet fruits, and the yeast-positive strain, including strains of Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhodotorula and Rhodotorula sp., was detected in the strawberry samples but not in the strawberries samples (Figure 2). It is noteworthy that the yeast-positive strain, including strains of Cryptococcus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhodotorula and Rhodotorula sp., was detected in all samples, but not in the strawberry samples, and the strain of Rhodotorula sp. was detected in the strawberry samples but not in the strawberry samples (Figure 3). Yeast species in this study also differed significantly in their occurrence.
