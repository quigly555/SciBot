Gra<U+021B>iel, Pro. Daniela Hoselakin, Dr. Gra<U+021B>iel, Dr. Robert Fisk, Dr. John Logsdon, Dr. John Logsdon, Dr. John Crous, Dr. John Wiley, Dr. Ronald C. Bunyan, Dr. John A. Swart, and Dr. John W. Swart, offer their perspectives on how to apply their Specialty to the treatment of Dermatophytosis. Specialty Description: Targeted Antibody Therapy, a method for the treatment of autoimmune and opportunistic infections, has been proven to be effective for treating patients with immune deficiencies. The aim of this article is to review the current treatment of autoimmune and opportunistic dermatophytosis, to provide a brief introduction of targeted antifungal therapy and discuss the current challenges and future directions of this therapeutic method.

A brief introduction: Dermatophytosis is a gross infection that tends to resolve in healthy individuals, in spite of therapy, after which the symptoms and the bacteria are harmless. To overcome these problems, special preparations of dermatophytic solvents such as ethyl acetate and phenol (phenglycine and phenyl acetate) can be obtained, although their effects are curative. There are also other forms of treatment that work well in spite of treatment, including immune suppressive treatments such as corticosteroids, sertraline, and caspofungin.

It is important to consider that the treatment of the immune deficiency of the dermatophyte is not only effective for the patient with advanced stage, it can also be beneficial for the patients with advanced stage. However, there are some complications during the treatment of a clinical dermatophyte. To be more specific, there are also some important terms that have to be understood. These terms were firstly applied in the context of treatment of the mentioned forms of treatment and are nowadays defined as those terms defined in the legislation of relevant international organizations or the guidelines of clinical laboratories that were carried out in force at the time of the last international agreement (or the regulations adopted by the competent authorities).


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections has risen over the past decade, with the number of susceptible individuals estimated to reach over one million annually (1). This increase is partly attributed to the widespread use of immunosuppressive drugs, antifungal chemotherapy, and immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, all of which increase morbidity and mortality rates in patients with these conditions (2). It is also partly a consequence of the increase in patients with compromised immune system due to an increased incidence of infections by pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (3). Invasive fungal infections are also increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (4, 5).

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Screening Guidelines for the Treatment of Invasive Fungal Infections recommend amphotericin B (AmB) and 5-flucytosine (5-FC) for the treatment of invasive fungal infections (6). These recommendations are based on empirical data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. The recommendations are based on data from Europe and Japan.

Amphotericin B, an azole antifungal, is active against yeasts (7, 8). AmB is a combination of the prodrug and the first-line drug of the AmB-ZolPIN system (AmB-Zol). The first-line treatment for invasive aspergillosis is oral 5-FC, followed by fluconazole (FLC) for the first-line treatment (9).


## Methods
Data Source
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (Protocol number 2014837-01), and all participants gave written informed consent. The research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, which is the central principle of international principles for biomedical research and the procedure of research is not subject to extra-legal risks.

Study Population and Sample Size
The study cohort included patients with CD4 cell count < 100 cells/mm^3, or with a plasma < 5 cells/mm^3 and a history of non-HIV-infections. The total numbers of CD4 cell counts were calculated using the Beckman Coulter cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
