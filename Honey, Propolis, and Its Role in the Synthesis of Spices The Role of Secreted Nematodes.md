## Abstract
Polymeric metals have been suggested as effective antimicrobial agents in the industrial production of Staphylococcus aureus. Aspergillus spp. is the most common causative agent of invasive A. fumigatus infections in humans, and metals not only have antimicrobial activity but also antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. and dermatophytes. Previous study reported that manganese and copper have antimicrobial activity against A. fumigatus but no studies have reported antimicrobial activity of copper against A. niger. In this study, we found that the fungicidal behavior of manganese and copper was dependent on the zinc and manganese coordination, and this effect was enhanced when the A. niger strain was grown in copper-rich media. Further, the growth of the A. niger strain inhibited the growth of A. fumigatus in both the presence and absence of these two metals. The inhibition of growth of the A. niger strain inhibited the conidial growth of A. fumigatus in both the presence and absence of these metals. In contrast, the conidia of the conidia of the A. niger strain were inhibited in both the presence and absence of these metals. Taken together, these results suggest that manganese and copper can be used as anticandidal agents by blocking the conidiomata formation, and copper detoxification can be effective in blocking the conidial toxicity. These findings indicate that zinc and manganese coordination are important in the regulation of the conidial toxicity of copper.


## Introduction
The alkaloids in propolis are extremely long-chain fatty acids (C20:0) and the fatty acids from propolis are water soluble and have a high affinity for the phytocompounds and phytocompounds-those known as N- and O-dextran or paroufolin, respectively-named by . alpina and by other propolis species, which include the olive oil, the propolis, and the green propolis, propolis, propos, and propolis aroma. In propolis the phytocompounds, including propolis alkaloids, are active by acting as a functional enzyme. Propolis plants contain a variety of phytocompounds which are essential to the active structure of the aromatic compound, propolis flavonoids (a- and ß-sitosterol). However, the major phytocompounds, such as propolis flavonoids, are also present in other propolis species and some of them are also active metabolites, like the flavonoids, flavanones, and eugenol. In general, propolis is a good source of essential oil (over 75% of the total number of propolis), which is used as a starting material for the synthesis of many commercial applications, such as the production of the flavor and aroma of many Asian liquors, such as the Korean version of Negroni (Shanhee et al., 2013), the Chinese version of Dongxing-Jia (Zheng et al., 2015), and the Japanese version of Nagahama (Yama and Kubo, 2010). In this study, the major phytocompounds, namely propolis flavonoids, flavanones, and eugenol, were evaluated in order to determine their functional activity.

The three major phytocompounds, propolis, and propolis aroma, are characterized by phenolic and/or toluene residues. Propolis aroma is mainly produced by the non-alkylated aromatic compounds of propolis, which are mainly produced by the oxidation of the aromatic compounds to to oxygen and/or nitrogen, which leads to the formation of lignocellulosic materials. Propolis aroma is mainly produced by the oxidation of aromatic compounds, which lead to the formation of aromatic lignin and wood components (Nagahama et al., 2010).


## Methods
[48.

In this study, the antimicrobial activity of the selected compounds was tested in vitro. The inoculum was prepared from 1-month old Lactobacillus sp. and M. smegmatis yeast culture and used to inoculate a 10 mL of rich medium (2% agar). The solid medium was replaced after 24 h with distilled water and the microbial suspension was obtained by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was extracted twice with 20% EtOH and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. The antimicrobial activity was obtained by the addition of 10% HCl to the solid medium and the rate of increase was calculated from the wavelength of the absorbance at 550 nm. The blank control, with 100 µL of PBS, was used as blank control. The same volume of the sample (2 mL) was then spread on a nutrient-rich medium plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C and the number of colony forming units per gram of yeast was determined. The antimicrobial activity of the selected compounds was determined on the basis of the reduction in the optical density at 600 nm. The antimicrobial activity was obtained by the addition of 0.25% SDS to the solid medium and the optical density at 600 nm was measured. The antimicrobial activity was calculated as the absorbance at 600 nm.

Antimicrobial activity of the selected compounds was obtained by the treatment with the appropriate antibiotics according to the method by Koch et al. [49]. The antimicrobial activity of the selected compounds was tested in vivo in a mouse model of colitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (2.0 kg) were used for experiments. They were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment, and were treated with antibiotics at the following concentrations: 0.125, 0.125 mg/kg of body weight and 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 mg/kg of body weight. The rats were weighed and monitored daily. The animals were fed in a specific pathogen-free environment, and were treated with antibiotics at the following concentrations: 0.125, 0.125 mg/kg of body weight, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 mg/kg of body weight.

## Discussion
This result is in line with the finding that the sugar group (sp/ß) of the anions is not a conserved part of the sugar residues involved in the synthesis of sp/ß [35, 36.

Sugar-binding affinity of the spiced sugars
The S-bonds in the sugar-binding pocket of Spice proteins were investigated, and the results are presented in Table 3.

The most important characteristic of the S-bonds in the sugar-binding pocket was that all the spice proteins had the same affinity towards the spiced sugars. The Spice B and C residues of Spice proteins are the main ones involved in the C-terminal GTP-binding, and in the active site. The C-terminal GTP-binding of Spice B and C is the main domain, and also the active site, of the Spice proteins. These results indicate that the Spice proteins are fully involved in the C-terminal GTP-binding of Spice proteins.

The spicing of the C-terminal GTP-binding domain of Spice B and C was very efficient, and these results indicated that these proteins have the same affinity for the spiced sugar. This result is also in line with the finding that the spicing of the C-terminal GTP-binding domain of Spice B and C was very efficient, and these proteins have the same affinity for the spiced sugar.

The most important characteristic of the S-bonds in the sugar-binding pocket of Spice proteins was that the C-terminal domains of Spice proteins have the same preference for the spiced sugar. This result is in line with the finding that the C-terminal domains of Spice proteins are the main domain, and also the active site of the Spice proteins. These results indicate that the Spice proteins are fully involved in the C-terminal GTP-binding of Spice proteins.
