## Introduction

Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are a class of molecules that are present in fungi as diverse as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans (Patel et a., 2015). Glucosylceramides (GlcCer) are the principal members of the GSL family. The GlcCer family is found in all fungal phyla but has a restricted structure that includes a cer-3-phosphate unit and a lipid group (Tong et al., 2017). The most important GSL family members include the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and the carbohydrate-binding superfamily (C-B families) (Hara and Akiyama, 2017). The MFS is comprised of a family of glycosphingolipids, including GSLs, Mfs and liposomal amphipathic sterols, and GSLs are known as mycosomes, which can be found in cells of fungi, bacteria, plants, animals and humans (Garcia et al., 2015; Fang and Cantillo, 2017). The C-B families are responsible for the structural structure and the secretion of a wide range of virulence-related proteins and molecules into the extracellular environment (Hara and Akiyama, 2017). The MFS are phylogenetically diverse and distributed among all fungal phyla except for the dermatophytes and yeasts (Kaur and Singh, 2017). There are six main families of the MFS, namely GSLs, Mfs and lipids (Dinan and Gopal, 2011). In the MFS, the fatty acids are the major building blocks of glycan membranes and the fatty acid composition varies with the fungal species (Watervolo et al., 2011). These molecules are important to virulence of the fungus, and several molecules are toxic to the host cells and contribute to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as the production of toxic metabolites by the fungal cell, as well as the formation of cell wall associated protrusions that prevent the immune system from recognition them (Mulholland et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017). The C-B families are absent in fungi. Only two families of the GSL are present in fungi: the MFS and C-B families.


## Methods
It was considered a “diagnosed” disease if the patients survived at least two weeks after ART initiatio. When a single clinical outcome was found, an additional clinical outcome was considered for inclusion. The incidence of clinical outcome was defined as the number of cases of Cryptococcus infection per 100,000 person-years (PEPFUS) in 2010 (the number of HIV infected persons per 100,000 person-years [pEPFUS) in 2010, divided by total HIV infected persons per 100,000 person-years [PEPFUS].

We assumed that HIV infection in cryptococcosis cases was associated with a higher incidence of clinical outcomes than other infectious diseases in cryptococcosis (ie, fewer adverse events and more rapid response times). When HIV infection was considered a clinical outcome, only AIDS cases were included in the analysis. We also assumed that HIV infection in the pneumococcal meningitis phase was associated with a higher incidence of clinical outcomes than other infectious diseases in pneumocystiosis (ie, fewer adverse events, more rapid response times). We assumed that all participants with positive latex sputometry, cytology or culture positive blood cultures were also positive for HIV infection, with the exception of those with cryptococcal meningitis, who were excluded from the study due to lack of sample availability. The reasons for exclusion of participants with positive latex sputometry were based on the assumption that HIV infection is not associated with a higher incidence of clinical outcomes than other infectious diseases.

The following assumptions were applied to the results of the study: (1) HIV infection is not associated with a lower incidence of clinical outcomes in pneumocystiosis; (2) HIV infection is not associated with a higher incidence of clinical outcomes in pneumocystiosis; (3) HIV infection is not associated with a higher incidence of clinical outcomes in pneumocystiosis; and (4) the incidence of clinical outcomes associated with the infection was the same in the pneumocystiosis group.

Ethical considerations
All studies that met the following criteria were conducted according to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committees of both the hospital and the research center approved the study. All research conducted by the research center was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Federal University of Pernambuco, and all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study.


## Results
Transcriptome analysis
A total of 16464 transcripts were identified from a total of 994 samples, representing 158 transcripts in five biological replicates. The relative abundance of transcripts was calculated by applying a Log-rank test (see Methods). The enriched categories were categorized into biological process, biological process(s), molecular function, and molecular function(s).


## Discussion
gattii in mic. We identified the genes and proteins involved in fungal virulence in C. gattii meningitis, demonstrating that C. gattii can affect the immune response in vivo and induce host immune responses in vivo. We also identified the genes and proteins involved in host immunity and pathogenicity. This study adds to the growing list of fungal pathogens that can cause diseases in humans.

Genome-wide analysis revealed a number of novel virulence factors

Genome-wide analysis revealed that a number of C. gattii genes and proteins were unique to the isolate in comparison to other C. gattii strains. We also identified genes involved in the serotype A strain, with the exception of the C. gattii VNI genome. This observation suggests that the VNI genome has a unique gene encoding for an RNA-binding protein, which has not been previously identified in C. gattii. Our analysis suggests that the VNI genome encodes a protein with unknown function. This protein, involved in host-pathogen interactions, is part of a genome-wide gene duplication event of C. gattii in the C. neoformans var. grubii (VGII) population. The VNIV genome encodes a protein encoded by a region of the VNIV.eu protein-coding gene cluster with the exception of VNI genome. However, we did not identify the VNIV homolog in C. gattii. To our knowledge, this is the first time that C. gattii has been identified as a unique pathogen.

C. gattii has been reported to cause infection in humans by the invasive species Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, which causes human disease [28]. The C. gattii VGII strain was isolated from a patient and was found to be a virulent strain, which is consistent with the VNI genome. The C. gattii VGII strain was also isolated from a patient and was found to be a virulent strain. The VNI genome encodes a protein encoded by the VGI gene cluster with the exception of VGI. This protein has not been previously identified in C. gattii. The VNIV genome encodes a protein encoded by the VNB gene cluster with the exception of VNI. This protein has not been previously identified in C.
