## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the etiological agent of the emergent fungal disease C. gattii. Unlike the related Aspergillus species, C. gattii is relatively scarce in arid vegetation and extreme environments. We previously demonstrated that A. fumigatus meningitis is caused by the A. fumigatus necrotic complex (NFSC) infection. To further understand the virulence attributes of this organism, we investigated the association between fungal communities and fungal burden in various tissues.

We isolated fungi from lung tissue of 4 pigs with invasive fungal disease at the Asupendous West Nile Hospital, Burkina Faso. Ham samples were collected and tested for the presence of aspergillosis and investigated for the presence of microbiota using quantitative PCR and fungal burden analysis.

Fungal burden was higher in the lung tissue of the infected pigs compared to the tissues of control pigs. The number of fungi detected in pigs was similar between the two groups. Although the number of Aspergillus species detected in pigs was higher than that in pigs of the control group, the number of Aspergillus species detected in hamsters was higher than that in the control group. In addition, the abundance of Candida albicans and non-albicans yeasts were detected in both groups.

This study demonstrated the importance of fungal communities in pig lungs of pigs compared to aspergillosis and investigated for the fungal microbiota in pigs. Aspergillosis was the commonest fungal cause in pigs in both the control and A. fumigatus hemolymph. Pig hemolymph as well as Aspergillus were the predominant Aspergillus species in both groups.

## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a serious opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. It is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, a major fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients [1]. CM is an AIDS-defining illness and a leading cause of mortality among AIDS patients in many regions around the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America [2,3]. In this context, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection by conventional microbiologic tests is routinely used in the diagnosis and management of patients with cryptococcal disease. In this context, the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia and the CrAg lateral flow assay (CrAg LFA) are well-established case studies in HIV-positive patients, especially in Africa, which has an estimated 220,000 to 250,000 newly diagnosed patients with cryptococcal disease annually [4].

We herein report a case of cryptococcal antigenemia with CrAg LFA in a patient with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. This case emphasizes the importance of CrAg LFA in the diagnosis and management of cryptococcal meningitis, and further highlights the potential association between CrAg LFA and HIV infection.


## Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of KwaZulu-Natal University (Approval Number: 19/CEUA-2012-001) and all animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsink.

Culture and purification of S. apiospermum isolate
S. apiospermum isolate R9ACF-1 from S. apiospermum strain H99 was used as a culture medium. The culture was cultured at 25 °C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and subcultured on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 48 h.

S. apiospermum isolate R9ACF-2 was used as a culture medium. The culture was cultured at 25 °C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and subcultured on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 48 h.

S. apiospermum isolate R9ACF-3 was used as a culture medium. The culture was cultured at 25 °C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and subcultured on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 48 h.

Determination of antimicrobial activities of S. apiospermum isolate R9ACF-2
The antimicrobial activity of the S. apiospermum isolate was determined as previously described [20]. Briefly, the S. apiospermum isolate was cultured at 25 °C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h and subcultured on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 48 h. The culture was subcultured on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at 28 °C for 48 h. The bacterial suspension was adjusted to the desired concentration using sterile distilled water.

## Results
The original murine model (Figure 1) was used to assess the frequency of immune cells in the ventricle and throughout the bod. In this model, lung and brain immune cells were recruited into the ventricle by primary immune cells and these cells subsequently disseminated to the rest of the body. Thus, lungs were treated with different combinations of in vivo and murine models of infection.

We first employed a murine model of pulmonary infection, which was chosen because murine immune cells are capable of being recruited to the ventricle by primary immune cells (8, 15). A murine model of pulmonary infection was used to assess the frequency of in vivo and murine in vivo models of infection (Figure 2). In this model, the lungs were infected by primary immune cells, and fungal cells were identified by immunofluorescence. Lungs were infected with a murine or a murine model of infection, and lung and brain immune cells were recruited by primary immune cells. In both murine and murine models, fungal cells were observed in the ventricle at least three times.

We then used murine models of infection to assess the frequency of in vivo and murine models of infection. Lung and brain immune cells were observed in the ventricle at least once. The frequency of in vivo and murine models of infection in the ventricle was determined by the presence of neutrophils in the lung and brain. In both models, the frequency of in vivo and murine models of infection was higher than that in the ventricle. In both models, the infection frequency was significantly higher than that in the ventricle.

We then examined the incidence of in vivo and murine models of infection by comparing the frequency of in vivo and murine models of infection in the ventricle. The incidence of in vivo and murine models of infection was significantly higher than that in the ventricle in both murine and murine models of infection. In both models, the incidence of in vivo and murine models of infection was significantly higher than that in the ventricle.


## Discussion
We should note that our patient was an immunocompetent patient with low CD4 count and had not been exposed to cholecystokini. We believe that the most likely cause of the disease was a fungal infection, but the immunocompetent patient, as described in this case, was not immunocompetent. The patient with the fungal infection had a CD4 count of 143 cells/µL, which is below the CD4 count for C. neoformans (approximately 150 cells/µL). The fungal infection was diagnosed on examination of the patient’s CD4. The patient’s CD4 was not elevated, and he was not infected with any fungi.

The patient had a low CD4 count, which is also above the CD4 count for C. neoformans. This low CD4 count is likely related to the immunosuppressive effects of cholecystin. The patient’s CD4 was not elevated, and he was not infected with any fungi. This low CD4 count could have been the result of immunosuppression. The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was not infected with any fungi. The patient’s CD4 was not elevated, and he was not infected with any fungi. Therefore, the infection could have been caused by C. neoformans.

Fungal infection is a rare disease in humans. It occurs in immunocompromised patients, and it is usually diagnosed by direct immunological testing, such as positive blood culture, a negative blood smear, or positive serology. The patient’s CD4 was not elevated, and he was not infected with any fungi. The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was not infected with any fungi. The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was infected with any fungi. The patient’s CD4 was not elevated, and he was not infected with any fungi. This low CD4 count could have been the result of immunosuppression.

The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was infected with any fungi. The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was infected with any fungi. The patient had a low CD4 count, and he was infected with any fungi.
