## Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous membranes that allow cargo vesicular cargo to pass within cells via a fluid-phase, non-intersecting surface. In recent years, researchers have discovered several new EVs that integrate into the vesicular plane via a unique membrane organizationer, called cAMP. In the transport of cargo, researchers have described the use of EVs as multipurpose delivery systems with potential for both research and clinical applications. These new studies, along with recent advances in EV biology, have given rise to several hypotheses as to the origin and function of cAMP-dependent signaling. Here we review these hypotheses and discuss their implications for cargo biology and virology.

Many of the mechanisms described in these studies can also be explained in terms of secretion of lytic enzymes, for example, arthropod lytic enzymes, endocytic enzymes and extracellular vesicles. The secretion of these enzymes by arthropods seems to be coordinated by the secretion of EVs, as demonstrated by the presence of two EVs in the metagenome of Metarhizium anisopliae.


## Introduction
 2018; Beopoulos et a., 2018), is a phenomenon that has been well-described in the model fungus A. fumigatus (Hoffman et al., 2011). BcYak1, a member of the WcYAK-containing enzyme family, is synthesized during the sexual cycle and is responsible for the regulation of the conidiation (Schweinitz et al., 2012), and conidiophore formation (Jagielski et al., 2015), and consequently, it has the potential to regulate conidiation (Buey et al., 2014; Saito et al., 2014).

The function of BcYak1 in A. fumigatus is well understood. For instance, in addition to other fungi such as Magnaporthe grisea, Schweinitzia cuniculi, Kluyveromyces lactis and Cryptococcus neoformans, the BcYak-containing enzyme BcYakA regulates conidiogenesis and spore formation (Ding et al., 2015; Swetendra et al., 2016; Baayen et al., 2016), conidiation (Johnson et al., 2003), hyphal growth (Chatterjee et al., 2016), growth in media containing BcYak1 (Ding et al., 2015), conidiation (Ding et al., 2015), and hyphal development (Kojima et al., 2016; Swetendra et al., 2016; Baayen et al., 2016; Saito et al., 2016).

BcYakA is also a major regulator of the conidiation-regulated genes (Garcia et al., 2018), which results in the inhibition of conidiation, oxidative stress tolerance, and virulence of A. fumigatus. BcYakA was first characterized in yeast (Schweinitz and Dehring, 1985), and in filamentous fungi (Wicklow et al., 2013; Gautam et al., 2015). The main functions of BcYakA were first characterized in Neurospora crassa. In this organism, the enzyme BcYakA is involved in conidiation, oxidative stress tolerance, conidial germination, and virulence (Vallim et al., 2008). BcYakA is also involved in virulence, in particular in Aspergillus spp.


## Methods
 2009) was performed with two other strains of . albicans. Strains C. albicans ATCC 22019 and C. tropicalis ATCC 90028 were used as outgroups. Strains C. albicans ATCC 90028 were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 30°C for 7 days. For inoculum preparation, 5-10 × 10^6 conidia of each strain were inoculated in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at a density of 1.5 × 10^3 conidia/mL. The mycelium was removed from the broth by passing the culture through cheesecloth and washing the mycelium with sterile distilled water. The suspension was incubated at 30°C for 4 days. The mycelium was collected, washed with sterile distilled water and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. Serial dilutions of the fungal suspension were prepared. Serial dilutions of the stock solution were prepared in sterile distilled water. 100 µl of the suspension were inoculated on SDA plates at 37°C for 2 days. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The number of CFUs per gram of mycelia was calculated as the number of CFU per gram of mycelial weight of the colony. The fungal burden was calculated as the ratio of the number of CFU per gram of mycelial weight of the colony with the number of CFU per gram of mycelial weight of the colony. The fungal burden was calculated as the ratio of the number of CFU per gram of mycelial weight of the colony with the number of CFU per gram of mycelial weight of the colony. The concentrations of the fungal suspensions were 10^6-1 × 10^3 conidia/mL. The final fungal burden of the isolates was determined by plating the suspensions on SDA plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h. The fungal colonies were counted.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of BcYak1 in the Presence of Inoculated Thawed B. subtilis Extract
To determine the antifungal activity of the BcYak1 in the presence of a thawed thawed B. subtilis extract, the yeast cells of A. fumigatus, C. albicans and A.


## Results
fumigatus, including the lack of YAK1 (Yak1 in . graminearum). This observation was also confirmed by the analysis of the <U+0394>yak1 strain in the xylem model, where it was found to be significantly attenuated for virulence (Fig 4A). We found that yak1 mutants in A. fumigatus, namely the <U+0394>yak1 strain and the wild-type strain, are less virulent than the <U+0394>yak1 strain (Fig 4A). We further analyzed the effect of the <U+0394>yak1 strain on A. fumigatus during growth in the xylem model, which we verified by examining the growth of the <U+0394>yak1 strain in the xylem model of infection. The growth of the <U+0394>yak1 strain was found to be more susceptible than that of the wild-type strain, which indicates that the <U+0394>yak1 strain is more resistant than the <U+0394>yak1 strain to the infection of A. fumigatus. Taken together, these data indicate that yak1 mutants in A. fumigatus are less virulent than wild-type A. fumigatus strains.

Yak1 is Required for Successful Infection of A. fumigatus in the Mouse Model of Infection with A. fumigatus
To further investigate the role of YAK1 in A. fumigatus virulence, we performed a mouse model of infection by the murine inhalation model of A. fumigatus infection. We first examined the role of YAK1 in A. fumigatus virulence in the mouse inhalation model. In this model, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of A. fumigatus (10^5 CFU/mouse) and survival was monitored daily for over a month (Fig 5). At 1 week post-infection (p.i.


## Discussion
 2001. However, BcYak1 does not play a role in pathogenicity in A. fumigatus, which might be due to the fact that BcYak1 is conserved only in A. fumigatus (Verkley et al., 2001). Similarly, although C. albicans is a human pathogen, deletion of Yak1 has not been associated with virulence in mice (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2011). Therefore, further investigations are required to understand the role of BcYak1 in fungal pathogenicity.

It has been reported that in C. albicans, Yak1 is essential for hyphal development, hyphal branching, and conidiation in A. fumigatus (Bhadro et al., 2014). However, deletion of Yak1 in A. fumigatus also had a severe phenotype (Verkley et al., 2001). In A. fumigatus, the deletion of Yak1 rendered the hyphal system defective in hyphal formation, conidiation, and hyphal growth (Verkley et al., 2001). In contrast, deletion of BcYak1 rendered the hyphal system defective in conidiation, hyphal growth, and hyphal formation (Verkley et al., 2001). In A. fumigatus, we found that the deletion of Yak1 increased the cell wall integrity in the mutant, causing the cell wall integrity to be decreased. The cell wall integrity of A. fumigatus is thought to be responsible for the virulence of A. fumigatus (Kim et al., 2005). Similarly, BcYak1 was thought to be involved in the cell wall integrity of A. fumigatus (Kim et al., 2005). However, BcYak1 deletion has been reported to confer resistance to cell wall stress and resistance to cell wall-degrading enzymes (Szeke et al., 2014). Although the cell wall integrity of A. fumigatus has been reported to be defective, other cell wall-related genes have been reported to be essential for pathogenicity in A. fumigatus (Kulich et al., 2001).

Although A. fumigatus has been reported to have less resistance to cell wall stressors (Szeke et al.
