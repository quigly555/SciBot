## Abstract
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an “unmasking” of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS during T-cell immunity. T-cell immunity is often misdiagnosed by early and often irreversible changes in the tissue culture or immunohistochemical staining. T-cell immunity is believed to be lost in autoimmune disorders and organ transplant recipients with IRIS. However, the involvement of autoimmune IRIS in T-cell immunity has not been studied.

We studied the characteristics and role of T-cell immunity in 56 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarticular syndrome (OO2) with rheumatoid arthritis (O2). IRIS was defined as the presence of skin lesions or prosthetic infection besides osteoarticular lesions or prosthetic infections and non-vascular lesions at the time of diagnosis. The clinical forms of IRIS were evaluated using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods and the manufacturer-labeled co-culture methods.

We identified 56 patients with a mean ± SD age of 52 ± 9 years with a mean ± SD age of 49 ± 9 years. Four of the patients had osteoarticular lesions at the time of diagnosis and six had non-vascular lesions at the time of diagnosis. The mean time to diagnosis for all the patients was between 28 and 36 months with six patients had a median time of more than 6.5 months after the diagnosis.


## Introduction
The development of new antibiotics is on the rise. This is due to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens and the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. In order to fight these pathogens, new antibiotics are needed. The development of new antibiotics has been a matter of rapid evolution and is also of great significance to the natural products. It has also had an impact on the development of new antibiotics. The development of antibiotics from natural sources has been largely focused on the recent time. In the past two decades, a large number of antibiotics from natural sources have been obtained and were developed. However, the development of antibiotics from natural sources has not been straightforward. As a result, there has been a steady decline in the number of new antibiotics from natural sources. Moreover, the number of drugs from natural sources has also been declining. However, the number of new drugs from natural sources has also been declining. This decline has been accompanied by an increase in the number of new antibiotics from natural sources [1-5].

Pharmacological research has shown that antibiotics obtained from plants and animals have various pharmacological activities. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the number of antibiotics obtained from plants and animals since the beginning of the 20^th century [6,7]. Many of these antibiotics were first described in medicinal chemistry in the 1830s. According to these data, the first antibiotics were first described in 1845 in the human skin (Hosage’s Extract, Volvine, Inocytosis, and Proteus) and in 1867 in the rat liver (Ixigenia) [8]. In the 20^th century, antibiotics became widely used in the pharmaceutical industry because of the development of the European Union where, the first synthetic antibiotics were discovered in 1867 in the human skin and rat liver (Ixigenia) [9].

In the 20^th century, the number of antibiotics discovered from plants and animals has been increasing.

## Results
Identification of yeast isolates that showed more than 10% growth in vitro of C. neoformans
C. neoformans was isolated from a patient with invasive fungal infection in the legs of a public health worker from the local health department in a very low-cost environment in 2012. The patient was diagnosed with hematoma (data not shown), and he was treated with surgery and antibiotics, and then was admitted to the hospital with a case of systemic candidiasis. After a short period of hospitalization, he recovered. He was extensively immunosuppressed and his kidneys were normal. The main symptoms of the kidney were fever, pleural effusion, and mild abdominal pain. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and he underwent a serum culture with C. neoformans. After a course of surgery and antibiotics, the patient was discharged with a negative result.


## Discussion
T cells, in particular, are associated with cell differentiation and development, and the cytokine response may be mediated by T-cell-derived cells [32,33. Here, we showed that Chitin interacted with the cytokine response during T-cell-dependent cell cycle progression, resulting in a significant upregulation of IL-1ß and IL-17. The role of IL-17 in the cytokine response during T-cell-dependent cell cycle progression is controversial, but it has been demonstrated that IL-17 induces the Th17 response to inflammation and cell proliferation [34]. IL-17 also promotes the Th1/Th17 differentiation and apoptosis of T cells [35]. We also demonstrated that the IFN-gamma response to IL-17 plays a crucial role in T-cell differentiation and proliferation, and the IFN-gamma response to IFN-gamma-stimulated IL-17 in the T cell line may also be involved in the pathogenesis of CD4+ T cell lymphopenia and Th1/Th17 differentiation [36].

IL-17 is produced by various cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils [37,38]. In addition to monocytes, neutrophils are also recognized as a major source of IL-17 in T-cell differentiation and proliferation [39]. Our results demonstrated that the IL-17 response induced by IFN-gamma stimulated the IFN-gamma response, which was stronger than that of the WT in T-cell-deficient cells. This is in line with the previous report that the IFN-gamma response is a key regulator of the IFN-gamma response to IL-17 and Th17 [40]. In contrast, IFN-gamma-stimulated the IL-17 response in CD4+ T-cell-deficient cells. The IFN-gamma response was stronger in CD4+CD8+ T-cell-deficient cells. These results are consistent with the previous study that the IFN-gamma response is a key regulator of the IFN-gamma response to IL-17 and Th17 in T-cell-deficient cells. In addition, the IL-17 response was stronger in CD8+CD8+CD8/IL-17^+ cells.
