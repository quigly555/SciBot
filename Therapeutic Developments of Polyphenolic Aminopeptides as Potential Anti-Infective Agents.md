## Abstract
The mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma reesei is the most halophilic organism known to date. Its genome encodes 27 putative transcription factors, which are intricately linked to a surprising array of cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation. The conserved heterodimeric protein kinase protein kinase subunit HppKp has been implicated in a series of cellular functions, including signal transduction, pH homeostasis, signal transduction, oxidative stress and cell wall remodeling. Here we investigate HppKp function in a model fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is halophilic. We find that the Hpp family proteins are transcribed to a degree that correlates with the degree of trimerization of the fungal cell wall. Interestingly, we find that trimerization of the cell wall is required for survival under stress. To our knowledge, we have the most detailed quantitative understanding of the transcriptional response of this mycoparasite to environmental stress in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, our data suggest that trimerization of the cell wall modulates the expression of some genes in response to specific stresses. Overall, our work provides insight into a cell wall remodeling mechanism of fungal pathogenicity, and it provides insight into a possible strategy for fungal resistance against antifungal drugs.


## Introduction
They have been used in several medical fields, for example as components of various medicines, and in the control of fungal infections [1. The discovery of novel antifungals by a selective approach can be explained by two main factors. Firstly, the natural sources of antifungal peptides are found in the tropical and temperate regions of the world. Secondly, fungi have been known for using fungal antifungal agents for centuries.

Fungal antifungal peptides are classified into five groups: polyketides (p-d-amylopiperazines), peptides (lipopeptides), peptides (amylons), and peptide-like structures [2]. The basic structures of fungal antifungal peptides are well known, although there are some antifungal drugs that are not available in the market today. The most important antifungal peptides are the most commonly isolated polyketides, and the three major groups are: (i) glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), (ii) galactoxylomannan (GXMG), and (iii) p-d-amylons. The GXM group is a heterogeneous group of peptides, and their structures are diverse and usually contain two to five residues in the sequence a-ß-GalpMan [3]. GXM structures have been obtained from plants, bacteria, and fungi, while GXMGs are obtained from animals and fungi. However, they are more common in the environment, e.g., in soil [4,5]. The p-d-amylons are a group of small peptides with high structural diversity, and are often associated with virulence. The most common a-galactosyl moieties are glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM) residues. However, there are a few exceptions, e.g., galactoxylomannan is present in the fungal cell wall and may form a hydrophobic polysaccharide capsule, while galactoxylomannan is absent in the fungal cell wall. As a consequence, GXM can cause fungal infections [6].


## Methods
The microtiter plates (Table 1) were prepared using the Sabouraud agar (Sigma-Aldrich, S. Louis, MO) plates. Sterile saline (0.85% saline) was added to each well of the microtiter plates. After the growth of the bacteria and the suspension of the microtiter plate with the same volume of the medium, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance that completely inhibited the growth of the bacterial cells.

The antifungal activity of the polyphenolic compounds was tested against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus by the broth microdilution method. The inoculum was prepared by serial dilutions of the standard broth method. The test of the MIC was performed by transferring the turbidity of the diluted inoculum to wells of sterile 96-well microtiter plates. The MICs were recorded after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by inoculating the wells of the microtiter plate with the standardized concentrations of the polyphenolic compounds. The MFCs were defined as the lowest concentration of the substance that completely inhibited the growth of the yeast cells.

2.4. Antifungal Activity of the MFCs
The antimicrobial activity of the MFCs was tested against a group of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Aspergillus fumigatus, using the broth microdilution method. The inoculum was prepared by serial dilutions of the standard broth method. The test of the MFCs was performed by transferring the turbidity of the standardized inoculum to wells of the microtiter plate, which were then inoculated with the standardized concentrations of the tested substances. The MFCs were defined as the lowest concentration of the substance that completely inhibited the growth of the yeast cells.

## Results
In this work, we chose polyphenolic compounds that have been reported as potential antifungal agents, and we therefore used the following criteria to select polyphenolic compounds that have been shown to be active against . neoformans, Candida albicans, and some fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans (16).

The most active polyphenolic compounds tested were amphotericin B (6.15 mg/mL), fluconazole (2.95 mg/mL), and voriconazole (1.49 mg/mL). No activity was found for amphotericin B (0.41 mg/mL), fluconazole (0.41 mg/mL), voriconazole (0.41 mg/mL), voriconazole (0.41 mg/mL), or caspofungin (0.41 mg/mL). The antifungal activity of polyphenolic compounds was evaluated against C. neoformans, C. albicans, and C. tropicalis. The antifungal activity of polyphenolic compounds was evaluated against C. neoformans, C. albicans, and C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis.

The MIC values for amphotericin B and fluconazole were 0.14 and 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B was evaluated against C. neoformans and C. albicans. No activity was found for fluconazole against C. neoformans and C. tropicalis, and no activity was found for caspofungin against C. parapsilosis.

The MIC values for amphotericin B and fluconazole were 0.24 and 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B was evaluated against C. neoformans and C. tropicalis. No activity was found for amphotericin B against C. neoformans and C. tropicalis.


## Discussion
APMA-AFMG-PP.org) and the PAPMA-AFMG-PPA clinical trial (PAPMA-AFMG-PPA; www.pAPMA-AFMG-PPA.org) has been published. In the present work, a total of 2,123 polyphenolic compounds (20.4%) were identified, representing 13.7% of the total number of polyphenolic compounds identified in this work (4,612).

The initial polyphenolic compounds identified in this work were C1-C3, C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C7, C8-C9, C10-C11, and C12-C13. In general, polyphenolic compounds are known to exert various biological functions, such as anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, anti-tumor, and immunological effects. The monoterpenoid compounds C1-C3, C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C7, C8-C9, C10-C11, C12-C13, and C13-C13 were reported as the main compounds in the synthesis of C1-C3, C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C7, C8-C9, C10-C11, and C12-C13 (Hau et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013). C1-C3, C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C7, C8-C9, C10-C11, and C13-C13 are reported to exert their biological activities by inhibiting the synthesis of C1-C3, C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C7, C8-C9, and C10-C11 (Hau et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013).
