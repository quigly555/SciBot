## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii, a saprophytic fungal pathogen, is considered to be the most common human pathogen responsible for 1 million deaths per year worldwide. In the last few years, a series of new molecular epidemiological studies have demonstrated the critical importance of the molecular population dynamics (MPD) model to shed light on the dynamics of fungal pathogenicity and to contribute to the development of novel strategies to control fungal infections in humans. The MPD-like population dynamics of C. gattii have been characterized in detail in the past few years, mainly focusing on the multidrug resistance (MDR) isolates. However, the majority of the MDR strains are known to be resistant to a variety of antibiotics, toxins, and heavy metals. Here we review the important roles of MPD-like population dynamics in the epidemiology of cryptococcosis and the importance of this new, rapidly evolving population. Furthermore, we discuss the MDR strains and the main factors that affect the MDR phenotype in the control of fungal infections in humans.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematological malignancies, who have undergone solid organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1,2,3,4]. Many fungal species are opportunistic pathogens and the infection starts with inhalation of conidia or conidial cells, which may disseminate to other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) and spread to other organs with tissue damage [5,6]. The development of IFIs is most often asymptomatic and is usually treated by treatment with antibiotics, although resistance can develop in some fungal species such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, and less frequently Candida glabrata and C. krusei, to the azoles and echinocandins, respectively [6]. The incidence of IFIs is increasing in both developed and developing countries with more intensive care and the availability of better antifungal drugs.

The global incidence of invasive aspergillosis is estimated to be around 223,100 and is associated with significant mortality, ranging from 40 to 70% [7]. The increasing number of patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis is a consequence of rapid diagnosis and the availability of antifungal agents.


## Methods
mold complex
The most active constituents of . mold complex were obtained from the cultivation of the plant in the morning. For the use of the plant extracts, the process was performed according to the method described by Watanabe et al. [16]. Briefly, the plant material (1.0 g of dry weight) was extracted with 0.1 mL of methanol and concentrated under reduced pressure at 70 °C. The extracts were then diluted with distilled water and used in the preparation of the test solution. One gram of the extract was then added to 1.0 mL of n-hexane and stirred at room temperature for 30 min to obtain the test solution. The extract was then concentrated under reduced pressure at 70 °C to obtain the test solution with a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. The test solution with the test substance was used as the negative control and the test agent alone as the positive control.

The effective concentration of the test agent was determined according to the method of Nusson and Wells [17]. The sample was treated with aqueous Na_2CO_3 (0.1%) and then the concentrated extract was dissolved in 10% (v/v) methanol. Then, 1.0 mL of this mixture was then placed in a 1.5 mL tube, and the solution was heated at 100 °C for 2 min and then cooled at 60 °C for 5 min. Then, the solution was filtered, and the residual Na_2CO_3 was removed by adding a solution of 5% (v/v) Na_2CO_3 (0.1%) in distilled water. The final concentration of the test agent was then determined according to the method of Nusson and Wells [17].

2.4. The Antifungal Activity of the L. mold complex and Non-classical Compounds
The antifungal activity of the L. mold complex and non-classical compound was determined according to the method of Borková-Zavala et al. [18]. Briefly, the test solution was prepared by boiling the test compound in sterile distilled water. Then, 1.0 mL of the test solution was then added to a 2.0 mL tube, and then, a solution of 3% (v/v) Na_2CO_3 was added to the tube. Then, 1.0 mL of this solution was then added to a 2.


## Results
budensis, . dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three antimicrobial and antimicrobial-tolerant fungi. The antifungal activity of the extracts of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii was evaluated for the different antimicrobial activities of the extracts obtained from the leaves of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii. The MIC values of the extracts of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii against the most relevant agents were determined for the different extracts of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii. The MIC_50 values of the extracts of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii against all tested fungicides were determined. The MIC_50 values of the extracts of L. dendrorhous, L. sphaerii, and G. budensis against all tested fungicides were determined for the different extracts of G. budensis, L. dendrorhous, and L. sphaerii. The MIC_50 values of the extracts of L. dendrorhous, L. sphaerii, and G. budensis against all tested fungicides were determined for the extracts of L. dendrorhous, L. sphaerii, and G. budensis.
