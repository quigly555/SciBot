## Abstract
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil-borne fungi that have huge potential for biocontrol, plant protection, and sustainable agricultural practices. The complete genome of the main AMF species, EF-<U+03B3> YPD1, was recently reported, and the genetic architecture and pathogenicity of this fungal group of fungi has been the subject of a large-scale study. However, the underlying mechanisms of EF-<U+03B3> YPD-1-sensing, pathogenicity, and mycorrhizal biocontrol fungi remain poorly understood.


## Introduction
Cases caused by influenza viruses are increasing, and there are only two major influenza virus infections in the world: influenza A (IA) and influenza B (IB. The two most important viruses, influenza A and B, are the causative agents of both acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related disorders, including cerebral malaria, cerebral peering virus, and immunodepression-induced lymphadenitis (INS) [1].

IA viruses have a worldwide distribution and cause no less than 10% of the cases of disease [2]. The current pandemic of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which started in the summer of 1918, has resulted in an ever-increasing number of cases and deaths. Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, many cases of influenza have been described in Africa and Asia, including India, Pakistan, South Africa, United States, and other countries with a large population. The incidence of IFD has increased to levels comparable with tuberculosis. IFD is the most common infectious complication of IFD, affecting 1-2% of the adult population in the United States [3,4]. The emergence of the IFD outbreak in the summer of 2014 has led to a dramatic increase in the number of cases, which include an estimated 1,000 cases from June 2014 to August 2016 [4,5].

The WHO recommended treatment for patients with IFD to be used in the immediate post-acquisition phase, and WHO guidelines for the management of IFD have been published [6]. These guidelines recommend a regimen of antifungals such as flucytosine (5FC) and 5FC, daily fluconazole monotherapy, and combination therapy with flucytosine and flucytosine, to manage IFD [7]. For IFD, flucytosine should be used at least once in the course of therapy, with occasional use of 5FC. In patients with persistent signs of IFD, maintenance therapy with 5FC is recommended. However, maintenance therapy with flucytosine and 5FC is indicated only if persistent signs of IFD are detected. The WHO guidelines recommend that patients with persistent signs of IFD should be treated with fluconazole monotherapy only after the IFD signs have been established [8].

The cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS, and the pellet was suspended in PBS. The cell suspensions were diluted with PBS to obtain the desired density, and the suspensions were plated on YPD agar plates. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The S. cerevisiae BY4741 cell viability was calculated by the following equation:

## Results
albicans VPS4
. albicans VPS4 (GenBank KR99014) has been characterized previously as a novel virulence factor in C. neoformans (Mehta et al., 2015). In order to obtain a more comprehensive view of this highly virulent pathogen, a novel VPS4 protein was constructed from a novel 3-D protein with the predicted function (Fig 1A). As shown in Fig 1B, VPS4 was expressed in the VPS4^+ strain in the absence of iron. The observed growth and virulence phenotypes of the VPS4^+ strain were similar to those of the wild type (Fig 1C). The VPS4 gene in the VPS4^+ strain was transcribed in a similar manner as the wild type. The VPS4 gene was syntenic to the yeast VPS4 by a 1.5-kb insert in the promoter of the yeast VPS4 gene (Table 1). Thus, this unusual gene appears to be specific for C. neoformans.

The VPS4 protein was expressed in the VPS4^+ strain during the late exponential growth phase in the presence of iron (Fig 1B). In contrast to the wild type, the yeast VPS4 gene was not expressed in the VPS4^+ strain during the transition from the early exponential growth phase (Fig 1B). The VPS4 protein was transcribed in a similar manner as the wild type, in which the wild type expressed the predicted signal peptide (S1 Fig).

VPS4 Is Required for Normal Growth and Virulence in C. neoformans

We examined the virulence of the C. neoformans VPS4 mutant strain in the murine model of cryptococcosis. The lung was used as a model for cryptococcal infection. The mice were infected with a 1:1 ratio of the wild type and the VPS4 mutant strain and sacrificed at day 7 post-infection. The fungal burden was measured by an ELISA to determine fungal burden in the lungs, brain, and spleen. The VPS4 mutant strain showed a higher fungal burden in the lungs and brain than the wild type (Fig 2). The lungs were analyzed by measuring the fungal burden by a dilution log dilution method.


## Discussion
major and . donovani have been well established [33]. It is therefore conceivable that the subcellular localization of L. major in macrophages and inflammatory cells contributes to the acute inflammatory response and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, including chemokines and cytokines. In addition, the molecular mechanisms of action of L. major against the pathogenic strain of L. donovani are not completely understood. However, L. major is known to have an excellent ability to induce macrophages to a Th1 response in vitro [31], [32], and its anti-inflammatory activity has been reported in macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells [33], [34]. In addition, L. donovani possesses both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms [35]. It is conceivable that the L. donovani effect on macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells provides a platform to examine the molecular mechanisms of L. donovani-induced pro-inflammatory mechanisms and biological functions in macrophages and dendritic cells.

The current study showed that the L. donovani effect on T cells (NMD-derived) induced by L. donovani had no effect on NK cells and CD4^+ T cell subsets, which is in agreement with previous reports showing that L. donovani can induce T cell activation in a dose-dependent manner [36]. However, L. donovani treatment induced a Th1 response in NK cells and CD4^+ T cells in response to L. donovani, which is in accordance with previous reports in T cell-derived macrophages [37]. Moreover, the effect of L. donovani on T cells was similar to that of L. donovani on CD4^+ T cells, which is consistent with previous findings that T cells are also activated in response to L. donovani [32]. This finding is also in accordance with previous reports that T cell-derived macrophages are activated after L. donovani exposure [37], [38].

The results of this study also showed that L. donovani significantly increased the expression of several inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-8, and interleukin (IL)-9, which are involved in the induction of inflammatory responses.
