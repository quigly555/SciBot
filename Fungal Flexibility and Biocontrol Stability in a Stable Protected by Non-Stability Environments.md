## Abstract
The Cryptococcus gattii VGIII VGIII population is thought to be genetically highly variable and can be easily pigeonholed due to a combination of reduced virulence, the emergence of drug-resistance virulent strains, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Isolation of the yeasts from infected individuals in the form of suspensions from infected individuals was a key step in cryptococcosis identification because of their ability to form biofilms that can adhere to implanted medical devices. Here we report the isolation of a newly identified strain of C. gattii VGIII from a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of cryptococcosis. This patient had been diagnosed as a rare but aggressive form of cryptococcosis, and she presented with multiple contiguous nodular lesions that appeared all preceding April, 2010. The diagnosis of cryptococcosis was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and the patient was treated with fluconazole. This patient had no clinical symptoms and no previous underlying immunodeficiency. This is the first report of C. gattii VGIII isolates isolated from a patient with cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
In spite of recent advances in the treatment of cryptococcosis, the mortality of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains suboptimal [1]. Cryptococcosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [2]. Efforts to improve cryptococcosis treatment have been limited because of a lack of reliable, sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. In the past two decades, several HIV diagnostic laboratories have developed improved algorithms and validated tests for rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnosis, such as the ImmunoVIRAL assay [3]. However, these tests are time-consuming, expensive, and can be rendered insensitive to in some patients.

The World Health Organization requires laboratories to develop standardized, validated tests that can be used to make POCs of HIV patients. The WHO Criteria for CrAg Testing (ICTC) were developed by the WHO and have been used to guide CrAg testing in Africa [4]. In this study, we analyzed the performance characteristics and diagnostic characteristics of the CrAg POC test in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.


## Methods
brasiliensis wild type, Pb18 was used as a stable positive contro. In this study, the wild type Pb18 strain was used as the stable negative control. The bacterial strain was cultivated on PDA at 30 °C. The cultivation was carried out in the dark at 28 °C for 3 days. The production of citrate lyase and lysinease was monitored on PDA by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry as previously described [30].

The viability of the wild type Pb18 strain was evaluated by a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, USA) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The bacterial strain was cultivated in PDA at 37 °C. The production of lysozyme and lysinease was examined using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) equipped with an HPX-87P column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Phenomenex, USA) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The solubility of the cell-free supernatant was monitored using a gas chromatograph (GC-MS) equipped with an HPX-87P column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Phenomenex, USA) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The solubility of the supernatant was monitored using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) equipped with an HPX-87P column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Phenomenex, USA) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.

The ability of the Pb18 wild type strain to grow on solid media was evaluated by growing the Pb18 strain in the liquid medium at 28 °C. The growth of Pb18 was monitored by incubating the culture at 28 °C for 24 h. The viability of the wild type Pb18 strain was evaluated by incubating the culture at 28 °C for 24 h.

In the analysis of the relative viability of the wild type Pb18 strain compared to the WT Pb18 strain, a yeast cell suspension of 1 × 10^6/mL in RPMI 1640 medium was prepared and inoculated into each well of a sterile 96-well plate.


## Results
oryzae and . oryzae-infected yeast models were not due to differences in the total number of spores (Fig 1A). Nevertheless, the difference in expression patterns of the strains in the M. oryzae model is probably related to the low number of spores in the yeast form. This is in contrast to the mating type (F_1) and the virulence index (V_I) of the strains in the M. oryzae model (Fig 1A), which showed a relatively high number of spores, even though some strains were clearly different in the virulence index. To investigate the possible role of spore germination in M. oryzae virulence, we examined the growth of strains in the presence of F_1 and V_I, respectively. In contrast to the results in the yeast model, the germination rates of the M. oryzae strains were not affected by the level of F_1 (Fig 1B). This indicates that these strains were not affected by the level of V_I, which is essential for virulence in a broad range of fungi.

The Expression Profiling of Spore-Related Genes in the Presence of F_1 and V_I
To further investigate the possibility that F_1 and V_I could play a role in M. oryzae virulence, we investigated the expression profiles of the F_1 and V_I gene products in the M. oryzae and M. oryzae-infected yeast models. The F_1 gene product (F_1) was expressed with higher levels in the yeast model, and the expression level of V_I was higher in the M. oryzae model. The expression level of F_1 was higher in the yeast model (Fig 2A), and the expression level of V_I was higher in the M. oryzae model (Fig 2B). We then examined the expression of the F_1 and V_I gene products in the presence of F_1 and V_I. The expression level of F_1 and V_I was higher in the M. oryzae model (Fig 2C) and the expression level of V_I was higher in the M. oryzae model (Fig 2D). In the M.


## Discussion
Despite the fact that the fungal cells are superimposed on each other, their genetic and physiological states are still differen. Because of the different roles of genes involved in fungal development and pathogenicity, the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum can accommodate different types of pathogens in its environment. The unique role of the plant pathogen Fusarium to cope with plant pathogens has already been shown in plants, where a stable fungal infection process was observed in the presence of a prokaryotic host (36). However, the fungal cell wall is a highly dynamic structure, and the host plant can use a variety of environmental factors to cope with fungal infections (36). The Fusarium oxysporum strain Fc3 was used to predict the gene family that regulates cell wall synthesis and to develop plant resistance to Fusarium oxysporum. The gene family that governs cell wall synthesis was identified in the Fusarium oxysporum Fc3 strain. In addition, the gene family that controls cell wall synthesis was identified in the Fusarium oxysporum Fc3 strain. The gene family that controls cell wall synthesis was identified in the Fusarium oxysporum Fc3 strain. The gene family that controls cell wall synthesis was identified in the Fusarium oxysporum Fc3 strain.
