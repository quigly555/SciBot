## Abstract
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat, and the larvae are the first vectors of Fusarium species that disseminate to many organs of wheat berries. In the present study, we found that the population size of the FHB-causing fungus Fusarium graminearum changed from a normal population size of wheat to a hyper-sexual stage. The size of the hyper-sexual population increased by 75-99%, and the spores were more dispersed and had a longer life span. The increased population size also changed the fungal community structure. However, the spores were more dispersed and had a higher content of a polyphenol content. Increased numbers of spores produced in the presence of a mix of host and environment provide evidence that the fungus has evolved into a complex that enables it to survive in host tissues. In addition, spores from host tissues were more efficiently dispersed and had a longer life span. These findings provide additional insights into the determinants of the sexual cycle of F. graminearum and suggest that the fungus has evolved to become a complex with host.

Fusarium graminearum is an important disease of wheat, and the fungus is the first major pathogen of Fusarium head blight (FHB). In the wheat host, it causes disease symptoms and economic loss. During the infection, FHB is transmitted via contaminated wheat berries and the larvae of FHB are the first stage of the disease cycle. However, the development of new resistance leads to the formation of new pathogens and the loss of yield. In order to survive in the host and to survive in the environment, F. graminearum needs to adapt to host changes.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus and can be classified into superficial infections (fungi-like) and deep-seated infections (including aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and cryptococcal pneumonia) [1]. Although superficial infections are caused by a few opportunistic fungi, deep-seated infections can be classified into severe, life-threatening mycoses (cryptomycosis) and chronic infections (alveolar maculomatosis, pityriasis versicolor, histoplasmosis, candidiasis, and aspergilloses) [2].

The clinical manifestations of IFD are varied and include an early presentation, the development of symptoms, and the persistence of the disease. In the early stages of the disease, the diagnosis is based on epidemiologic and clinical features, but usually the fungus is isolated from environmental samples. However, in the course of disease, the development of the disease is often confused with the underlying pathology. It is important to differentiate between the later stages of the disease and to understand how epidemiologic and clinical data can be used to guide a definitive diagnosis.

Here, we present an overview of the epidemiology and clinical features of IFD, as well as the latest evidence available.


## Methods
-.5 µg/mL; 0.1-2 µg/mL; and 2-8 µg/mL.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
For further observation of the morphology of the colony, a TEM was used as previously described (Jassal, 2006). Briefly, each haematological sample was fixed in 10% (v/v) formaldehyde and embedded in epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrenton, VA, USA). The samples were observed under a TEM using a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Ethics statement
All animal studies were performed with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the Federal University of São Paulo and were conducted in strict accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Animal Rights ratified by the UNESCO in January 2007 (The Protocols for the Use and Welfare of Laboratory Animals, 1992) and the Brazilian Federal Law for the protection of animals; and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation and were approved by the ethics committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (Protocol #13/2006).

Sample preparation
The following haematological samples were used: a) C. albicans cell suspension (1 × 10^4 CFU/mL) from the first sample of the procedure and the second, after the second sample, was centrifuged at 3000×g for 10 min and re-suspension in 5% (v/v) formaldehyde. B) Ca. albicans suspension (1 × 10^4 CFU/mL) from the third sample of the procedure and the third, after the third sample, was centrifuged at 3000×g for 10 min and re-suspension in 5% (v/v) formaldehyde. C) Neosporium sp.


## Results
In this study, we observed an unexpected change in the number of viable bacteria in the bone marrow of mice infected with the E. coli strain KN99a, and its multiple re-colonization in the blood. For both strains, the number of viable bacteria was significantly decreased in the bone marrow, while the number of viable bacteria in the blood was increased. These data indicate that the E. coli strain KN99a carries a high frequency of multinucleated cells and that the major pathogens of the blood in this animal are the M. tuberculosis and the C. neoformans.

The Human Bacterial Load is Increased in the Bone of C57BL/6 mice After Infection with E. coli
To determine the burden of E. coli in the bone of C57BL/6 mice after infection with the E. coli strain KN99a, and its re-colonization in the blood, we first established the study of C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were used as control. Mice were infected with either a single E. coli strain KN99a, or a multiple E. coli strain KN99a, and the mice were sacrificed at day 7 post-infection. The mice were monitored daily for 24 hours and histopathology was performed using the eosinophilic (gelatinized) and encapsulated (gelatinized) epitopes.

The animal was subsequently sacrificed on days 14 and 21 post-infection, and the bone was collected for microscopic examination. E. coli strain KN99a was found in the blood of C57BL/6 mice after infection, with a burden of 12.9 × 10^6 CFU/ml in the bone marrow (Fig 1A). The bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice was significantly higher than that of the blood of C57BL/6 mice at days 14 and 21 post-infection (P < 0.05, Fig 1B). Furthermore, the number of viable bacteria in the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice was significantly decreased after infection with the E. coli strain KN99a (P < 0.05, Fig 1C), which was also seen in the blood of C57BL/6 mice (Fig 1D).


## Discussion
In the present study, the detection of clinically relevant antigens in these samples was 9.8%, and 97.6% and 96.6%, respectively.

The effect of the treatment method and the degree of disease in our study were similar to that of the case reports in the previous publication (9). Our study was performed in the setting of a hospital-based study, and in the setting of a tertiary-care hospital, where all cases were treated with fluconazole for acute febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, which are known to be associated with the increased risk of this disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effectiveness of fluconazole in treating candidemia in a tertiary-care hospital. In our study, the lowest fungal burden was observed in the lungs of patients with haematological malignancies, while the proportion of haematological malignancies was higher in patients with tuberculosis.

A recent report showed that the rate of early disseminated candidiasis was 38.7% in healthy subjects [25]. Our study found that the early disseminated candidiasis occurred in patients with a number of predisposing factors, including HIV infection, chemotherapy, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, and HIV infection. Patients with underlying malignancies and malignancy are the most common underlying factors that predispose to early disseminated candidiasis, and thus treatment is recommended in these patients. In our study, the patient with candidemia had a history of malignancies, malignancy, and diabetes mellitus, and was immunocompromised.

The most common cause of acute disseminated candidiasis was disseminated candidiasis in our study. This is in accordance with other studies in other centers and general hospitals. In the study by Kim et al. (20), the most common cause of acute disseminated candidiasis was disseminated candidiasis, followed by malignancies. This finding is in accordance with other studies in other hospitals in Korea, in which the most common malignancy was cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (28, 29).

We found that the most common cause of bloodstream infection in our study was HBCN infection, with C. albicans being the most common type.
