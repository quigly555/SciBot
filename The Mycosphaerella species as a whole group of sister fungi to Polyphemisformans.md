## Abstract
The order and species of the genus Neolecta include species of Naumovozyma, which are found in freshwater and saline environments in the Mediterranean Sea. Naumovozyma spp. are freshwater mites with a polyploid, comboborate and halotolerant lifestyle, found in all areas of the world where they can exist. They are known as “metazoa” for the multicolored, melanized, ellipsoid, or basidiospores, and their halotolerant lifestyle has received much attention for the exploitation of natural resources. The aim of this study was to investigate Naumovozyma species in a Mediterranean area and to find out more about their populations and ecology, habitat and life cycle. In this study we sampled four samples of mycobiota, cultured them in agar and examined them for micafungin morphology.


## Introduction
Fungal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immunity. They can be caused by a wide spectrum of environmental organisms, such as mold, yeast, and viruses, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although the virulence of many fungal diseases has improved substantially over the past few decades, they still cause significant losses in human health. In recent decades, a growing number of fungal pathogens have become pathogenic to humans. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common invasive fungal disease and is the most common fungal infection in the United States (1). The treatment of IA is complicated by the fact that it is usually seen in immunocompromised patients with hematological diseases, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients on prolonged therapy with corticosteroids (2, 3).

We present a case of cryptococcal meningitis in an immunocompromised patient.


## Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases of Shandong University, China (Permit Number: A-05-0015).

In this study, we used the previously described method for microorganism growth in Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) to determine the viability of the microorganisms obtained from the culture. The cultivation was performed on a shaker at 37°C and 150 rpm for 72 h. The growth was visualized after drying of the culture by autoclaving in an oven at 40°C for 15-20 min. The suspension of the microorganism was filtered through 0.


## Results
The strongest supports for the clade of Mycosphaerella that was resolved in the ML tree were formed by the combination of ML and MP analyses (Supplementary Figure 1B.

The ML phylogenetic tree revealed four clades, all with high support values, with ML, MP, and PC1 as the best supported monophyletic clades (Figure 1C). The Mycosphaerella clade was supported by MP and PC1 analyses (Supplementary Figure 1C). The Mycosphaerella clade was supported by ML and MP analyses (Supplementary Figure 1C). The PC1 and ML analyses (Supplementary Figure 1C) supported the clade that was resolved in the ML tree (Figure 1C). The Mycosphaerella clade was resolved in the MP tree (Supplementary Figure 1C).

The fungal clade placed in the order Phialophora, was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1D). The fungal clade was supported by ML and MP analyses (Supplementary Figure 1D). The Phialophora clade was resolved in the MP tree (Supplementary Figure 1D). The Phialophora clade was resolved in the PC1 tree (Supplementary Figure 1D). The Phialophora clade was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1D).

The fungal clade placed in the genus Trichoderma, was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1E). The fungal clade was resolved in the PC1 tree (Supplementary Figure 1E). The Trichoderma clade was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1E). The Trichoderma clade was resolved in the PC1 tree (Supplementary Figure 1E). The fungal clade was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1E). The fungal clade was resolved in the PC1 tree (Supplementary Figure 1E).

The clade placed in the genus Trichoderma, was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1F). The fungal clade was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1F). The Trichoderma clade was resolved in the PC1 tree (Supplementary Figure 1F). The Trichoderma clade was resolved in the ML tree (Supplementary Figure 1F).


## Discussion
Polyphemisformans is the most prominent and prevalent species in our study, and is the second most common species in the marine environment (Hattori et a. 2017). As the second most common species in the environment, Polyphemisformans is commonly associated with the human population. Moreover, Polyphemisformans species in the genus Dioszegia (Saccharomyces) are frequent in the environment. The genus Dioszegia (Saccharomyces) was first discovered in temperate climates in the northern hemisphere (Wong et al. 2017). It is able to form a complex with Saccharomyces and its derivatives (Saracomma et al. 2014). In our study, Dioszegia sp. was the second most common species, with the majority of the isolates of Dioszegia spp. having been isolated from environmental samples and other marine habitats (Hattori et al. 2017). The species Dioszegia parvum and Dioszegia terrestris are widely distributed in temperate and Antarctic environments, but have also been found in water (Hattori et al. 2017). Dioszegia terrestris, which was previously identified in our study, was observed in this study. The species Dioszegia pygmaea and Dioszegia terrestris were previously reported from Antarctic habitats (Hattori et al. 2017). The genus Dioszegia was originally introduced by Hori (1909) and it is recognized as a multicellular, branched and filiform-forming species with an ascospore-like apical wall (Dioszegia). The genus Dioszegia (including Dioszegia sp. and Dioszegia terrestris) has been known to be able to form a branched septate hyphal structure (Dioszegia). Polyphemisformans is a subfamily of Polyphemisformans that was first identified in South America, which was introduced by Hori (1909). This species is able to form a branched hyphal structure with a hyphal-like structure (Dioszegia).
