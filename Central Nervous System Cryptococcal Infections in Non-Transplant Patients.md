M. tuberculosis is the causative agent of a fatal autoimmune thyroiditis syndrome of unknown etiology. Treatment of myelofibrosis or hypothyroidism has often been associated with malignancy. However, only a few cases of MLCCW135 have been reported in the literature. Here, we report the case of a 41-year-old homosexual male with severe recurrent thyroid diseases, diagnosed using the utility panel of lymphocyte antigen detection (WASH) and sequencing of the large subunit (LSU) 18SARC-231, which has an estimated annual prevalence of about 5%. His underlying condition was not reported because he had not suffered from serious infectious complications. WASH confirmed the diagnosis of fungal thyroiditis with fungal elements and fungal granulomata, with an estimated annual incidence of 14.0 cases and 1.5 deaths. The mortality rate was 25.1%. The MLCCW135 population was similar across patients with various underlying conditions, including HIV infection, malignancy, and malignancy. The utility of MLCCW135 in diagnosing malignancy and nephrotoxicity was also evaluated. Mortality rates were comparable to those for patients without HIV disease, with HIV as the primary etiology.

MLCCW135 is an Ascomycete fungi of unknown etiology, with a predominant distribution in Southeast Asia and Southeast Asia. Its molecular type, MLCCW135, is a haploid strain isolated from environmental isolates from tropical, semi-arid regions in Southeast Asia. MLCCW135 is a rare etiology of ascomycetes-basalamoeticus, with a relatively high mortality rate.


## Introduction

. neoformans is an environmental fungus and the main cause of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV positive patients, patients with hematologic malignancies, and patients receiving immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids or corticosteroids in the transplantation setting [13], [16], [17]. In HIV-positive patients, C. neoformans was reported to be the main etiology in 15% of cases [15]. In patients with lymphocytic nephritis, cryptococcal infections were the main etiology in 60% of the cases [16].

The main etiological agents in C. neoformans are Cryptococcus spp. and Sporothrix schenckii, both of which are known to be involved in the lung, skin, and lymphatic system [5], [18]. C. neoformans var. grubii, the predominant species in the C. neoformans/C. neoformans hybrids/M. gattii species complexes, is the major etiological agent of cryptococcosis in immunocompromised patients [19]. The virulence factor of the C. neoformans/C. neoformans hybrids/M. gattii species complex has been reported to be highly homologous to the genes encoding for the major virulence factors of the species, including the capsule and melanin [20].

The C. neoformans/C. neoformans hybrids/M. gattii species complex are thought to be derived from two parental species, a/a and a/a. However, the relationship between the two parental species is not clear. The sexual state of the a/a hybrids was described to be similar to the one found in the a/a hybrids [21]. However, the sexual state has not been described in the a/a hybrids. In the present study, we isolated the C. neoformans/C. neoformans hybrids/M. gattii species complex, which contained two parental species, a/a and a/a, from two different locations in Thailand, including the location of isolation and its phylogenetic relationship to the C. neoformans/C. neoformans hybrids/M. gattii species complex.


## Methods
A total of 49 patients were treated with fluconazole as well as no treatmen. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of São Paulo (IRB 18.07.2008), the University of São Paulo (IRB 25.4.


## Results
%), we found a higher frequency of cryptococcal infection in patients with COP. The median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 22.8%, the median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in patients with COPD was 12.3%, and the median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in patients with COPD was 8.9%. The median age of non-transplant patients with COPD was 54 years (IQR: 50.6-85.0) and the median age of non-transplant patients with COPD was 38 years (IQR: 38.4-49.3). The median duration of COPD was 7.5 days (IQR: 6.9-9.2). The median duration of COPD was 22.8 days (IQR: 18.4-32.5) and the median duration of COPD was 48.7 days (IQR: 21.9-50.6).

Overall, the average annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 9.1%, the median annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 12.6%. The median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 23.6%, the median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 20.1%, and the median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 18.6%. The median duration of COPD was 7.5 days (IQR: 7.5-9.2) and the median duration of COPD was 20.7 days (IQR: 21.9-25.3). The median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 6.3% and the median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 22.3%. The median (IQR) annual rate of cryptococcal infection in non-transplant patients with COPD was 10.


## Discussion
It is estimated that 20% of all non-transplant patients have a fungal infection [4. The incidence of fungal infections in the central nervous system of non-transplant patients is approximately 1 in 10,000 [5]. The incidence of fungal infections in the central nervous system of non-transplant patients is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 [5].
