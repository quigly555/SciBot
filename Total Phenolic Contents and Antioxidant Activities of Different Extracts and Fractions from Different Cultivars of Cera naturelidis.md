## Abstract
The management of infectious diseases is a continuous process that involves several different strategies, which include antifungal therapy, immunotherapy, surgical approaches, and further active strategies. This review focuses on the management of fungal diseases, focusing on the different approaches used in the early phases of fungal development. The information collected in this article represents the viewpoints of the scientific community as it stands now and after the identification of the main factors, mechanisms, and outcome of fungal diseases in the setting of human or animal diseases. The topics discussed include antifungal therapy in the treatment of infectious diseases, immunotherapy in the treatment of neglected fungal diseases, and further active strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in the future.


## Introduction
Lung involvement by fungi in various settings, including transplant recipients, cancer patients, oncology patients, and leukemia patients, is increasing (1-3). Of the approximately 1.6 million fungal infections worldwide, approximately 1.5 million cause mortality (4). More than 180,000 deaths occur each year due to fungal infections in hematological and radiologic patients (5).

The genus Candida includes fungi from both ascomycetous and basidiomycetous organisms (6). The organisms most commonly isolated from hematopoietic sources are Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida kefyr and Candida glabrata. However, other fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, are also involved in the opportunistic infections, particularly in immunosuppressed patients (7).

Besides the immune system, Candida albicans is a normal colonizing organism in healthy people. In the elderly, Candida albicans is the second most common species isolated from blood, in contrast to other Candida species (8). The common symptoms of candidiasis include fever, redness, weight loss, and skin lesions (9).

In the context of the host, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the first barrier of the host to prevent the spread of pathogenic fungi and infection (10). A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the integrity of the barrier (11). The BBB protects the host from pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites (12). In patients with various diseases, the integrity of the BBB is compromised, resulting from changes in the fluid content, which in turn influences the expression of virulence factors, such as the polysaccharide capsule (13).


## Methods
nordicilense (Cera nordicilense) species complex, and the origin of the isolate has been described in the literature as Cera nordicilens. The isolate was cultured on PDA and cultured at 28°C for 7 days. After 7 days, the mycelium was extracted with 40% (v/v) ethanol. The mycelium was washed with sterile distilled water and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (0.5 M). The organic phase was evaporated with a rotary evaporator, using a rotary evaporation system (9% KOH and 70% ethanol). The organic layer was dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and then washed with sterile distilled water. The dried extract was dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and then washed with distilled water. The filtrate was dried at 55°C for 2 h, and then air dried until the absolute volume was equal to 1.0 ml. The amount of reducing sugar released was calculated using the following formula:

Ethyl acetate extract (Et) = [(Extent of Extract, % (%))] × 100 × (Na_2O_2, % (%))] × 100

The Et_50 and Et_90 were calculated by the following equation:

The relative amount of Et_50 was calculated from the % Et_90 of Et_50. Et_90 of Et_50 of Et_50 was calculated from the % Et_90 of Et_90 of Et_90.


## Results
The major constituents were the phenolic compounds (terpenes, flavonoids, flavonoids, terpenes, and flavonoids), followed by the flavonoids, terpenes, and flavonoids and flavonoid. Among these compounds, the flavonoids (C3, C6, C10, C12, C15, and C18) were the most active, with an IC_50 of 20.13 and 25.62 µg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the terpenes (C1, C4, C6, C9, C10, C13, C14, C18, C22, C26, C28, C30, C33, C34, C35, C36, C37, C39, C41, C42, C45, C48, C50, and C53) and flavonoids (C5, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C16, C17, C18, C20, C25, C27, C28, C34, C37, C39, C40, C44, C45, C48, C50, and C53) and the flavonoids (C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C16, C17, C18, C20, C25, C27, C28, C34, C35, C36, C37, C39, C40, C44, C45, C48, C50, and C53) and the flavonoids (C6, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C16, C17, C18, C20, C25, C27, C28, C34, C35, C36, C37, C39, C40, C44, C45, C48, C50, and C53) were also found in the extracts from Cera naturelidis.


## Discussion
The main compounds were xantholic and flavolic acids (Fig 2A), citral and tuticrosol (Fig 2A. The principal constituents of all extracts were xantholic acids (6.3% and 6.8%), flavolic acid (6.8% and 4.2%), tuticrosol (4.2% and 2.6%), citral (2.6% and 2.2%) and tuticrosol (2.2% and 2.4%). Some compounds, which were not included in this study, were identified as compounds with antioxidant activity and/or activity against oxidative stress [28]. The total content of xantholic acids in the roots of Cera naturelidis was 100% (Fig 2B). However, the content of flavolic acid in the roots of Cera naturelidis was considerably higher (63.3% and 69.1% in total contents) than that of xantholic acids (26.9% and 32.8%). The total contents of tuticrosol in the roots of Cera naturelidis were slightly higher (62.2%) than that of xantholic acids (27.3%). The total content of citral was significantly lower (29.3%) than that of tuticrosol (14.6%). The total contents of tuticrosol in the roots of Cera naturelidis was significantly higher than that of xantholic acids (26.8% and 27.9%). The total contents of tuticrosol in the roots of Cera naturelidis was significantly lower (15.7%) than that of xantholic acids (15.3% and 17.3%). The total contents of tuticrosol in the roots of Cera naturelidis was significantly higher (38.3%) than that of xantholic acids (39.6%) and tuticrosol (39.7%) (Table 2).

On the basis of the composition and characteristics of the collected samples, a total of 36 compounds (36.3% and 31.7%) were identified as xantholic, flavolic and tuticrosol. The total contents of the plants in each of the four cultivation periods varied greatly from 1 to 50% and 10 to 50% in total contents (Table 2).
