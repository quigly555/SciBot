## Abstract
Since the emergence of the yeast pathogen Candida albicans in the 1990s, important human and animal models of the human pathogen have been deeply imbued with important medical value. Yet many current medical treatments for this fungal infection remain unsuccessful. As a result, there is a dearth of clinical trials and still is not a great need for more definitive evidence for treatment of this fungal infection. To address this, we screened gene-expression profiles in 25 human and experimental murine models of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis using the life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) of clinical isolates of C. albicans. We found that these model yeasts maintained cell viability and pathogenicity at the infectionally active sites of infected tissues. In addition, these fungal models showed significant increases in P-ATPase activity, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) but low levels of CD40L expression. In addition, we found that there was a significant decrease in the ability of C. albicans to grow inside macrophages, which is likely due to the attenuated virulence of the model strain. These data suggest that C. albicans cell viability and growth in the CNS of experimental and clinical patients with C. albicans infection are very similar.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease that is caused by Cryptococcus species, which include C. neoformans and C. gattii, which live in the soil and on trees. Inhalation of the infectious propagules results from the inhalation of airborne basidiospores. Inhalation of basidiospores by the host is followed by hyphal growth, followed by death of spores. The lungs are the main site of infection. Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported to the central nervous system (CNS). Cryptococcus can survive inside the host for a long period, but some organisms, such as C. neoformans, can survive inside the host for long periods. However, some fungal species, such as C. gattii, can be pathogenic in the blood and in the brain. Cryptococcal infections can be caused by either C. neoformans or C. gattii, which differ in geographic, etiological and clinical features.

Cryptococcosis is caused by the inhalation of basidiospores that originate from the environment and the subsequent inhalation of basidiospores from the lung. Cryptococcus can survive in the alveoli of the lung and in the blood, and its ability to survive and replicate inside the host is critical to its pathogenesis [1]. In particular, C. neoformans can live inside the macrophages and cause a fatal infectious disease called cryptococcal meningitis (CM) [2,3].

CM is characterized by rapid clearance of the infected cells and by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) [4,5]. These cytokines are generated in response to various stimuli, including a tumor or macrophage infection, and are necessary for the cellular response to the infection [6,7]. In addition, macrophages have an important role in anti-cryptococcal immunity, since the monocytes and macrophages from infected individuals can differentiate into macrophage-like cells [8].


## Methods

For the TB treatment in Malawi, we have performed TB-specific TB testing on bacterial strains (Table 1), and we performed TB-specific TB testing on all other samples teste.

In the MEC, we also performed TB-specific TB testing on HIV-infected patients with CD4 count <350 cells/mm^3 and a WHO stage 4 clinical disease.

In the PDBD, we conducted TB-specific TB testing on C. gattii isolates from patients with CD4 count <350 cells/mm^3 and a WHO stage 3 clinical disease.

In the TB treatment in Malawi, we also performed TB-specific TB testing on C. gattii isolates from patients with CD4 count <350 cells/mm^3 and a WHO stage 2 clinical disease.

We also performed TB-specific TB testing on the most common BSI-related infections in Malawi (Table 1).

We also performed TB-specific TB testing on HIV-infected patients with CD4 count <350 cells/mm^3 and a WHO stage 2 clinical disease.

In the TB treatment in Malawi, we also performed TB-specific TB testing on the most common Cryptococcus neoformans-related infections (Table 1).

We performed TB-specific TB testing on the non-tuberculous non-infectious non-infectious bacterial bloodstream infection (nTMO-related) bloodstream infection (nTN-related) in Malawi (Table 1).

In the PDBD, we performed TB-specific TB testing on the most common P. aeruginosa-related infections (nPS-related) in Malawi (Table 1).

In the TB treatment in Malawi, we also performed TB-specific TB testing on the non-tuberculous non-infectious non-infectious bacterial bloodstream infection (nTMO-related) in Malawi (Table 1).

We also performed TB-specific TB testing on the non-tuberculous non-infectious non-infectious viral bloodstream infection (nVR-related) in Malawi (Table 1).


## Results
neoformans mutants lacking the virulence factor SreA, the virulence factor responsible for the increased resistance of . neoformans to azoles, exhibited a reduced susceptibility to a range of azole drugs (4). Thus, we evaluated the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain CNE 1439. The CNE 1439 strain is a clinical isolate and is therefore a likely target of the antifungal drug combination for this study.

The virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain was evaluated using the murine systemic infection model. The murine model is a well established model of systemic infection resulting in mortality and morbidity of morbidly infected mice (12). In this study, we compared the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain with that of the C. gattii WM276 strain. We used the C. neoformans serotype A strain as the control because the serotype A strain of C. neoformans is not suitable for this study and C. gattii is a relatively new pathogen of interest. As shown in Figure 3, C. neoformans serotype A strains were more susceptible to fluconazole than serotype A strains, although these strains were not as virulent as the serotype A strain. The C. neoformans serotype B strain was not significantly different from the serotype A strain. We have previously observed a correlation between the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain and the ability to survive in a mammalian host. In this study, we have observed a virulence defect for the C. neoformans serotype B strain compared to that of the C. gattii strain. We therefore wanted to evaluate the ability of the C. neoformans serotype B strain to cause lethal tuberculosis in an animal model. We have also observed that the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype B strain was not as robust as the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain (4). Therefore, we investigated the virulence of the C. neoformans serotype A strain to examine if the virulence defect of the C. neoformans serotype A strain is associated with the virulence defect of the C. gattii strain.

Introduction: The diagnosis of Lyme disease in children is challengin. In addition, a number of reports of Lyme disease in adults have been published. Our patient presented with the symptoms and signs of Lyme disease in a recent visit to the home. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Lyme disease in a person.

Objective: To assess the accuracy of the diagnosis of Lyme disease in adults.

Method: Definitive diagnosis of Lyme disease in adults was made by immunohistochemistry and PCR for serum proteins and a secondary biomarker, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cell recovery.

Results: PCR-guided immunohistochemistry of CD4+ T cell in serum was positive for Borrelia burgdorferi (bovine LPS) and a serological marker CD4+ T cells (CD16+ T cells). CD16+ T cell was also positive for Borrelia burgdorferi. CD8+ T cell was positive for Borrelia burgdorferi. CD16+ T cells were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi.

Conclusion: CD8+ T cell was positive in our patient, Borrelia burgdorferi. CD8+ T cell was negative in this case.
