## Abstract
The gut microbiota is an important factor in various human health activities, such as digestion, washing hands, cleaning the stomach, and fulfillment of domestic work demands. Sensitivity of the human gut microbiota to antibiotics is increasing and an antibiotic-based approach has proved to be suitable for probiotic-based work. In this study, we evaluated the activity of nystatin-N(+)-difluioxone, a probiotic antibiotic, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the pathogens that cause diseases such as Candida spp. The bacteriome was investigated using a 4 × 2.


## Introduction
 2006.

The term “pathogen” was coined by Eichhoffer, who proposed the concept of “nutrient homeostasis”, a concept that has gained importance in the last decades. Nutrient acquisition in the form of amino acids, for example, is a common biochemical process in vertebrates, which is the main factor that governs the evolution of the entire host cell. Fungi acquire these amino acids via a common pathway, which includes the triose phosphate pathway, with the presence of trehalose, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose. The amino acids are the primary precursors for the synthesis of proteins in the cell, which are subsequently degraded via the proteasome. The amino acid biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of all kinds of proteins, which have a high metabolic demand and a high enzymatic activity, enabling the organism to obtain nutrients efficiently, such as glucose, amino acids, lipids, and vitamins (Gomori and Kamui, 2007; Seyedmousavi et al., 2010; Ghosh and Kamui, 2010; Abd-Elsalam and Abdalla, 2012). The proteasome is a large complex consisting of a lipid-binding protein complex, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and glycoproteins (GPbs), which can be separated by a combination of proteolytic, lipolytic, and post-translational modifications. In some cases, proteases can be added to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to degrade the proteins of other proteins, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). After proteolytic cleavage, GPbs are released into the cytosol, and GAGs are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where they are degraded (Kamui and Kamui, 2010).

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a secretory secretory secretory protein is secreted into the extracellular space (Kock et al., 2004). In this secretory secretory protein, the secretory protein is secreted from a membrane-bound secretory protein complex that was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ramos et al., 1992).


## Methods
All experiments were conducted in the Department of Cell Biology and Cell Biology, University of Cape Town (UK.

For the role of BBB, the experimental design was conducted using the well-established procedure in the interorgan dysfunction model for various human pathogens (Nawl, 2010). Briefly, BBB was applied as described in previous section in order to establish the model of endothelial cell mediated inhibition of the pathogen-induced Wernicke's Encephalitis (Nawl et al., 2013). Bacterial endothelial cell line MEC-7 (ATCC BAA-747) was used as a model organism. The BBB was applied as a control (Nawl et al., 2013).

For the role of BBB-induced Wernicke's Encephalitis in the pathogenesis of Wernicke's Encephalitis, the experimental design was conducted using the well-established procedure in the interorgan dysfunction model for various human pathogens (Nawl et al., 2011). Bacterial endothelial cell line T cell line JEC21 (ATCC CRL-185) was used as a model organism. The BBB was applied as a control (Nawl et al., 2012).

## Results
fumigatu. We chose the NrgD^T strain because of its relatively low virulence (10% mortality in the laboratory) and the fact that the isolate was able to grow in the presence of purified EVs and antibodies [16], [17]. The NrgD^T strain was also used as a model for evaluating the role of other NrgD-deficient strains, namely, NrgD<U+0394>/NrgD<U+0394>-URA (not shown) and NrgD<U+0394>/NrgD<U+0394>-ELV (not shown).

The virulence of NrgD^T was not dependent on its source and was dependent on the EV or antibody used for infection. The NrgD^T strain was avirulent in the mouse model and was avirulent in the mouse model of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (Fig 2a). The NrgD^T strain was avirulent in the murine model but avirulent in the mouse model of acute pulmonary aspergillosis [17], [19], [20]. The NrgD^T strain was avirulent in the murine model but avirulent in the mouse model of disseminated aspergillosis [19], [20]. The virulence of the NrgD^T strain was not dependent on the EV or antibody used for infection, and the virulence of the NrgD^T strain was dependent on the presence of purified EVs or antibodies.

In vitro susceptibility testing of the strains to a range of antifungal agents
The fungal virulence of all three NrgD^T strains was tested in triplicate assays in the murine inhalation model of infection using the standard drug antifungal fluconazole. The NrgD^T strain was highly virulent in the murine model, but was avirulent in the mouse model of disseminated aspergillosis [20].


## Discussion
mellonella can produce both a G2/M transition and a G1/M transition in response to external stimuli [36, 37. Additionally, G. mellonella induces a mating-type switch in the mycelium during infection of the host, and a mating-type switch in the ascomycete S. cerevisiae, which is controlled by the MAPK system [38]. In the present study, we used RNAseq analysis to identify genes involved in the G1/M transition. We found that the production of G1/M is regulated by the host. In addition, we also found that the production of G1/M is controlled by the MAPK system in S. cerevisiae. The MAPK pathway is regulated by the Slt2-type MAP kinase complex, which is regulated by the MAPK system [39]. This signaling network is responsible for G1/M transition in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae [40]. In addition, we found that the production of G1/M is regulated by the Slt2-type MAP kinase complex, which is regulated by the MAPK system [41]. We also found that the G1/M transition in C. albicans is controlled by the MAPK complex, which is regulated by the MAPK system [41]. This is the first study that provides insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of G. mellonella.

Our results showed that the mating-type switch is regulated by the host in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. The mating-type switch is activated by the host, but not by G. mellonella. The mating-type switch in C. albicans is activated by the G1/M switch, which is regulated by the MAPK system [40]. In contrast, in C. neoformans, the G1/M switch is activated by the G1/M switch [41]. We found that the G1/M transition in C. albicans is activated by the MAPK system and is regulated by the MAPK system in S. cerevisiae, which is regulated by the MAPK system in C. neoformans [40]. In addition, the G1/M transition in C. neoformans is activated by the MAPK system in C. albicans [40]. The MAPK system in C.
