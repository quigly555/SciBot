## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. The inhalation of environmental cryptococcal spores causes pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) infection. Despite the availability of numerous airborne molecules and numerous available antifungal compounds, the immune response against this fungal pathogen is complex. Several molecules that target the host immune system have been shown to exhibit potent antifungal activities, including peptides, peptides, and glycans. The antifungal potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has also been proposed as a defense strategy against cryptococcosis. In the current study, we identified a molecule, designated as C16orf1 (Me), that interfered with the interaction of the host anti-fungal compounds against this yeast. MAb treatment resulted in cell surface changes in the cryptococcal strain with an M13- or M13-deficient cryptococccine-like protein phenotype.


## Introduction
Lung involvement is one of the most common clinical presentations of cryptococcosis in patients with HIV/AIDS. Of the 33 patients that were initially diagnosed with cryptococcosis, Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common and fatal organism, followed by the opportunistic pathogen Cryptococcus gattii (reviewed in [1-3]). Although Cryptococcus neoformans is capable of infecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, it is the most common cause of infection in AIDS patients [4,5]. However, the incidence of cryptococcosis is increasing in patients with AIDS. In this study, we present a case of cryptococcosis in a patient with HIV, and report the latest available information on cryptococcosis in the context of HIV.


## Methods
(S1 Text.

The review of the literature, combined with literature review and meta-analysis, was reviewed to determine whether there was any evidence of an acute liver injury, and whether there were differences in the outcomes between acute liver injury and not-injury. The review was classified as follows: acute liver injury: documented a prolonged period of intense severe pain, loss of mobility, or ischemic heart disease. Chronic liver injury: documented a prolonged period of moderate intensity, severe, superficial heart pain, and loss of mobility. Expected to be present at death in the future: documented a prolonged period of time with significant decline in mobility, particularly in the first few days.

The meta-analysis was determined with the Cochrane review of the medical records of patients with liver cirrhosis. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who were at risk for acute liver injury (AHL) [15]. Secondary outcomes included liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and liver/biliary transplantation. The analysis was performed using the pooled data from all studies with the most recent publications.

Ethical considerations
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organizationâ€™s Migrating Organ Burden Report [16].


## Results

Further, the pAUG3-predicted AUG3-like regions in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections were largely filled by well-conserved RNAs in the sense and antisense orientations (Figure S4. Moreover, two of the largest RNAs in the sense and antisense orientations of the pAUG3-predicted AUG3-like regions were found in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections (Figure S5).

Finally, a second region in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections was highly conserved between human and animal species (Figure S6). The first segment, containing the largest number of predicted proteins in each organism, was highly conserved in both human and animal species. Moreover, the second segment contained three predicted proteins in both species, which were highly conserved in both species (Figure S7).

The third region in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections was highly conserved between human and animal species. The first segment contained two predicted proteins in both species (Figure S8).

The last region in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections was highly conserved between human and animal species. The first segment contained two predicted proteins in both species (Figure S9).

In addition, the pAUG3-predicted AUG3-like regions in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections were highly conserved between human and animal species (Figure S10).

The largest number of predicted proteins in the pAUG3-predicted AUG3-like regions were found in the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections (Figure S11).

The second region in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections was highly conserved between human and animal species. The first segment contained two predicted proteins in both species (Figure S12).

The pAUG3-predicted AUG3-like regions in the genome of the dark side of no-till and opportunistic infections were highly conserved between human and animal species (Figure S13).


## Discussion

The most abundant Cn in this study is the mainstay of Cn-producing sphingolipid polymers and flavonoid. This is not surprising as the production of Cn-like flavonoids has been linked to a number of diseases, including acute or chronic invasive fungal infections (24). Additionally, our results show that Cn-producing BcCn can also produce fungal-specific polymers (e.g. flavonols and mannitol). These polymers are probably not produced by BcCn-producing fungi but by Cn-producing fungi. The fact that BcCn-producing fungi produce flavonoids and that they are not produced by BcCn-producing fungi is consistent with our previous observations that BcCn-producing fungi can also produce eumelanin and mannitol (25). The abundance of BcCn-producing fungi in our study suggests that the industrial-scale production of Cn-producing Cn-monomers could be conducted on a large scale.

The most abundant transcript in this study is the Cn-522 transcript that is expressed by <U+0394>cnaA and <U+0394>cnaB in response to C. albicans infection. This Cn-522 transcript is highly expressed in the <U+0394>cnaA strain but not in the <U+0394>cnaB strain. This transcript was also highly expressed in the <U+0394>cnaB strain but not in the <U+0394>cnaB strain. In contrast to the Cn-522 transcript, the <U+0394>cnaA strain was found to express the Cn-522 transcript. The expression of Cn-522 in the <U+0394>cnaA strain is even higher than the transcript of CnaB in the <U+0394>cnaB strain. The same pattern was observed in the <U+0394>cnaA strain. In contrast to CnaB, which encodes for the acetylated Cn-522, CnaA is not expressed in <U+0394>cnaA.
