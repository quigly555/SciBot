## Abstract
A 35-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a four-week history of cough, fever and sore throat for four weeks. He had a history of diabetes mellitus, smoking and drinking, weight loss and history of diabetes. On examination, he was obese and had history of diabetes and non-diabetic diabetes. He was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and treated with high-dose levofloxacin.


## Introduction
The genus of the Dothideomycetes comprises an ascomycetous group of filamentous fungi that includes the plant pathogen Dothistroma cassiicola (teleomorph Ananthera cassiicola [1]). Dothistromes are a complex of cryptic, cryptic and asexual genera, which include asexual and sexual fungi, as well as more than 20 other taxa of closely related, cryptic and sexual fungi that occur on various plant hosts [2-4].


## Methods
We used the combination of the FLC and CHP treatments to increase the exposure to contaminant. In the FLC treatment, the FLC treatment alone and the control were included. In the CHP treatment, the CHP treatment alone and the control were included. We tested the FLC treatment alone and the control with the combination of FLC and CHP treatment and found that there is no difference in the FLC treatment and the control, while the treatment with the FLC and CHP treatments do not result in any effect on the FLC treatment. In our preliminary study, we tested the FLC treatment alone and the control with the combination of FLC and CHP treatment and found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments are superior to the control treatments (Figure 1).

The FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments is considered the most effective treatment in terms of reducing the number of CFU and the reduction in the risk of incident of bloodstream infection (Figure 2). In our preliminary study, we tested the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments and found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments is superior to the control treatments (Figure 3). The combination of the two treatments and the control of the two treatments are different in terms of the treatment intensity and the time to death (Figure 4).

In a second study, we used the combination of the two treatments to decrease the exposure to contaminants. We found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments decreased the exposure to contaminants compared to the control treatment (Figure 5). In our preliminary study, we tested the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments and found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments are superior to the control treatments (Figure 6). The combination of the two treatments and the control of the two treatments are different in terms of the treatment intensity and the time to death (Figure 7).

In a third study, we used the combination of the two treatments to reduce the exposure to contaminants. We found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments decreased the exposure to contaminants compared to the control treatment (Figure 8). In our preliminary study, we tested the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments and found that the FLC treatment with the combination of the two treatments are superior to the control treatments (Figure 9).


## Results
neoformans is a relatively recent event [44], and it has been shown that . neoformans infection of macrophages is an effective strategy to treat C. neoformans infections in patients with C. neoformans infection [45-47]. Our cohort of C. neoformans-infected human bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was generated using the well-characterized, opportunistic Cryptococcus neoformans strain, JEC21. The culture medium was obtained from a C. neoformans-infected patient on the day of C. neoformans infection, and the fungal burden in the lungs was determined by CFU counting on day 7 post-inoculation.

We found that C. neoformans infection of BMDMs was more lethal than that of BMMs or CSF cells, although there was a slight difference in CFU counts between the two groups (Table 2). However, the fungal burden in the lungs of C. neoformans-infected BMDMs was similar to that of BMMs or CSF cells (Fig 2). The number of CFU in the lungs of C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice was much lower than that of C. neoformans-infected BMMs or CSF cells (Fig 2).

In addition, we observed a slight increase in fungal burden in the brains of C57BL/6 mice at all time points tested (Fig 3).

C. neoformans Is Not Essential for Virulence in C57BL/6 Macrophages
In C. neoformans infection, C. neoformans can be propagated through the lungs and brain through the thoracic cavity [8, 49, 50]. Therefore, we reasoned that C. neoformans could play a role in C. neoformans virulence in a C57BL/6 macrophage-like cell line.

Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that C. neoformans infection of C. neoformans cells can be propagated through the lungs or brain via the thoracic cavity, and we were particularly interested in studying the role of C. neoformans in C. neoformans virulence in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice.


## Discussion
sympodialis inoculated with various . sympodialis strains. In our study, we used three different culture media (YPD, 2% glycerol, and 2% sucrose) and used two different sera for the study of the effect of inoculation. In our experiments, we used two different sera (YPD and 2% glycerol) and used two different sera (2% sucrose and 2% glycerol). It is worth noting that the M. sympodialis inoculum used in our studies was used in this study, and we used it for the same experiments.

The M. sympodialis inoculum was inoculated with the following media: YPD, 2% glycerol, 2% sucrose, and 2% glycerol. The sera of all three inoculum types were used for this study. No M.
