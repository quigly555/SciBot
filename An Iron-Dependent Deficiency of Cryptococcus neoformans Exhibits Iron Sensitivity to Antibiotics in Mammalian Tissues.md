## Abstract
We report a case of a 76-year-old woman with HIV who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a four-week history of coughing and pantycardia. The diagnosis was made on clinical, radiological, and histologic examination, and she was given the appropriate antifungal treatment. However, the patient continued to have respiratory symptoms of coughing and pantycardia and developed neurosyphilis, a meningitis, despite the administration of a second antifungal agent. This case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing CNS fungal meningitis and the importance of recognizing and managing patients with CNS infections with continued unexplained coughing and pantycardia.

A patient with unexplained coughing and pantycardia can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is necessary to initiate an anti-fungal treatment. Prompt diagnosis and management of the underlying condition are important.


## Introduction
In contrast, the lack of iron by . tuberculosis (Mtb) is sufficient to trigger the expression of the iron-responsive genes Toxoplasma gondii, Toxoplasma gondii-responsive genes and B cells [31]. In addition, Mtb-mediated iron-dependent iron acquisition is required for growth under iron-limiting conditions [32]. In other words, Mtb is able to sense the iron limitation and can utilize this iron to exploit its own resources. Iron is an essential component for many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, protein turnover, autophagy, and virulence [33,34].

Iron and other metals are able to be used as catalysts to produce enzymes that are able to catalyze the oxidation of both iron and other metals. The presence of iron and other metals in the human body, along with other micronutrients, can exert selective pressure on the immune system. This selective pressure can be exerted through different mechanisms, such as iron-binding, iron-dependent permeability, and iron-dependent inhibition of bacteria [35]. The iron-binding mechanism is highly conserved in the vertebrate host, and the iron-dependent permeability is found in most tissues [36]. The ability to absorb iron and to utilize the iron in the presence of other metals has been well characterized in the human host. This includes iron-zinc, ferric, and/or siderophore proteins. Iron-zinc-binding proteins include the siderophore binding protein 2 (Sco2), the siderophore binding protein VII (sco2) and the siderophore transporter (sct1) [37,38]. Iron-binding proteins have a role in iron uptake and transport [39,40].

In the human host, the key iron-binding proteins of the human body, including siderophores, are the ferric reductases, which degrade iron-containing ferric substrates to smaller fragments. The siderophore reductase complex (SHCS) is the main iron-dependent iron-sensing proteins. The SHCS complex is comprised of four members: the reductive iron-reductase (RIF), the ferric reductase (FR), and the ferrous reductase (FR), all of which are activated by the activation of the ferroxidase, which results in ferroxidase activity [41,42].


## Methods
The experimental protocol for the rabbit blood-feces test was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Texas Medical Branch at San Antoni. The tested compound was obtained from the Mycology Research Laboratory of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Briefly, a sample of blood from an infected rabbit was cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) for 72 h at 37 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cell pellet was washed twice with sterile distilled water. The cell pellet was suspended in sterile distilled water and counted with a hemocytometer. The concentration of compound in the sample was calculated by the following formula: (C_T) × 100.

Immunoblotting and identification of compounds in the serum
The sera from the immunosuppressed mice were screened for their antibacterial activities against the tested compound by immunoblotting. The sera from the immunosuppressed mice were tested for their antimicrobial activity against the tested compound. The samples were subjected to the automated bead-beating method, and the microtiter dilution method was followed. A minimum of 100,000 steps were performed for each compound in a biological triplicate. Each compound was diluted in PBS, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After that, 100 µl of the cell suspension was added to each well of the 96-well plates. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the colorimetric index (I_A) was calculated by subtracting the absorbance of the well with the lowest concentration of the test compound. The I_A value was calculated as the ratio between the lowest concentration of the test compound (0.5 µg/ml) and the highest concentration (0.125 µg/ml) of the tested compound (i.e., the 100% inhibitory concentration). The data were then plotted against the I_A value for each compound.

Data analysis
The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States).


## Results
We tested whether the reduced growth rate of the strain can be attributed to reduced iron availability by determining the susceptibility of the mutant to iron-limiting conditions and determining the susceptibility of the wild type and reconstituted strains to iron-limiting iron condition. As shown in Figure 2, the growth of the strain was greatly reduced in iron-limiting conditions, and it was completely resistant to the iron limitation of P. aeruginosa, which is an osmotolerant yeast. In contrast, the growth of the strain was severely reduced in the presence of P. aeruginosa and copper-limiting conditions, but the growth of the strain was completely recovered in the presence of copper-limiting conditions, and the growth of the strain was restored to the wild type level in the presence of copper-limiting conditions. The growth of the strain was also completely restored in the presence of copper-limiting conditions, and the growth of the strain was completely restored in the presence of copper-limiting conditions. These results indicated that the reduced growth of Cryptococcus neoformans strains in iron-limited conditions can be attributed to the inability of the mutant to grow in iron-limited conditions.

Deletion of SNF2 or SNF5 of Cryptococcus neoformans SreA Considered a Biologically Unhealthy Alternative to Cryptococcus neoformans Strain
Given the importance of iron for maintaining cell viability and the importance of iron in Cryptococcus neoformans pathogenesis, we speculated that the strain might have a better capacity to survive in a hostile environment. The ability of the mutant to grow in iron-limited conditions was examined and compared to the wild type, and the results indicated that the mutant displayed a decreased ability to grow in iron-limiting conditions. The mutant also exhibited a reduced ability to grow in iron-limited conditions. The mutant also exhibited a reduced ability to grow in iron-limiting conditions. The growth of the mutant was restored to the wild type level in the presence of iron-limiting conditions. The growth of the strain was restored to the wild type level in the presence of iron-limiting conditions.


## Discussion
neoformans were deficient in iron acquisition via iron acquisition pathways that are independent of the mannose-binding proteins, Mfn1 and Mfn. These genes were previously shown to be critical for the pathogenesis of C. neoformans, a human fungal pathogen [24], [45]. In this study, we used an iron-dependent assay to test the role of Mfn1 and Mfn2 in iron acquisition, which we confirmed in the RNA-Seq data. Furthermore, we also showed that iron acquisition pathways are not essential for C. neoformans virulence, but are essential for the pathogenesis of C. neoformans, since the most severe cases of cryptococcosis and other invasive candidiasis involve the lungs and brain. In addition, we also showed that C. neoformans requires Mfn1 and Mfn2 for iron acquisition. In addition, we also showed that Mfn1 and Mfn2 are important for iron resistance.

In the present study, we found that iron acquisition pathway is involved in C. neoformans pathogenesis. In addition, we also showed that C. neoformans can be rescued by the overexpression of Mfn1 and Mfn2, and the activity of Mfn1 and Mfn2 in protecting C. neoformans against stress conditions. The overexpression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 could affect iron acquisition, and this could be related to the iron-dependent response. In addition, Mfn1 and Mfn2 could help C. neoformans in iron starvation conditions. In our study, we showed that Mfn1 and Mfn2 might be involved in the iron-dependent response. Therefore, we believe that the Mfn1 and Mfn2 might be involved in the iron-dependent response.

The activity of Mfn1 and Mfn2 was mainly regulated by the overexpression of Mfn2. We also found that Mfn1 and Mfn2 were required for C. neoformans growth, and this could be related to the iron-dependent response. However, it is worth noting that the <U+0394>Mfn1 and <U+0394>Mfn2 mutants of C. neoformans were killed at higher concentrations of iron than the wild-type strain, which would explain the decreased virulence in these mutants.
