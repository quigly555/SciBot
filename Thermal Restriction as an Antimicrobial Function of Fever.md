## Abstract
The emerging pathogenic fungus Candida albicans is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particularly in regions with endemic C. albicans densities comparable to those found in the global area of the organism. It is therefore paramount that we develop a better understanding of this multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen to enable the development of novel therapeutics against this emerging opportunistic human pathogen.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a frequent human fungal pathogen, accounting for the vast majority of fungal infections, as well as causing a wide range of non-infectious bloodstream infections in many countries [1]. Despite the availability of antifungal agents, mortality remains high despite availability [2].


## Methods
The MICs of the compound were determined by the standard methods and were calculated as MIC values after incubation at 35°C for 24 .

In order to evaluate the potential antifungal activity of the compound, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration at which no visible growth was observed. The lowest concentration at which no visible growth was observed was considered the MIC. The MIC of the compound was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound at which no visible growth was observed.

Antifungal Activity of the Compound
The antifungal activity of the compound was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) using the micro-dilution method [27]. Briefly, the MICs were determined by a micro-dilution assay with the following modifications: (i) the broth dilution method; (ii) the suspension method; and (iii) the final concentrations of the compound at which no visible growth was observed. The MIC of the compound was defined as the lowest concentration at which no visible growth was observed.

Antifungal Activity of the Compound
The antifungal activity of the compound was evaluated by measuring the MIC as previously described [28]. Briefly, the MIC of the compound was determined by using the MIC, MIC_10, and MIC_20 methods [28]. The MIC was determined by using the micro-dilution method and was calculated as the lowest concentration of the compound at which no visible growth was observed. The MIC_10 and MIC_20 values were obtained from the following standardized concentrations of the compound: 0.125, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 µg/mL. The MIC_10 and MIC_20 values were obtained from the following standardized concentrations of the compound: 0.125, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 µg/mL.

Antifungal Activity of the Compound
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by using the method of Liu et al. [29]. The MIC was determined by using the MIC_10, MIC_20, and MIC_10 and MIC_20 values, respectively, in the broth microdilution method.


## Results
Infected mice had a much higher mortality rate of .5% (Fig 2A) than that of uninfected mice (3.8%). This finding suggests that F. solani (and its derivatives) are able to exert a protective effect in the mice of F. oxysporum.

The killing activity of F. oxysporum ssp. ssp. is dependent on the temperature of the host [24]. Therefore, we tested the effect of different temperatures on the killing activity of F. oxysporum. As shown in Fig 2B, when the fungus was cultured under 10°C, the fungal cells were killed by either 0 or 1°C, whereas the killing activity of the heat killed F. oxysporum ssp. ssp. was much lower than that of the heat killed F. oxysporum ssp. ssp. (Fig 2B). As the temperature of the host is a critical factor for F. oxysporum survival, we tested whether F. oxysporum ssp. ssp. might attenuate the susceptibility of the mice of F. oxysporum to F. oxysporum ssp. s. The survival rate of the infected mice after F. oxysporum ssp. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s. s.


## Discussion
 was reported to be susceptible to fluconazole, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used for treatment of bacterial infections [37. In this study, we used Fasciola pseudomallei as a host model to investigate the role of Fasciola in fungal infections.

We found that Fasciola induced basal inflammation and killed fungal cells, while Fasciola killed fungus-infected infected macrophages. The reason for the activation of Fasciola-mediated fungal killing by Fasciola-infected macrophages is not known. The fact that Fasciola-infected macrophages showed higher levels of Fasciola-induced oxidative stress than uninfected macrophages suggests that Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress is activated by Fasciola-induced oxidative stress. The results of this study also suggested that Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress plays a protective role for Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, we conducted Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress test in vitro to evaluate the role of Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress in Fasciola-mediated fungal infection. The results showed that Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress induced the higher levels of Fasciola-induced fungal killing compared with that of Fasciola alone. This indicates that Fasciola-mediated oxidative stress is also activated by Fasciola-induced fungal killing.

We hypothesized that the action of Fasciola might be due to fungal killing. We have shown that Fasciola induces the host defense response, which activated the host innate immune system, and triggered the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-4, and TNF-a, which were reported to be associated with the induction of the innate immune system [38]. Therefore, we hypothesized that Fasciola might activate the host defense response and trigger the release of proinflammatory mediators. However, we could not find any significant difference in the release of IL-4 in the Fasciola-treated or in the untreated macrophages, as the results of this study are not similar to those of the previous studies.
