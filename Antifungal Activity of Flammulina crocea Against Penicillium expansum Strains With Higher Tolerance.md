## Abstract
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in Guilan State, Philippines.

Medical records of 380 HIV-infected and 380 HIV-uninfected patients, from whom only 62.2% were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis between 2011 and 2014 were reviewed. Diagnostic variables were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. The incidence rates for cryptococcal meningitis were estimated using the International Association for Research and Treatment of Cancer Institute (IAptPCTC). The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated using the Calgary Protocol.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a serious fungal infection that can lead to life-threatening invasive pulmonary infections, including pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis, meningoencephalitis, and ventilator-related pulmonary disease [1]. The diagnosis is complicated by the complex interplay of host and organism, particularly by the complex interaction of host defense mechanisms with virulence factors and pathogenesis-related mechanisms [2].

C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast-like fungus that causes infection in the lung and is responsible for more than 600,000 deaths every year [3]. C.


## Methods
Penicillium species used in this study were Penicillium catenariae and Penicillium equatorialum (. equatorialum) (Table 1).

To perform the antimicrobial assay, the antimicrobial activity of the antifungal agent was determined by adding the tested fungal strains to the inoculation medium and the assay was performed by plating the resulting suspension on solid YPD agar.

## Results
A. fumigatus is resistant to tunicamycin and dithiothreitol
We previously reported that A. fumigatus is sensitive to aflatoxin (AFT) and dithiothreitol (DTT) and is resistant to dithiocarbamate (DCC) and terbinafine (TAB) (9). We therefore tested the A. fumigatus susceptibility to various tunicamycin (TM) and DTT (0.05-3.


## Discussion
lusitaniae

As discussed earlier, the relatively low biomass yield of flammulina on dead wood of Fusarium sp. (Fig 2) was higher than that of other fungal taxa such as Fusarium graminearum and Cryptococcus neoformans [19-21]. The low biomass yield of flammulina was attributed to the high cost of the biomass decomposition process. However, the increased cost of biomass decomposition process of Fusarium spp. has also been shown to be associated with the presence of other fungi, such as Alternaria and Penicillium species [22-24].

To assess the toxicity of the crude extract of Flammulina crocea against the two Penicillium species, the maximum concentration of crude extract of Flammulina crocea (10 µg/mL) was determined. However, when crude extract of Flammulina crocea was used for the inhibition of Penicillium expansum Strains, the maximum concentrations of crude extract of Flammulina crocea were determined (10 µg/mL).

According to the results of the experimental and experimental results, the toxicity of the crude extract of Flammulina crocea against Penicillium expansum Strains was the lowest on dead wood of Fusarium spp. (Fig 2), and the highest concentration (10 µg/mL) was determined in the presence of F. lusitaniae. The lowest concentrations of crude extract of Flammulina crocea (10 µg/mL) were determined in the presence of F. lusitaniae. These results are in accordance with those of other studies that have reported the highest toxicity of the crude extract of Flammulina crocea against Penicillium expansum Strains. The highest concentrations of crude extract of Fusarium spp. (10 µg/mL) was determined in the presence of F. lusitaniae. The highest concentrations of crude extract of Fusarium spp. (10 µg/mL) were determined in the presence of F. graminearum. The lowest concentrations of crude extract of Fusarium spp. (10 µg/mL) were determined in the presence of F. graminearum.
