## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii. It is currently believed that the worldwide distribution of the fluconazole-resistant strain, ST5, is due to a fluconazole-resistant strain of C. neoformans. In this study, we analyzed fluconazole susceptibility patterns in 122 clinical strains of C. neoformans. Our results showed that the clinical fluconazole susceptibilities of fluconazole-susceptible and fluconazole-susceptible clinical C. neoformans were 1.03 and 1.03, respectively. The results also showed that the clinical fluconazole-susceptible strains were 2.78 and 2.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungal pathogen and is the second most common cause of invasive aspergillosis, first being diagnosed in 1997 [1]. While the disease affects immunocompromised patients, it is also found in healthy individuals and is rarely seen in patients with immune deficiencies. However, invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an infection caused by Aspergillus species, particularly A. fumigatus [2]. It can be caused by various species of the genus Aspergillus, including A. flavus, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. protozoanus, and A.


## Methods
 g L^-1] with the addition of .5% DMSO (1:1 wt/vol) and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The production of NO_2 was measured by indirect counting of spore-derived NO_2 using the Nikon SMZ1500 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by the Nikon DS-U2 and NIS Elements 4.70 software.

O-MTA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR using the primers oMTA-F and oMTA-R. For each PCR reaction, the o-MTA signal was amplified using the 5'-CTCGTCCTCCTGAGTGCTCG-3' and 3'-CTCCACCTACGCCGGTTTCCG-3' primers and was then labeled with a fluorophore (DNA labeling kit, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using the Quant-iT ÄktaGene 3000 QPCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Western Blot of NO_2
SDA-containing medium was used to prepare monensin and a layer of PEG-urea-elicited monensin (1 mg mL^-1) was added to the monensin and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and re-suspended in 1% Tween 20. The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The lysate was mixed with 1% SDS and incubated at 60°C for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube.


## Results
tuberculosis infection, we showed that . tuberculosis can trigger a macrophage-driven immune response [14]. To test whether P. aeruginosa-infected cells may have similar macrophage-driven immune responses, we generated P. aeruginosa-infected P. aeruginosa-infected macrophages and tested the macrophage-mediated immune response in these cells. As shown in Fig 5, there was no difference in the amount of macrophages in infected cells after 24 h of infection (Fig 5A). These results suggest that P. aeruginosa can induce macrophage-mediated immune responses in M. tuberculosis-infected cells.

To explore the P. aeruginosa-induced immune response in RAW 264.7 macrophages, we stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages with P. aeruginosa and phagocytosis was performed by the use of the J774 macrophage line. As shown in Fig 6, there was a significant increase in the number of RAW 264.7 cells in response to P. aeruginosa (P<0.05) and the number of macrophages in response to P. aeruginosa was significantly higher in infected cells than in uninfected cells (P<0.05).

To evaluate whether the number of macrophages in infected cells could be quantified by the P. aeruginosa-induced immune response, we tested the viability of RAW 264.7 cells by flow cytometry after 24 h of infection. As shown in Fig 7, infected cells had a higher number of viable cells compared to uninfected cells.

We next investigated the P. aeruginosa-induced M. tuberculosis phagocytosis by RAW 264.7 cells. As shown in Fig 8, the number of viable cells was higher in infected cells compared to uninfected cells.

## Discussion
difficile Spore-Macrophage Interactions
The results of this study demonstrate that interleukin-1-1 and interferon-<U+03B3> release by macrophages and neutrophils is dependent on the M1 macrophage activation of M2 macrophage. In the absence of M1 macrophages, interleukin-1-1 and interferon-<U+03B3> release by neutrophils and C57BL/6J mice is highly dependent on M1 macrophages. In the presence of macrophages, interleukin-1-1 release was increased by 1.5-fold by the addition of macrophages. In the presence of neutrophils, interleukin-1-1 release by macrophages was increased by 1.6-fold by the addition of macrophages. These results demonstrate that macrophages are the primary activators of interleukin-1-1 release by macrophages.

In our previous studies, the macrophages from the control group and the LPS-treated mice showed enhanced macrophage activation after treatment with interleukin-1-1 (IL-17A) and interferon-<U+03B3> (IL-23) in response to LPS-induced IL-23 release in C57BL/6J macrophages. This result confirmed that the TLR4 activation pathway was activated in the absence of macrophages, which was in agreement with previous studies. In addition, the results from our previous study showed that macrophages from the LPS-treated mice, which showed enhanced interleukin-1-1 release by macrophages, also increased IL-17A release. This result further confirmed that macrophages were the primary activators of interleukin-1-1 release by macrophages. These results are in agreement with the previous studies. In addition, the results from the present study showed that macrophages from the LPS-treated group, which showed enhanced interleukin-1-1 release by macrophages, also increased IL-17A release. These results are in agreement with the previous studies.
