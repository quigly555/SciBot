## Abstract
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a virus that is endemic in the lungs of patients with nephrotic syndrome and it’s associated diseases. Patients with EBV infection are highly susceptible to other viral infections, including Chikungunya virus (CYV), Meyronelanthamoeba virus (LPV), and other viral etiologies. In this review, we first summarize the knowledge about the viral subtype B (VSB) in the nephrotic syndrome (NT) and it’s associated diseases. We then review the current knowledge about the role played by the nephrotic syndrome subtype B (VSB) B-cell in viral infections and the molecular mechanisms of disease in the NT. Finally, we try to highlight the role of the NT in virulence, host cell cytotoxicity, and the reactivity of EBV-related virus among patients with NT and HLN syndrome.


## Introduction
The genus Trametes was first proposed by Bernhardt (1909), who described the genus Trametes based on three generic types. According to the type of the genus, eight species are described as trametine, nine species as trametin, thirteen species as trametin-co-substituent, and seven species as trametin-hydroxyacyclovir (TCAH) and two species as Trametella carrionii, Trametella amurensis and Trametella cryptica.


## Methods
 2014. The bacterial strain was isolated from a healthy animal (Charles River, United Kingdom) at the Veterinary Tropical Diseases Service (TVTDS) Clinical Laboratory, Nauru, and maintained at the Veterinary Tropical Diseases Service Laboratory, Nauru.

Animal studies
All animal experiments were carried out under UK Home Office licenses and were approved by the University of Aberdeen Animal Welfare Ethics Committee (AWC) and the University of Aberdeen Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). The work was conducted in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and was approved by the University of Aberdeen Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB).

Infection of mice with Burkholderia spp. was performed using standard bacteriostatic techniques as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2012). Briefly, for infection, 10-week old male BALB/c mice (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States) were infected with 10^7 bacteria (s.p.) of each strain (100 µl/mouse) by oral gavage for 5 days. On the day of infection, the mice were sacrificed by CO_2 asphyxiation and the spleen was harvested. The spleen was removed and the fungal burden was measured by plating serial dilutions on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. The inocula were determined by plating serial dilutions on brain heart infusion agar. The isolates were then purified and maintained on brain heart infusion agar at 4 °C.

For in vitro virulence assays, 5 × 10^4 CFU/ml were plated on brain heart infusion agar (BHI) plates. A serial dilution of the bacterial strain (5 × 10^4 CFU/ml) was then spread on blood agar plates (BD Bactel) to test for viable bacteria in the suspension. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 7 days, and CFU/ml counts were calculated. The colony forming units (CFU) of each strain were calculated from the number of CFU in each plate, and the average value of two replicates. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

Animal studies
All in vitro virulence assays were conducted in triplicate. For in vivo assays, mice were treated with a standard antibiotic solution (0.


## Results
Among the 68 strains, three were single maltotolerant isolates. The remaining three were single maltotolerant isolates. Two were single maltotolerant isolates. Eleven strains were grouped into a clade of C. neoformans var. grubii (clade I) that is distinct from the other clades in C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans. The C. neoformans var. grubii isolate W303 was isolated from a clinical isolate in an outbreak of S. Typhimurium spp. (S Typhimurium spp.). The other six isolates were isolated from a clinical isolate in an outbreak of S. Typhimurium spp. (S Typhimurium spp.) and were identified as C. neoformans var. neoformans by PCR as previously described (8). The isolates were identified by their phylogenetic tree (Fig 1). All strains clustered together in a well-supported clade (Fig 1).

The most abundant cryptococcal species isolated in the outbreak were C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans (Fig 2). The clade included isolates of C. gattii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. neoformans var. neoformans (Fig 2). The four other isolates were also identified as C. neoformans var. grubii by PCR as described in the material and methods section. The C. neoformans var. grubii isolates were identified by their phylogenetic tree (Fig 2). The isolates clustered together in a well-supported clade (Fig 2). The isolate C. neoformans var. grubii was found to be grouped with C.


## Discussion
However, the effect of the catheter-associated uricase on innate immunity is not well understood, although a role for catheter-associated uricase has been reported in an invertebrate model of invasive aspergillosis [26.

In addition to the two catheter-associated uricase inhibitors, two other inhibitors, PI(4,5)_2BP and PI(4,5)_2, were also found in the catheter-associated uricase-mutant strain, including 5-flucytosine and 5-flucytosine-2, respectively. 5-flucytosine is an antifungal drug that has shown in vitro activity against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata, with no toxicity to human beings [27]. 6-flucytosine is a salvage drug, with antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans, and has been shown to have potential in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis [28]. The other inhibitors, PI(4,5)_2BP and PI(4,5)_2, were also found in the catheter-associated uricase-mutant strain, including 5-flucytosine and 5-flucytosine-2.

The catheter-associated uricase-mutant strain also had the same degree of PI(4,5)_2 as the catheter-associated uricase-mutant. In vitro activity of 5-flucytosine against Cryptococcus neoformans has also been reported [29]. The catheter-associated uricase-mutant strain also had the same degree of PI(4,5)_2 as the catheter-associated uricase-mutant.

The catheter-associated uricase-mutant strain also had the same degree of PI(4,5)_2 as the catheter-associated uricase-mutant. However, there were differences in the degree of PI(4,5)_2 between catheter-associated uricase-mutant and catheter-associated uricase-mutant strains.
