## Abstract
We evaluated the activity of essential oils (EOs) against Candida species, and the toxicity of EOs were determined using checkerboard assays. The EOs were tested against model organisms using standard Bacillus Calmax and RAPD methods, and antifungal amphotericin B was used as a first-line treatment. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined by using broth microdilution method. The MIC and MFC were 0.03-4 mg/mL and 0.06-16 mg/mL, respectively. The MFC concentration and activity were dose-dependent and MIC were 0.06-2 mg/mL. The activity of essential oils were dose-dependent and the activity of the MFC was 0.5 mg/mL. Cytotoxicity and the activity of essential oils were dose-dependent and the activity of the essential and nonessential oils were 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. The antifungal activity of the essential oils was dose-dependent and the activity of the nonessential oils were 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively.


## Introduction
The marine environment has been known to harbor a plethora of microorganisms called mycolangiophagous (MM) fungi that may be responsible for disease (cerebral pneumonia, pneumonia), disease and even death (Sivakibas-Bojana et al., 2017). A number of studies have reported the existence of MM fungi in the marine environment (Welker et al., 2009; Pfeiffer et al., 2017).


## Methods
Thus, in the present study, the clinical stages were analyzed as first stage (stage A), second stage (stage B) and third stage (stage C) in terms of progression of the diseas. The incidence of first stage (stage A) and second stage (stage B) patients in our study were compared with patients in our hospital and compared with patients in the national hospital. The classification of diseases in this study was based on the clinical characteristics, disease outcomes, and the cause of death. The classification of diseases in our study was based on the clinical characteristics, disease outcomes and the cause of death.

Diagnostic criteria
The diagnosis of bacterial peritonitis was based on the diagnosis of probable bacterial peritonitis in the patient by a combination of histopathology and microbiology. The diagnosis of early fatal bacterial infections was based on a combination of histopathology and microbiology. The diagnosis of early fatal bacterial infections was based on a combination of microbiology and histopathology.


## Results
A total of 30 patients were diagnosed with C. albicans infection with a median age of 51.4 years (range 22-67 years). The median duration of symptoms was 4-6 days (range 0-7 days). The clinical manifestations were characterized by a clinical disease: predominantly central nervous system (n = 5), peripheral (n = 5) and perivascular (n = 5) signs, mostly hypo and hypo-stitial lesions (n = 3), progressive dilatation (n = 2), diffuse and diffuse diffuse edema (n = 2), and necrosis (n = 2). All the patients had a positive CSF culture, but the negative culture was not available for further analysis.

Patient characteristics: Mean age was 38.9 years (range 0-84 years) with a mean CSF glucose level of 1.6 mmol/L (range 1.1-2.1 mmol/L). The mean CSF protein concentration was 17.5 mg/L (range 0.6-32.5 mg/L). CSF culture was positive for a bacterial pathogen. The CSF protein concentration was 18.5 mg/L (range 0.6-32.5 mg/L). No significant differences in the CSF glucose level between the two groups were found.

Overall mortality rate was 20.8% (95% CI 1.6-35.6%). This was similar to the overall mortality rate of 14.1% (95% CI 1.1-22.8%) in the NS-ICI group. The overall mortality rate was 14.1% (95% CI 1.7-17.8%).

The mortality rate was 0.8% (95% CI 0.6-1.0%) in the NS-ICI group. There was no difference in the rate of mortality between the two groups (0.


## Discussion

The latter is one of the more rare cases reporte. In our case, the patient had undergone a relative chemotherapy (prognosis of infectious disease) for breast cancer and had only a single episode of renal failure, a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the patient was not on the chemotherapy. The patient was then commenced on regimens of oral steroids (racosumonie, n = 6) and oral immunoglobulins (cyclophosphamide, n = 7) (n = 2), despite no evidence of this. This suggests that a progression of the disease is not likely to have been due to a lack of renal function, as is the case in the current case [15].

There are many possible explanations for the early fatal bacterial peritonitis cases in patients with metastatic colon cancer. In the case of the patient in our case, the antibiotic therapy was commenced before the infection, which would have been indicated by the positive results of the infectious disease (remission of sepsis) and the patient's renal failure.

The literature also suggests that the malignant tumor cells are less likely to be able to clear the peritonitis in the setting of metastasis [16]. We believe that the lack of progression of the disease and the lack of renal function may have contributed to the lack of a negative result in our patient.

We also found a previous case of a patient with metastatic cancer with a CD4 cell count of 200/ÂµL (metastasis). The patient was then transferred on a course of corticosteroid treatment, which may have contributed to the lack of renal function.

The patient in our case was also on corticosteroid therapy (racosumonie, n = 8) as a result of a concurrent infection with a tumor-like malignant tumor. However, the patient had only a short illness and was discharged on a course of corticosteroid treatment. The patient in our case had a short illness and was discharged on a course of corticosteroid therapy.

The patient in our case had a short illness and was discharged on a course of corticosteroid therapy, which may have contributed to the lack of renal function.

The patient in our case had a small illness and was discharged on a course of corticosteroid treatment.
