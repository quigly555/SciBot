## Abstract
The use of various biological control agents has been extensively explored for the management of various diseases. Among them, the use of chemicals or physical substances that cause biological effects is a major contributor to their occurrence. Biological agents are generally regarded as natural or synthetic substances and can be induced by various means such as diet, physical exercise, physical exercise, chemicals, or by combination with other substances.


## Introduction
With the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, many of them with genetic or acquired immune defects, such as HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplant recipients, patients on prolonged immunosuppressive regimens, and patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy, it is increasingly recognized that immunocompromised patients are prone to opportunistic fungal infections. The number of patients suffering from fungal infections has increased by over 20% in the past 5 years [1,2]. Among these infections, the most common are aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and candidiasis. Pulmonary fungal infections include aspergillosis, candidiasis, and aspergillosis, in which the infection occurs by inhalation, followed by hematogenous spread to the lungs. Pulmonary aspergillosis is the most common fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. The frequency of aspergillosis and candidiasis varies from 1 to 20% in immunocompromised patients [3-7]. There are few data on the prevalence of mucormycosis and to our knowledge, the first published data on the epidemiology of mucormycosis on hospital-based collections were obtained from China in 2010.

This is the first report of a hospital-based collection of fungal infections in an immunocompromised patient.


## Methods
The study was conducted using a mixed population of healthy, and a disease-free, healthy, and a disease-free, healthy hospita. Each hospital was classified as either a hospital “untouched” or a hospital “patient-patient” by the hospital classification method. The hospital classification system is based on the data of published information on infectious diseases, including inpatient hospitalization, hospitalizations, and deaths. The hospitals were divided into two groups, “Unattached” and “patient-patient”. In this study, the hospital classification was as a “unattached” hospital (unattached patients) and a “patient-patient” (patient-patient).

Because the hospital classification method is not suitable for all types of fungal diseases, a second type of data analysis was conducted to determine the impact of fungal disease on the hospital classification system. The data for each type of fungal disease were divided into three equal parts, “Unattached”, “patient-patient”, and “patient-patient”. For this study, the unattached part was used to assign patients to the hospital classification system. The unattached part was used to assign patients to the patient-patient classification system. For this study, the hospital classification system was used as a “unattached” and a “patient-patient”.

All of the data was analyzed using the statistical software R v. 2.3.1 (R Core Team, 2015). The data analysis was performed using the Statistica 7.2 software (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). In this study, the statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 7.2 software. The data analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) v. 7.0.0 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). All the experiments were performed in three independent experiments.

Data Analyses
Fungal data were analyzed using the STATA 14 software (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The data analysis was performed using the STATA 14 software (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).


## Results
The results of this study are summarized in Table . The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 4.3% in the year 2011. In the second survey, F. pedrosoi prevalence was found to be 1.4% in the year 2011. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 1.6% in the year 2013.

In the first survey, a total of 3936,049 and 1276,064, respectively, were identified as having a disease occurrence on public storage culture, respectively (Table 1). The results of this study are summarized in Table 1. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 2.7% in the year 2013.

In the second survey, a total of 2850,465 and 1349,917, respectively, were identified as having a disease occurrence on public storage culture, respectively (Table 1). The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 4.1% in the year 2013.

In the third survey, a total of 513,939 and 1384, respectively, were identified as having a disease occurrence on public storage culture, respectively (Table 1). The results of this study are summarized in Table 1. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 1.6% in the year 2013.

The results of this study are summarized in Table 2. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 4.5% in the year 2013.

In the fourth survey, a total of 447,922 and 1280,049, respectively, were identified as having a disease occurrence on public storage culture, respectively (Table 1). The results of this study are summarized in Table 2. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 3.9% in the year 2013.

The results of this study are summarized in Table 3. The prevalence of F. pedrosoi is estimated to be 2.8% in the year 2013.


## Discussion
., 2006-2015). This is significantly higher than the number of fungal pathogens detected in the same period in China (total of 847 and 646, respectively), which is in accordance with the previous study (715 and 634, respectively) that also reported the presence of fungal pathogens in HBS of Guangxi (Feng et al. 2014). The total number of fungi in HBS was comparable to that of the previous study (818) and is comparable to that of the previous study (631) in which the total number of fungi was comparable to that of the previous study. Interestingly, we found that the number of fungi in the HBS of Guangxi was only slightly higher than that of the previous study (715) and this may be due to the fact that the number of fungi in the HBS was relatively small and the previous study used a pool of 120 fungi, which could have led to the underestimation of fungi in the HBS. Another explanation is that fungal pathogens are more sensitive to the environment, due to the fact that they are more virulent, which may be related to the fact that they are more adapted to environmental conditions, such as temperature fluctuations (Hartmann et al. 2012). In this study, the total number of fungi in the HBS of Guangxi was comparable to that of the previous study (736), which is comparable to that of the previous study.

The total number of fungi in the HBS of Guangxi was significantly higher than that of the study by Fang et al. (2013), which was the highest number of fungi detected in the HBS of Guangxi in the last two decades (i.e., 2006-2015). The higher number of fungi detected in the HBS of Guangxi in the study by Fang et al. (2013) is likely related to the fact that the study used a pool of 120 fungi, which may have led to the underestimation of fungi in the HBS.

The total number of fungi in the HBS of Guangxi was lower than that of the study by Fang et al.
