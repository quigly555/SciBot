## Abstract
Infections of the skin and nails are common to all animals and lack guidance for proper treatment of infections in humans. Infections due to fungi, mainly referred to as “mycetoma,” are difficult to treat because of the pathogens’ persistence in the tissues. However, the skin responsible for infection is usually the first pathogen to infect the mammalian body, where yeasts and molds are found together. In addition, the fungi present in the human skin are able to modulate the host immune response. The key to the fungal biology of the skin is the cell wall. The immune system does not only detect the fungi present in the skin, but also the microbes can either form biofilms or form spores. The latter form of infection is capable of progressing rapidly through the bloodstream, causing infection or even fatal infection. The fungal cells present in the bloodstream are of great importance to the host. In this study, we used spore-forming cells to investigate the interaction between yeast and human spore particles. Biofilms composed of yeast and mycetoma cells were isolated from blood and examined by microscopy and X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Yeast cells were found in spore-infested sputum and spores were observed in the mycelium. Human and yeast biofilms were also observed. The mycetoma cells displayed more resistance to antifungal drugs than did the yeast cells. Resistance to antifungal drugs was not found in the human biofilms. Resistance to antifungal drugs was also found in the spore-infested, sputum-covered fungus, but was lost in the human biofilms when yeast cells were examined.


## Introduction
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a life-threatening infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic fungal infection in patients with hematologic malignancies. In the case of immunocompromised patients, it is a major cause of opportunistic pulmonary infection, especially in the lungs. Invasive fungal pneumonia (IFP) is the most common manifestation. The pathogenesis of this infection is complex and depends on the immune status of the host. In the lung, IFIs are associated with the release of conidia and/or fungal cells, which may lead to the development of granulomas, or macrophage-like cells, in the lungs. In the spleen, IFIs may also lead to the development of lung disease and poor clinical outcomes. In contrast, IFIs in the lung are associated with mortality. In the brain, IFIs may lead to the development of meningoencephalitis. However, the most common manifestation of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, which is associated with a low incidence of immunocompromised patients. The lung is also a site of major fungal dissemination in the setting of immune compromise.


## Methods

Molecular phylogeny
Total genomic DNA was extracted from the isolate by a standard CTAB metho. For all fungi, the ITS1 region was amplified using the primer pairs ITS1F/ITS4. The amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the primers LR0R and LR3. PCR reactions were performed with a PCR thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a final reaction volume of 50 µl using the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The products were separated on a 2% agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) using a Bio-Rad CFX384 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and sequenced on an ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

The ITS1 region was amplified using the primer pair ITS1F/ITS4 and the PCR products were purified by a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced on an ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

## Results
Consequently, we tested several wheat-related pathogenicity techniques for the wheat pumilus and pumilus-like fungus, respectively (Fig 2A and B.

The disease incidence of the pumilus and pumilus-like fungus was significantly higher than that of the wheat pumilus-like fungus. Although the wheat pumilus-like fungus was able to cause disease in the field in the field before the outbreak, the disease incidence of the pumilus-like fungus was significantly higher than that of the wheat pumilus-like fungus. The pumilus-like fungus did not show disease symptoms on wheat seedlings, but the wheat pumilus-like fungus caused severe disease symptoms on wheat seedlings when inoculated on corn seedlings (Fig 2C and D).

We further assessed the pathogenicity of the pumilus and pumilus-like fungus on wheat seeds and demonstrated that they were unable to cause disease on the wheat pumilus-like fungus in the field. The wheat pumilus-like fungus caused severe disease symptoms on wheat seedlings inoculated with the pumilus-like fungus, while the pumilus-like fungus did not cause disease symptoms on wheat seedlings inoculated with the pumilus-like fungus.

The pumilus-like fungus has the ability to produce secondary metabolites in the form of aflatoxin and some xenobiotics. The pumilus-like fungus produces aflatoxin, xylanobacteriophage, and xenobiotics, and the wheat pumilus-like fungus has the ability to produce secondary metabolites in the form of xenobiotics. The wheat pumilus-like fungus was able to produce aflatoxin and xenobiotics in the form of xenobiotics, and the wheat pumilus-like fungus was able to produce secondary metabolites in the form of aflatoxin, xylanobacteriophage, and xenobiotics.

The plant pathogenicity of the pumilus and pumilus-like fungus was not completely resolved. However, the pumilus-like fungus caused extensive disease symptoms on wheat seedlings (Fig 2E and F).


## Discussion
These findings suggest that the formation of a ‘zinc-finger’ structure in the ‘zinc-finger’ structure may be a marker of the development of wheat stripe rus. A similar feature has been reported for the rust fungus Rhizophagus solanacearum, which encodes a cluster of eight predicted zinc-finger genes, with an average of 7.2 kb/cM, and an average of 5.7 kb/cM [42].

We also identified a gene that encodes for the transcription factor Hsp70, which is also known as “cell wall integrity protein” (CFMP) and has been shown to play a role in host defense during infection of the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans [43]. These findings suggest that Hsp70 might play a conserved role in the development of wheat stripe rust.

The formation of ‘zinc-finger’ structures in the ‘zinc-finger’ structure can be visualized as a black band that appears at both ends of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure, and the ‘zinc-finger’ structure appears as a bright blue band that appears at both ends of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure. The ‘zinc-finger’ structure is composed of two strands, one of which is in the middle of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure. A band with a red cross-hypointensity in the middle of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure was found. In contrast, the ‘zinc-finger’ structure is composed of three strands, one of which is in the middle of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure. The ‘zinc-finger’ structure is composed of four strands, one of which is in the middle of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure. The ‘zinc-finger’ structure is composed of two strands, one of which is in the middle of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure. These three ‘zinc-finger’ structures are reminiscent of the formation of the ‘zinc-finger’ structure of the rust fungus Cryptococcus neoformans [43].
