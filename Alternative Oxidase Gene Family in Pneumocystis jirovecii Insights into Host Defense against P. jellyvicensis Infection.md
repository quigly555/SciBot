## Abstract
Post-transcriptional regulation is a central facet of genome function. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this regulation is mediated by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) family of histones. However, the role of histone HATBP in post-transcriptional regulation has not been resolved. Here we demonstrate that HATBP represses the expression of Hap4 and Hap9 by decreasing the expression of the latter. Surprisingly, the Hap4 ortholog in S. cerevisiae, hitherto identified as Cdc33, is associated with regulation of the Hap9 complex. Disruption of Cdc33 rendered the two Hap HATBP genes uniparentally inherited.


## Introduction
Macropinocytosis is a type of hematopoietic cell-mediated endocytosis that occurs through endothelial cells (1). Macropinocytosis has been studied for decades in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2-5). Macropinocytosis has been studied in a number of models, including murine macrophage (Mep1-like) cell line (6-8) and human macrophage (Mep2-like) cell line (9). Macrophage cell lines are widely used as model systems to study macrophage cell biology (10, 11). The versatility of macrophage cell models and the ability of individual cells to be manipulated make them ideal for studying cellular processes and cell biology.

Mep1-like molecules have been shown to regulate macrophage cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue invasion (12, 13). The activation of macrophage cell proliferation is essential for macrophage survival and progression in chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis, chronic granulomatous disease, and obesity (14, 15). The presence of macrophage cell markers in the body results in the expression of these molecules in the cells of the macrophage population, resulting in a “cellulo-mepidemic” phenotype (16). Macrophage cell line are used as a model system to study macrophage cell biology. For example, Mep1 has been shown to regulate proliferation and differentiation in macrophage cells (17). The cells of the phagocytic cell line (PCL) that express macrophage cell markers, such as Mep1, can differentiate into macrophages (18). Macrophages can also differentiate into macrophages after macrophage differentiation, although it is not known how macrophage differentiation is regulated by the macrophage cell line. Macrophage cell lines that express Mep1 are not involved in macrophage differentiation and the cell differentiation process (19). Macrophage cells expressing Mep1 are unable to differentiate into macrophages, but they can differentiate into macrophages after macrophage differentiation (20, 21). In addition, the macrophage cell line is used as a model to study macrophage cell biology.


## Methods
jirovecii in the isolate from the New Zealand . jirovecii isolate FJ01 that is the main source of bloodstream pathogens in the US (N = 18). This isolate was provided by Dr. John Weisberg at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. P. jirovecii isolates were maintained on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar at 4°C. The yeast cultures were grown on YPD agar at 25°C for seven days before use in the assay.

P. jirovecii isolates were used for virulence assays in the assays where P. jirovecii was detected in clinical specimens. P. jirovecii isolates were maintained on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar at 4°C. The yeast cultures were grown in YPD broth at 25°C for seven days before use in the assay.

In order to compare the virulence of P. jirovecii in P. jirovecii isolates, the different P. jirovecii isolates were tested for their ability to induce fungal growth on mycelium of P. jirovecii. P. jirovecii isolates were maintained in YPD broth at 25°C and subjected to inoculation with sterile plugs of mycelium (10 µl of each P. jirovecii isolate) onto either YPD agar (YPD or YPD + 1% penicillin/streptomycin) or rice-agar (YPD + 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The fungal growth was induced by the addition of sterile distilled water (dH_2O), followed by incubation at 25°C for 24 hours, and the mycelium was harvested. The fungal biomass was then removed by filtration through a 0.22 µm filter paper (Whatman). The mycelium was ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, and then subjected to liquid nitrogen extraction with liquid nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source. The mycelium was then transferred to 50 ml of liquid nitrogen and subjected to vacuum filtration through a 0.22 µm filter paper (Whatman).


## Results
jirovecii infection, we utilized the novel Pneumocystis jirovecii . jirovecii HACSS containing the HACSS gene family (see Table 1). We first compared the effects of the HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS and the other nine HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS against HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS. These HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS and the P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P. jirovecii HACSS containing P.


## Discussion
The infection does not involve the lungs, which does not produce infectious plasmacytoi. Pneumocystis jirovecii do not produce infectious plasmacytoin, which is a sign of an immunocompromised state [12,13]. In contrast, the organism is able to infect the spleen, and in this case plasmacytoin production was detected in infected tissue.

The Pneumocystis jirovecii has evolved a variety of virulence mechanisms to escape host immune defences. Some of these mechanisms are mediated by the secretion of cytokines and other proteins. The fact that Pneumocystis jirovecii invades the bloodstream and infects a healthy human host and does not require the aid of an immunocompetent host further suggests that this organism is capable of multiple mechanisms of evasion of host immune defences.

A third method of evasion is the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of chemokines. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-4 are secreted by Pneumocystis jirovecii, and the chemokines IL-10 and IL-23 are secreted by Pneumocystis jirovecii during its infection [17]. It is likely that Pneumocystis jirovecii secretes these chemokines and cytokines to evade host immune defences. However, it is possible that Pneumocystis jirovecii uses alternative mechanisms of evasion, such as the secretion of a variety of chemokines and cytokines, to evade host immune defences.

Pneumocystis jirovecii produces multiple types of infectious plasmacytoins, which include a number of proteases, lipases and non-lipase species [18,19]. The secretion of these proteins, which are secreted by Pneumocystis jirovecii, is a common phenomenon in several organisms, such as the fungus C. neoformans [20,21]. A number of studies have shown that Pneumocystis jirovecii secretes several types of plasmacytoin [20,21].
