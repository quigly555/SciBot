## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii, the causative agent of cryptococcosis, is usually found in the environment, particularly in the lungs of immunosuppressed individuals. It is unclear why this fungus infects immunocompetent individuals. The molecular mechanisms of infection appear to be primarily related to host-pathogen interfaces. In this study, we identified two genes encoding putative transcriptase enzymes, encoding for the pfam and the pfam-like kinase, in the C. gattii genome. We found that they are required for growth, which is predicted to be regulated by a homeodomain transcription factor. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase II double-strand-break (dsRNA) plays a major role in host-pathogen interactions. The ability of the pfam-like kinase to modulate infection is dependent on the pfam gene. In addition, we found that the pfam-like kinase was not necessary for the virulence of C. gattii. Taken together, these results suggest that the pfam-like kinase is dispensable for infection of C. gattii.

Cryptococcus gattii, the causative agent of cryptococcosis, is found in the environment, particularly in the lungs of immunosuppressed individuals. The pathogenic yeast infects immunocompetent individuals mainly in the lungs of immunosuppressed hosts and can invade the central nervous system (CNS) in humans and animals at an exponential frequency.


## Introduction
 2012) is a novel and abundant enzyme that is present in all three domains of life (Smith et a., 2012).

The hyphal cell wall is a critical structure that acts as a physical barrier against a wide variety of microorganisms and protects them from environmental stresses. A special compartment of the cell wall known as the hyphal cell wall is also known to be involved in phagocytosis (Hidgen et al., 2006; Epstein and Smith, 2012). The hyphal cell wall consists of four highly interconnected networked compartments. The first three are connected to each other, with the hydrophilic, phagolytosed and/or acid-fast compartments being the most rigid (Boekhout and Marcotte, 2010). The acid-fast compartments are made of laminar and/or amorphous components (Marcotte and Kolter, 1998). The acid-fast compartments are made of laminar and/or amorphous components (Boekhout and Marcotte, 2010). These compartments are composed of an outer layer of chitin, a central layer of mannan, and a thin layer of proteins (Hidgen et al., 2006). The proteins present in the phagolytosed compartment are transported to the phagosome where they are converted into proteins that are processed by the lytic phagolysosome (Hidgen et al., 2006; Scorzoni et al., 2006). The presence of proteins from both the phagolytosed and the amorphous compartments is considered to be highly significant in the development of resistance to infection by Candida albicans and the development of resistance to other Candida species. This hypothesis was also demonstrated by several studies on the mechanism of antifungal drug resistance (Gandhi et al., 1999; Pandey et al., 2000; Pandey, 2002; Peralta et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2002; Tripathi et al., 2006; Vijaykumar and Sanyal, 2007).

It is widely accepted that the laminar and/or amorphous compartments are more resistant to phagocytosis than the outer and/or inner compartments (Hidgen et al., 2006).


## Methods
The Soil Carbonic Anhydrase CAS1 inhibitor was selected to induce the cell wall stress response and the osmotic stress response in macrophage. It was prepared by the addition of 1 M sorbitol and the solvent bath. The reaction was initiated by incubating the compound at 37°C for 15 min. The cell-free supernatant was used for the quantification of CAS1 concentration and absorbance at 595 nm. The cell-free supernatant was used for the determination of O_2^-^32P. The concentrations of O_2^-^32P and O_2^-^32P were quantified using the 3-µm-plate-diffractometer method using the Ascentis Modification (AB) 3.1 software (AB Labtech).

## Results

Macrophage damage caused by fungi is associated with a wide range of cellular processe. Accordingly, the proliferation of yeast cells, the production of oxidative stress and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to an inflammatory response, which can be a source of virulence factors [35]. Candida albicans may produce rutin, a potent antifungal drug for candidiasis [36], and the degradation of rutin by the fungal membrane may be a source of virulence factors in C. albicans [37,38]. Therefore, to examine the effect of CAS1 on C. albicans killing, we first examined the effect of CAS1 on the killing of the C. albicans strains. When all the strains were eliminated, CAS1 treatment significantly reduced the killing of C. albicans (Fig 4C). The CAS1-treated strains also showed a significant reduction in killing in macrophage phagocytosis (Fig 4D). In order to further assess whether CAS1 was able to reduce the killing of C. albicans, we performed experiments with a similar stress condition. C. albicans was first cultured in the presence of 100 µg/ml CFW for 24 h, and then transferred to the presence of 100 µg/ml CFW for 24 h. The CFW concentration of the drug was then increased to 1.25 µg/ml CFW for 24 h. We then transferred C. albicans strains to the presence of 100 µg/ml CFW for 24 h. The CFW concentration of the drug was then increased to 1.25 µg/ml CFW for 24 h. The results indicate that CAS1 treatment significantly reduces the killing of C. albicans by C. albicans, but it also inhibits the phagocytosis of C. albicans.

Candida albicans inactivation results in the production of reactive oxygen species, which can be a source of virulence factors [35]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CAS1 on the production of these antifungal compounds. The number of fungal cells that were killed by CAS1 treatment was significantly reduced in the presence of 100 µg/ml CFW for 24 h (Fig 5). The killing of C. albicans was also significantly reduced in the presence of 100 µg/ml CFW for 24 h (Fig 5A).


## Discussion
The amount of CAS1 in the CFU of the phagocytic cells decreased by about 50% and 50% respectively in the presence of the . albicans MTP-1 inhibitor CASA, and the amount of CAS1 in the CFU of the fungus was significantly decreased by about 15% when compared to the phagocytic cell surface-to-volume ratio (Figure 5). In addition, CAS1 decreased by about 10% when compared to the fungal surface-to-volume ratio (Figure 5). The effect of CAS1 on fungal membrane fluidity and lipid content was also examined. We observed that the CFU of C. albicans was able to tolerate CASA only at a pH of 6.5 and to tolerate CASA only at a pH of 7.0. The CFU of the fungus was also able to tolerate CASA only at a pH of 7.5 and to tolerate CASA only at a pH of 7.0. In contrast, the CFU of C. albicans was not able to tolerate CASA at pH 5.0, which was completely inhibited by CASA (Figure 6). The results of the antifungal activity of CAS1 are summarized in Table 2 and Figure S1.

The antifungal activity of CAS1 was examined on Candida strains with different initial colony sizes and colonies that formed a large cross. The results showed that CAS1 exhibited a broad antifungal activity against Candida strains with different initial colonies sizes, which was consistent with the results of the previous study [27]. The results showed that CAS1 had a fungistatic effect against C. albicans and C. tropicalis and had a fungistatic effect against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, whereas the activity was also lower against the C. krusei and C. krusei strains, which was consistent with the results of previous studies [27]. The antifungal activity of CAS1 was further evaluated on C. krusei.
