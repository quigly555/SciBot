## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common fungal infection in humans. However, the epidemiology, pathogenicity and factors that regulate IA are still unclear. We used a genome-wide microarray approach to identify genes and cellular constituents involved in the regulation of IA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Our data showed that the different PBMC subpopulations had different IA pathogenicity profiles. Different populations of PBMCs were enriched for genes and pathways related to the different PBMC subpopulations. Different populations harbored different subsets of different PBMCs for different pathogenicity pathways. Our analysis identified several PBMCs that were either highly virulent or very virulent in specific populations. We also identified several PBMCs that were either less virulent or had lower pathogenicity levels in a similar subpopulation. The data suggest that the regulation of IA pathogenicity genes may be different PBMCs.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans. Invading bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis cause bloodstream infections in susceptible patients. Invasive candidiasis is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause life-threatening invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised individuals. Candida albicans is also the most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection in patients with nephrotic syndrome, with a mortality rate of 40-60% (Naranja et al., 2015). The rate of candidemia has increased during the past decades due to the growing population of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other chronic conditions (Romeiro et al., 2013; Palazzini et al., 2014). However, the cause of the most common clinical manifestation of candidiasis remains unknown (Park et al., 2016).

Several factors are involved in the pathogenesis of candidiasis.


## Methods
fumigatus strain G217B (n = 3), and . niger strain NRRL-8218 (n = 1) were used to evaluate the transactivation of MMPs. For inactivation experiments, MMPs were amplified from genomic DNA of A. fumigatus strain H99 using the primer set G217F: 5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGT-3' and 5'-CCTGGTCCGCTAGCAG-3' and 1/3 (for A. fumigatus strain A/G217B) and 1/3 (for A. niger strain NRRL-8218). The resulting PCR product was then used to transform A. fumigatus strain NRRL-8218 to obtain mutants, which were purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). MMPs were then purified from the resulting plasmid using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Primers were designed to target the ÃŸ-glucuronidase gene (glaA1) and a single-stranded His-tag (glaA2) using the primer set G217F: 5'-CAAGCAGGGTCATCAGAACTTCC-3' and 5'-GGCGTAGTCTCCAGCTCCA-3' and 5'-GCCAGCTCCACCTCCGGTCTCC-3' and used to amplify A. fumigatus strain A/G217B and A. niger strain NRRL-8218, respectively. The resulting PCR product was then transformed into A. fumigatus strain H99 to obtain mutants. All transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method [34]. All mutant strains were confirmed by diagnostic PCR, and all experiments were conducted in triplicate.

DNA Manipulation of Mutant Mutant
The inactivation mutant strains were identified by PCR amplification of the 5' UTR, the 5' UTR and the 3' UTR of the gene encoding glucoamylase using the primer set G217F: 5'-CGGTTCTCCAGAGCGACCA-3' and 5'-GTCAGTCTCCGCCCCAGCTCC-3' (for A.


## Results
cinerea, we tested the inhibitory effect of various nitrogen sources on growth of the fungu. As shown in Fig 6A, the inhibition of growth of B. cinerea was significantly reduced in the presence of a nitrogen source that were equivalent to nitrogen concentration. A similar effect was also observed for the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant, as shown in Fig 6B. However, we also observed that the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant did not show any growth inhibition on a minimal medium (YPD) with either a glucose (glucose) or a KG (glycerol) concentration of 1 mM. The growth inhibition on a KG concentration of 1 mM was also observed for the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant, as shown in Fig 6C. These results suggest that the disruption of bcl2 alters the growth of B. cinerea to the extent that a reduction in the growth rate of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant is beneficial.

bcl2 is required for the viability of B. cinerea
In our previous study, the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant was able to form colonies in the presence of various concentrations of ammonium sulphate (AMS) for the first 6 h and formed solid colonies at a final concentration of 5 mM. However, the viability of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant was significantly reduced, indicating that a defect in the growth of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant was caused by the lack of bcl2. To evaluate the effect of ammonium sulphate on the viability of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant, we tested the effect of AMS on the viability of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant. As shown in Fig 7A, the viability of the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant was significantly reduced, indicating that the absence of bcl2 is not essential for the viability of B. cinerea. The lack of bcl2 in the <U+0394>bcl2 mutant is therefore linked to the inability of the fungus to form viable colonies, which were fully rescued by addition of ammonium sulphate.

bcl2 is essential for the viability of B.


## Discussion
prolificans biofil. To this end, the respective LAMP was administered to L. prolificans biofilms. This treatment effectively inhibited the in vitro growth of L. prolificans biofilm in comparison to that of wild-type strain. The results shown in Figure 2 clearly demonstrate that the in vitro growth of L. prolificans biofilm was inhibited by the LAMP, as shown in Figure 2A.

When the biofilm was in a vegetative state, the growth rate of the LAMP was inhibited by 4% (Figure 2B). This indicates that LAMP plays an important role in the in vitro growth of L. prolificans.

The overall effect of the LAMP on the in vitro growth of L. prolificans biofilm was monitored using several techniques. The results are shown in Figure 2C. The biofilm exhibited a gradual decrease in the initial G + C content and a gradual increase in the L content of the biomass. However, the biofilm grew faster than that of wild-type strain, suggesting that LAMP plays an important role in the in vitro growth of L. prolificans.

The growth of the LAMP was inhibited by 5.7% (Figure 2D). The first and the second stages of the growth of the LAMP were inhibited by 5.5% (Figure 2E), indicating that LAMP is an important factor for the in vitro growth of L. prolificans. The other two stages of the LAMP were not inhibited by this LAMP. Therefore, this result indicated that the LAMP plays an important role in the in vitro growth of L. prolificans.

The growth of the LAMP was inhibited by 4.3% (Figure 2D). The first and the second stages of the growth of the LAMP were inhibited by 4.7% (Figure 2E), indicating that LAMP plays an important role in the in vitro growth of L. prolificans. The other two stages were not inhibited by this LAMP. Therefore, this result indicated that the LAMP plays an important role in the in vitro growth of L. prolificans.

The LAMP has an inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of L. prolificans biofilm. The decrease in the G + C content of the biofilm was also inhibited by the LAMP, as shown in Figure 2E.
