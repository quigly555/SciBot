## Abstract
In the present study, we investigated whether fluconazole (FLC) or voriconazole (RTZ-N -) can act as chemopreventive agents in chronic meningitis by screening the fungal mutants of two major-line fungi, Alternaria alternata and Penicillium expansum. The mutants of both fungi were more resistant to FLC and RTZ-N than the wild-type strain, and these mutants displayed more resistance to FLC. The data suggest that FLC-RTZ-N mutants may be an important strategy to treat CM caused by these two different fungal strains. Moreover, the activities of FLC and RTZ-N mutants against other chemosensitizing molecules, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (COXs), likely explain the differences in the mutants of these two different fungal strains.


## Introduction
The genus Phylloporus was established in 1865 by Hennings and Huhndorf, and presently only seven species have been described in the genus. Species of Phylloporus are saprobic, acervuli, hypocreales, and sometimes as true hypocrealean species. H. erinaceus (L.) Donk, G. H. Doniger, and J.H. Dehors described from the Atlantic Ocean in 1894, 1905, and 1910, respectively. Phylloporus also known as Saccardo and Hennings (L.) Donk (Phylloporus) E.C.M. Seifert, was introduced by Dehors and Huhndorf in 1895, and was introduced by them and H. erinaceus (now Saccardo) Donk in 1896.

The morphological concept of the genus Phylloporus has been widely debated and several authors have used various names for the same species. The most common authors include Dehors (1918), Hennings (1937), Crous (1937), Crous & Groenewald (1964) and Huhndorf (1964). Dehors (1918) first described the genus Phylloporus based on a specimen from Atlantic Canada and later, Hennings (1937), he placed it in the genus Phylloporus based on the acervular growth on agar slants.

He provided a detailed description of the type specimen of Phylloporus, but did not describe any additional collections of the fungus. Later, Hennings (1941) placed Phylloporus in Saccardo and Hennings (1937), and later, Dehors & Huhndorf (1964) and Dehors et al. (1964) introduced Saccardo as the type species of Phylloporus.


## Methods
Organisms and Growth Conditions
The C. albicans ATCC 90028 strain was isolated from a diseased chicken head in Sichuan province, China, and was cultured in YPD medium (1% peptone, 2% yeast extract, 2% glucose) at 37°C. The cultures were treated with different drugs at different concentrations (0.1% to 0.5% final concentration) at 37°C for 24 h and then the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium at 37°C. The cells were counted and adjusted to 10^6 cells/mL.

Tryptophan Production Assays
The C. albicans ATCC 90028 strain was cultured in YPD medium at 37°C and 200 rpm for 24 h and then the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium at 37°C. The cells were counted and adjusted to 10^6 cells/mL.

Construction of C. albicans Cell-lines
The gene encoding a putative Ca^2+ selectable marker in C. albicans was amplified by PCR with the primer pair Ca^2+_F and Ca^2+.


## Results
In the case of the microdilution assay, the highest activity was observed in the fed cattle (Figure 4. The microdilution assay is a sensitive technique to measure the activity of fungicides in the fed cattle. It is commonly used to measure the activity of a fungicide in cattle feed and feed supplements. The FIC values for the evaluated agents are shown in Table 4. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle with the lowest activity of the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle with the highest activity of the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle with the lowest activity of the microdilution assay.

The bioactivity of all the evaluated agents in the presence of the microdilution assay was evaluated in real-time assays using the microdilution assay. In the present study, all tested agents showed the highest activity in the presence of the microdilution assay. The bioactivity of all the evaluated agents was evaluated using the FIC values for the evaluated agents in the fed cattle, fed cattle and fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay. The FIC values for the evaluated agents are presented in Table 5.

In this study, the highest activity of all evaluated agents was observed in the fed cattle. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was observed in the fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay.

In the present study, the highest activity of the microdilution assay was also observed in the fed cattle with the highest activity of the microdilution assay. The highest activity of the microdilution assay was also observed in the fed cattle supplemented with the microdilution assay.


## Discussion
glabrata and . parapsilosis, and two C. tropicalis and C. krusei isolates (two isolates and two C. famata). These isolates represented previously described C. famata, and C. krusei, respectively. However, these isolates were not identified by CF methods. To facilitate the evaluation of the CF method, two C. famata isolates were used for the analysis of the CF system. One isolate (CGB6138) was identified as C. famata and the other as C. krusei. The other isolate (CGB6129) was identified as C. krusei, and the other isolate (CGB6131) was identified as C. famata. However, the results of CF methods were not reproducible. The C. krusei isolate was identified as C. famata by two CF systems. This was confirmed by the comparison of the CF system with the real-time CF system (Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, the C. krusei isolate was named as C. krusei.

The investigation of the CF system revealed four new and distinct isolates belonging to C. parapsilosis, C. famata, C. tropicalis, and C. famata. The isolates were identified as C. famata by CF methods. These isolates were found to be distinct from the strains previously described by [14,15,22]. To elucidate the mechanism of the disease in this area, we used multiple CF systems, including CFX media, to examine the CF system during the infection period. Results showed that the CF system was highly active during the infection period. The CF system was able to clear the infection of C. famata, and the strains were identified by CF analysis of the CF system (Figure 4). The CF system was also able to clear the infection of C. famata and C. parapsilosis. However, the CFX media did not clear the infection of C. famata. The CFX media was not able to clear the infection of C. famata because of the CFX medium produced during the infection period (Figure 4).
