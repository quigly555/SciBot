## Abstract
Understanding the biogeochemical process for the synthesis of the novel biopolymeric substrate used by the human pathogen Phlebesium eubayanus for the synthesis of the third-generation protein polyketide synthases (PKSs) is of interest because of the enormous biotechnological potential of these enzymes and the enormous costs that they present to the human body. Although the exact nature and scope of polyketide synthase research is not yet fully understood, an increasing number of studies are now being conducted, mostly in the non-host organisms such as humans, that use PKSs as a bioprocess to produce protein lipids. While the genetic manipulation of PKSs has been greatly successful in decreasing parasites burden, other fungal strains have modified PKSs to produce other modified polyketides. This review will discuss the biostatistics and use of PKSs by parasites such as the fungus Candida albicans, and the use of non-natural sources such as algae, soil, and lichens by non-natural organisms (NMO). The source of these lipids will be discussed and the costs and benefits that this modification has on the production of parasite lipids.


## Introduction
Ocimum gratissensiensis is a liqueur that is used as an alternative to liquor in ghee-based teas and liquor in vinegar, sake, and sake liquor. The term gratissensens [1] is derived from the French word “mont en couroir” (“mont pourrait de couroir”). The French word “mont” means “bitter passion.” The word “mont” means passion.

Visceral leavening is a form of fermentation of food products (e.g., bread, fruits, vegetables, and beer) by microbes that produce esterases, esterase-forming enzymes, and esterases-like proteins, which can degrade food products and cause spoilage, and/or even cancer (2). In recent years, several studies have reported the presence of various microorganisms in food products (3, 4). Among them, bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most prevalent group. These bacteria are present in most foods, while others such as Salmonella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Proteus spp., and other organisms have been isolated only from certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract of humans (5). The presence of these bacteria in food products is not only due to their ability to degrade food products, but also due to their ability to produce antimicrobial molecules and enzymes. The bacterial products are used by the food industry because of their high viscosity, which allows for easy handling, and safety, which in turn reduces the consumption of ingredients. Many studies have also demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of food products (6, 7).

In recent years, the number of publications on antimicrobial activities of food products has increased considerably. Several authors have reviewed the literature, including some reviews by others, and have reviewed the antimicrobial activities of food products, and have published extensively about food products in recent years (8-10).

## Results
We searched for Nodular proteins in the . bombycis genome database using the BLASTP analysis tool. We identified a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 31 kDa (IPR002075) and predicted molecular weight of 62 kDa (IPR002076). It has been shown that the S. cerevisiae NOD2 protein has a conserved N-terminal signal sequence that is highly conserved in the N. bombycis genome (Guan et al., 2006). However, we did not find any NOD2 protein homologs in other fungi or in any other fungal species, including plants (Table 4). Therefore, we asked whether the Nodular protein is required for Nodular processing. The Nodular protein was identified as being an N-terminal protein with a predicted molecular weight of 30 kDa (IPR002076). The protein was identified in a recent study that was performed using a Biotyper software package (Sitzknecht et al., 2007). In this study, the Nodular protein was identified as being a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 33 kDa (IPR002077).

We next wanted to investigate whether Nodular protein processing is required for fungal Nodular proteins. We attempted to identify Nodular proteins in the N. bombycis genome database using the BLASTP analysis tool. We found that Nodular proteins were present in all species except N. bombycis, but not in the plant N. mays. Therefore, we examined Nodular proteins in N. bombycis for potential Nodular-like processing. We identified Nodular proteins in all species except N. bombycis. For each species, we used the Biotyper software package (Sitzknecht et al., 2007). We then analyzed Nodular proteins in each species using the different proteins as queries. We identified Nodular proteins in all species except N. bombycis, but not in the other fungi. The Nodular proteins were identified in all species except N. bombycis. Therefore, we conclude that Nodular protein processing is not required for Nodular proteins in N. bombycis.


## Discussion
Drosophilous and facultative hyphae are morphologically similar, and have similar responses to redox-inducing stimuli (Kojic et a. 2010). The two main pathways of redox homeostasis are the oxidative stress response and host response (Kojic et al. 2010). Both pathways are based on the catalase-dependent pathway and catalase-dependent pathway (Cda1 and Cda2) (Kojic et al. 2010). This suggests that the three pathways are expressed in different organisms. This is in agreement with previous studies that reported the upregulation of these pathways in response to redox-inducing stimuli (Kojic et al. 2010). In addition, this suggests that Drosophila homologs of the Drosophila melanogaster Cda1/Cda2 and Drosophila dsRNAs have the same pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that redox-induced oxidative stress is the dominant factor in the regulation of gene expression in redox-promoted infection.

The genes responsible for this response are the Kojic and Drosophila homologs of the proteins involved in oxidative stress response (Rho1, Cda1) and host response (Lep3p). Kojic et al. (2010) also identified a putative Rho family protein family in the Drosophila genome. The Rho1 protein kinase was found to be upregulated in response to the redox-induced oxidative stress.

The genes involved in redox-induced oxidative stress response are the Kojic homologs of the homologs of the redox-promoted oxidative stress response (Rho1p) and host response (Lep3p). The genes involved in redox-induced oxidative stress response are the Kojic homologs of the homologs of the redox-promoted host response (Lep3p) and redox-induced host response (Lep3p) (Fig 2).
