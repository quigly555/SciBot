## Abstract
The echinocandin family of drugs, once considered a cancerous tumour drug, is now considered as a cancerous tumour drug.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a human fungal pathogen that causes disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals, predominantly in AIDS patients. This pathogen has been identified as the causative agent of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CME), one of the most common central nervous system (CNS) infectious diseases, in many parts of the world including Australia, and the United States, in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and in Australia in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada (1).

C. neoformans is classified as a non-viral, encapsulated yeast with a polysaccharide capsule, and the capsule has a variety of functions including as a rigid, extracellular matrix, which protects the yeast from environmental stress, such as host immune response and the immune system, and from the host immune reaction (2). The capsule protects the organism from host phagocytosis, preventing it from forming biofilms (3). A variety of antigens and mechanisms including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and host innate immunity have been suggested to be responsible for the pathogenesis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (4-6). The capsule is also an important contributor to host defense against fungal pathogens such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Sporothrix schenkii (7).

The capsule is a highly dynamic, microenvironmental structure, which can change rapidly and significantly with environmental temperature, hypoxia, solar radiation, and microbial growth (8-12). Changes in the moisture and oxygen levels in the capsule are sensed as signal molecules that trigger cellular responses, including oxidative and nitrosative stress (12).


## Methods
[27. Host-pathogen interactions were determined in five different fungal pathogens, namely, Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida glabrata (ATCC 2001), Candida krusei var. glabrata (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), and Candida tropicalis (ATCC 13803). To estimate the degree of host response to infection, fungal growth on macaque antigens, yeast, and latex was compared with the extent of interaction between antigens and macaque serum. Host responses to infection were quantified by comparison of mean values of the four treatments. The relative importance of host response to infection was determined by the ratio of the number of pathogen-specific responses to the number of pathogen-associated pathogen-specific responses. To identify the role of host immune responses in the development of avirulence traits in macaques, a linear regression model was used.

Animal experiments
Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of the Institute for Clinical Laboratory Animal Resources (ICLAR), in accordance with the principles outlined by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the United States National Research Council (N. A. R. Haines et al., 2008). Laboratory animals were provided with food and water ad libitum. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The animal protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Utah, and the animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines of the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments were performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council.

Gastrointestinal samples were obtained by washing the gut of the mice, and the feces were collected by gentle washing, and removed. To test the effects of macaque antigens on the microbiota, mice were inoculated with 10 µl of 1 × 10^6 C. albicans yeast, or 10 µl of 10^6 Candida glabrata yeast. The microbiota was assessed by observing the changes in the gut microbial communities in the presence and absence of macaque antigens.


## Results
TEM of infection
To investigate whether the presence of fungal structures in the brain affected the virulence of A. fumigatus, we performed a series of experiments. First, we infected A. fumigatus in mice with a single inoculation, and observed that the brains of infected mice exhibited significant lesions in both the cerebrum and brainstem, while the brainstem of mice infected with A. fumigatus was not affected by the fungal inoculation (Figure 1A). In contrast, the brains of infected mice showed significant lesions in the cerebrum and brainstem, and the brains of mice infected with A. fumigatus had significantly lower fungal burden in the cerebrum and brainstem (Figure 1B). After 30 days of infection, mice showed signs of neurological recovery, and mice were euthanized by euthanasia.

We next used a murine model to study the CNS effects of A. fumigatus infection. Two mouse models were used to infect A. fumigatus: a laboratory-isolated infection model and a synthetic infection model. First, we injected A. fumigatus into the brainstem of mice via the tail vein. The mice were injected with 10^7 CFU of A. fumigatus or 10^8 CFU of the natural A. fumigatus-producing strain or the control strain. The mouse lungs were then collected, and the lungs were processed for CFU counting. At 2 h postinjection, the lungs of infected mice presented a single CFU in the brainstem of both A. fumigatus- and control-infected mice, whereas the brains of infected mice presented multiple CFU in the cerebrum and brainstem (Figure 2).


## Discussion
albicans, . glabrata, and C. krusei [20]. The cause of this disease has not been reported in humans. However, amoebic encephalitis has been reported in other animals, including mice, in which the infection caused by amoebic encephalitis usually involves the cerebellum, whereas the underlying cause is rarely described. In addition, a case report described a female patient who suffered from amoebic encephalitis, but was not observed in the subsequent autopsy, despite the fact that she had been treated with antibiotics and the exact cause of the disease in her mother’s blood [21]. However, the pathogenesis of the disease is not yet known, and the pathogenesis of the infection in the case reported here was not described in humans.

In our patient, the disease was initially diagnosed by a spinal fluid culture and histopathology. However, this patient was not a pathogen of the spinal fluid, because she had not been treated with antibiotics and the exact cause of the disease in her mother’s blood. Therefore, a diagnosis of amoebic encephalitis was made based on the spinal fluid results. In the spinal fluid, the diagnosis was made based on the histopathology of the lesions, which showed a diffuse pattern with diffuse cutaneous appearance. In the cerebellar atrophy, a deep-seated, granulomatous lesion appeared, which was not present in the patient with the spinal fluid infection. The disease was found in the cerebellar volume, but the patient had not received antibiotics and the exact cause of the disease was not known in her mother’s blood. Therefore, the diagnosis was made by a spinal fluid culture. In the cerebellar volume, the diagnosis was made based on the histopathology of the lesion, which showed diffuse and deep-seated lesion, which was not present in the patient with the spinal fluid infection. Therefore, the diagnosis was made by a histopathology of the lesion. In the case reported here, the patient had been treated with antibiotics and the exact cause of the disease was not known in her mother’s blood. Therefore, the diagnosis was made by a histopathology of the lesion.
