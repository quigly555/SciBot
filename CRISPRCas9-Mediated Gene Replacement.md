## Abstract
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is proposed to be a fast, cost-effective, and low-cost alternative for the diagnosis and diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aimed to evaluate the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of LgCalcR, a clinically used non-small cell lung cancer cell wall protein from an experimental NSCLC model. The assay was performed using high dose (1200 mg/day) of LgCalcR in human serum. The ELISA enzyme was confirmed by using the specific inhibitor Bafenimide Olamidine (BAF) on a panel of LgCalcR-positive NSCLCs. The positive LgCalcR sera were further tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISA on the immunofluorescence staining technique. The positive LgCalcR sera were further tested by the ELISA assay on the fluorochromes complement-response assay (CDR) and the transcriptional profiling assay (TIMA). The results of the assay were compared with results obtained with the standard gold standard assay. The assay was performed with a panel of LgCalcR-positive NSCLCs and found that the assay results were comparable to that obtained with gold standard results. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed high sensitivity and specificity, and the assay was able to detect LgCalcR on serum and in the serum of Lymphoma patients as well as those with neutropenia. This is the first time that ELISA has been demonstrated to be a fast, reliable and accurate alternative for the diagnosis and diagnosis of NSCLCs.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a growing problem in medical mycology, with high rates of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Candida species are globally distributed commensal fungi, and can cause systemic infections in both healthy and immunocompromised patients, especially in those with hematological malignancies. Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are two most common species isolated from clinical specimens from patients with hematological malignancies. In the past, candida infections were not included in the differential diagnosis of bloodstream infections. However, in recent years, the incidence of candida infections has increased significantly in various patient populations and is now more frequent in patients with hematological malignancies. The increasing number of patients with hematological malignancies, particularly in solid organ transplant recipients, patients with underlying immunosuppression and patients undergoing chemotherapy have led to an increase in the occurrence of candida infections [1]. Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are two other common species that can cause disseminated candidiasis, with higher rates of mortality compared to non-candida species [2]. The lack of distinction between these two species is expected to be a common characteristic of the clinical situation and the patient population. Candida glabrata and Candida krusei have been reported to cause many different manifestations, such as, but not limited to, superficial infections, mucocutaneous infections and invasive candidiasis [3].

Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that can colonize the skin, mucous membranes, and the gastrointestinal tract.


## Methods
Isolates and media
The isolates used in this study were collected from two different geographical regions of the country: Bangkok (Thailand) and Kaeru (Thailand). Existing strains were isolated from the holotype of these two regions by PCR and genotyping with the primers listed in Table 1. The isolates were stored in -80°C and used without further purification. The relevant culture media used for morphological studies are listed in Table 1. The isolates were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 25°C.

DNA extraction and sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from fungal mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers for the amplification of the flanking sequences of the loci of the bacterial and archaeal phyla were as follows: forward, 5'-CATGCTCTGGCCATCGA-3' and reverse, 5'-ACGCTAGCTTCACGACAC-3'; for the amplification of the ITS, 5'-CATTGACCTCCACCTCCATC-3' and 5'-GACCTCCACCTCCACCTCC-3'. For the PCR reactions, each DNA sample was treated with DNaseI (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and the products were purified with an Illustra^TM Gel DNA clean-up kit (GE Healthcare, Pontecorvo, Italy). The purified PCR product was sequenced in both directions using a BigDye^® Terminator v3.


## Results
elegans
We next investigated the potential role of . elegans in the C. elegans genome. C. elegans is a pathogenic fungal pathogen [26]. We hypothesized that C. elegans would exhibit a C. elegans-C. albicans-C. albicans interaction. We first investigated the interaction of C. elegans and C. albicans in a C. albicans-C. albicans interaction model. C. albicans and C. elegans interacted in a manner similar to that observed for C. albicans and C. albicans in a mouse interaction model (Figure 6A). First, we observed that C. albicans was able to secrete multiple peptides containing the CAP11 (CAP11) motif (Figure 6B), suggesting that C. elegans can secrete peptides containing the CAP11 motif. In addition, we observed that C. elegans was able to secrete multiple peptides containing the CAP11 (CAP11) motif (Figure 6B). Therefore, we hypothesized that C. elegans is able to secrete multiple peptides containing the CAP11 motif. We further investigated the association between C. elegans and C. albicans. First, we performed the interaction experiment using a combination of peptide pairs that were expressed in the absence of the peptide(s) and peptide(s) complementation with an epitope-tagged peptide. We observed that C. elegans was able to secrete peptides containing the CAP11 (CAP11) motif (Figure 6C). Next, we investigated the interaction between C. elegans and C. albicans. First, we performed the interaction experiment using a combination of peptide pairs that were expressed in the absence of the peptide(s) and peptide(s) complementation with an epitope-tagged peptide. We observed that C. elegans was able to secrete peptides containing the CAP11 (CAP11) motif (Figure 6D). Finally, we investigated the interaction between C. elegans and C. albicans. First, we performed the interaction experiment using a combination of peptide pairs that were expressed in the absence of the peptide(s) and peptide(s) complementation with an epitope-tagged peptide. We observed that C.
