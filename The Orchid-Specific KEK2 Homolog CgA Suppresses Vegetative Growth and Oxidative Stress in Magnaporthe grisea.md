## Abstract
In the course of deciphering the evolutionary origin of metazoa, we have to ask: What is it that makes certain microbes tick? The answer, of course, is in complexity. But beyond that, we need to understand the underlying biology of microbes as we know them.

Microbes’ ability to thrive in extreme niches has long been linked to their ability to adapt to adverse environments, and to evolve traits that enhance their own survival and health. For a wide range of microbes, this ability has diverse roles within the microbial community. For example, fungi have evolved sophisticated metabolic networks to adapt to environmental extremes, including human contact with host cells, direct invasion and infection, and elevated temperatures and drought. Likewise, we have seen evidence for the robustness of human-pathogenic protozoa, which have evolved highly elaborate adaptive responses to changing environmental conditions. In fact, the metabolic responses of the virulent fungal genera Pezizomycotina and Rhizopus are implicated in human diseases, and the super-virulent lineages that include comparative analyses of virulence factors are implicated in fungal infections. The metabolic reorganization hypothesis suggests that metazoa have evolved metabolic reorganization mechanisms to cope with different host environments. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the evolution and persistence of human-pathogenic fungal pathogens, and for understanding the connections between fungal disease and human health.


## Introduction
grisea), an economically important and economically important plant pathogen that is the causative agent of rice blast diseas. In C. grisea, the KEK2 gene is composed of three genes, KegA, KegB, and KegC, and two C. grisea-specific genes, KegF and KegH (C. grisea KegF). In C. grisea, KegA is conserved and required for virulence, while KegB and KegC are strongly up-regulated in response to pathogenicity [7], [8]. However, deletion of KegA and KegB in C. grisea significantly impaired growth and resistance to oxidative stress, respectively, and reduced the sensitivity to osmotic stress and heat shock, compared to KegA [7]. In contrast to C. grisea, deletion of KegA or KegB in C. grisea did not affect the growth, hyphal growth, and resistance to osmotic and oxidative stress [7]. These results demonstrate the importance of KegA in C. grisea virulence. In addition, the KegA and KegB homologs of C. grisea KegF were found to be expressed under oxidative stress, and this changed the expression of KegA and KegB upon osmotic and oxidative stress. Moreover, the KegA and KegB homologs of C. grisea KegF were found to be induced under oxidative stress, and the KegA and KegB homologs were significantly up-regulated under osmotic and oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the KegA and KegB homologs of C. grisea are required for the virulence of the C. grisea KegA and KegB homologs.

In the present study, the expression of the KegA and KegB homologs of C. grisea was analyzed by qPCR, using a high-throughput RNA sequencing approach. The results indicated that the KegA and KegB homologs are induced under oxidative and osmotic stress in C. grisea. The KegA and KegB homologs of C. grisea KegF and C.


## Methods

Construction of Fc/ßRhoCox and Fc/ßRhoGFP
The coding region of Fc/ßRhoGFP was amplified from plasmid pFHC-FcRhoGFP using the PCR-mediated amplification of the primers listed in Table S. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then ligated to a T-vector by the insertion of a His-tag (hybridoma kit). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA10. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was generated by PCR with primers FcFh and FhGFP. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA11. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA12. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA14. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA15. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA16. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA17. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA18. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA19. The Fc/ßRhoGFP construct was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into DH5a to obtain plasmid pFA20.


## Results
The growth and virulence of Magnaporthe grisea were assessed in the presence and absence of 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) (.6% w/v) and 1,4-dimethoxy-1,2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) (1.5% w/v). The growth and virulence of Magnaporthe grisea in liquid culture were confirmed by the growth and virulence assays, respectively. The growth of Magnaporthe grisea was significantly (p<0.05) inhibited in the presence of 1,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (0.1% w/v) compared to the negative control (control). The growth and virulence of Magnaporthe grisea were also assessed in the presence of DOPA, DOPA plus DOPA-bisphosphate-chloride (2% w/v), DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v), DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) or DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) (Figure 1). In the presence of DOPA, DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) or DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) the growth of Magnaporthe grisea was significantly inhibited compared to the negative control. The growth and virulence of Magnaporthe grisea were also assessed in the presence of DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) or DOPA plus DOPA plus DOPA plus 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2% w/v) (Figure 1).


## Discussion
In the osmotic stress response pathway, mutants lacking the CgA_3 were initially selected to simulate osmotic stress conditions in order to mimic the osmotic stress conditions in a hos. The mutants were then tested for osmotic and oxidative stress resistance in Magnaporthe grisea. The mutants were then found to be more resistant to osmotic and oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea. Surprisingly, the mutants showed greater resistance to osmotic stress in Magnaporthe grisea. This result indicates that the fungus is able to tolerate osmotic and oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea. In addition, the mutants were also found to be more resistant to oxidative stress.

In contrast to the osmotic stress response pathway, the oxidative stress response pathway showed higher resistance to osmotic and oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea. The mutants were also found to be more resistant to oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea. In addition, the mutants were also found to be more resistant to oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea. These results indicate that the fungus is able to tolerate and adapt to osmotic and oxidative stress in Magnaporthe grisea.

The response of the fungus to osmotic stress is regulated by the Ca^2+/Calcium^2+/Thi^2+ exchanger system. CgA_3 and CgA_2 are required for osmotic resistance in Magnaporthe grisea and the CgA_3 and CgA_2 are required for oxidative resistance in Magnaporthe grisea. The Ca^2+/Calcium^2+ exchanger system has been found to be involved in the osmotic stress resistance in Magnaporthe grisea [18], and calcitriol and Ca^2+/Thi^2+ exchangers in Magnaporthe grisea are required for osmotic resistance in Magnaporthe grisea [19].
