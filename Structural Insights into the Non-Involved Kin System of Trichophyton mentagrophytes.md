## Abstract
In this study, a new fungal species, Fusarium fujikuroi (F. fujikuroi) from Bali, Indonesia, F. hominis from Temba Island, Hawaii, and F. pseudoknowii from Provo, Washington, collected in Hawaii, were investigated by morphological, chemical, and genetic analyses. DNA sequence data were generated for F. hominis, F. pseudoknowii, and F. hominis from different sites in Bali, Indonesia, Bali, Provo, Washington, and Provo, Hawaii. All fungal isolates were subjected to a combined screening method that included sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit DNA molecule (LSU), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Fourteen F. hominis, eight F. pseudoknowii, one F. hominis, one F. hominis, one F. hominis, and one F. pseudoknowii, were evaluated for their yield and phylogeny, and molecular genetic techniques were performed to evaluate the most consistent group of fungi. Results indicated that eight out of ten taxa in the study group carried out distinct fruiting-body cycles, whereas three out of four Fusarium isolates carried out the largest reproductive stage. No significant differences in the yields were observed between the two groups, which were maintained even after the respective morphological and chemical changes. In addition, all eight F. hominis carried out sexual reproductive cycles.


## Introduction
John’s wort (SWE), have been reported recently [2], [3], [4. TAMPS, and to a lesser extent SWE, have been identified as a key component of the host innate immune system, since they serve to protect and modulate the phagocytic process by releasing inflammatory cytokines that mediate the innate recognition of fungal cell wall components and cell wall associated molecules [5].

The intracellular concentration of antigens is critical for the immune response, as antigens are thought to be taken up through the respiratory chain or secreted by the phagocytic cells or macrophages. These intracellular antigens are then delivered to the lysosome for further processing and presentation to lymphocytes. Importantly, TAMPS is a key component of the immune system of all fungi, and thus, they represent a significant class of antigens, with potential for therapeutic intervention.

Recent studies have demonstrated that TAMPS is required for the activation of the innate and adaptive immune response [6], [7]. In addition, the type-2 galactomannan (Gal-C-Gal) is an immunodominant antigen that is present in the fungal cell wall and is required for the activation of the adaptive immune response [8], [9]. The Gal-C-Gal is recognized by the cells of the innate immune system via a receptor, C3a, which is expressed on phagocytes and macrophages. The receptor binds to the surface of the fungus and can be recognized by the fungal cell wall. Gal-C-Gal is able to be released by macrophages through a chaperone mechanism and is sensed by mononuclear phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Macrophages can respond to the presence of macrophages by activating the type-2 helper T cells (Th_1 or Th_2) [10]. Indeed, the activation of the Th_2 response is pivotal for the differentiation of Th_1 cells [11], [12], [13], whereas the activation of Th_2 responses is associated with the activation of the Th_2 response [14], [15]. In the context of the host-pathogen interaction, it is also important to recognize the molecular and cellular features that facilitate the activation of the host immune response to fungi.


## Methods
cerevisia. Briefly, the antifungal agents were prepared by boiling the inoculum in the appropriate solvent for 10 min and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and vortexed for 2 min. The pellet was then re-suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and vortexed for 3 min. After vortexing, the upper aqueous phase was removed from the aqueous phase and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and centrifuged again. The aqueous phase was then removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and centrifuged again.

## Results
The non-involved kin kin system of Trichophyton mentagrophytes has been shown to have a cellular signature in the late cell [23,25,27,28. Therefore, we first analyzed the non-involved kin system of Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

Non-involved kin systems in the late cell of Trichophyton mentagrophytes
The kin system of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (Figure 4) consists of three components, the kinases (KIN1-3, KIN6-4, and KIN8) and the nuclear envelope (NUP2-2). KIN1 is responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the nuclear envelope, and the KIN2 is responsible for the secretion of the outer membrane protein, NUP2. NUP2 is a nuclear envelope protein that secretes extracellular proteins into the cytoplasm and the nuclear envelope. The NUP2 kinase contains a single A/G region that is conserved in all other kinases. The NUP2 kinase is a prototypal kinase in the late cell of Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The NUP2 kinase is considered to be the most important kinase in the late cell of Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

## Discussion
First, the absence of the mycelia in Trichophyton species has been linked to a defective in vitro growth of Trichophyton species, a phenomenon that has been associated with its low virulence [39. Our analyses revealed that the host mycelium of Trichophyton species is not maintained, and therefore, Trichophyton species can be colonized by non-fungal yeasts. It is of interest that the fungal species inhabiting the plant-associated parts of the same plant, Horshambillus sativus, have never been cultured in this medium before. In addition, some Trichophyton species have been isolated from different plant parts, e.g., from fruits or roots of Quercus genus, and from leaves of Citrus genus [40]. The fungus also has been isolated from roots of Abies species, and even from different parts of the same plant [41]. However, in the absence of an established mycelium, the fungus seems to have retained the ability to form a heterogeneous complex with other fungi. Although Trichophyton species may be found in the same habitat, they can be found in different parts of the same plant, e.g., on different hosts, and even in different substrates, suggesting that Trichophyton species may be adapted to different habitats.

Second, the yeast-like species, Trichophyton atrovirens, are known to be opportunistic pathogens of humans [42]. Therefore, the presence of a fungus that is able to cause disease in humans is of interest. The fungus, Trichophyton atrovirens, is a hyphal-like fungus that is found on decaying wood in the genus Demequina [43]. The fungus is able to colonize plants, especially conifers, in the context of antagonism with other fungi [44]. Thus, Trichophyton atrovirens may be a possible human-pathogenic fungus that can cause infection of humans.

The fungi inhabiting the same plant hosts are also known to be opportunistic pathogens of humans. For example, the fungus, Aspergillus terreus, has been isolated from roots of P. expansum, which is the host for the outbreak of infection [45]. This fungus is able to form a complex with other fungi, including human pathogens [46].
