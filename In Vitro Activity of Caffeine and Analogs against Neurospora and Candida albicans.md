## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis (IA) among immunocompromised patients, with high mortality and morbidity. IA is associated with a higher risk of therapy and higher upfront drug costs, which are commonly associated with high-dose corticosteroids. We sought to develop a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose systemic corticosteroids for the management of IA patients treated with Fusarium together with other regimens.

Patients were randomized to high-dose systemic corticosteroids (100-200 mg/day) or placebo (400-1000 mg/day) for 6 months, and followed for a median of 3.5 months. RCTs were prospectively registered. Baseline data were obtained at baseline and 2-year follow-up. RCTs were stratified by baseline characteristics using a matched list of patients with either known, suspected, or proven IA.

Two hundred and forty patients were enrolled; median age 48 months was 38 months (range 3.4-108), with a mean ± SD age of 71 months (range 0-89). Eight Fusarium isolates were identified to date (four E. coli isolates, two Enterococcus sp. isolates, one Salmonella sp. isolates, one Rhizopus spp., and one Pichia pastoris and one Cauladifolia clavata), and most of the isolates were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. RCTs demonstrated a significantly increased mortality rate in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids (71.2% vs. 7.


## Introduction
Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes with an antigenic repertoire consisting of different proteins that can be recognized by the innate immune system and control the immune response. These cells have emerged as important innate cell types that serve as targets for immune evasion by phagocytes. In fact, it has been estimated that about 1 million non-self parasites infect the human body [1]. Depending on the structure and function of their immune system, NK cells can be classified into three major cell types. The large NK cell type is defined as the lymphocytes that produce cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-13, and produce macrophage polarization and cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [2, 3]. The small NK cell type consists of lymphocytes with different activation strategies. It has been estimated that approximately two-thirds of the human population has a self-limiting NK cell type (NKL) and this is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections [4]. The third cell type is defined by the presence of antigenic molecules including CD3 and CD4 molecules. CD3 and CD4 molecules are small molecules with an affinity for CD47 on the surface and inhibit immune responses by CD45, CD68, CD82, CD163, and CD163R [4]. The antigenic repertoire of NK cells is very diverse and depends on several factors, such as the antigenic concentration, the size of cell, the antigen's surface, and the interaction with the immune system. The repertoire of CD3 and CD4 molecules varies in response to the presence of different antigenic molecules. CD3 and CD4 molecules can be immunotolerant and inhibit the host immune response, whereas CD3 and CD4 molecules are non-immunotolerant and allow the immune system to clear the infection. Thus, the ability to generate and maintain NK cells in the immune system is vital to the control of the parasite and to prevent its replication.


## Methods
The fungi were identified by their morphology and by their morphological characteristic. These fungi were obtained from the collection of the Department of Microbiology of the University of São Paulo, by the method of Dario São Paulo, as well as from the collection of Microbiology Laboratory of the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of São Paulo. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by S.P. Martinsão. The yeasts were obtained from the collection of the Department of Microbiology of the University of São Paulo, by the method of the botanist and the pathogen was confirmed by Dario São Paulo.

Methods
The broth dilution method was employed for testing the antifungal activities of the compounds. This method is based on the checkerboard method, which allows the rapid determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In the checkerboard method, two compounds were tested, viz. 0.1-1.0 µg/mL, and 0.3-1.0 µg/mL, and the results were expressed as the mean value ± SD. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined according to the following calibration curve: [1-(0.01-0.2)], [2-(1-1.0-1.0)]-(0.01-0.2) and [3-(1-1.0-1.0)]-(1.0-1.0). The antagonistic activity of the compounds was determined according to the following equation: [1-(1-1.0-1.0)], [2-(1.0-1.0)]-(1.0-1.0) and [3-(1.0-1.0)]-(1.0-1.0) [4-(1.0-1.0)]. The MIC values of each compound were determined as the lowest concentration that did not inhibit fungal growth.

Method
The agar well diffusion test was carried out to determine the antifungal activities of the compounds on the fungal strains. This test was carried out in triplicate.


## Results
The antifungal activity of the compounds was inversely related to the antifungal activity of the compound.

The MIC_50 values of the compounds for C. albicans and C. glabrata were 1.125 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of the compounds for C. glabrata were 0.813 µg/ml. A comparison of the MIC_50 values of the compounds against the five yeast species of the order Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed that the MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. albicans and C. glabrata were 0.813 µg/ml and 0.875 µg/ml, respectively.

We also compared the antifungal activity of the compounds against C. glabrata and C. neoformans. The MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. glabrata were 0.813 µg/ml and 0.875 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. neoformans were 0.813 µg/ml and 0.875 µg/ml, respectively.

Our results showed that the MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. glabrata and C. neoformans were 0.813 µg/ml and 0.875 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. neoformans were 0.813 µg/ml and 0.875 µg/ml, respectively.

In Vitro Activity of Caffeine and Analogs against the Five Candida Species of the Order Saccharomyces cerevisiae
In the present study, we determined the antifungal activity of the compounds against five Candida species of the order Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The antifungal activity of the compounds was inversely related to the antifungal activity of the compounds.

The MIC_50 values of the compounds against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. neoformans, and C. glabrata were 1.125 µg/ml, 1.


## Discussion
albicans and . tropicalis) revealed that these compounds could have antifungal activity against C. albicans (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, and C. krusei) and/or C. gattii (C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. lusitaniae). However, their MICs against C. albicans and C. neoformans were similar to those of the current study.

The data presented here revealed that the a-amyl and a-pinene derivatives (0, 1, 2, 4-butyldimethyl, and a-pinene) and alcohol derivatives (4, 5, 6, and a-pinene) were more active against C. albicans than against C. tropicalis. The data also demonstrated that a-amyl and a-pinene derivatives were active against C. albicans but less potent against C. krusei. The antifungal activity of alcohol derivatives against Candida albicans was also similar to that of the a-amyl derivative against C. dubliniensis and C. lusitaniae. However, the data also showed that a-pinene and alcohol derivatives could inhibit the growth of Candida albicans in vitro.

The data presented here showed that the a-pinene and a-pinene derivatives (0, 1, 2, 4-butyldimethyl, and a-pinene) and alcohol derivatives (4, 5, 6, and a-pinene) could inhibit the growth of C. albicans and C. krusei in vitro. These results indicated that a-pinene and a-pinene derivatives could be considered as a potential antifungal agent. In the current study, the activity of Caffeine and alcohol derivatives against C. albicans and C. krusei was similar to those of the studies conducted by Moraes et al. (2018) and Reina et al. (2018). The MIC values for C.
