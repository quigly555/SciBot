## Abstract
The Candida glabrata complex contains a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are difficult or impossible to culture in culture, but are resistant to various antibiotics and various fungicides. For example, the C. glabrata complex contains fluoroquinolones that are highly potent against dermatophytes and fungicidal against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by two species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Two of these species, C. neoformans and C. gattii, can be isolated from environmental and clinical sources in healthy individuals. In the case of immunocompromised patients, C. neoformans is a common cause of infection and in immunocompetent individuals C. gattii is a common cause of infection and rarely causes disease [1,2,3,4,5]. However, infections caused by C. gattii, a rare species, are increasingly recognized and treatable with antifungal therapy. In the context of immunocompetence, C. gattii has also been documented to cause disease in immunocompromised patients, with the highest rate of mortality being seen in cancer patients [6,7].

In this context, the development of antifungal therapy has been a focus of clinical research in the past few decades [8,9]. Many of the available antifungal agents have limitations in the choice of antifungals for the treatment of fungal infections, such as the formation of biofilms, the susceptibility of fungi to azoles, and the emergence of resistance. Among these, the azoles inhibit ergosterol synthesis, leading to cell membrane disruption and cell death [10]. However, the side effects of azoles are not well understood and the pharmacokinetics and safety of these drugs have not been well defined [11,12]. Therefore, new antifungals are urgently required for the management of fungal infections [13].

In the present work, three new triazoles, fluconazole and voriconazole, were selected because of their excellent bioavailability, broad spectrum of activity, and long-lasting bio-toxicity, especially in patients with septic shock [14,15,16,17].


## Methods
Microbial cultures were performed on brain tissues using the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Ustilaginous bacteria, Gram negative bacteria and Gram positive bacteri. In addition, bacterial cultures were performed on blood using the Gram negative blood test, the Gram positive blood test, the Gram negative blood test, and the Gram positive blood test, and the Gram positive blood test.

Mice
The animal model used for the study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the College of Animal Science of the University of Quisquén (CEUA-CCR-2016-07) and was housed under a specific pathogen-free conditions in a specific pathogen-free environment. The mouse model was performed as described previously (Guan et al., 2017a,b). Briefly, animals were used for the study in the model cage at the University Hospital of Quisquén, Quisquén, Brazil. The animal husbandry was performed according to the Animal Welfare Act and regulations. All animal experiments were approved by the College Animal Welfare Committee of the University Hospital of Quisquén, Quisquén, Brazil. The experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Occupational Medicine (OOPS) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Animal Welfare of the National Institute of Occupational Medicine (OOPS).

Generation of the complete genome-wide P. brasiliensis deletion mutants
To generate the complete genome-wide deletion mutants for the gene deletion of Pb18, a 6.7 kb fragment containing the 5’ and 3’ regions of the gene coding sequence of Pb18 was amplified using the PCR primers Pb18-F and Pb18-R. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and ligated to a pBluescript vector, which was then transformed into Escherichia coli. The pBluescript-pBluescript vector contains a 5’-binding site for Pb18 that is fused to a 3’-binding site for Pb18 (Pb18-F). The pBluescript-pBluescript vector was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells. The transformants were selected on lysogeny broth (LB) containing 0.01% (wt/vol) ampicillin.


## Results
In this study, the highest proportion of nuclei (.8%) was present in BBB-associated tissues, followed by the blood (5.3%) and spleen (3.3%) (Figure 1A). To further assess whether the BBB permeability in the BBB-associated brain was affected by BBB permeability, we analyzed the numbers of nuclei in the BBB-associated peripheral regions using the anti-B-P (BiP) antibody. The result demonstrated a significant increase in the number of nuclei in the BBB-associated peripheral region compared with the peripheral region in the control group (P<0.05) (Figure 1B). These results showed that the number of nuclei in the BBB-associated peripheral regions was increased in the BBB-associated brain compared with the peripheral region in the control group.

The results of the antifungal susceptibility assay in the BBB-associated peripheral tissues showed that the proportion of BSI was significantly decreased in the BBB-associated peripheral tissues (P<0.05) (Figure 2). In contrast, the proportion of the BSI was significantly increased in the BBB-associated peripheral tissues in the control group (P<0.05) (Figure 2). These results indicated that the BBB-associated brain was relatively permeable in comparison with the BBB-associated peripheral tissues.

Bacterial susceptibility of BBB-associated BBB permeability in brain
The ability of bacteria to survive and invade the brain was evaluated. The survival of bacteria in the brain was measured by plating of brains of animals infected with bacterial isolates. The percentage of the total bacteria in the brain was significantly decreased in the BBB-associated BBB permeability group compared with the control group (P<0.05) (Figure 3). In contrast, the percentage of bacteria in the BBB-associated brain was significantly increased in the BBB-associated control group compared with the BBB-associated BBB permeability group (P<0.05) (Figure 3).


## Discussion

The importance of microbiota in infant bacterial dysbiosis has been highlighted in previous studies in the setting of infant innate lymphoid cell. In our setting, infant bacterial dysbiosis is associated with decreased intestinal bacterial load and increased Lymphocyte infiltration [18]. In this setting, infant bacterial dysbiosis was also associated with decreased intestinal bacterial loads, with a trend towards decreased intestinal bacterial load in the infant infant. Our study adds an additional layer of complexity to this relationship, as the infant bacterial dysbiosis is not specifically associated with infant bacterial dysbiosis in our setting, but rather with other infant bacterial dysbiosis. This could be due to differences in the infant and the infant formula. In addition to the infant formula, the infant formula also has other potentially important factors, such as the infant's medical status, and the infant's previous and current infant body weights [19]. This infant body weight has also been found to influence infant bacterial dysbiosis [20, 21], but the infant formula itself does not. The infant formula is an example of a host body, and the infant formula has been shown to influence bacterial dysbiosis in the infant [20, 21].

Infant bacterial dysbiosis is also associated with dysbiosis in the gut, with bacterial dysbiosis associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the gut [20, 21]. In this study, infants with bacterial dysbiosis were more likely to be admitted to hospital, and dysbiosis was more prevalent in the infant. We have not yet identified other children with bacterial dysbiosis, but other children with bacterial dysbiosis have been found to have bacterial dysbiosis [22]. These children have been found to have higher risk factors for bacterial dysbiosis than infants with bacterial dysbiosis, such as higher BMI, smoking and increased antibiotic use [22, 23].

Infant bacterial dysbiosis also appears to be associated with higher levels of maternal blood pressure in the infant [24]. In our study, the infant formula is a unique infant body, and its infant formula is a shared home environment. This may be a result of a shared infant body in the infant, or a result of infant maternal blood pressure being a limiting factor in the infant formula.
