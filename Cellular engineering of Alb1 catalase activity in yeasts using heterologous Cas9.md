## Abstract
Our understanding of the human immune response to fungal infections has been greatly expanded thanks to our innate immune defenses. The most common pathogens known to date are Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. Immune responses to Aspergillus are often directed at complement-targeting, and the crucial role of the immunositis and complement-system dysfunction imposed by the pathogen during infection is thus far largely unknown. In this study, we used comparative proteomic analyses to identify proteins involved in the response of human monocytes to fungal infection. We found that the fungus primarily utilizes two macrophage activation pathways, complement and Treg cells, and that the high expression of M1 macrophage-specific CD11b+ (Camtisome) macrophages and the low expression of Camtisome B+ (Deinwath) macrophages contribute to the fungal-host interaction. We showed that the fungal infection induces significant changes in the composition of the primary macrophage plasma membrane, with the size of fungal cells being reduced and stabilised in monocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dectin-like proteins such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the fungal capsule and Toll-like receptor, and soluble proteins contribute to the host response to the fungal pathogens. Taken together, these results reveal a major role for the host-fungus interaction, with a possible explanation for the low expression of many of these proteins and the interactions observed.


## Introduction
The fungus Py.


## Methods
7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 2% bactopeptone) with or without 1% Cas9 for 5 days at 30 °. The medium was collected by centrifugation at 3200 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were washed in sterile 0.85% saline, and cell density was adjusted to the final cell density of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. Cell density was then adjusted to a cell/mL concentration by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). The mixture was incubated in a liquid nitrogen-free room at 30 °C with shaking for 1 h. The supernatants were removed, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using HCl. The activity of Cas9 was then measured by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad).

Alb1 and Cas9 transporters were predicted by Tandem Repeat Alignment (TRACS) using the RNA-seq data
For the preparation of genomic DNA, 10 µL of the RNA sample was used for TAR sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from the isolated RNA using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For each sample, four replicates were prepared. The RNA samples were treated with RNAse A (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 5 min and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the RNA-seq primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA sequences were prepared with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the cDNA libraries were generated with the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using the FLX 2x50 bp paired-end sequencing technology.

Transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation
The sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.


## Results
albican. In order to test if loss of Cas9-mediated Cas9 targeting is responsible for the inhibition of catalase activity of Alb1 we constructed Alb1-GFP-CAS9 chimeric Cas9-deleted and Cas9-deleted wild type and Alb1-GFP complemented strains. Following the same protocol as above, we deleted all four genes of Alb1 (Fig 1a,b) and found that Alb1 is fully functional (Fig 1c). We then used Cas9-deleted strain Alb1-GFP to reintegrate a wild type strain Alb1-GFP-CAS9 gene into the strain Alb1-GFP. When the recombinant strain Alb1-GFP-CAS9 was reintroduced into a wild type strain, the addition of Cas9-GFP resulted in the reintroduction of the wild type Alb1-GFP-CAS9 gene into the Alb1-GFP strain (Fig 1d). When Alb1-GFP-CAS9 was reintroduced into a complemented strain Alb1-GFP-CAS9, the reintroduction of the wild type Alb1-GFP-CAS9 gene into the Alb1-GFP strain (Fig 1d) restored the wild type Alb1-GFP-CAS9 expression level to wild type levels (Fig 1e). These results indicate that the effect of loss of Cas9-mediated Cas9 targeting on the activity of Alb1 catalase is responsible for the inhibition of catalase activity.

We then generated a second Alb1-GFP strain Alb1-GFP-CAS9 complemented strain to determine whether Cas9-mediated Cas9 targeting is required for the induction of catalase activity of Alb1. As shown in Fig 2a, the addition of Cas9-GFP resulted in the reintegration of the wild type Alb1-GFP strain into the Alb1-GFP strain (Fig 2b). These results indicate that Cas9-mediated Cas9 targeting is required for the induction of catalase activity of Alb1.


## Discussion
We found that the homologous recombination events in Alb1A gene led to a downregulation of three catalases, the other two being heterologous to the mammalian catalase Alb1. In contrast, the homologous recombination events in Alb1A gene, Alb1A homologous to the mammalian catalase, and Alb1A homologous to the yeast (N. C. P., S. A. Y., M. V. H, and A. S. H.) resulted in a subsequent increase in catalase activity and a subsequent downregulation of several genes. In this way, homologous recombination events led to a rise in the expression of three genes. One gene encoding the catalase Alb1A was upregulated by severalfold in a homologous recombination-dependent manner. The second gene encoding the catalase Alb1A was upregulated by severalfold in a homologous recombination-independent manner. The third gene encoding the catalase Alb1A was upregulated by severalfold in homologous recombination-dependent manner. These results suggest that, in combination with the results previously described (Harding et al., 2013), heterologous recombination-dependent gene disruption leads to a rise in the expression of catalase activity and the subsequent downregulation of several genes.

Regulation of catalase activity in vitro
The expression of Alb1A homologous to the mammalian catalase Alb1A was measured to determine the catalase activity in vitro. The results showed that the expression of Alb1A was significantly regulated by the homologous recombination (Figure 2A). The results also indicated that the expression of Alb1A was significantly regulated by homologous recombination (Figure 2B). The results also indicated that the expression of Alb1A was significantly downregulated by homologous recombination (Figure 2C). These results are in agreement with previous results reported by Harding et al. (2013).
