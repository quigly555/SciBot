## Abstract
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The development of IFI is initiated due to the proliferation of Cryptococcus gattii VGIII in the lungs, predominantly in immunocompromised patients. To the best of our knowledge, only few studies have focused on the infection process in an immunocompetent adult.

We present a case of a young woman with type 2 immune deficiency, who presented with cough, swelling and redness in the left pulmonary opacities. Chest CT showed multiple small nodules in the pulmonary lesions. Lumbar puncture was performed and the results revealed Cryptococcus species.

This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing IFI in immunocompromised hosts and in that patients presenting with IFI often have an increased morbidity and mortality.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast found in soil in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can persist in the lung of a mouse immunosuppressed host, causing pneumonia, pneumonia, meningoencephalitis and death. Worldwide, the fungus accounts for an estimated 10 million cases of cryptococcal meningitis and more than 600,000 deaths annually (Park et al., 2009). Since its discovery, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence and prevalence of cryptococcal disease in patients with compromised immune systems and a lack of effective treatment options.


## Methods
In all, the microbiological findings were evaluated from a total of 52 samples (13 in the clinical samples, 13 in the oropharyngeal samples. In addition to the clinical samples, a total of 16 samples were also evaluated for bacterial and fungal communities, and also included the oropharyngeal samples. The samples from the oropharyngeal samples were collected from one of the eight fields of view and were deposited in the Herbarium of the Department of Pathology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of UCLU. The samples from the oropharyngeal samples were collected from a total of two field of view, one from the field of view and one from the field of view of the mice. The oropharyngeal samples were collected from the mice that were initially dissected. The specimens from the oropharyngeal samples were collected from the mice that were first dissected. All the samples were stored at 4 °C. The sampling procedure was the same as described in the previous section. The samples were placed in a clean sterile plastic container with the aid of sterile swabs and incubated at room temperature for 24-48 h. Then the samples were diluted and prepared as previously. The procedure was repeated. The preliminary analysis was performed using the same laboratory personnel.

The outcome of the microbiological study was evaluated by the Laboratory of Microbiology, UCLU, in a three-month period, from May 1, 2016 to February 17, 2017. The statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post-hoc test with a significance level of P < 0.05. The data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the samples.

2.4. Determination of Bacterial and Fungal Community
The bacterial and fungal community of P. brasiliensis was determined from two fresh specimens of the fresh water samples. These two fresh water samples were collected from the same field of view and were stored at 4 °C in a sterile container.


## Results
After the eggs were incubated in the olive oil-containing cream bag, a sterile cream bag was inserted into the center of the cream bag with a sterile cream bag seal, and a sterile cream bag was inserted into the center of the cream bag with a sterile cream bag seal, using the sterile cream bag seal (Figure 1A,B. The olive oil-containing cream bag was filled with sterile cream bag seal, and the sterile cream bag was filled with the olive oil-containing cream bag. After incubation in the olive oil-containing cream bag, the olive oil-containing cream bag was filled with sterile cream bag seal, and the sterile cream bag was filled with the olive oil-containing cream bag. The olive oil-containing cream bag was filled with the olive oil-containing cream bag. The mycology center typically performed the procedure in a sterile cream bag.

## Discussion
The type of sampling sites were the freshwater of the reservoir site (20 mbsf of the reservoir site) and the freshwater of the reservoir site (20 mbsf of the reservoir site. The concentration of benthic mycophyte species was 0.3 ± 0.2%, of which 3% was benthic mycophyte (Figure 3). The concentration of microbial communities in the water samples was 0.8 ± 0.3% for the freshwaters and 0.9 ± 0.2% for the freshwater of the reservoir site. The microbial community composition of the water samples was dominated by benthic mycophyte species. The benthic mycophyte species were not detected in the water samples of the reservoir site (20 mbsf of the reservoir site). In contrast to the benthic mycophyte species, the bacteria were detected in all of the samples (20 mbsf of the reservoir site). The most abundant phylotypes detected in the water samples (Table S1) were Acidobacteria, Propionibacterium, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In the samples from the Red River and the reservoir site, the benthic mycophyte community composition was dominated by Acidobacteria (29%), Propionibacterium (21%), and Proteobacteria (11%) (Table S1).

Based on the results of the phylotypes, we demonstrated that benthic mycophyte communities were highly enriched in the water samples from the reservoir site (20 mbsf of the reservoir site). The abundance of the bacteria in the water samples of the reservoir site was higher than the abundance of the bacteria in the water samples of the reservoir site (20 mbsf of the reservoir site). The bacterial communities in the water samples of the reservoir site were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes (Figure 3).

Bacteroidetes are the major bacterial phylotypes in freshwater ecosystems and are highly abundant in freshwater ecosystems and are highly abundant in freshwater ecosystems and are highly abundant in freshwater ecosystems.
