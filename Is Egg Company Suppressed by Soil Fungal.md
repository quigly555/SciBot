Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, EMBASE, Scopus, and ENCASE were searched between October 2011 and March 2012, supplemented with January 2012 results. Key informants were recruited from affected communities and health centers across Romania, interviewed using questionnaires and questionnaires. Key informants were also selected to participate in community- and health-based informant searches using an interview guide. Data were analyzed using Epi-info 3.5.1.

The mean age of respondents was 41.8±13.7 years, 61.4% were male and 40.8% were female. The distribution of respondents was similar to the the way health information was distributed in 2011, except that the proportion of women and people living in families with children were significantly different (36.3% and 13.8% respectively). Only 36.2% of the health informants knew the basic principles of soil ecology.

The distribution of respondents was similar to the way in 2011, except for the proportion of women and people living in families with children. The distribution of respondents was unevenly distributed. The distribution of respondents was not observed for the first time in the context of a discussion of the impact of soil protection on health. The risk factors for the occurrence of skin and lung diseases were identified and health impacts on the poorest third were identified.

The distribution of the respondents was similar to the way in 2011, except for the proportion of women and people living in families with children. There was not a significant difference for the distribution of the risk factors for the occurrence of lung diseases, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and infections. The risk factors for the duration of protection against disease were identified and the distribution of disease-related indicators was identified.

The implementation of targeted interventions to reduce the burden of disease and prevent the occurrence of disease is essential to ensure that all those affected are protected. Romania faces a growing number of outbreaks of tuberculin linked to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the 1990's.


## Introduction
In the past two decades, fungal infections have been increasing in incidence and acquired immunodeficiency states (AIDS) and, in many cases, the public has become involved in the healthcare field. The cause of these infections is the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans (CA) (1). The high incidence of the disease, which manifests as skin lesions and serious central nervous system (CNS) diseases, may be attributed to the poor control of the infection by the immune system (2). The CA cause is usually acquired by inhalation of the organism from the environment and is known as the airborne source. The primary route of transmission is through the respiratory route, which is characterized by the presence of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The latter are considered as the primary pathogen and are responsible for a large proportion of the morbidity and mortality. The infection by the airborne source can be distinguished from the acquired immunodeficiency via the production of spores by the fungus (3).

CA infections are often caused by two main species, namely C. albicans and C. glabrata. The species are found in different geographic regions and are more common in certain climatic zones. In addition, the prevalence of the species ranges from 2% to 30% in certain parts of the world, and 10-40% in certain countries (4).

The most important causes of infections are opportunistic, including candidiasis, mycosis, and cryptococcosis. C. albicans infections are caused by C.


## Methods
First, the egg was suspended in .2 M citrate-phosphate buffer and poured over a 25% glycerol-ethanol cushion. After centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 10 min, the internalized egg yolk was transferred to a sterile tube containing 0.5 M citrate-phosphate buffer. The remaining liquid was removed and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the egg yolk. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 0.5 M citrate-phosphate buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the egg yolk. The resulting supernatant was filtered with 0.22 µm membrane filter and the egg yolk concentration was determined by plating on YPD agar.

The egg yolk mixture was then transferred to a fresh YPD agar solution and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell weight was determined by placing the egg yolk in a 1.5 mL glass vial with a 5 mL pipette and transferring it to a new vial. Then, a glass vial was placed over the egg yolk vial and mixed using a 1:1 mixture of water and 1% SDS. The vial was then transferred to a new vial containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min. The vial was then transferred to a fresh vial containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. The vial was then placed on a glass slide with a 5% oil, covered with a cover slip, and then placed in a glass vial. The vial was then put in a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The slide was then placed in a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The egg yolk in the vial was then added to a glass slide containing 10% Congo Red solution, 10% MgSO_4 solution, 10% DTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then the slide was placed in a glass slide with a cover slip.


## Results
cerevisiae was also tested in the laboratory using an environmental-invasive scleroti. As shown in Table 1, S. cerevisiae was not capable of surviving in the presence of the fungicide and sclerotia were more sensitive to the fungicide. This suggests that the sclerotia were less sensitive than the sclerotia to the fungicide. As a result, the production of both the sclerotia and the fungicide is less efficient in the egg production process than in the sclerotia. The egg production process was also less efficient in the egg-producing sclerotia than in the egg-inoculating sclerotia (Table 1).

The yield of the sclerotia and the fungicide was significantly less than that of the sclerotia (P < 0.05). The yield of the sclerotia was significantly less than that of the fungicide (P < 0.05). The yield of the sclerotia was significantly less than that of the fungicide (P < 0.05). The yield of the fungicide was significantly less than that of the sclerotia (P < 0.05).

## Discussion
Although pyocyano-ß-lactamase activity has been reported in other fungi, for instance in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, pyocyano-ß-lactamase activity has not been describe. However, fungal loads in Drosophila melanogaster cells that grown in BHI medium supplemented with sodium pyrazide were found to be significantly higher than those in Drosophila melanogaster cells grown in BHI medium supplemented with sodium pyrazide. In contrast, in Drosophila melanogaster cells grown in BHI medium supplemented with total sodium pyrazide, pyocyano-ß-lactamase activity was found to be significantly lower than those in BHI medium supplemented with total sodium pyrazide. This difference may be due to differences in the pretreatment and/or yeast nutrient composition of the media, which could affect the cell growth and/or cell fate of the fungus.

Our studies of the effect of egg products on the fungal population of egg yolk cultures in the Drosophila melanogaster cell line is the first to demonstrate that the synthesis of pyocyano-ß-lactamase by D. melanogaster in the presence of fungal biomass is dependent on the presence of a specific mycelium. In contrast to pyocyano-ß-lactamase activity, pyocyano-ß-lactamase activity was detected in the presence of yeast in the presence of pyocyano-ß-lactamase from D. melanogaster cells. These results suggest that the cell surface of Drosophila melanogaster is composed of mycelium rather than yeast, and that the cell wall is composed of ß-1,3-glucan rather than ß-1,3-glucan. This phenomenon is similar to what has been observed in other fungi [12].

In addition to the mycelium, the fungal cells are a diverse group of cells that can be treated with various synthetic metabolites.
