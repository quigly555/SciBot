## Abstract
A syndromic, deadly infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is emerging in unvaccinated and immunocompetent people of Asian descent. Infection is often fatal and the patient’s immune status deteriorates. A 36-year-old immunocompetent Chinese woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic-choriasis (CLL) presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on day 14 of follow-up. She had multiple infections; fever, dyspnea, and hemolytic anemia. On hospital admission, she had a good performance and was discharged with minor symptoms and signs. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing and treating Chlamydia chlamydospira infection in an unvaccinated and immunocompetent population and emphasizes the importance of recognizing this life-threatening infection in order to prevent its propagation.


## Introduction
CD1d signaling cascades can mediate both endogenous and acquired immune response. These pathways can be activated by different types of stimuli. The classical CD1 receptor, which recognizes endogenous and exogenous bacteria, and the CD103 family of receptors, which recognize environmental and endogenous pathogens, respectively, result in the activation of CD1d signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways can be activated through either non-classical (CD1d^-/-) or classically activated (CD1d^+/-). CD1d signaling can be activated by many stimuli including nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and antifungal agents. The use of antifungal agents has led to the search of new antifungal agents for treatment of fungal infections [1, 2].

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are class-specific molecules that bind to the cell membrane and are capable of exerting antimicrobial effects. AMPs are mainly produced by bacteria and fungi, and are mainly formed by surface hydrolases and hydrophilic binding groups such as pyraniphosphate (PPD), salicylic acid (SA) and 2,4-dihydroxytetralldi-(1,2)-diphenyl (DHPD). They are mainly synthesized by endo-membranes and present in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or biofilm forming lipids. The two most abundant AMPs in the mammalian plasma membrane are LPS and DMDPD. LPS is synthesized in a lipid-dependent manner by an inactive protein carrier, often a heparin-type protein, and the endo-membrane domain is enriched in the active site LPS. DMDPD is synthesized by endo-membrane proteins and the endo-membrane domain contains two molecules, a heparin-type protein and an antimicrobial peptide (MSP). The MSP is a highly conserved carbohydrate containing a large number of different carbohydrate moieties. It can be either a single molecule or a double molecule. The MSPs are composed of two domains.


## Methods
albicans
CD1d-resistance is known to occur in an individual based on the accumulation of a specific epitope in the cel. A specific epitope is composed of a fragment of the epitope sequence with a negative charge and a positive charge, with which the cell is polarized. The cell is polarized through the P450-derived C-terminal domain of CD1d, which is the epitope to be bound to the cell. The cell is polarized by the P450-derived CD1-Fluorin-B-Rhodamine (CFBR)-associated CD1d. This is a tetranucleotide derivative of the plasmid pKMT-Fluorin-B-Rhodamine. The cell is polarized by the F-actin-C motif [34], which is the promoter of the CD1d-resistance gene.

A modified version of the CD1d-resistance gene was obtained by PCR amplification of the 1 kb promoter region using the primer pair CD1d-Resistant-Fluorin-B-R and CD1d-Resistant-Stop-Fluorin-B-R (Table S1). The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purified PCR product was subjected to sequencing.

SDS-PAGE and SDS-PAGE
The purified CD1d-resistance gene was subjected to SDS-PAGE using an EasySep^® system (GE Healthcare, Germany). The bands were excised from the gel and further purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purified CD1d-resistance gene was subjected to SDS-PAGE using a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). The band was excised from the gel and further purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purified CD1d-resistance gene was subjected to SDS-PAGE using a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). The band was excised from the gel and further purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The band was treated with Triton X-100, and the gel was stained with 0.02% Triton X-100.


## Results
In this study, we identified a CD1d-transferred monocyte-like cell population that is required for the maintenance of normal blood CD4+ T-cell responses in the presence of a range of high concentrations of gamma irradiatio. The population was composed of CD3+ T-cell populations (Fig 3). Although the percentage of CD3+ T-cell populations was high in the study group, this percentage did not exceed 1%, indicating that the C. neoformans monocyte population is not sufficient for the maintenance of normal blood CD4+ T-cell responses.

The majority of the CD4+ T-cell populations (73%) were monocytes and did not have an abundant CD4+ T-cell population (Fig 3). The percentage of monocytes in the study group was very low, with 12% and 16% of monocytes and neutrophils, respectively, being monocytes and neutrophils, and the remaining 24% were monocytes and neutrophils (Fig 3). The ability of monocytes and neutrophils to maintain blood CD4+ T-cell responses was not assessed. The CD4+ T-cell population of the study group was monocytes and neutrophils, with a ratio of 100:1. The percentage of monocytes in the study group was low, with 6% and 12% of monocytes and neutrophils, respectively, being monocytes and neutrophils, and the remaining 12% were monocytes and neutrophils (Fig 3).

The role of CD1d-transferred monocytes in the maintenance of blood CD4+ T-cell responses in the context of experimental diabetes mellitus is well established (31, 32). In this study, we observed a CD1d-transferred population that was required for the maintenance of normal blood CD4+ T-cell responses in the presence of gamma radiation. The population was composed of CD3+ T-cell populations (Fig 3). However, the percentage of CD3+ T-cell populations was low in the study group, with 20% and 38% of monocytes and neutrophils, respectively, being monocytes and neutrophils, and the remaining 24% were monocytes and neutrophils (Fig 3).

Finally, CD1d-null mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of 6-flucytosine in addition to immunosuppressive drugs and Mieczkowski et al., 2005; Zarghali et al., 2006). The treatment of CD1d-null mice with antipsychotic drugs was then extended to include the use of 5 mg/kg of 10-flucytosine in addition to Mieczkowski et al., 2005; Zarghali et al., 2006). The use of anti-atherogenic drugs was also evaluated. Treatment with Mieczkowski et al., 2005; Zarghali et al., 2006; Zarghali et al., 2006). In a recent study, a Mieczkowski et al. group treated CD1<U+03B3>RIIa-null mice with antipsychotic drugs for 2 weeks (two weeks of antipsychotic, Mieczkowski et al., 2005) and then added Mieczkowski et al., 2005; Zarghali et al., 2006).
