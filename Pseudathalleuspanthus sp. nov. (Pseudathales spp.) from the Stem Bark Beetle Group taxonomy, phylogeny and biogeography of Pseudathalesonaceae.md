## Abstract
The Triton-like 1,3,6-triazole (TNB TriAmin) is a newer triazole with broad spectrum antifungal activity. It has demonstrated activity against some filamentous fungi, including mycobacteria, Cryptococcus spp., and Sporothrix spp. The aim of the study was to identify the activities of the TNB against Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and C. gattii. The results showed that the isolated compounds from TNB were able to inhibit the growth of these fungal pathogens with minimal inhibition zone (MZ) diameter of <100 nm. The in vitro antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans. The results indicated that the isolated compounds were able to inhibit the fungal pathogens. The in vitro activity of the isolated compounds was not relevant to treatment efficiency. However, the isolated compounds were able to reduce Aspergillus zygosporus growth, which was statistically significant. The in vitro activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans. The results showed that the isolated compounds were able to reduce the Aspergillus zygosporus growth, which was statistically significant.


## Introduction
2010, Wingfieldia and Wingfieldomycetes), namely Stem Bark Beetles (Kirk et a. 2010) and Wingfieldomycetes (Pleuropis caribereus) (Wingfieldia and Wingfieldomycetes) (Drechsler 1982, Teixido et al. 2015).

The genus Pseudathales is comprised of a range of species that mostly colonise bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae, Scolytinae, Scolytinae, Scolytinae and Triboloporiidae: Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Triboloporiidae: Dicatae and Triboloporiidae: Teixido et al. 2015). The genus Pseudathales is highly polyphyletic, consisting of five distinct clades (Pseudathales, Castellanea and Stem Bark Beetles) that have been reported from different beetle hosts (Jakobsen and Trotter 1983, Teixido et al. 2015). Recently, multiple Pseudathales taxa have been identified from beetles in different habitats, including forest products (Reddy et al. 2006, Karun et al. 2009, Rupp et al. 2010, Gaudin et al. 2011, Hilario et al. 2013, Moncalvo et al. 2015). However, to our knowledge, there are few records of species from these beetles, including P.caribaea (Pseudathales) from South-East Asia, P.ekota (Drechsler 1982, Teixido et al. 2015) and P.osmicola (P.caribae) from South-East Asia (Gaudin et al. 2011, Hilario et al. 2013, Moncalvo et al. 2015).

The genus Pseudathales is typified by P.praetochii (Gaudin et al. 2011, Gaudin et al. 2011, Gaudin et al. 2012) from South-East Asia. It is a phytopathogenic fungus occurring in pine forests in the tropical zone (Gaudin et al. 2011, Gaudin et al.

Materials examined: Italy, Sicily, on Chamaecyparis vitis, date and collector unknown, isol. F.H. Boerema, holotype CBS H-20543, cultures ex-type CBS 101372 = CPC 14277 = CBS 124780.

Notes: Pseudathalpina papili is a member of the Stipa s. str. clade that is well characterised in its ability to form numerous synnemata (Crous et al. 2012a). Pseudathalpina is a common pathogen of coffee and coffee roasts (Leifson et al. 2012). It has been reported from coffee, tea, coffee, tea, tea, coffee, tea and coffee in the Netherlands (Leifson et al. 2012). It has been found in coffee, tea, coffee, tea and coffee, but is most often found in coffee in England (Kohlman et al. 2005).

## Discussion
2015. The second group is the Bombyxisphaeriaceae, which encompasses four species in the genus, including Pseudathalitoideae and Dendroctonus (Nishayama et al. 2015). Pseudathalitoideae is morphologically similar to Pseudathalitoideae but its body and appendages are thinner and have larger basidiospores (25-50 µm vs. 30-60 µm, respectively) (Nishayama et al. 2015). The species of Pseudathalitoideae are closely related to the species of Dendroctonus in Pseudathalitoideae s.str. (Marks et al. 2013) and include three species in the genus. Pseudathalitoideae is morphologically similar to Pseudathalitoideae s.str. (Zhang et al. 2014) in the genus, but its basidiospores are smaller and shorter (23-27.5 µm vs. 30-45 µm, respectively). Dendroctonus spp. occur in and on bark beetles (Dendroctonus spp. and Dendroctonus trichophoroides) (Nishayama et al. 2015). However, Dendroctonus has to be distinguished from the other Dendroctonus spp. in the following ways: (i) The beetles are smaller and smaller basidiospores (25-50 µm vs. 30-60 µm, respectively); (ii) Pseudathalitoideae is not seen in this beetle species; (iii) The beetle's body is thinner and thicker (30-45 µm vs. 40-60 µm, respectively); (iv) The beetles have appendages that are more similar to some Dendroctonus species (this species) (Zhang et al. 2014).

Dendroctonus, Dendroctonus, Pseudathalitoideae and Pseudathalitoideae are closely related to each other in Pseudathalitoideae s.str. (Zhang et al. 2014). Dendroctonus and Pseudathalitoideae are found on different host trees in Asia, Europe and North America (Mok et al. 2008).
