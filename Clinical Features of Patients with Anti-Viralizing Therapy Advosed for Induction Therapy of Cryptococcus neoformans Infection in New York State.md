## Abstract
Infections of immune cells are common to all ecosystems, with few exceptions. While infections caused by plant and fungal pathogens are often non-infectious, their impacts are often severe and often unrecognized. The pathogenic microbes present in most cases are not commensal or modulatory organisms, but instead play a role in immunopathology of both internal and external miliary skin and in the worm-transmitted microorganism communities that develop in the skin and/or the lymphatic system during infections. The mechanisms by which host beneficial bacteria have evolved to overcome antimicrobial resistance in host’s immune cells and the mechanisms by which resistance can evolve are still being elucidated. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms by which resistance to the majority of antibacterial agents is reduced in the host. We also explore the influence of resistance mutations or self-replicating bacteria on resistance in the host that are further described in the field of immune cell adaptation. We provide a theoretical framework for how resistance is mitigated in the host and how this mitigates itself in the host. We also explore the ways in which resistance can be mitigated in the host that enable effective treatment of infectious complications.


## Introduction
The role of lymphocytes in the development of interleukocytes (ILCs) is well-known in the tumor microenvironment and is thought to be critical to tumor progression. ILC formation is initiated by the activation of the Lymphoid-derived Pattern Recognition Receptor (PatternR) by the non-classical pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on T lymphocytes. PatternR-mediated signaling is initiated by the interaction of the TCR with the receptor subunit 6 of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and the homology of TCR and TLR4 and regulates their expression. The second receptor, TLR4, is a homologue of type-2, and is responsible for TLR4-mediated recognition of T lymphocytes. In contrast to TLR4, TLR4 interacts with receptors of the immunosuppressive cytokines Interleukin (IL-4) and TNF-a, and with human T cells. In addition, TLR4 recognizes the CD4 and CD8 cytokines. The TCR is also a receptor of both innate and adaptive immune cells (CSCs) and is composed of two subtypes-Toll-bearing cells (TLR4 and TLR4) and a variety of functional cells (CD4+CD32+TLR4). There are many studies showing that IL-4 and IL-4 receptor signaling contributes to the interaction between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the role of TLR4 on the recruitment of IL-4 receptor-bearing cells (Treg) to the site of infection is well described. TLR4-expressing Treg cells secrete high levels of IL-4, IL-12 and IL-10, which were essential for the induction of IL-4 and IL-10 production in both the Treg and the CD4+ T cells (Andrews et al., 2002). However, the role of TLR4 in the recruitment of T cells to the site of infection has not been investigated so far.

Recent studies have shown that IL-4 signaling is required for the recruitment of T cells to the site of infection in mice.


## Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Huashan University. All patients were examined in the ICU and registered as informed consent was obtained from their parents or legal guardians.


## Results
It has been reported that a single episode of cryptococcal meningitis can lead to mortality of up to 1% (1) in the United States alone [5, 16. We assessed the mortality of patients with cryptococcal meningitis in a global cohort of patients with clinical signs of cryptococcal meningitis (GMDs) in the United States and Europe. The median age of the participants was 50 years (range, 35-72 years) with a median of 36 years (range, 8-90 years) [5]. The median CD4 count was 59 cells/µl, with a median of 69 cells/µl. The median CD4+ T-cell count was 37 cells/µl, with a median of 46 cells/µl. The median CSF glucose was 16.5 mmol/L, with a median of 20 mmol/L. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. There were no significant differences in baseline variables including ART, baseline serum albumin, CSF glucose, CD4+ T-cell count, CSF glucose, plasma glucose, CSF glucose, baseline plasma glucose, CSF CSF protein, CSF glucose, baseline CSF potassium, CSF CSF protein, CSF glucose, serum potassium, and CSF potassium.

In the first 9 months following antifungal therapy, the median survival time was 12.5 days (range, 2.0-17.5 days), and the median survival time was 27.5 days (range, 1.0-42.0 days). After treatment, the median survival time was 10.3 days (range, 1.8-14.5 days). There were no significant differences in survival time and CSF glucose between the two groups. There were no significant differences in CSF potassium between the two groups. The median CSF glucose was 19.4 mmol/L, with a median of 20.6 mmol/L.


## Discussion
biad.doe.gov/). Patients with cryptococcal meningitis are at increased risk of disseminated disease, and usually develop cryptococcal meningitis secondary to treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in those patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µL. ART is associated with higher mortality and increased risk of death in those patients who initiate ART due to cryptococcal infection. HIV-associated cryptococcal infection is reported to be most common in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µL [4]. It is thought that cryptococcal infection may cause immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [4]. The majority of patients with cryptococcal infection in the United States have been diagnosed with IRIS [5]. IRIS is an inflammatory response to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogen that causes severe infection in HIV-infected individuals. It can be caused by either environmental or acquired infection, and infection itself is a risk factor [5]. IRIS is the most common complication of cryptococcal infection in patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/µL [5]. Asymptomatic cryptococcal meningitis in the United States is uncommon. It is the second most common cause of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected individuals [5].

In our case, the patient had been treated with antiretroviral therapy for cryptococcal infection for 7 years. However, she did not clear the infection or the symptoms that had been associated with the infection. She had been treated with oral fluconazole for 2 weeks and then started on fluconazole for 5 weeks. She had been treated with fluconazole for 2 weeks.

Infections in the lung or other tissues can occur in the setting of high cryptococcal titers in HIV-infected individuals. In particular, patients with cryptococcal infection in whom Cryptococcus neoformans was present may be more prone to developing the infection [6]. Viral propagules may also be present in the lungs of HIV-infected individuals [6].

Our case report of pulmonary Cryptococcus infection in an HIV-infected patient has provided the first example of Cryptococcus infection in an HIV-infected patient with a CD4 count of 200 cells/µL.
