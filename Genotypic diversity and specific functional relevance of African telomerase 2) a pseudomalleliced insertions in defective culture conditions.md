## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the etiological agent of cryptococcosis. Here we report a case of cryptococcosis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presenting with mild respiratory symptoms. The patient had been treated with anti-fungal treatment for several years. Her symptoms improved gradually. Four months later, she presented with seizures and ataxia in the left upper limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions in the lungs and thymus, and it was suspected that the infection was disseminated. The patient was successfully treated with anti-fungal therapy. This case illustrates the importance of the identification of cryptococcal lesions, as well as the prompt initiation of treatment to ensure successful treatment.

A 65-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a mild cough and burning epigastrium. She was suffering from progressive weakness in both hands and was diagnosed with cryptococcosis from both the initial lung scan and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. There was an atypical presentation of burning epigastrium and diffuse diffuse infarcts. After antifungal treatment, the patient developed a comatose state.

This is the first reported case of cryptococcosis in a patient with burns in the left upper limb. Burn results of burn patients should be considered in patients with burn and disseminated infection, and in patients with ataxia and burn associated with cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
B. subtilis is a dematiaceous fungus that is a member of the order Mucorales. It is a major pathogen of rice, cotton seedlings and other cereal crops. It has emerged as a serious problem in the rice production worldwide and has a worldwide distribution. In agriculture, it is the major pathogen responsible for most of the disease-causing yield loss. Currently, there are five reported species of Mucorales causing the major losses in rice production (Table 1).

The genus Mucorales includes the most important pathogens of rice, as well as the cause of shoot diseases and soft rot diseases in other cereal crops (Table 2). Mucor circinelloides is a common species that causes soft rot disease on corn, barley, sweet potato, tomato, canola, potato, melon, soybean, canola, tomato and wheat in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Mucor circinelloides can cause rice blast and canola disease on soybean and canola in South and Southeast Asia. Mucor circinelloides is often misidentified as M. ovoides by the mycotoxin detection system, but also by the dominant Cryptococcus neoformans and Kluyveromyces marxianus detection systems (4, 5, 6, 7). The Cryptococcus and Kluyveromyces detection systems are sensitive to environmental stress conditions, including high temperature and UV irradiation (8).


## Methods

A large-scale pilot study has been undertaken to identify a panel of .1-5 million patients with CD4 < 100 cells/µl with CD4 count of < 200 cells/µl, and to identify additional factors related to this “infectious status” that may contribute to the progression of the disease and its associated mortality in the ART setting. For this panel, we included a reference panel of approximately 4 million patients with CD4 count of < 200 cells/µl. We established a protocol by which, in order to evaluate the presence of diagnostic evidence of the “infectious status”, the panel of patients who were considered “viral” by the “viral status” panel were included in the study, and all those patients who were not CD4 count < 200 cells/µl were excluded. The final study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Zhejiang University.

Research protocol
Before we begin the study, we have to evaluate the following 3 main reasons for exclusion: (1) patients are not clinically relevant; (2) CD4 count of < 200 cells/µl is not considered to be “infectious status” by the “viral status” panel; (3) diagnostic evidence is not available for the “viral status” panel.

In the first group, all patients were excluded from the study because of their “viral status” and the “viral status” panel is not available. In the second group, these patients were excluded from the study because of their “viral status” panel, and hence they were excluded from the “viral status” panel. All of the patients were not on ART at the time of the study.

The exclusion criteria were: (1) CD4 count of < 200 cells/µl is not considered to be “viral status” by the “viral status” panel; (2) clinical evidence is not available for the “viral status” panel.


## Results
The authors identified A. fumigatus strain VGIII as the most virulent strain of A. flavus. Compared to A. flavus, A.


## Discussion

The observation that telomerase 2*) is a pseudomallelic insert in healthy individuals and that telomerase 2*) appears to be functionally associated with multiple functions, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, cell separation, and telomerase activation, raises the possibility that telomerase 2*) may have a dual functio. In the human population, the telomerase 1*) and telomerase 2*) may have both functions, including the ability to initiate cell cycle progression, differentiation, and telomere fusion, respectively. The cellular components of the telomerase 1*) and telomerase 2*) are also involved in the development of cell division, cell wall integrity, and chromatin remodeling in the human body, as well as in the development of the cell cycle, telomere and nuclear division, telomerase activation and telomere-associated proteins, and telomerase formation, respectively. The genome of telomerase 1*) encodes a sequence of 434 amino acid residues (55% identical) that are conserved in telomerase 1*) and telomerase 2*) genomes, respectively. However, the telomerase 1*) genome encodes two additional genes, telomerase 2*) and telomerase 1*) (see Table S3 in File S1). The telomerase 1*) genome encodes a single gene, telomerase 1* (L504400), which is orthologous to telomerase 1* of the mouse telomerase 1*) [16]. The telomerase 1*) genome encodes a gene encoding a protein that is involved in cell differentiation, differentiation, and telomere-associated protein processing [16].

Telomerase 1*) also encodes a gene encoding a gene encoding a protein that is involved in chromosome segregation, chromosome loss, and telomere-associated protein processing. The telomerase 1*) genome encodes a gene encoding a gene encoding a protein that is involved in chromosome segregation, chromosome loss, and telomere-associated protein processing. The telomerase 1*) genome encodes a gene encoding a gene encoding a protein that is involved in chromosome segregation, chromosome loss, and telomere-associated protein processing. The telomerase 1*) genome encodes a gene encoding a gene encoding a protein that is involved in chromosome segregation, chromosome loss, and telomere-associated protein processing.
