## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis (IA) among immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematological malignancies. Aspergillus fumigatus can readily be cultured from solid state cultures to enhance in vitro virulence, but its ability to replicate in a mammalian host has been understudied. In this study we demonstrate that an Aspergillus-culturable isolate of the pathogenic fungus A. flavus can efficiently produce soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan in minimal medium in a dose and temperature dependent manner. This work provides the first demonstration of effectively applying an efficient process of growing ß-(1,3)-D glucan in an IA patient to generate soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan.

The production of soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan by A. flavus in vitro was demonstrated in vitro using synthetic medium (nifedipine) and in vivo using a murine pulmonary infection model. The soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan was produced in minimal medium with minimal medium supplemented with 10 µg/mL of amastigote (A. flavus FEL59 strain). The enhanced production of soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan (above 3.4 µg/mL) was achieved when the medium was supplemented with 10 µg/mL of metformin or ritonavir. The medium composition, concentration, and time course of the induced medium were compared. The enhanced ß-(1,3)-D glucan production was associated with enhanced pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the lung and in the brain in vitro. The high quality ROC curve and the association with time course of the induced medium were obtained in the medium. These results demonstrate that A. flavus can effectively produce soluble recombinant ß-(1,3)-D glucan in minimal medium and establish this compound as a viable antifungal drug.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal infection occurs when the immune system is disturbed and the organism is acquired from the environmen. When the host becomes immunocompromised, the organism enters the bloodstream, where it can survive for long periods. Cryptococcal cells are able to multiply and cause diseases in the host, such as meningitis and pneumonia, depending on the immunocompromised state. In the case of AIDS, pneumonia is the most common opportunistic infection, followed by osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Treatment of Cryptococcal infections is complex, involving the use of amphotericin B, azoles, and echinocandins. However, the current gold standard for the treatment of cryptococcosis is azoles, which target ergosterol biosynthesis and are not able to bind the azoles themselves. The drug is limited in its nephrotoxicity and the reactivity of the drug to multiple antigens. Treatment with amphotericin B requires high doses of the drug, which is lethal in the case of HIV-positive patients. Although the drug is effective in HIV-positive patients, the rate of AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis is very high. In the United States, the death rate from cryptococcosis is estimated at over 200 a year [1]. The high rate of drug resistance and emergence of drug resistant strains is a major concern, as studies have shown that there is no correlation between drug resistance and the frequency of infection in the population at large. Therefore, the development of new antifungal agents has a high cost and is expensive, making the pharmaceutical industry and the government of the developing world at large and increasingly important.

The development of new drugs is very difficult due to the large number of active substances and emergence of resistance. The global market for antifungals is estimated to be worth $80 billion by 2017 [2]. The global market for antifungals is expected to reach $1.8 billion by 2021 [3]. In a recent study, some 73 new drugs were introduced into the market with a market value of about $11 billion. Of the 73 new drugs, 33 were found to be fungicidal against Cryptococcus neoformans and 59 were fungistatic.


## Methods
The Cryptococcus meningitis outbreak was recorded in 2009 and 201. Cryptococcal meningitis was classified as a chronic inflammatory reaction syndrome (CIRS) [10]. Cryptococcal meningitis was defined as a CIRS syndrome according to the criteria described by Taha et al [11] and Sabah et al [12]. Cryptococcosis was defined as a CIRS syndrome if the organism showed: 1) typical, non-red-cell-mediated Cryptococcal activation after incubation for 24 h, 2) no Cryptococcus nodules, or 3) normal Cryptococcus oocysts. The results of the previous study showed that treatment with prophylaxis with cyclosporine was able to reduce mortality of Cryptococcus oocysts by 40% [13]. The Cryptococcus oocysts were not visible on the plates. The survival rate of the patients was obtained by counting the number of Cryptococcus oocysts per milliliter of blood.

Cases of cryptococcal meningitis and CNS cryptococcosis were classified according to the criteria of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [14]. Cryptococcosis was defined as a CNS cryptococcosis according to the criteria described by Mina et al [15]. CNS cryptococcosis was defined as a CNS cryptococcosis in a patient with a positive cryptococcal antigen assay, an assessment of CSF cryptococcosis, or a CSF CSF culture in order to determine Cryptococcus oocystis antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid. CNS cryptococcosis was defined as a CNS cryptococcosis in a patient with a positive CSF cryptococcosis, or a CSF CSF culture in order to determine Cryptococcus oocystis antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid.

For each treatment, one patient was divided into two groups, treatment with cyclosporine (CDM) and treatment with cyclosporine (CDM) on the same day. In addition, the CSF samples for the first time after CDM were collected. The first patient was treated with CDM. The second patient was treated with cyclosporine.


## Results
Comparative analysis of P. pastoris and C. albicans germinating on sucrose-containing medium
A comparison of the germinating stage of P. pastoris on sucrose-containing medium was performed using the glycerol-binding assay (GFA) method. The incubation period of the sucrose-containing medium (Figure 1) was selected as the time point for the germination of the fungal cells. A comparison of the GFA results from the two inoculated strains showed that the control strain had a significantly higher GFA score of 0.11 compared to the GFA score of 0.09 from the control strain. The gating parameters of the different experiments were identical. The conidiation of P. pastoris on sucrose-containing medium was then examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the gating conditions, P. pastoris germinated on sucrose-containing medium in the glycerol-binding assay and the conidiation of the control strain was not observed. The high concentration of glucose in the glycerol-binding assay was also observed. The highest concentration of glucose was found in the control strain (0.


## Discussion
tuberculosis, . avium, and M. tuberculosis-associated cytomegalovirus), in addition to non-cryptococcal infections (e.g., T. cruzi, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus) [18, 19]. However, this differential diagnosis is rarely observed in patients with pulmonary disease, such as those who are immunocompromised, in immunosuppressed individuals, and in those who have undergone organ transplants, in which the risks of disseminated cryptococcosis have been reported to be very high [20]. The differential diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis has been previously described in patients with immunocompetent status, such as those who have received the fluconazole drug amphotericin B, a drug that has antiretroviral activity [21]. In this study, we found that the differential diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was based on a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis-associated cytomegalovirus (CMV-CMV), a causative agent of disseminated CMV in the lung and the lymph node, and also in patients with disseminated infection, such as those with skin involvement or solid organ involvement [22].

Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompetent hosts, and is commonly found in the lung, although it has been reported in other organs [23]. Although C. neoformans is relatively common, it is not commonly the most prevalent cause of meningitis in immunocompetent hosts, and is more common in immunocompromised individuals [24]. It is also a common cause of meningeal infection, which has been associated with severe immunosuppression and the use of corticosteroids [25]. The epidemiological characteristics of this disease in immunocompetent hosts are unclear, and few studies have reported the presence of C. neoformans in immunocompetent hosts [26].

Cryptococcal meningitis is usually caused by a single isolate of the pathogen in association with a different pathogen, such as C. neoformans var grubii. However, we found that C. neoformans var grubii was present in more than one patient in this study. In this study, the isolates of C.
