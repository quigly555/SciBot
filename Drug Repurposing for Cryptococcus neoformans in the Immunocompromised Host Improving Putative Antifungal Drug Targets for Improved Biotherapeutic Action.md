## Abstract
Fungal infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. Candida species are the most common cause of candidemia, with the majority of infections being found in patients with underlying diseases of the skin or mucous membranes. In addition, the incidence of invasive fungal infections, including Candida auris, is increasing, especially in the setting of immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Candida species are the most common agents of fungal infection in solid organ and hematopoietic transplant recipients, and in patients with nephrotic syndrome, immunosuppression and hyperthyroidism are the primary causes of invasive candidiasis. Candida species cause both superficial and more systemic infections. The first line of antifungal drugs are used to treat candidiasis, but the use of antifungals in solid organ and hematopoietic transplant recipients is also discussed.


## Introduction
Chemokines and their ligands are the most abundant and important members of the innate immune system. They play important roles in the innate immune system, and their ligands are often self-toxic, triggering a variety of immune processes. The presence of chemokines and their ligands in the body is a major determinant of the immune status of the host. The human body has more than 150 chemokines that have been identified and classified in the seven-syllabose group (COS-MBs) (1). Chemokines have a wide range of functions in the body, including cytokines, chemokine receptors, and apoptotic cells. These molecules are important in the development of immune responses, including induction of apoptosis, activation of immune cells, and regulation of apoptosis. Chemokine ligand (CBL), which includes 5-HT1 and its ligands, such as IFN-<U+03B3>, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-12, and IL-18, are well known to have a role in the induction of apoptosis of cancer cells, e.g., in lymphoma (2-4). In the case of IL-2, it has been shown that IL-2 can regulate tumor growth and apoptosis in different ways, including through induction of cell cycle arrest, activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and degranulation (5,6). In cancer cells, IL-2 has been shown to be important for tumor growth and apoptosis, e.g., in the case of tumor suppressor cells (Treg) (7).


## Methods
neoforman. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and was approved by the Committee on Ethics in Animal Research of the China Health Insurance Corporation (CICH).

Drugs were provided by Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Shanghai, China). In vitro antifungal drug combinations were prepared with the following concentrations: Amphotericin B, 50 µg/ml, Fluconazole, 0.5 µg/ml, and Zidazole (0.125 µg/ml). Amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at the highest drug concentration to treat C. neoformans in the immunocompromised host. Fluconazole, Zidazole, and Amphotericin B were used as drugs to treat C. neoformans in the immunocompromised host. Amphotericin B was used to treat C. albicans in the immunocompromised host. Zidazole was used to treat C. glabrata in the immunocompromised host. Zidazole was used to treat C. parapsilosis in the immunocompromised host.

Evaluation of the Antifungal Activity of the Drugs
The drugs were tested against the following pathogen: C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. neoformans, and C. tropicalis. The efficacy of the drugs was assessed by the antifungal activity of the drugs against three clinical isolates of C. albicans (inoculum-positive, in vitro-positive, and in vitro-negative).


## Results
The drug-repurposing model of cryptococcal infection was characterized using a panel of immunocompromised drug-susceptible drug candidates as described in the Materials and Methods sectio. In the preliminary screening, we screened a panel of drug-susceptible drug candidates that were used in a previous study to screen drug-susceptible drug candidates in the context of a clinical infection model [23]. We found that at least one of the drug candidates for which the drug candidates were resistant to drug selection had an effect on the drug-susceptible drug-susceptible drug candidates (Figure 4A). The effect of drug repurposing for Cryptococcus neoformans infection was evaluated by the size distribution of the drug-susceptible drug candidates.


## Discussion
neoformans in patients with HIV/AIDS and a systematic evaluation of new antifungal drug targets for cryptococcal infection. As previously discussed, there are several potential therapeutic targets for this pathogen, and the first one, C. neoformans, is highly prevalent in the blood. Second, C. gattii, which was first identified in 2009, has been found in the HIV-infected population and in patients with low CD4+ cell counts. Third, C. gattii infection in HIV-infected patients is significantly associated with increased susceptibility to systemic candidiasis. Finally, we observed that C. gattii infection could significantly enhance the activity of the enzyme glucosidase, ß-lactamase, and chitinase, and that the antifungal activity of the C. gattii enzyme, C. neoformans, was significantly enhanced in HIV-infected patients. Importantly, this is the first study to report the antifungal activity of this enzyme.

In this study, we found that the antifungal activity of C. neoformans was significantly increased by the addition of ß-lactamase to the enzyme. This is in agreement with previous studies on the enzyme activity of C. gattii in humans [14] and C. neoformans in the immunocompetent hosts [12, 13, 15]. In addition, C. gattii infection in HIV-infected patients was significantly increased by the addition of ß-lactamase. This is in agreement with the results of our previous studies [14] and our previous studies [14]. Our results are consistent with the results of studies on the enzyme activity of C. neoformans in humans [14] and C. gattii [13, 16] and C. neoformans in patients with HIV/AIDS [14]. The ability of C. neoformans to suppress host immune responses is a major challenge in the host against Cryptococcus neoformans [12, 13, 15].

The major challenge in the treatment of cryptococcosis is its toxicity, and the synthesis of antifungal agents is crucial to successful treatment.
