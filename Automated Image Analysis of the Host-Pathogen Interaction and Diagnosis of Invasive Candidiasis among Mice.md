## Abstract
Background. HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a major cause of AIDS-related deaths in the United States. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is an uncommon but severe complication of solid organ transplantation (SOT) rejection. We evaluated whether treatment-resistant Cryptococcus gattii (Cg) poses a threat to SOT recipients in the United States.

Methods. Five kidney- and adult stem cells-derived macrophages were treated with amphotericin, flucytosine, fluconazole, and flucytosine-amphotericin B (FLD), respectively. Three hundred four SOT recipients with CM were followed up for 10 years.


## Introduction
The emergence of new fungal pathogens has been recognized as a threat to human and animal health, and it is now well recognized that pathogenic microbes have the capacity to cause invasive infections in humans. The emergence of new fungal pathogens has been recognized in the last decades as a threat to both human and animal health. For instance, Candida albicans, the most common species causing superficial infections, has become a leading cause of life-threatening systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, and mortality rates up to 40% have been documented in some of these patients (1). Candida albicans is a human commensal and a major cause of the human disease candidiasis, which is associated with a high mortality rate. In the United States, candidiasis has become a major cause of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections with an incidence of 50% in the intensive care unit (ICU), with mortality rates as high as 81% in intensive care units (2).


## Methods
furfur susceptibility to azole, we firstly compared the results of the assay with the results of previous studies, where we also tested the susceptibility of the WT and . furfur to the compound. The results of the previous studies were also compared with the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay and the results of the previous studies were also compared with the M. furfur susceptibility assay. We then tested the data obtained from the M. furfur susceptibility assay and the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay, and the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay and the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay were also compared with the results of the previous studies.

2.2. M. furfur susceptibility to Fungal Infections
The susceptibility of M. furfur to fungi was determined as described by Yuan et al. [15]. The experiment was performed in triplicate for each of the tested species. For the M. furfur susceptibility assay, we also checked the results obtained from the previous studies with the M. furfur susceptibility assay. The results obtained from the previous studies were also compared with the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay and the results of the M. furfur susceptibility assay.

2.3. M. furfur Microscopic Analysis
The M. furfur strains of M. furfur were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 37 °C and 160 rpm. The inoculated conidia were obtained by inoculating the fungal material into 10 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDA) medium. The conidial suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 CFU/ml by counting the colony forming units (CFUs) in a Neubauer chamber. The number of viable fungal cells was determined by the counting of CFUs by using a hemocytometer. The optical density at 530 nm (OD_530) was calculated by using a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite M200, Austria).

2.4. M. furfur Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The M. furfur strains of M. furfur were cultured on PDA medium at 37 °C and 160 rpm. The conidia of the tested fungal strains were obtained by growing the conidia in 5 ml of sterile water for 10 days.


## Results
The mean percentages of the fungal community in infected mice were not significantly different from uninfected controls (P-value < .05; two-way ANOVA test) (Figure 2). In contrast, the mean percentages of the fungal community in uninfected mice were significantly different from uninfected controls (P-value < 0.05; two-way ANOVA test) (Figure 2). Interestingly, the mean percentages of the fungal community in infected and uninfected mice were similar (P-value < 0.05; two-way ANOVA test).

Infected and Infected Mice Differ in Their Host-Pathogen Interaction and Diagnosis of Invasive Candidiasis
In order to address whether the differences in host-pathogen interaction and diagnosis of invasive candidiasis are related to the host-pathogen interaction, the relative frequency of the same host-pathogen species in both infected and uninfected mice was analyzed. In order to test the hypothesis that the host-pathogen interaction and diagnosis of invasive candidiasis are related to the host-pathogen interaction, we also compared the frequency of the same host-pathogen species in infected and uninfected mice. In order to analyze whether the host-pathogen interaction and diagnosis of invasive candidiasis are related to the host-pathogen interaction, the relative frequency of the same host-pathogen species in infected and uninfected mice was analyzed.

## Discussion
Here we showed that macrophages were activated by the extracellular and intracellular signaling by Mice, Mice, and Pneumococcus neoforman. These Mice, Mice, and Pneumococcus neoformans are able to up-regulate the expression of a MAP kinase by different means.

Inhibition of a MAP kinase by extracellular signaling causes morphological alterations in mouse macrophages and this is associated with the activation of IL-12 production. Mice, Pneumococcus neoformans, and Cryptococcus neoformans are able to up-regulate the expression of IL-12 by different means, and a MAP kinase-independent pathway by which Mice, Pneumococcus neoformans, and Cryptococcus neoformans are able to activate MpkB is also required for the activation of MpkB by extracellular signaling. In our experiments, Mice, Pneumococcus neoformans, and Cryptococcus neoformans were able to activate MpkB by extracellular signaling.
