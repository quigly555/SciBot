## Abstract
The Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species complexes in rice have a remarkably long, symmetric, and punctate, history that starts in the early phase of evolution. In contrast, the evolutionary trajectory of the yeasts in the late phase of evolution was very different from that of the Aspergillus niger species complex in the late phase of its evolution. The divergently evolving Cryptococcus species complexes in rice holds a unique position among fungal pathogens with a remarkably short, and punctate, past that ends in the emergence of the pathogenic yeasts of the present day.

The divergently evolving Cryptococcus species complexes in rice holds a unique position among fungal pathogens with a remarkably short, and punctate, past that ends in the emergence of the pathogenic yeasts of the present day. The Cryptococcus niger strain Vx was used for studying the interaction of the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizopus ericatum with host and model plant species Fusarium oxysporum and for developing a novel yeast cultivation strategy.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, and in the USA they represent a major cause of death in AIDS patients [1,2]. The major opportunistic fungal pathogens are Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, but can also be opportunistic filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Malassezia furfur, and Toxoplasma gondii. The rate of mortality in these patients is between 30% and 90% [2]. The incidence of IFIs in patients with deep-seated fungal infections is approximately 3-4% [3,4]. The majority of fungal infections are caused by Candida, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma species [2]. The Cryptococcus species are ubiquitous in the environment and the most common species encountered in hospitals, where they are frequently identified as the leading cause of fungal infections [5].

Cryptococcus is an encapsulated yeast-like fungus that is usually found in soil and rotting vegetation.


## Methods
Chemicals and reagents
ViriciaBH (DIBEC, Darmstadt, Germany), HPLC grade (D-T) chloroform-methanol (C-Methanol-MeOH) was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The hexane fraction of Vibra-Cloth^® was from J.T. Baker (Darmstadt, Germany). The ethyl acetate fraction of Clor-Cloth^® was from J.T.


## Results
neoformans, we first examined the ability of FKBP12 to promote the virulence of . neoformans in a mouse model. In the mouse model, FKBP12 was used as the model for the induction of virulence factors by immunosuppression (human fungal pathogen and human human primary fungal pathogen) and in vitro immunosuppression (human neutrophil-derived macrophage-like cells).

FKBP12 is required for FK-DAP-induced virulence in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis
Our first observation of FKBP12 in C. neoformans suggested that FKBP12 is a fungal virulence factor. To further test whether FKBP12 is a fungal virulence factor, we tested the ability of the FKBP12 gene to repress the expression of FK-DAP in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. As shown in Figure 3, FKBP12 was required for FK-DAP-induced virulence in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis.

Next, we tested whether FKBP12 can induce FK-DAP-induced virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. We infected three mice with strains of C. neoformans var. grubii, a clinical strain that causes systemic candidiasis in a wide range of settings (44). At two weeks postinfection (p.i.), C. neoformans var. grubii was cleared and the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of C. neoformans var. grubii. At the end of the experiment, all mice survived, while only one mouse died (Figure 4).

In contrast, FKBP12 treatment failed to elicit any FK-DAP-induced effect in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis (Figure 4). These data suggest that FKBP12 is not a fungal virulence factor.

In vitro RNA-seq Analysis of FKBP12 in Response to the Efficacy of the Media
To further investigate the role of FKBP12 in the virulence of C. neoformans, we used a mouse model of systemic candidiasis and the FKBP12 gene was deleted by homologous gene replacement using an inducible promoter (Figure 5).


## Discussion
In this study, we explored the role of thymidine phosphatidylserine in the fungus-plant interactio. Fungal infections with dsRNA viruses showed a decrease in the activation of TPD-1 and TPD-2, while, in contrast, fungus-plant infection with TPD-1 and TPD-2 showed a significant increase in TPD-1 and TPD-2 and TPD-4 [37]. The increase in TPD-1 and TPD-2 after dsRNA infection was also observed in a previous study [38].

In contrast to the thymidine phosphatidylserine (TPD), the major non-catalytic TPD in plant pathogenic fungi is dsRNA [40, 41]. However, in fungi, dsRNA is highly expressed in the plant cells and is widely distributed in the fungal cell wall [41]. A previous study showed that dsRNA can be expressed in fungal cell wall during the early stages of fungal infection [42].

In this study, we found that Fusarium species are able to induce the TPD-4 phospholipase activity. Phospholipids are components of the fungal cell wall, as well as in the fungal cell membrane [43, 44]. In our previous study, we reported that DsRNA-induced phospholipid synthesis was regulated by the TPD-4 protein, which was also the major phospholipid in the fungal cell wall, but was not present in the dsRNA-treated fungal cells. The addition of the DsRNA inhibitor Congo-2 to the fungal cell culture did not induce the TPD-4 phospholipase activity, but the expression of the fungal cell wall phosphatidylserine (TPP) was increased in the fungal cells after DsRNA-treatment. These results suggest that the DsRNA pathway is involved in the induction of TPD-4 phospholipase activity. In addition, we also confirmed that the fungus is able to stimulate the TPD-4 protein expression.
