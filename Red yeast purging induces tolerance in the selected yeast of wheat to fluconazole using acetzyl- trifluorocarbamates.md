## Abstract
Itajahya, an invasive black yeast species, is the only commercially available herbal medicine. In her previous work on Itajahya, Karthikeyan, Agaran, and Amrasek provide evidence for the safety of AmPs, and that the low cytotoxicities of AmPs might be due to the mechanism of action of AmPs. In this work, the safety profile of AmPs obtained from the administration of AmPs in mice was evaluated in the systemic mouse model of infection. In the mouse model, administration of AmPs to mice of different developmental stages significantly increased the survival of the infected mice, and they showed an increased survival rate after a short time in which the levels of amylase and aspartic protease were reduced. Moreover, administration of AmPs to mice of the same developmental stage also increased survival of the infected mice, and they also showed an increased survival rate after treatment with amylase inhibitors. In conclusion, the safety profile of AmPs obtained from the administration of AmPs to mice of the same developmental stage was evaluated, and the administration of AmPs resulted in the same results as in the systemic model. Moreover, the administration of AmPs to mice of the same developmental stage also increased the survival of the infected mice, and they also showed an increased survival rate after treatment with amylase inhibitors.


## Introduction
. neoformans has the ability to form biofilms on the surface of solid solid media. The formation of biofilms in C. neoformans is similar to the formation of biofilms in other pathogenic fungi [13,14]. The formation of biofilms has been described in several human pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Malassezia globosa [15,16,17]. C. neoformans biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of this fungus and has been reported to be involved in many important aspects of human infections, including invasive candidiasis, candidemia, and cryptococcosis [18,19]. The formation of biofilm in C. neoformans can be regulated by the cell wall integrity-associated proteins 1 (CWIS1) [20]. The CWIS1 is a member of the family of metalloproteases which have a role in biofilm formation [21]. The members of CWIS1 are induced in the presence of heat-killed glucose in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [22].

The CWIS1 is a member of the core members of the metalloprotease superfamily and is conserved in eukaryotic organisms [23]. It is the only enzyme that has a known role in the formation of biofilms on solid media. The enzyme belongs to the Pdr1 superfamily, a subfamily of metalloproteases that are found in eukaryotes [24]. The enzymes are able to form complexes with other members of the metalloprotease superfamily (e.g., Pdr1, Pdr2, and Pdr3), which are involved in the formation of a biofilm [25]. The Pdr1 and Pdr2 proteins are two members of the superfamily and are necessary for the biosynthesis of the CWIS1 enzyme [26,27]. The Pdr1 and Pdr2 proteins are highly expressed in the presence of glucose. The enzyme is also required for the formation of a biofilm by the fungus [28,29].

The ability of C. neoformans to form biofilm is an important virulence factor.


## Methods
In brief, the wheat cultivar “G7” was grown in synthetic complete medium (SCM) and was then supplemented with 10 mM NaC. The plates were inoculated with 100 µl of 5 mM NaCl and incubated for 15-18 days at 37 °C. The percentage of germinating spores was determined by counting the number of spores after 5,000 spores were inoculated in 0.5 ml of sterile PBS. A similar procedure was used to detect “soft” microorganisms by spreading 100 µl of liquid culture of 10^5 spores/ml onto the rice agar.

The inoculated rice fields were cultivated in a cultivation incubator at 20 °C and 75% relative humidity, and the number of plants was 10. The culture medium used for the preparation of rice bran was composed of 0.1% (w/v) YNB (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) and 1% (w/v) glucose, and the incubation was carried out for 12 h at 20 °C, 150 rpm. The rice bran was harvested by filtering through a sterile loop and the bran was treated with N-hydroxysulphonate (1:1 w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, United States) to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v) for the processing. The rice bran was then stored at 4 °C for storage at -20 °C until use. The rice bran was then transferred to a sterile tube and the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then used for determination of the turbidity of the filtrate using a spectrophotometer.

Determination of the Candida Elicitor
The inoculated rice bran was obtained by filtration through a sterile loop and the bran was treated with N-hydroxysulphonate (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, United States) to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v) for the filtrate. The rice bran was then stored at 4 °C for storage at -20 °C until use.

The number of Candida spp. in the rice bran was determined by determining the number of Candida spp.


## Results
In this experiment, both antifungal drug concentrations were significantly reduced by a 20-fold dilution (p<.05, Table 2). In the most-treated wheat control, the MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.21 µg/ml, which was equivalent to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml), suggesting that the salt concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate does not inhibit the growth of the selected strain.

Antifungal activity of antifungal agents
We also tested the antifungal activity of the selected yeast strains against the microorganism of the following three microorganisms: the major pathogens of wheat: the A. fumigatus strain (Figure 2A) and the A. terreus strain (Figure 2B). The MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.21 µg/ml, which was equivalent to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml). In the majority of the wheat cultivars, the MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.21 µg/ml, which was equivalent to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml). However, in the largest wheat cultivar, the MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.22 µg/ml, which was comparable to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml). These results suggest that fluconazole does not inhibit the growth of the selected yeast strain.

Antifungal activity of antifungal agents
To test the antifungal activity of fluconazole against the selected strains, the MIC_50 of fluconazole was determined by a spot dilution assay (Figure 2C). The MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.22 µg/ml, which was equivalent to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml). The MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.22 µg/ml, which was equivalent to that of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.16 µg/ml). In the case of the A. terreus strain, the MIC_50 of fluconazole was 0.


## Discussion
CBTs were initially isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated from the plant roots [43. Nowadays, CBTs are widely used in agriculture and in biotechnology [44, 45]. It is recognized that a strain of the Fusarium species is highly susceptible to CBTs [46]. It is important to note that the inhibition of ergosterol synthesis (production of acetyl-CoA) by CBTs is required for the resistance to CBTs [47].

In conclusion, in our study, we have isolated a CBT from P. lindemuthianum and found it to be tolerant to CBTs and fluconazole. CBTs are potential new antifungal agents for treating plant diseases.

Dissolved Candida yeasts inhibit growth of wheat and other plants by binding to the drug, lipids and DNA [48, 49]. The antifungal activity of CBTs is attributed to their ability to break down the fatty acid chain of fatty acid, which is a common component of the cell membrane and cell wall [50, 51]. However, the activity of CBTs against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans has not been reported. The inhibitory effects of CBTs on Cryptococcus neoformans have been reported but not for Cryptococcus spp. [52, 53].

The antifungal activity of CBTs against Candida spp. has been described previously [54, 55]. However, the antimicrobial activity of CBTs against Candida spp. has not been reported. The inhibitory effects of CBTs against Cryptococcus neoformans have been reported but not for Cryptococcus spp. [52].

The inhibition of Candida albicans by CBTs has been previously reported but only for the strain used in the present study. It is unclear whether the CBTs are more effective against C. albicans or C. glabrata strains. The antifungal activity of CBTs against C. albicans has been described previously [54]. The inhibitory effects of CBTs against C. albicans have been reported but not for C. glabrata strains.

The inhibition of Candida albicans by CBTs has been previously reported but only for the strain used in the present study.
