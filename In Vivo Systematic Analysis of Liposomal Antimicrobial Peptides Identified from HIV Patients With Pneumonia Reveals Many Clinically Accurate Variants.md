## Abstract
The high cost of maintenance of fungicidal chemicals makes industrial fungicides unsuitable for human use. Natural products represent a valuable alternative to be used in biocontrol agents. The antioxidant properties of polyphenols, flavonoids and triterpenes extracted from medicinal plants have attracted increasing interest. The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antioxidant and anti-fungal activities of polyphenols and flavonoids from Thymbra gum (Trifols boiduncelis, T. gum) and Laurencia lipolytica (L. lipolytica), obtained from Thymbra gum and their evaluation for their use in biocontrol against clinically relevant fungi.


## Introduction
The term “tissue culturomicroscopy” refers to the diagnostic and/or therapeutic use of specific diagnostic techniques to obtain a picture of tissue for testing. Culture of fungal organisms is widely used in the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of both conventional and non-conventional culture methods. Conventional culture involves the use of specific conventional cultures to detect fungi in tissues such as alveolar spaces, hematologic malignancies, and as well as fungal infections. Non-conventional culture involves the culture of specific organisms in a specific tissue for specific species or species-specific identification of specific organisms. The non-conventional culture is a cost-effective and rapid diagnostic procedure that allows for the specific identification of fungi in the human body in a short time to a longer period of time. This method is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to detect certain species of fungi in clinical specimens.

Non-conventional culture is a cheap and simple procedure that is easy to perform, and can be performed in low cost and without any special modifications.


## Methods
In addition, we used a prospective study to evaluate the effect of the different antifungal peptides on the biofilm formation of Pneumonia and identified two alternative antimicrobial peptides that were more potent in comparison to the one used in this stud.

The study was approved by the University of Vienna School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine and the University of Vienna Institutional Review Board.

The study design was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Medical Research Service (No. 30-008-17).

The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the University of Vienna Ethical Committee (No. 2-821).

2.1. Sample Collection
The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, no. 123, dated 11 January, 1997) and the Animal Welfare Act of 1978 (Animal Welfare Act, U.S. federal law). All animals were handled in accordance with the ethical standards set forth by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Federal University of Viandera, and in conformity with the principles of the principles of the European Convention for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (European Treaty Series, no. 123, dated 3 July, 1998).

2.2. Anti-Fungal Activity
The anti-fungal activity of each antifungal peptide was measured by a standard broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [13]. The peptide was diluted in RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS (Sigma-Aldrich) buffered with HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), and the final concentrations were 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 mg/mL for amphotericin B, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 mg/mL for fluconazole, and 1.


## Results
The identified peptides were then analyzed to determine the difference in their number of amino acids (aa) between the two patient. In the pro-bacte-infected patient, the number of amino acids was approximately half that of the pro-bacte-infected patient, and the peptide score values were estimated as a ratio of the ratio of the number of amino acids in the cells of the pro-bacte-infected patient to the number of amino acids in the cells of the pro-bacte-infected patient.

The number of amino acids in the pro-bacte-infected patient was approximately 10 times that in the pro-bacte-infected patient. The number of amino acids in the pro-bacte-infected patient was also approximately 10 times that in the pro-bacte-infected patient. Thus, the numbers of amino acids in the pro-bacte-infected patient were approximately 10 times that in the pro-bacte-infected patient. The overall number of peptides in the pro-bacte-infected patient was approximately 10 times that in the pro-bacte-infected patient. Moreover, the pro-bacte-infected patient also had an average of 16 peptides per cell, which was significantly higher than the average peptide score values in the HIV patients. Thus, the total number of peptides in HIV patients was approximately 10 times that in HIV patients.

Determining the Efficacy of Antibodies Using the Antibodies of the Vivo Systematic Method
The results of the antifungal peptides were further evaluated using the anti-bacte anti-pneumococcal antibody (Figure 1). The results demonstrated that the anti-bacte anti-pneumococcal antibody (ATB) was highly effective at inhibiting the development of Pneumonia in HIV patients. The anti-bacte anti-pneumococcal antibody was less effective than the anti-bacte anti-pneumococcal antibody at inhibiting the development of Pneumonia in HIV patients.


## Discussion
Pneumococcal pneumonia is a systemic infection caused by bacterial and fungal specie. Pneumococcal pneumonia has been reported in the literature. A variety of bacteria and fungi, including C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Aspergillus species, have been isolated from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. It is a common bacterial infection in immunocompetent individuals and occurs in about 10% of cases. As Pneumococcal pneumonia is a rare disease, Pneumococcus pneumonia is one of the most common causes. Although HIV-infected patients typically have a relatively poor response to therapy, Pneumococcus pneumonia in HIV patients can lead to clinical deterioration, a more serious condition, and death [20].

In our patient, the pathogen was identified in the blood and CSF of the patient at the time of admission. Pneumococcus pneumonia is often fatal, but the severity of the disease is often associated with a favorable response to therapy [21]. The patient was immunocompetent, and the antimicrobial resistance was active against pneumococcal pneumonia. The serum antibiotics were effective, but the patient's serum levels of penicillin BX were decreased and he had an elevated rate of bacterial cell growth. The patient was neutropenic, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antimicrobial activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans. The patient was a former smoker, and the antifungal activity was active against Pneumococcus neoformans.
