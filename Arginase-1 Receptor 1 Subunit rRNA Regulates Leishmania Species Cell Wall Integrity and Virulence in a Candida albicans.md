## Abstract
Opportunistic fungal infections are a significant health problem, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The recent increase in resistant fungal isolates makes it imperative to find new strategies to combat these infections. Cryptococcus neoformans is an important fungal pathogen that is found worldwide, and it exhibits resistance to several antifungal drugs. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antifungal drugs that could be used as anti-cryptococcal drugs. In order to identify new targets, we screened the genomes of 23 species of fungi for genes that function as resistance and predicted their specific functions. These drugs were tested against two metal complexes (e.g., 1-a-b) and a triazole analog, and these performed in a strain-specific assay. Moreover, we designed and analyzed mutant strains to generate derivatives of these drugs. Our results show that a derivative of thymol with a zinc-finger metal ring could be an effective anti-cryptococcal drug. These results strongly suggest that the synthetic derivatives of thymol are promising candidates for drug development.


## Introduction
The prevalence of fungal infections and their associated morbidity and mortality ranges from 10 to 40% in the developed world [1-3]. The invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and many are as high as 40% in developing countries [4,5]. The most common fungal species causing IFI are Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum.


## Methods
coli strain (ECSC A23-4) [14. The production of leishmanial transcriptomes was induced in a mammalian cell line (Human cell line CEA17) using a modified L-trpase inhibitor cocktail [15]. The CEA17 cell line was grown to saturation at 37°C in YPD at 150 rpm and then inoculated with a cell suspension of the desired number of yeast strains. The inoculum was prepared from a yeast cell suspension that was made in PBS at a ratio of 1:1 (yeast cells:cell suspension). The cells were cultured in a shaker at 37°C for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO_2. Cell cultures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml PBS, and the amount of leishmanium in the supernatant was determined by a spectrophotometric method at a wavelength of 540 nm. The leishmanial transcriptomes were also analyzed using a spectrophotometric assay at a wavelength of 590 nm.

A 2.0 × 10^6 yeast cell suspension was inoculated onto the bottom of a 5-µm polylysine-coated polycarbonate membrane (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, and then incubated with a 1:1 (yeast cells:cell suspension) (yeast cell suspension) for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the membrane was incubated with a 1:1 (yeast cells:cell suspension) (yeast cell suspension) for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the membrane was incubated with a 1:1 (yeast cells:cell suspension) (yeast cell suspension) for 1 h at 37°C. The membrane was washed again with PBS and the membrane was incubated with 1% BSA in PBS. The membrane was washed with PBS and the amount of leishmanium in the supernatant was determined by a spectrophotometric assay at a wavelength of 540 nm.

In order to evaluate the inhibitory effect of leishmanium on Leishmania spp.


## Results
delemar strain had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the . delemar control strain (Fig 5A,B). A similar pattern was observed in the control strain (Fig 5A).

In the same cross, two isolates of the same genotype had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had lower levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain (Fig 5A,B).

In the cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had lower levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain.

The rRNA genes from two isolates of the same genotype were found to be expressed in different ways. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had lower levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain.

To test if rRNA gene expression was affected by the pathogenic genotype, we identified rRNA gene expression levels in two R. delemar isolates of the same genotype, and the results showed that rRNA gene expression levels were different between the two isolates of the same genotype (Fig 5C).

The R. delemar isolate had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain.

R. delemar isolate had lower levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain. In a cross between two isolates of the same genotype, the R. delemar strain had higher levels of leishmania isolates than the R. delemar control strain.
