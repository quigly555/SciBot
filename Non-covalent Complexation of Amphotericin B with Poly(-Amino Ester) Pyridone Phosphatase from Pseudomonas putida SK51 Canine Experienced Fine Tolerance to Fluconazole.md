## Abstract
The global burden of invasive fungal infections is high and the rapid development of resistant strains poses a global health concern. The management of these infections involves the continuous use of essential oils and terpenoids that are safe and well-tolerated. The use of plant-derived products in the treatment of fungal diseases is also reviewed. Antifungal properties of essential oils and their applications in the management of dermatophytosis, dermatophytosis with biocontrol agents, aspergillosis, and other relevant fungal diseases are also discussed.


## Introduction
The release of microorganisms into the extracellular space, known as biofilm formation, is a key concept in the interactions of microorganisms and their host cells [1]. The biofilm concept is defined as a complex system in which the extracellular matrix (ECM) is the physical barrier to all biological interactions between a microorganism and the host. The ECM is composed of a self-produced matrix that protects the cell from adverse conditions and provides protection for all involved [2]. The ECM provides the physical barrier against pathogens and antimicrobial agents [3]. In addition to these protective functions, ECM also contains a number of extracellular proteins, which are important for the maintenance of the integrity of the cell membrane and the immune response.

In eukaryotic cells, microorganisms have emerged as important players in the maintenance of cell integrity, particularly in the maintenance of the integrity of membrane proteins, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cell integrity in vivo [4]. For example, Lactobacillus species have been shown to be essential for viability in mouse embryonic kidney cells (EKCL) [5] and it was recently reported that Lactobacillus rickettsii can also induce cell death in vitro in vitro [6], and L. rhizobi can cause death in mice lacking L. rhizobi and L. infantum [7]. The loss of ECM proteins, such as elastin, elastoproteins, and cytoplasmic proteins, can cause cell death, as well as high membrane fluidity [8].

However, the ECM has a number of important structural proteins, which are critical for the proper functioning of the cell.


## Methods
To test the effect of the drugs on the cell wall of the fungal cells, MTT assay was applied [34.

Isolation of Fungal Cells from Spores
Fungal cell walls were prepared as described [35]. Yeast cells were harvested from 0 to 20 mL of Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) agar plate (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, United States) by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min) and washed with PBS to remove non-selectable carbon sources. The collected fungal biomass was resuspended to 5 g in 50 mL of PBS and subjected to 1 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended to 1 mL of PBS. The suspension was transferred to a glass-bottom 96-well microtiter plate (Polypropylene Box, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United States) with 100 µL of PBS. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 30°C and washed with PBS. The cells were then adjusted to 5 × 10^4 spores/mL in PBS and allowed to adhere to the membrane overnight. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO_2 and 10% FBS. The cells were then washed with PBS three times and allowed to adhere to the membrane overnight. The cells were then washed again with PBS and kept at 37°C. The membrane was blocked with a 1% agarose-1% Triton X-100 solution for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibody against C. albicans SC5314 (Abcam, aba2:1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, abc8:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody against C. albicans SC5314 (Abcam, aba2:1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, abc8:1000) was used at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was washed three times with PBS and the membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit anti-rabbit secondary antibody.


## Results
sclerotiorum was conducted in the presence of a higher concentration of amphotericin B (20 mM) with the addition of fluconazole, amphotericin B, and poly-Amino Ester (5 µM) in the mediu. The MICs of amphotericin B and poly-Amino Ester in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B were 0.85, 1.75, and 1.75 µM, respectively. The antifungal activity of fluconazole against S. sclerotiorum was determined with fluconazole concentration of 10 µM, fluconazole concentration of 5 µM, and fluconazole concentration of 20 µM. The MICs of amphotericin B and poly-Amino Ester in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B were 0.16, 0.16, 0.16, 0.16, and 0.16 µM, respectively. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B against S. sclerotiorum was determined with fluconazole concentration of 10 µM, fluconazole concentration of 5 µM, and fluconazole concentration of 20 µM. The MICs of poly-Amino Ester in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B were 0.27, 0.32, and 1.63 µM, respectively. The antifungal activity of poly-Amino Ester was determined with fluconazole concentration of 10 µM, fluconazole concentration of 5 µM, and fluconazole concentration of 20 µM. The MICs of poly-Amino Ester in the presence of amphotericin B were 0.27, 0.32, and 1.63 µM, respectively. The antifungal activity of poly-Amino Ester was determined with fluconazole concentration of 10 µM, fluconazole concentration of 5 µM, and fluconazole concentration of 20 µM. The MICs of amphotericin B and poly-Amino Ester in the presence of amphotericin B were 0.17, 0.


## Discussion
A. terrae is an ascomycetous species, with a worldwide distribution and a wide range of morphological characters. The species is distinguished by its multi-celled, albino-coloured ascospores with a reddish-brown to brownish-brown mycelium, and an ascomycete-coloured ascospore structure. It is distinguished from several other genera by its distinct ascospores with a reddish-brown to brownish-brown mycelium. A. terrae is a synonym of D. sp. Ascomycota, which is also represented by D. terrae [18,19,20,21]. D. terrae is closely related to D. sp. Ustilagoides, which is a synonym of D. terrae, but differs in its albino-coloured ascospores with a reddish-brown to brownish-brown mycelium.

The genus comprises several taxa with a wide range of morphological characters. They include species in the order Sulcocercospora [12,17] and those closely related to T. tritici [17], D. terrae [18], and T. adiantum [18], which was recently described as a new genus in the family Sulcocercospora [12,18,19,20,21]. D. terrae is closely related to T. asperellum, which is closely related to T. subcampylinae [18], and T. subcampylinae is closely related to T. tritici [18]. D. terrae is in the order Sulcocercospora. This genus is represented by D. sp. Ustilagoides [17], D. sp. Lactobacillus [19], and D. sp. Microsporum [21,22]. The genus comprises species in the order Sulcocercospora and Dictyonema [12,18,19,20,21]. D. terrae is closely related to D. sp.
