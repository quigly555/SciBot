## Abstract
There is a widespread view that Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis, is sequestered in warm saline environments and is unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy.


## Introduction
Yeast cells are mainly derived from the mycelia and yeast cells, and are capable of growing on a range of substrates, such as various substrates rich in keratin, food, and other molecules, such as plant-derived oils, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics [3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

The capability of yeast to produce lipids from a variety of substrates is the basis of their beneficial roles in human health. Among the various benefits of yeast, they are involved in the breakdown of the bioactive components, such as carotenoids, cholesterol, and ergosterol [10,11,12,13,14,15]. The growth of yeast cells is achieved by a large amount of glycosylated fatty acids (GAS) that can be digested by the yeast glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor proteins, and these are then incorporated into the substrates through the action of glycosaminoglycans. The major role of GAS is to protect the yeast cells from oxidative stress and the interaction of the GPI anchor proteins with their surface molecules, such as water molecules or lipid droplets [16,17,18].

In addition, GAS are major components of yeast cell walls and act as detergents and emulsifiers in the growth of the yeast cells. It is also used as a detergent and emulsifier to deter and solubilize pharmaceutical ingredients and a variety of other substances [19,20].

The yeast lipids from dairy products are structurally similar to those of vegetable oil, and therefore, their lipid structures can be determined. For example, the fatty acid residues of choline and stearic acid residues in the terpenoid chain of the glucosamine residues in the glucosamine ring are similar to the fatty acid residues of linoleic acid residues [21,22]. The amount of fatty acid residues in the fatty acid chain of the glucosamine ring varies according to the yeast strain, and in some strains the amount of fatty acid residues is present as a linear chain [23].

The fatty acid residues in the glucosamine ring are similar to those of linoleic acid residues and the fatty acid residues are modified by a polymer called linoleic acid [24].


## Methods
fumigatus strain LYS26 [22] in 100 µL of sterile PB. Mice were checked daily for clinical signs of disease and humanely euthanized if they exhibited histological signs of disease. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Histopathological assessment of mice
Mice were euthanized with CO_2 and brain tissues were collected and weighed. For the histopathology, lungs, spleen, liver, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, heart and kidneys were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in 0.5 ml of sterile PBS. The homogenate was diluted with PBS, and 5 µl of this diluent was plated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. The number of CFU per gram of tissue was counted after 24 h. For histopathological analysis, lungs, spleen, liver, heart, kidneys, liver, heart and kidneys were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in 0.5 ml of sterile PBS. The homogenate was diluted with PBS, and 5 µl of this diluent was plated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. The number of CFU per gram of tissue was counted after 24 h.

## Results
elegans VS control (P3) model, JE7/JEC18 and JE7/JEC18, showed that a single copy of Drosophila VS domain was essential for fungal virulence in mice, while a single copy of FAD-16/DAF Viscoq Bros, Drosophila VS domain, was essential for fungal virulence in . elegans.

Drosophila VS domain is essential for virulence in C. elegans

To determine the genetic basis of the Drosophila VS domain, we utilized a C. elegans VS mouse model in which the Drosophila VS domain (D.V. domain) is flanked by a small region (K_D 80-100) that is not present in the C. albicans genome (see Fig S1A in the supplemental material). We constructed a C. elegans VS mouse model by using a set of C. elegans VS genes and a set of C. albicans genes that are overexpressed in the C. albicans background (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The C. elegans VS mouse model contained the complete Drosophila VS domain (K_D 80-100) and the FAD-16/DAF Viscoq Bros, Drosophila VS domain, which were both present in the C. elegans VS mouse genome. To address the significance of the C. elegans VS deletion strains, we conducted a series of cross-reactions using three different strains of C. albicans in which the FAD-16/DAF Viscoq Bros, Drosophila VS domain, and the FAD-16/DAF Viscoq Bros were overexpressed (see Fig S1B in the supplemental material).


## Discussion
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the in vivo immunofluorescence results are coincidental, since immunofluorescence results may be incomplete or incomplete, and immunofluorescence results may be false negative. This is an area of research that is growing and that should be investigated in the future.

Here, we showed that the CD4+ T cell subset in our model system, i.e., the CD8+ subset, is significantly reduced in the wild-type infected mouse, suggesting that CD4+ T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of the experimental IFN-gamma infection. To assess whether T cells play a role in IFN-gamma infection, we used the mouse CD4+ T cell subset as a surrogate. We observed that CD4+ T cells were significantly reduced in the wild-type infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, and that CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in the infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, compared to the wild-type. In addition, we found that CD4+ T cells were significantly reduced in the infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, but that CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in the infected mouse, and that CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in the infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, compared to the wild-type. Taken together, these results suggest that CD4+ T cell subsets are involved in IFN-gamma infection in vivo, and the results are consistent with a previous study in the mouse model of IFI that showed that CD4+ T cells are significantly decreased in the infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, but increased in the infected mouse, and that CD4+ T cells are significantly increased in the infected mouse, but not in the infected mouse, compared to the wild-type.
