## Abstract
Cocos nucifera (Coccotina, Aspergillus fumigatus) is used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments. In the recent years, there has been a huge expansion of its application to many conditions.


## Introduction
This group of giant cells is responsible for invasive infections in immunocompromised patients and has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, with mortality rates as high as 30% in hematologic and solid organ transplant patients [13,14. The ability of giant cells to rapidly proliferate and cause invasive infection has been documented for many pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus [15-17].

The innate immune system consists of a complex network of cells that includes the classically activated innate lymphoid cells (iLCs), which can recognize pathogens by phagocytic cells and secrete various antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to induce tissue immune responses [18]. In the case of bacteria, AMPs have been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo [19]. In the context of fungal infections, an important role for the innate immune system has been established in the killing of pathogenic fungi by cells of the phagolysosome phagolysosome complex (PMC), which can be further subdivided into the PMC class and intracellular phagolysosome class [20]. The PMC class consists of a group of proteins with a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The cysteine-rich PMC proteins are among the most abundant eukaryotic PMC class proteins, and have a catalytic domain and a conserved cysteine-rich domain. Although the majority of eukaryotic PMC proteins are expressed in prokaryotes, plants and fungi, the majority of eukaryotic PMC proteins are expressed in eukaryotic cells in response to pathogens [21,22].

The PMC class comprises four conserved protein-binding domains. The conserved PMC proteins are found in prokaryotic cells in response to pathogens, such as Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus [23]. In eukaryotic cells, the PMC class proteins play important roles in the cell cycle, cell differentiation, and signal transduction, whereas the intracellular PMC proteins are mainly expressed in response to viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa [24,25].


## Methods
glabrat. The strains of S. glabrata (strain SSC-1) and C. glabrata (strain SC-1) were used in this study. The mutant strains were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37 °C for 48 h. The colonies were washed three times with PBS and suspended in 5 mL of PBS. The inoculum was adjusted to a density of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL by counting with a hemocytometer. The cell suspension was placed in a 37 °C incubator, and the number of CFU/mL was determined by plating 1 mL of the cell suspension on SDA and then observing the optical density at the optical density (OD) of the colony. The inoculum was diluted 1 : 10 and spread on SDA plates. The strain SC-1 and SC-1-MG were used as control.

For in vitro assays, 200 µL of the cell suspension was spread onto SDA, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The fungal cells were counted, and the OD of the colony was measured at the optical density (OD) of the colony. The inoculum was diluted 1 : 10 and spread on SDA plates. The yeast growth in the presence of the bacteria was determined as described above.

For in vivo assays, the in vitro Candida glabrata-infected mice were bred in a specific pathogen-free environment. Mice were housed in groups of five at the same facility. The animals were handled according to the Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals of the European Communities (European Community, 2010) and followed the principles of good animal practice as set forth by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals). The animals were kept in an a- (1-h-mo) cage with access to food and water ad libitum.


## Results
brasiliensis in the plasmids of the mous. As shown in Fig 6, P. brasiliensis was able to overcome the stress condition in the presence of antibiotics and extracellular inhibitors, whereas the growth and viability of P. brasiliensis was severely affected. The growth of P. brasiliensis was inhibited in the presence of METH and was rescued by the addition of 1 µM METH. The average number of colony-forming units (CFU) of P. brasiliensis was significantly reduced when compared to the control group (Fig 7).

P. brasiliensis has a high antioxidant capacity (30.3% to 36.3%) and is able to reduce the oxidative stress by enhancing ROS production. Therefore, P. brasiliensis is considered as a potential anticandidal agent. The antioxidant capacity of P. brasiliensis is found to be 1.5-fold higher than that of the control group. However, the cells were more resistant to oxidative stress in the presence of METH (Fig 8).

P. brasiliensis is highly virulent towards B. amylolentus and C. albicans, and the virulence of P. brasiliensis was so virulent that several clinical isolates of P. brasiliensis were killed [9]. The overall survival rate of P. brasiliensis was 8.1% in the presence of METH and 15.2% in the presence of 1 µM METH. The survival of the P. brasiliensis strain was found to be significantly reduced compared to that of the control group (Fig 9).

The efficacy of the P. brasiliensis was found to be 50.7% in the presence of METH and 49.8% in the presence of 1 µM METH. The efficacy of the P. brasiliensis was found to be 100% in the presence of METH and 98% in the presence of 1 µM METH.

P. brasiliensis is also able to reduce the oxidative stress by enhancing ROS production by disrupting the ROS radical. The antioxidative capacity of P. brasiliensis was found to be 1.7-fold higher than that of the control group. However, the survival of P. brasiliensis strain was also significantly reduced compared to that of the control group (Fig 10).


## Discussion
This study showed that the use of host cells as a surrogate for virulence of pathogenic bacteria is significantly more virulent than the use of host cells alon. It is noteworthy that the use of host cells as a surrogate for virulence of bacteria is significantly more virulent than the use of host cells alone, which is consistent with the results from the earlier study [7].

The mechanism of virulence and antifungal resistance of different bacterial species is generally limited to the interactions with host cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of antifungal resistance have not been studied in the same way as the mechanisms of antifungal resistance have been studied in bacteria. One mechanism is the interaction between host cells and bacteria, which in turn results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The other mechanism involves the bactericidal activity of host cells, which in turn results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by host cells is linked to the release of IL-6 [52]. In the present study, we showed that the use of host cells as a surrogate for virulence and antifungal resistance of different bacterial species is significantly more virulent than the use of host cells alone. The use of host cells as a surrogate for virulence is important to understand the virulence mechanisms of these different bacterial species.

The analysis of the genomes of the three bacterial species showed that the mitochondrial membrane was more fluid than the nuclear membrane, which may be caused by the alterations in the cell wall composed of polysaccharides. It is a membrane that contains several proteins, such as chitin and cellulose, which play a critical role in maintaining cell integrity and cell wall integrity [53]. The results of this study showed that the mitochondrial membrane was more fluid than the nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane is considered as the most important and important membrane in bacteria, which provides the flexibility for cell growth and cell wall formation, and it is also a suitable substrate for growth and replication of multivesicularle formation [54]. The cell wall of multivesicularle formation is composed of polysaccharides, which are one of the major components of the cell wall [55].
