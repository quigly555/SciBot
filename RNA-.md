## Abstract
We present the case of an HIV-seronegative young man diagnosed with HIV-1 IA who developed acute rejection of the liver due to hepatitis. His cirrhosis was not associated with an underlying liver pathology. The liver biopsy revealed several polyendocrine glands with thick cirriose stomatognum. The patient received treatment for hepatitis C. This case suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be a possible cause of an HBV reactivation.

## Introduction
As a consequence, they are required for viral isolation and processing [19, 30, 31. Recently, it was shown that RNA-based primers from V. dahliae and their protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, can inhibit the growth of Trypanosoma cruzi [32]. RNA-based primers also inhibit the growth of L. infantum [33].

The generation of RNA-based primers relies on the RNA polymerase II catalytic activity, which is controlled by the homologous mRNA ligand-binding protein Ebp1. The Ebp1 gene is composed of three distinct subunits: an N-terminal cysteine residue protein of approximately 10 kDa, a nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and a variable number of lysine residues of approximately 50 kDa. Ebp1 can be divided into two types: an “old” EBP and a new “new” Ebp1. The Ebp1 homolog is located on chromosome 1 and consists of approximately 17 amino acid residues, and is responsible for the DNA binding specificity of Ebp1. The Ebp1 protein of Trypanosoma cruzi has a single intron and a large spacer region. It can synthesize short non-coding RNA (cDNA) at the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, and cleave this small non-cDNA into a long non-cDNA (nCN) [34]. The nCN can be processed by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) through a Argonaute protein to produce short fragments, which are known as short structures [35]. The cleaved cDNA is then processed by Argonaute proteins by the Arg1/2 type protein. The cDNA is then loaded into a ubiquitin-like receptor (UPR) such as the CCR5 or the CCR6, which serve as the targets for the RISC-cDNA pathway [35]. RISC-cDNA pathway requires the presence of a large number of target proteins, including ubiquitin, lysine proteases, proteins involved in the synthesis of cDNA, and proteins that interact with or directly interact with the RISC.


## Methods
Tau/Pan-Tau/Pan-Tau/Pan-Tau, respectively. For the pan-tau-bond, an equilibrated tubulin immunoprecipitation approach was employed. Briefly, C. albicans yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000× g, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich), and allowed to attach overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min, the resulting suspension was washed three times with PBS and adjusted to a final concentration of 1×10^7 yeast cells/ml. To reduce background contamination, C. albicans cells were lysed in PBS by incubating with 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 min. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 10,000× g at 4°C for 30 min, and the supernatant containing C. albicans cells was collected. To reduce background contamination, the lysate was again centrifuged at 10,000× g at 4°C for 30 min, and the supernatant containing C. albicans cells was collected. To prepare C. albicans cells for the pan-tau-bond approach, 100 µl of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence or absence of 0.05% Tween 80 was added to the cells at 37°C for 30 min. This procedure was repeated for C. albicans cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000× g at 4°C for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. To reduce background contamination, the supernatant was again centrifuged at 10,000× g at 4°C for 30 min, and the supernatant was again centrifuged at 10,000× g at 4°C for 30 min.


## Results
This transcript was chosen because it is the only candidate gene that has been shown to be expressed in the wild type and mutant strains, as well as the transcription factor . polymorpha. O. polymorpha is an endoplasmic reticulum parasite, and the O. polymorpha transcript in C. albicans is upregulated in response to host infection. This transcript is highly expressed in the wild type and mutant strains, but it is also upregulated in the mutant strain (Fig 4B). Transcripts of the O. polymorpha transcript in the wild type and mutant strains were also found to be highly expressed in the mutant strain. In contrast, O. polymorpha transcript in the mutant strain is highly expressed in the wild type and mutant strains. We observed a reduction in O. polymorpha transcript abundance in the wild type and mutant strains when compared with the transcript levels in the mutant strain (Fig 4C). In the mutant strain, the transcript levels of O. polymorpha increased 2.2-fold compared to the transcript levels in the wild type and mutant strains (Fig 4C).

Protein-protein interactions
To investigate the protein-protein interactions among the putative proteins of O. polymorpha, we used the proteins of the yeast R. oryzae proteome (PDB code: RPDB_S17), which has been shown to be a good candidate for protein-protein interactions in other fungi (10). The three proteins identified in our analysis were shown to be part of the N-terminal sequence of the protein, as well as the homology with other protein-protein complexes such as proteins of other fungal species (Fig 5A). A BLAST search of the PDB-seq database against the R. oryzae proteome revealed that three of the proteins, R. oryzae PKS1 (PDB code: PDB_S17), R. oryzae PKS2 (PDB code: PDB_S17), and R. oryzae PKS3 (PDB code: PDB_S17), are also involved in other proteins (Fig 5B). BLAST searches revealed that, the PKS1 and PKS2 proteins were highly similar in their sequences (Fig 5C).


## Discussion
cruzi, which has a genome of 8,450 bp, but lacks the gene encoding the enzyme for ATP synthase and which encodes for the mitochondrial protein I<U+03BA>_. The genome of T. cruzi also contains the genome of the bacterial TbT. cruzi-specific transporter, TbT, which is important for regulating ribosomal proteins. The TbT. cruzi genome encodes several TbT. cruzi-specific genes, including the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,460 bp), the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,462 bp) and the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,449 bp). The TbT. cruzi genome encodes multiple TbT. cruzi-specific genes, including the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,153 bp), the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,153 bp) and the ribosomal protein I<U+03BA>_c (1,152 bp). The TbT. cruzi genome encodes a larger number of genes than the bacterial genomes (Figure 3A), which were found to be the most similar. Also, the genome of T. cruzi was different in the number of genes, which were different from the bacterial genomes. TbT. cruzi possesses two TbT. cruzi-specific genes, TbT_c (1,000 bp) and TbT_l (1,000 bp), and the genome of T. cruzi encodes the TbT. cruzi-specific gene. The genome of T. cruzi was similar to the bacterial genomes, and the genome of T. cruzi was similar to the bacterial genomes (Figure 3B).

In T. cruzi, the genome of TbT. cruzi-specific gene encodes a gene encoding for a protein required for the utilization of glucose by the TbT. cruzi transcription factor (TbT_c) [20]. The TbT. cruzi genome encodes the TbT. cruzi-specific gene, and the TbT.
