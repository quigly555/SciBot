## Abstract
The identification of the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata in humans is difficult because the host lacks the required enzymes for the identification of the pathogen. The current study aimed to identify the essential oil (EO) isolated from the CSF of a CSF isolate submitted for identification by molecular methods. The EO was obtained from the culture medium containing 1 : 1 M sodium hypochlorite, 1 : 1 : 1 chlorophenol, and 1 : 1 : 1 malonyl-CoA, obtained by using a dilution method, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The EO was tested for its ability to identify C. glabrata in a biotrophic assay by the culture method. The results obtained were consistent with that of the biotrophic method. The results obtained with the molecular-based approach were further useful in the identification of this opportunistic fungus.


## Introduction
Bacterial infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a leading cause of mortality among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1, 2]. The lung is the most frequently affected site [3]. Globally, approximately 200,000 people die annually from COPD, with over half of these occurring in sub-Saharan Africa [4, 5]. The most common pathogens identified to cause the disease are Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli [6].

Staphylococci are the most common etiological agents of systemic infections in the United States and Europe [7]. They are classified into three groups based on clinical presentation: those that are non-motile, those that are facultative intracellular, and those that are multinucleated [7, 8]. The non-motile group include the Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii [9, 10].

There are only a few studies describing the prevalence of bacterial infections in COPD, but they are predominantly based on clinical presentations [11]. Amongst other studies, these are based on retrospective studies. These studies show that between 10% and 15% of patients have been evaluated for non-inflammatory central nervous system infections and that these infections are associated with poor outcomes [11, 12].

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have increased prevalence of non-inflammatory central nervous system infections in Africa.


## Methods
coli, . albicans, S. luteus, L. norvegensis, T. asahii and S. pombe were identified by comparison of their chemical structures with the published sequence of the proteins of the species. The first sequence, from E. coli O111:1-O-3, was amplified by PCR using the primers O111:1-O-3 and O111:1-O-3-3 (Table 2), which also included a primers o111:1-O-3 and o111:1-O-3-3, which have been previously used to analyze E. coli O111:1-O-3 and O111:1-O-3 proteins. The second sequence, from C. albicans O111:1-O-3, was amplified using the primers O111:1-O-3-3 and O111:1-O-3-3-3, which contain identical sequences to O111:1-O-3 and O111:1-O-3-3, respectively, and the primer o111:1-O-3-3-3-3 (Table 2) was used to amplify the first sequence, which contained the o111:1-O-3 sequence, which was amplified by PCR using the primers o111:1-O-3-3 and o111:1-O-3-3-3 (Table 2) (Table 2). The third sequence, from S. pombe O111:1-O-3, was amplified using the primers o111:1-O-3-3-3 and o111:1-O-3-3-3, which contain the o111:1-O-3 sequence, which was amplified by PCR using the primers o111:1-O-3-3-3 and o111:1-O-3-3-3 (Table 2).

The final sequence, from S. pombe O111:1-O-3, was amplified using the primers o111:1-O-3-3 and o111:1-O-3-3-3 (Table 2).


## Results

From these observations, it appears that the production of essential oils by Oleaceae sp. is often dependent on the fermentation process and the establishment of the fermentation process. In our analysis, the most common essential oils isolated from the mycelia of P. pyriformis, P. roseus, and P. pratense were EO (5%), EFA (4%), and EO (1%) (Table 3).

Eosinophilic oils are produced by the production of aldehydes, glycerol, oleic acid, but also by the production of carboxylic acids, which are produced by the synthesis of hydroxycarboxylic acids, and these oils are often found in industrial oil or in fragrificous products (Lachance, 1999; Russ and B. Sutton, 1998; Rao and Briard, 1999). The production of carboxylic acids is highly dependent on the fermentation process, so the production of these essential oils by P. pyriformis, P. roseus, and P. pratense was also dependent on the fermentation process.

Eosinophilic oils are usually found in the form of glycosides, which are derived from glycerol and oleic acid. In our study, the production of carboxylic acids by P. pyriformis, P. roseus, and P. pratense was also dependent on the fermentation process (Table 3).

Eosinophilic oils were produced by the synthesis of anisaldehyde, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, propionic acid, inositol, and malonyl ether. This is also the case for EO (4%) and EO (1%). The production of carboxylic acids by P. pyriformis, P. roseus, and P. pratense was also dependent on the fermentation process, so the production of carboxylic acids by P. pyriformis, P. roseus, and P. pratense was also dependent on the fermentation process (Table 3).

Eosinophilic oils are produced by the production of esterified esters, which are produced by the synthesis of esters, esters-oligosides, and esters-catabolism of alcohols (Millanesa, 2002). The production of esters-catabolism by P.


## Discussion

In addition, the primary role of the yeasts in the production of essential oil is the production of essential oil (3. The essential oil has been reported as a bioactive compound and it can act as an antibacterial and antioxidant agent [42]. Several studies showed that essential oil is a good candidate for the production of lipids. In fact, several studies showed that essential oil could be an efficient antioxidant [43-45]. Studies also showed that essential oil has antimicrobial properties [46]. It was also reported that the essential oil has anti-fungal activity [47].

The essential oil has been shown to be a good model for the production of essential oil. It has been reported that essential oil can be a good option for the bioprocessing of bioremediation products [48, 49]. It was also reported that the essential oil can be used to prepare more efficient biomaterials to replace the costly and time consuming process of processing biomaterials such as metals or metals-containing materials [50].

The essential oil has been reported to be highly active against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and T. mentagrophytes, and it has been reported that it can be used as an antifungal agent [51].
