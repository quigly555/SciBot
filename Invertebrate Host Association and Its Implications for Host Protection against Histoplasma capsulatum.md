## Abstract
Fungal infections of the central nervous system (CNS) have frequently been described in patients with diabetes mellitus, which has led to the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis.


## Introduction
However, the ciliates secrete proteins called microbicidal polysaccharides which kill the yeast cells not following phagocytosis (Desjardins and Fries, 2007; Sander, 2009; Sander, 2014. The C. albicans cell wall is composed of several polysaccharides including chitin and glucans, and the polysaccharides are the primary target for the pathogen (Sander et al., 2005; Sander, 2005; Sander, 2006). The polysaccharides are secreted and trafficked through the cell by means of the secretory pathway, leading to the secretion of numerous toxic substances including leukotrienes, nitric oxide (NO), and proteases, which are recognized by the host immune system and contribute to the pathogenesis (Sander et al., 2005; Sander, 2005; Sander, 2006).

The cell wall is a complex structure which is composed of many different types of cellulose fibers, polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and chitin. Among the various carbohydrate components, cellulose is known to be the most important material for pathogenesis of Histoplasmosis (Sander and Nicaud, 2007; Abourez-Alves et al., 2010). The cell wall is a primary cell component for Histoplasma and C. albicans, and the structure of the cell wall has been shown to play a role in their pathogenesis (Sander, 2009). A key component of the C. albicans cell wall is the chitin. The chitin is a linear layer of ß-(1<U+2192>3)-linked glucan (C2) and linear ß-(1<U+2192>6)-linked chitin (C3) (Sander et al., 2005). Chitin is formed by ß-(1<U+2192>3)-linked glucose units and chitin is mainly found in the cell walls of Histoplasma and C. albicans. The chitin layer is mainly composed of ß-(1<U+2192>3)-linked glucan and chitin.


## Methods
Host-invasive fungal pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans, . albicans, and C. gattii, are known to be important stressors for the host, with the toxicity of which is considered to be a significant threat to health [37]. This study was therefore conducted in a clinical setting, and does not alter the underlying clinical data [38,39]. In addition, we also investigated the potential role of glucocorticoids in the antifungal activity of ampicillin against S. capsulatum, which was not assessed in this study. In order to be able to interpret the results, we considered the independent experiments performed by different individuals, and were able to use the results of these experiments. We also analysed the effects of various concentrations of ampicillin and antibiotics on the growth of C. gattii.

In the case of the control, the ampicillin-antifungal treatment was not included in the study. We considered that the susceptibility to the drugs was high. We considered that we could not assess the effect of the antibiotics on the growth of S. capsulatum.

The methods and methods for the assaying of the antifungal activity of Ampicillin against S. capsulatum, C. gattii, and S. cerevisiae
The assay for antifungal activity against S. capsulatum was performed using the modified method of Crandall and Hager [40]. Briefly, two-week-old female BALB/c mice were used to determine the MIC values of Ampicillin and antibiotics for S. capsulatum, S. cerevisiae, and S. cerevisiae, respectively, in their drinking water. The MECs were the MICs of all tested drugs for S. capsulatum, S. cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae, and S. cerevisiae. The MECs were determined by the method of Crandall and Hager [40]. The experiments were performed according to the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health [41].

The assays were performed with or without Ampicillin and antibiotics on the test animals. Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages and received water, food, and water ad libitum.


## Results
acridum host-pathogen interaction tool to measure the interactions of the fungal host with fungal host cells in the lun. M. acridum grows on host cells in the lung as well as on host phagocytes in the lung (Figure 4A). Host-associated fungal cells were co-expressed in the lung of infected animals and the phagocytes were stimulated with different concentrations of congo red (Figure 4A). During infection, host cells were processed by M. acridum-induced phagocytosis and labeled with the fluorescent dye, which was excreted from the lung. The fluorescent dye was labeled with polyclonal anti-conjugated antibody, which immunized with the host cells were co-immunized with the host cells. After the fungal infection, the fungal cells were infected and colostered, and the fungal infection was monitored by flow cytometry (Figure 4B). During the infected lung, the number of infected lung cells was significantly higher than that of uninfected cells (p<0.001). The number of infected lung cells was significantly higher than that of uninfected cells (p<0.001). The number of infected lung cells was significantly higher than that of uninfected cells (p<0.001).

The co-expression of host cells and host phagocytes was also studied, and the co-expression of host cells and host phagocytes was determined in the infected and uninfected lungs (Figure 4C). In the infected lung, co-expression of host cells and phagocytes was significantly higher than co-expression of host phagocytes (p<0.001). However, co-expression of host cells and phagocytes was significantly higher than co-expression of host cells (p<0.001).

To investigate the role of host-associated fungal cells in the lung, we used the M. acridum pathogen interaction tool to measure the interactions of the host cells with fungal host cells. M. acridum is a pathogen that can colonize the host cell, and the host cell does not require host phagocytes for the phagocytosis process (Nguyen et al., 2014). We used the M.


## Discussion
The role of the host defense system in invasive infection has been previously demonstrated in both the hamster and human models of invasive aspergillosis [57-59. In addition to the pathogen itself, the human pathogen A. fumigatus induces host immune response by promoting Th2-type cytokines in the lung, which are considered to be important virulence factors in invasive aspergillosis [60, 61]. The role of the host defense system in the development of invasive aspergillosis in humans has been also demonstrated in invertebrates such as the rat [62, 63], in which the recognition of Histoplasma capsulatum by macrophages enhances the production of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-4 [64] and enhances the release of proinflammatory cytokines [65]. In addition to these factors, the host immunity against Histoplasma capsulatum infection also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can also trigger the development of inflammation in the lung and cause the development of tissue damage in the lung [66].

The host response to Histoplasma capsulatum infection is mediated by a host-pathogen interaction, which is often referred to as ‘host-microbe-pathogen-host interaction’ (HAMP-HAMP) [67].
