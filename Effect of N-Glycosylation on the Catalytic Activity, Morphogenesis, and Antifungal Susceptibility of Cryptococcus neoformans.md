## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by members of the Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans species complexes. It is still poorly understood how C. gattii and C. neoformans differ in their ability to form biofilms, a major factor that influences virulence. To gain insight into the diversity of the cryptococcal and fungal biology, we examined a C. gattii isolate collection and phenotypical traits in comparison with a C. neoformans isolate. By using a multilocus sequence analysis approach, we identified numerous exceptions to the typical morphology and biochemical characteristics of C. gattii and C. neoformans isolates, including the ability to undergo mating, the formation of basidiospores, and the production of blastoconidia. Furthermore, we observed that the majority of C. gattii isolates were colonized by hyphae, whereas the majority of C. neoformans isolates colonized only by hyphae, and the majority of C. gattii isolates produced spores. These data suggest that the fungal biology is much more complex than previously thought.


## Introduction
The induction of the pro- and anti-catalytic activities of N-glycosylation was found to be dependent on both protein structure and localization, and the resulting activity was associated with the activity of the major facilitator superfamily of enzymes, such as cyclobutaminyl-1-yl (CBL-1), cyclobutaminyl-2-yl (CBL-2), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are involved in the synthesis of ergosterol (31. Antibodies against the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which was also reported to be involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, are required for the survival of Cryptococcus neoformans in the cytoplasm of host cells (32). However, the role of N-glycosylation in fungal growth, antifungal susceptibility, and antifungal drug resistance has not been explored.

In this study, the presence of N-glycosylation in the cell wall, and its possible role in cell wall metabolism, was investigated. The anti-C. neoformans N-glycosylation activity of an enzyme, known as N-glycosylase I, was analyzed. The results showed that N-glycosylation is present in the cell wall and is required for fungal growth, and that it is essential for antifungal resistance. The main inhibitory activity of N-glycosylation was observed in macrophages and neutrophils, and was associated with the secretion of different metabolites, such as trehalose and GlcNAc, that inhibited fungal growth and cell viability. N-glycosylation was also found to be required for the growth of the yeast form of C. neoformans, which was associated with the expression of several genes involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, and with the survival of this organism in the mouse lungs. The inhibition of N-glycosylation of the enzyme N-glycosylase I in macrophages, which was also associated with the growth of this organism in the presence of the enzyme, provided a mechanism to explain the survival of this organism in the host and in the infected mouse.


## Methods
neoformans strain CEA10 (serotype A, va. grubii, reference strain B) were used in this study. The cells were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 37 °C for 4 days. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL in PBS. CEA10 cells were seeded on petri dishes (2 × 10^3 in 25 µL PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 days. Cells were counted to determine viability and the percentage of viability was calculated according to the following formula: % Cell viability = (number of cells in petri dish)/number of cells in petri dish × 100.

Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing of CEA10 cells to CEA10 was performed using a broth microdilution method. CEA10 cell suspension (1 × 10^6 cells/mL in PBS) was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The optical density (OD) at 540 nm was read using a microplate reader (BioTek, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at a sample volume of 25 µL. The inoculum was prepared from 0.5 × 10^6 to 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL in PBS. The test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 0.1% and stored at -20 °C until use. Inoculum was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium buffered to pH 7.0 with MOPS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) by adding 0.5% DMSO to the final DMSO concentrations. The concentration of antifungal drugs in the broth was also adjusted to obtain a final DMSO concentration of 1% before use.


## Results
neoformans to the Synthetic Amino Acids Synthesis system was evaluated by measuring the IC_50 of the synthesized compounds for each isolate against the various concentrations of AM. The results are presented in Table 3. All of the tested isolates showed moderate to strong MIC values, which is similar to those reported for C. albicans against the human human pathogen C. neoformans. The MIC_50 values of AMB against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans were also similar to those reported for C. albicans against the human pathogen C. albicans. However, in contrast to AMB, AMB showed a very strong MIC_50 value against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans. The MIC_50 values of AMB against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans were also similar to those reported for AMB against the human pathogen C. albicans. The MIC_50 values of AMB against the human pathogen C. neoformans were also similar to those reported for AMB against C. albicans.

3.3. Isolation of Antifungal Activity against the Cryptococcus Species
A panel of clinically relevant strains, including all of the available strains of C. neoformans, were used to determine the antifungal activity of the synthesized compounds against the Cryptococcus neoformans. The results of the MIC_50 and IC_50 values are presented in Table 4. All of the tested strains showed moderate to strong MIC values against AMB, suggesting that the synthesized compounds are active against Cryptococcus neoformans. The MIC_50 values of AMB against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans were also similar to those reported for AMB against C. albicans. However, in contrast to AMB, AMB showed a very strong MIC_50 value against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans. The MIC_50 values of AMB against the Cryptococcus neoformans isolate C. neoformans were also similar to those reported for AMB against C. albicans. The IC_50 values of AMB against the human pathogen C.


## Discussion
The percentage of introns in the target gene was then calculated as the ratio of the total number of introns in the target gene to the percentage of introns in the coding regio. As shown in Fig 2, the N-glycan analysis revealed a constant value of the N-glycan concentration in the cell. The maximum concentration of the N-glycan in the cell was set at about 50% of the maximum concentration of the N-glycan in the cell. The lowest concentration was recorded for the enzyme of the N-glycan biosynthesis in the cell. The N-glycan is a molecule that is synthesized by a polymerase and is also present in the cell wall. It is a potent inhibitor of many cell wall biosynthetic enzymes and is used as an anti-fungal drug [24].

N-glycan concentration was determined by measuring the average concentration of the glycosidic linker between the two N-glycans. The optimum concentration of the N-glycan was set at about 50% of the maximum concentration of the N-glycan in the cell. The lowest concentration was recorded for the enzyme of the N-glycan biosynthesis in the cell. The highest concentration of the N-glycan in the cell was found at about 50% of the maximum concentration of the N-glycan in the cell. The glycosylation reaction catalyzed by the N-glycan and enzyme produced the maximum amount of the glycosylation. The enzyme catalyzed the glycosylation reaction to form a large chain of N-linked glycosyl residues (N-pyranosyl). The enzyme was catalyzed to generate the N-glycan, catalyzed to produce the N-linked glycosyl to form the N-glycan. The enzyme was catalyzed to generate the enzyme that produced the N-glycan, and the enzyme was catalyzed to produce the enzyme that produced the N-linked glycosyl to form the N-glycan. The enzyme was catalyzed to produce the enzyme that produced the N-linked glycosyl to form the N-glycan. The enzyme was catalyzed to produce the enzyme that produced the N-linked glycosyl to form the N-glycan.
