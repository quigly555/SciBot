## Abstract
This study evaluated the usefulness of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identifying and classifying compatible filamentous fungi.

Two hundred and eighteen solid phase yeasts were culture-cultured for 10 min with 0.1% NaCl and culture supernatant was added to each culture. Then, the specimens were examined for growth and antimicrobial activity using the microdilution method.

Both the culture supernatant and the antifungal isolates were identical to the standard Candida species isolates. However, the Candida species isolates were different from the compatible and incompatible profiles. Although Candida species was the most frequently isolated Candida species, the compatible and incompatible profiles were similar. The antimicrobial profiles were not statistically different between the two profiles.

MALDI-TOF MS showed satisfactory results for identifying compatible filamentous fungi, although not for identifying incompatible filamentous fungi. However, it failed to identify compatible filamentous fungi and its inability to classify incompatible filamentous fungi did not follow its targets.

MALDI-TOF MS is a fast, easy to operate, inexpensive, reliable, and effective method for the identification of compatible and incompatible filamentous fungi. Its performance might be considered as a good indicator of the right time to initiate antifungal therapy in patients with compatible filamentous fungi.


## Introduction
The disease is caused by the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, which consists of two species, Cryptococcus neoformans va. grubii, and Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. C. neoformans var. grubii has historically been considered nonpathogenic to humans, while C. neoformans var. neoformans is more common in immunocompromised individuals. The two species are considered distinct species, but most species are related, and their genetic characteristics can be altered. For example, C. neoformans var. neoformans is more closely related to C. albidus than to C. gattii. While C. neoformans var. grubii is more frequently encountered in the immunocompromised than C. albidus, C. gattii is much more frequently encountered in the laboratory than in the general population. The genetic differences between C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. gattii suggest that the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex may differ from the other Cryptococcus species, and that these differences may be related to their different mechanisms of pathogenesis (9, 12).

Infections due to C. neoformans are caused by the encapsulated yeast form, which is rarely encountered in the environment (13). The Cryptococcus species complex can cause a lethal infection in healthy people, while C. neoformans can cause infection in immunocompromised individuals (14). Infection with C. neoformans can be contracted by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells, which are formed by the inhalation of spores, and can cause a pulmonary infection (15-18). Inhalation of yeast cells is a common route of infection, and it is estimated that approximately 300,000 people per year are estimated to have a pulmonary infection with C. neoformans (19).

The Cryptococcus species complex consists of two species, C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans. C. neoformans var. grubii has a worldwide distribution and is the most common species, followed by C. neoformans and C. neoformans var. neoformans (20). C.


## Methods
 2005. The model was based on the use of a four-week-old murine model of cryptococcosis. The murine model was based on the use of a tricyclic model of cryptococcosis, which included induction therapy for the first month of therapy (TTC) in a ratio of one to two as well as antimicrobial resistance (RR) (Sommer et al., 1999). The model was based on the use of a murine model of tuberculosis. The murine model was based on the use of a murine model of chicken, which was considered as the “gold standard” model. The model was based on the use of a murine model of rabbit. All models were performed at the University of Texas at San Antonio BioMedical Research Center, and all patients received standard treatments for infection.

The model was compared to a conventional infection model with a “gold standard” treatment, with a series of murine infections that were included in the initial analysis. The total number of infections in the model was 6, 6, 6, and 6.5, respectively.


## Results
neoformans infection using the fungus as a model of cryptococcosis was first constructed using the split-second model of . neoformans infection. The model used was the split-second model of cryptococcal infection. The second model (which included the split-second model of C. neoformans infection) was based on the first model of cryptococcal infection (from the split-second model of C. neoformans infection). The model of C. neoformans infection was established by the split-second model of cryptococcal infection. The model of C. neoformans infection was based on the second model of cryptococcal infection. The model of C. neoformans infection was established by the split-second model of cryptococcal infection.

## Discussion
The model showed that sequential treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine increased the initial . neoformans load within the lungs [23]. The C. neoformans load was then reduced in mice using multiple combinations of amphotericin B and flucytosine (Figure 3A), which resulted in a significant increase in the initial C. neoformans load (Figure 3B).

Previous studies have shown that C. neoformans infection may not only occur in the lung but also in other organs (e.g., brain) [24, 25]. This suggests that the initial C. neoformans infection may not be as severe as previously thought. However, in the context of cryptococcal infection, it is important to consider the possibility that the initial infection may be as severe as previously thought and that the outcome may be even worse.

To test this hypothesis, we performed multiple-drug combination therapy with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole for 6 h. The results showed that fluconazole and amphotericin B both increased the C. neoformans load in the lungs (Figure 3C). The first dose of fluconazole increased the C. neoformans pulmonary burden (Figure 3D). The second dose of fluconazole (0.25-0.3 mg/kg) increased the C. neoformans pulmonary burden (Figure 3E). The third dose of fluconazole (0.25 mg/kg) increased the C. neoformans pulmonary burden (Figure 3F). Finally, the fourth dose of fluconazole (0.25 mg/kg) increased the C. neoformans pulmonary burden (Figure 3G). The results indicated that the initial infection was severe, and the later infection was only as severe as the first dose of fluconazole.

The initial cryptococcal infection in humans occurred in mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii var. neoformans [26]. The initial C. neoformans infection occurred in mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii var. neoformans (Figure 3A) [27]. The second infection occurred in mice infected with C. neoformans var. neoformans (Figure 3B).
