## Abstract
The resistance to azoles in the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus has been attributed to an excess of resistance mutations resulting in resistance to triazoles, which in turn undermines efficacy of currently used antifungal drugs. This mini-review aims to provide an overview of the azole resistance and triazole drug resistance in the human opportunistic fungal pathogen A. fumigatus. It summarizes the data on the following: (i) resistance mechanisms of A. fumigatus to triazoles; (ii) interactions between triazoles and the human fungal pathogen A. fumigatus; and (iii) interactions between triazoles and A. fumigatus with an overview of the mechanisms of resistance, drug resistance, and interaction. It concludes with a focus on interactions between triazoles and A.


## Introduction
Immunoglobulins (IgGs) are a family of proteins containing the adaptor molecule IgE and a cytotoxic IgE molecule. IgGs function as protective antibodies that bind to and interact with cell receptors on human monocytes and neutrophils, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators (1). In addition, IgGs are a family of proteins that have a dual role in immunity, as they protect against a wide range of microbes and parasites by modulating the immune response and binding to the immune receptors expressed on the cell (2). In addition to the role of IgGs, many studies have reported that they also function as other mediators of immune responses in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and asthma (3-5).

In the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that the functionality of several IgGs is linked to their role as antigen presenting cells, such as T helper (Th) cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and neutrophils. These cells are secretory and secrete the immunoglobulin-binding protein (IgGBP) and are capable of binding to antigen-presenting cells in the environment and through their receptors to activate their cell-mediated immune responses (6). In addition, Th cell activation has been demonstrated to be a critical factor for the formation of a protective Th cell response in the central nervous system (CNS) of humans (7, 8). In contrast to the pro-inflammatory role of Th cells, however, the studies conducted by our group and others have demonstrated that the Th cell response is not always protective and is necessary for protection against fungal and bacterial pathogens. Thus, the pathophysiology of the pathogenesis of MTHs and other autoimmune diseases is also complex.

In the case of MTHs, the infection processes of the CNS are important. The infection process begins with the circulation of the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BACE) into the CNS by the lysosporium of the gastrointestinal tract. The blood-brain barrier is formed by tight junctions, which restrict the flow of blood between the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BBB), which are the principal interfaces in the blood-brain.


## Methods
Study design and setting
This study was carried out in the Department of Pathology of the School of Pharmacy of the University of Malawi Hospital, with an established institutional review board (IRB) and an ethics review. We were a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a rural setting in an out-patient setting. We recruited patients with a history of suspected cryptococcosis or who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) therapy for a period of 18-24 months.

Patients were divided into two groups: those with a positive serum cryptococcal antigen (C. neoformans), and those without a positive serum cryptococcal antigen. The C. neoformans and C. neoformans C. neoformans were seroconverted by the method of Z. Dothidemoser (ZD) in the hospital and were confirmed as the causative organism by PCR. The C. neoformans and C. neoformans C. neoformans were grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at 37Â°C for 3 days and the fungal cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS. A positive serum cryptococcal antigen (C. neoformans) was used as a positive control, and a negative serum cryptococcal antigen (C. neoformans) was used as a negative control. All samples were processed within 24 hours, and the number of Cryptococcus colonies was counted.

The blood culture was performed from day 1 to day 90 of the study.


## Results
Clinical Characteristics of the Subjects
Among the 6 patients with pulmonary disease, 2 patients were excluded from the study due to poor performance in the initial recruitment. The median age of the patients was 25 years, and the median CD4 count was 134 cells/mm^3. The majority (70.9%) of the patients had fungal infections (n = 2), and 8 patients were hospitalized in the acute phase of the disease (n = 1). Of the patients with pulmonary disease, the median duration of symptoms at the time of admission was 26 days (range, 4-37 days), and the majority of the patients had a fever within the first 6 days of hospitalization. Of the patients with cryptococcosis, the median duration of symptoms at the time of admission was 24 days (range, 5-72 days), and the majority of the patients had a fever within the first 6 days of hospitalization. The median duration of symptoms at the time of admission was 27 days (range, 2-37 days), and the majority of the patients had a fever within the first 6 days of hospitalization.


## Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that the kinase inhibitors Cz, Mp and Pdr, as well as the human gene Rpd1, could be used to develop novel kinases inhibitors with antifungal activity against C. neoformans.
