## Abstract
In this study, we investigated the composition of the fungal communities in the indoor air on a day-to-day basis as observed by high-throughput high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Our results showed that the fungal community composition was highly complex and associated with various environmental factors, such as indoor air. The association between fungal community composition and various disease markers was supported by indirect measurements of the total fatty acids and carbohydrate contents of fungal biomass by surface characteristics, heat and drought conditions, and by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of total organic compounds (TCS) by MALDI-TOF MS. Our results showed that the total organic carbon (TOC) content was the major component of the community in the indoor air samples. This study further revealed that the fungal community composition was also influenced by the indoor air quality, including the presence of various local factors. The distribution of the fungal community showed significant heterogeneity in the quantitative analysis, with the number of taxa, the density of the fungal population, and the concentration of TOCs varying according to the location and the source of the carbon. The results also indicated that the contribution of the fungal community to total TOCs was significantly correlated with the indoor air quality and that the distribution of TOCs was also related to the concentration of TOCs. The results suggested that the presence of various environmental factors, such as indoor air, played a significant role in shaping the fungal community composition. These results represent the first comprehensive characterization of the fungal community associated with indoor air.


## Introduction
The interaction of . albicans and host cells may be the reason why C. albicans causes chronic infections in patients. Furthermore, C. albicans has the ability to form biofilm on implanted devices such as prosthetic joints, medical devices, and implanted medical devices [16]. C. albicans biofilm formation is known to be triggered by systemic inflammation [17]. Moreover, C. albicans can form biofilms on implanted medical devices such as heart valve, pacemaker, and pacemakers [18]. The biofilm formation may be triggered by C. albicans infection of implanted medical devices [19]. Moreover, C. albicans can form biofilms on medical devices and implantable medical devices [20].

Furthermore, several immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) can be implicated in the pathogenesis of C. albicans infections [21]. Thus, the innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, were shown to be critical to C. albicans pathogenesis. Furthermore, DCs can activate the inflammatory response in vitro, and when activated in vivo, can contribute to the infection process [22,23]. DCs can exert anti-fungal effects by phagocytosis, killing, inducing apoptosis, and killing C. albicans through the apoptosis associated protein (AP-1), which mediates the formation of caspase-dependent apoptosis [24]. The caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway has been shown to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of several diseases [25]. Recently, apoptosis associated protein (AP-1) has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of cancer [26].

The role of DCs in the pathogenesis of biofilm is well known. A recent study showed that in C. albicans biofilm formation is influenced by the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway [27]. DCs are involved in the inflammatory response in the lung and are involved in C. albicans infection through the production of IL-12 and CXCL1 [28,29]. C. albicans biofilm formation is well characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TNF-a [30,31]. Moreover, in C. albicans biofilm formation, the production of IL-10 and TNF-a has been demonstrated [32].

## Results
atroviride wild type strain (WT) or in the WT-Hog1<U+0394> strai. We found that the HOG1 deletion strain showed reduced growth rates in the absence of Hog1, compared with the WT strain (Figure 3A). The hog1<U+0394> strain also showed reduced sporulation (Figure 3B), which was in line with the reduced growth observed in the WT strain (Figure 3B).

Hog1 is Essential for Thioredoxin and Mucor Induction of T. aureus
The reduced growth rates of the hog1<U+0394> strain and the hog1<U+0394> h^-/- strain, respectively, were confirmed by colony blotting. Both strains showed reduced sporulation when grown in the presence of the antifungal compound miconazole (Figure 3C), which was consistent with the reduced growth in the presence of the HOG1 deletion strain (Figure 3C). The h^-/- strain also showed reduced sporulation, which was in line with the reduced growth in the presence of miconazole (Figure 3C). The h^-/- strain also showed reduced sporulation when cultured in the presence of the HOG1 deletion strain (Figure 3C). We also analyzed the growth of the h^-/- strain when cultured in the presence of the antifungal compound miconazole. The h^-/- strain showed reduced sporulation (Figure 3D), which was in line with the reduced growth in the presence of miconazole (Figure 3D). These results strongly suggest that Hog1 is required for the Thioredoxin and Mucor induction of T. aureus infection, but the lack of Hog1 in the h^-/- strain is not a major cause of the reduced growth in the presence of miconazole.

Hog1 is a GTPase
GTPase is a major GTPase required for both catalase and catalase-dependent GTPase activities [26]. We examined whether Hog1 is required for catalase activity by performing a GTPase assay.
