## Abstract
The root endophyte Trichoderma harzianum is a devastating biothreat threat to the central crops of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Current culture-dependent methods for tracking root growth have limitations, including the time-consuming environmental sampling required to obtain a complete assessment of the associated microbial community. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved methods to allow for the accurate estimation of the associated community and the community membership. This study evaluates the accuracy of the AcrBTL+ CAM method and its parameters in a range of root morphologies. Time-lapse imaging of the root morphological and functional changes over time was used to assess the CAM method with species richness and similarity. The AcrBTL+ CAM method had an additional parameter, lau (abundant), that was used to measure the relative abundance and abundance of related genera in the root morphologies. The AcrBTL+ CAM method had an additional composite parameter that was used to measure the relative abundance and abundance of the associated bacterial community in the root morphologies. The results showed that the AcrBTL+ CAM method had an effective and statistically significant correlation with the CAM method when it was used to measure the association of the associated bacterial community. The results of this study provide a general approach for the estimation of the associated microbial community and community membership and demonstrate that it offers an effective approach to obtain a quantitative approach to the analysis of a complex network of plants.

Reviewers' comments:

"The manuscript is written well and all the data are accounted for. I cannot recommend this study to proceed to final manuscript. There are a number of possible flaws in the manuscript. For instance, some of the experiments are not well performed. The final manuscript could have been done better by either of the reviewers. Or it could have been done better by the authors. I cannot comment on the manuscript's ethical issues. I strongly feel that the reviewers were fully professional and responsible for the quality of the manuscript. I think the reviewers were overly concerned with ethical issues, so I can't comment further on the manuscript's ethics."

## Methods
oleracea and fungi was studied by plating one colony of each fungus on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) plate. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 6-8 weeks and examined daily for germination and colony colour change. The influence of genetic stability on Saprophytic cultures and microbial biomes was studied by plating one colony of each fungus on SDA plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7-8 weeks and examined daily for germplasm formation and appressoria formation. The influence of genetic stability on microbial species was studied by plating one colony of each microbe on SDA plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 7-8 weeks and examined daily for filamentation, appressorium formation, appressorium colour change and appressorium colour change. The influence of genetic stability on plant species was studied by plating one colony of each plant on PDA (Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) plates. Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7-8 weeks and examined daily for hyphal colour change. The influence of genetic stability on lichenic fungi was studied by plating one colony of each fungal on PDA plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7-8 weeks and examined daily for hyphal colour change.

## Results
-1 m. However, when the MIC of the three microbial strains was 0.5 mM, all three strains were unable to grow on minimal DPPH. To test whether these strains had compromised soil properties, they were grown in a nutrient-rich medium and then grown on the microenvironment. In the absence of DPPH, all three strains were able to grow on the minimal DPPH-containing media. After 24 h of growth, all strains were able to colonize the microenvironment. The same results were obtained with the two more resistant strains (S1 Fig).

The high DPPH-containing concentrations of the three microorganisms are comparable with that of the other two isolates. However, the S. cerevisiae and E. faecalis strains were unable to grow on the DPPH-containing media (Fig 4, S2 and S3 Figs). To test whether the DPPH-containing concentrations of the three isolates are compatible with the model soils, the data were analyzed for the influence of cultivation conditions on the DPPH-containing concentration of the three isolates. At the highest cultivation temperature (70°C), all three strains grew well on the DPPH-containing media. However, the growth of S. cerevisiae and E. faecalis strains was severely compromised on the DPPH-containing media (Fig 4, S2 and S3 Figs). The two S. cerevisiae strains were able to grow in the presence of the highest DPPH concentration (0.2 mM) in the medium at room temperature (20°C), and the E. faecalis strain was unable to grow on the DPPH-containing media at the highest cultivation temperature (25°C). These results suggest that the DPPH-containing concentration of the three isolates is compatible with the model soils.

The DPPH-containing concentration of the three isolates is not significantly different from that of the other two isolates

## Discussion
and Enterobacter s. [15, 18, 26, 67]. The bacterial community in the composted soil was considered as a relatively stable state for the microbial community based on previous studies [15]. The presence of this microbial community during the first weeks of composting may be due to the chemical processes (e.g., micro-biomass, biomass, and organoleptic properties) that are employed by the microbial communities. The chemical processes are thought to be important in the biotic and abiotic processes that are induced by the composting process [68, 69]. The bacterial community was mainly dominated by aerobic and facultative anaerobic micro-organisms (Saprophytes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and by facultative anaerobes (Saprophytes, Pneumocystis, and Proteobacteria). The presence of these two types of bacteria was observed for all the stages of the composting process, but this abundance of anaerobic micro-organisms decreased significantly during the first three days (Table 1). This result was also observed in the same period (Figure 1A). The results indicated that the micro-organisms that were dominant during the first three days of the composting process were also dominant during the second day of the composting process (Figure 1B). The main groups of the bacterial community were found to be the genera Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus, and Clostridia. The presence of these genera in the soil was observed during the first week of the composting process. These results indicated that the microbial community may be dominated by the aerobic micro-organisms, but that the presence of these genera during the first three days of the composting process was also dominant.

The results from the metagenomic analyses indicated that the microbial community was dominated by the aerobic micro-organisms, and that the presence of the dominant genera Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus, and Clostridia during the first three days of the composting process was also dominant. The presence of these genera in the soil was observed during the first week of the composting process. This result was also observed in the same period (Figure 1A).
