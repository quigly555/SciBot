## Abstract
In this study, we evaluated the activity of trypanosomatins, plant polyketides, and polyketides from Lonicera ochrochoides against a panel of three Lonicera species (conidiales, sedentarabiales, and lichenized forms). In vitro activity was measured with a CaCl2-based assay, and polyketides were detected in the trypomastigote culture medium. The highest polyketide inhibitory activity was observed with the cultivated fungus Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The results show that polyketides could act as active moiety in the inhibition of L. ochroides with minimal inhibition zone (MIC) = 0.03 µg/mL. The minimal inhibitory concentration values for polyketides were 0.25-0.50 µg/mL, which was lower than the European mean value of 0.30 µg/mL. The MIC values of polyketides were highest for the fluconazole drugs amphotericin B and itraconazole (MIC = 8 µg/mL), followed by the fluconazole fungicide ketoconazole (MIC = 16 µg/mL). In our study, polyketides from Lonicera were fungicidal against L. ochroides, with minimal fungicidal activity (MIC = 0.03 µg/mL) against sedentaria and lichenized lichens. The mechanism of action of polyketides against lichenized lichens was also investigated. The effects of polyketides were evaluated against four L. ochroides clinical strains.


## Introduction
The . neoformans and C. gattii species complexes have been recognized as distinct species complexes based on their clinical and environmental characteristics, and are grouped into four major species complexes: Cryptococcus neoformans complex, Cryptococcus gattii complex, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii species complex. The C. gattii species complex was first recognized in 1999 by the first molecular pathogen molecular typing laboratory, Dictyostelium discoideum (2), which is based on the species C. gattii. Cryptococcus neoformans is the major cause of opportunistic infection in AIDS patients (3). The C. gattii species complex was found in the environment and has been isolated from a variety of plant hosts, including mango, cyano, citrus, grapefruit, oak, and cv. brucellosis (4, 5).

The Cryptococcus neoformans complex is characterized by its ability to cause meningoencephalitis, which is common among immunocompromised patients, especially those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (6). C. neoformans is also capable of replicating in the murine lung, where the yeast can be inhaled and be cleared from the lungs (7). In the host, the yeast establishes a pulmonary infection, which results in severe morbidity and mortality. In contrast, C. gattii is known to infect immunocompromised patients, where the yeast forms in the lung is cleared from the brain and disseminated to the brain (8). However, Cryptococcus neoformans can still cause meningoencephalitis in the immunocompromised patient, and Cryptococcus gattii is the only species that can cause disease in humans (9).

C. neoformans is found ubiquitously in the environment and on decaying vegetation, decaying wood, and plant debris (10). Infection with the C. neoformans complex is initiated by inhalation of infectious particles, such as yeast cells, which can then be released into the air. The yeast can be found in soil, pigeon droppings, and decaying wood, and can cause infections in healthy individuals or even in immunocompromised individuals (11).


## Methods
mellonella (Sections 214-223) were downloaded from GenBank (accession n. NM_013654). Nucleotide sequences of G. mellonella (Sections 419-475) were obtained from GenBank (accession no. NM_0204630). These nucleotide sequences were used in a comparative analysis using GenBank (accession no. NM_013654). The alignments were conducted using CLUSTALW version 3.1.9 [17]. The results of alignments were visually inspected with the aid of T-INS-i software [18].

Two markers of the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis were identified as the PI-1 and the ROS-1 marker of G. mellonella (Figure 1). The PI-1 marker was identified as H. sapiens strain JH16-a (Figure 1). The ROS-1 marker was identified as G. mellonella strain JH16-a (Figure 1).

Susceptibility to cell wall inhibitors
The cell wall inhibitor ABTS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as positive control. The OD_450nm was measured at the wavelength of 570 nm. The cell wall inhibitor dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as positive control. The cells were stained with 0.01% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the cell wall inhibitor dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as positive control. The IC_50 values were calculated using a 5% solution of dimethyl sulfoxide. The MIC values were determined in the same manner. The cell wall inhibitor dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as positive control. The incubation time for the cells was 1 hour.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Cells were treated with 2% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100.


## Results
A further advantage of the dual use of Fungal-animal interactions is that it allowed us to identify features of host immune status in the host, identifying the immunosuppressive properties of the host immune syste. To achieve this, we aimed to identify mechanisms that might lead to the immunosuppressive effects of Fungal-animal interactions.

The Human Immune System Is Important for Fungal Pathogenicity
The human immune system plays an important role in the pathogenicity of Fungi, which can affect the immune system and inflammatory response (10). To assess the immune status of the host during fungal infection, we used the intranasal inoculation model of F. graminearum infection and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral infection (see Material and Methods). As shown in Figure 2, an increase in the frequency of the low frequency (LF) was observed in the L. donovani L. donovani HIV infection group, whereas the frequency of the high frequency (HIV-1) was higher in the L. donovani HIV infection group. The L. donovani HIV infection group was also the most sensitive group to the L. donovani HIV infection group, but the HIV infection group had the highest frequency of the low frequency (LF) in the L. donovani HIV infection group. The L. donovani HIV infection group also had the highest frequency of the low frequency (LF) in the L. donovani HIV infection group.

To test whether the L. donovani HIV infection group was different from the L. donovani HIV infection group, we used the L. donovani HIV infection group and the L. donovani HIV infection group, and we observed the frequency of the L. donovani HIV infection group to be higher in the L. donovani HIV infection group. As shown in Figure 2, the L. donovani HIV infection group was the most sensitive group to the L. donovani HIV infection group, and the L. donovani HIV infection group was the most sensitive group to the L. donovani HIV infection group.


## Discussion
 2009. This study has also provided important insights into the biology of hybrid Cryptococcus neoformans, as well as the role of environmental adaptation in the evolution and distribution of this species. The results presented here demonstrate that there is a high level of genetic diversity within the strain CGMCC 6258, which is genetically isolated from individuals of a protected area in Northern California. In addition, genetic data from the genetic marker collection collected from the same location provided additional evidence that CGMCC 6258 has the potential to be used as a strain reference for molecular identification of Cryptococcus species and therefore warrants a whole genome shotgun sequencing of this strain.

The genome of CGMCC 6258 was assembled into one contig followed by four gene locations in each contig. Although the assembly of this contig required seven additional gene copies for each gene, the assembly of this contig resulted in four genes and six additional genes, which are all identical to coding genes from the original draft genome assembly. These results provide further evidence that CGMCC 6258 has the potential to be used as a strain reference for molecular identification of Cryptococcus species and thus warrants a whole genome shotgun sequencing of this strain.

The result from this study clearly establishes that CGMCC 6258 has the potential to be used as a strain reference for molecular identification of Cryptococcus species. This study provides some experimental support for the hypothesis that CGMCC 6258 is a strain with potential for use in a biological screening for Cryptococcus species. The genetic data generated in this study provides further evidence that CGMCC 6258 is a strain with potential for use in a biological screening for Cryptococcus species. The results presented here are consistent with previous work on CGMCC 6258 (Wang et al., 2013).

The initial work with CGMCC 6258 was performed in culture. This initial report showed that this strain is a strain of CGMCC 6258 and therefore may have been misidentified as CGMCC 6258. The first molecular identification of CGMCC 6258 was performed using a sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the presence of a spliced allele in the rpb2 gene of CGMCC 6258. This result indicated that this strain has the potential for use as a reference for Cryptococcus species identification. The second molecular identification was performed using a sequencing analysis of the fungal DNA.
