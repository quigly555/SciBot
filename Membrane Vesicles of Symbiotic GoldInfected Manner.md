## Abstract
Trichosporon asahii is the main pathogen responsible for the white-opaque Trichosporonosis (T. asahii) disease, which results in significant mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The rapid occurrence of T. asahii infection makes it important to find new molecular targets for antifungal drug development. Previously we reported that the T. asahii lipopolysaccharide pathway and its ligands can be targeted for the antifungal drug target-encoding T. asahii genome assembly. Here we report on the genome assembly and annotation of the T. asahii orthologues. The genome sequence includes nearly 19 Mbp of additional sequence that encodes 2733 amino acids of which only 12% contain functional homologies of orthologues previously described. These data suggest that genome-wide gene annotation is a powerful tool to define the functions of important loci and will provide additional impetus to complete the major goals of our study: the identification of T. asahii genes that may be used in drug design.

Complex networks are essential components of multicellular organisms. However, to our knowledge, have not been fully explored in the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and thus the identification of essential genes is of major importance. Here we report the genome assembly and annotation of T. asahii orthologues.

3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?

The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data-e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party-those must be specified.

4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

PLOS has the following guidelines for presenting scientific articles written in standard English: Standard English Checklist (SAC; http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/whole_article_prepare? journalKeyword=PLOSOne) and the PLOS Annual Shoal Project Report (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/whole_article_prepare? journalKeyword=PLOSOne).


## Methods
 2014. Briefly, mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups (Mice with C. neoformans var. neoformans, Mice with C. gattii, and Mice with C. neoformans var. neoformans var. grubii) and were infected with 10^4 C. gattii (determined by CFU/mL) by the intranasal route. The mice were sacrificed after sacrifice, and their blood was collected by cardiac puncture with a sterile needle. The liver and kidneys were removed, weighed, and homogenized with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the end of each experiment. The homogenate was centrifuged at the speed of 800×g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The amount of C. gattii in the supernatants was determined by measuring the amount of viable bacteria in the supernatants using the MTT assay.

Infection and Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing
The assay of antimicrobial activity was performed as previously described (Chen et al., 2011). Briefly, C. gattii was incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the fungal cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium. The bacteria were then diluted 10^3-10^5 in RPMI-1640 medium and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the bacteria were diluted 10^3-10^2 in PBS, and the MICs were determined by plating serial two-fold dilutions of the suspension on SDA plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h.

The inhibitory effect of the microorganisms was determined by determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the microorganisms (Chen et al., 2011). The MICs of the microorganisms were determined by plating serial two-fold dilutions of the suspension on SDA plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the bacterial suspension was diluted in RPMI-1640 medium, and the lowest concentration of the microorganisms that inhibited growth were determined by serial two-fold dilutions of the suspension.

## Discussion
In addition, the . albicans RAS mutant exhibits growth defects in both infected and non-infected mannitol-producing cells. RAS is essential for growth and development of the yeast in which the mannitol-producing fungus is exposed. We hypothesize that the reduced growth of RAS mutant in infected mannitol-producing cells represents a consequence of the loss of RAS function. As the RAS function is essential for fungal survival and growth, we hypothesized that RAS expression might be regulated by the fungus. We found that RAS expression was decreased in mannitol-producing cells, which was consistent with previous observations in C. albicans and C. neoformans (11). In addition, we found that RAS expression in infected mannitol-producing cells was decreased, but not completely, in non-infected cells. The data showed that RAS expression was decreased in non-infected cells, suggesting that RAS could play a role in fungal pathogenicity. The fact that C. albicans RAS expression was decreased in non-infected cells, which was consistent with previous findings in C. neoformans (11), suggests that RAS might play a role in fungal pathogenicity in C. albicans. The decreased RAS expression in non-infected cells suggests that RAS might be a target for antifungal therapy in C. albicans. We also found that C. albicans RAS expression was decreased in infected cells. This result suggested that RAS might be a target for antifungal therapy in C. albicans. However, C. albicans RAS expression was increased in non-infected cells, which is consistent with previous studies in C. neoformans (11).

C. albicans, like S. cerevisiae, is a commensal fungus that grows inside and inside of infected tissues, which leads to the production of antifungal drug, fluconazole. In this study, we found that C. albicans RAS was decreased in infected mannitol-producing cells. The data suggested that RAS might be a target for antifungal therapy in C. albicans.
