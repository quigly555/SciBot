## Abstract
Fungal infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with time-consuming and often unnecessary procedures such as invasive procedures, corticosteroids, and skin grafts. The progress made in preventing and managing fungal infections needs to be made aware of this aspect, as it can impact both patients and providers. The detection of fungal pathogens in these infections and the evaluation of their susceptibility are important to make the right diagnosis and to reduce the mortality associated with fungal infections. This article provides an up-to-date review of the current status of antifungal drug resistance in fungi. We discuss the challenges in finding and using the most resistant species, the best methods to overcome these challenges, and the latest advancements in the treatment of these infections.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast pathogen which causes fatal infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals [1]. The organism has been reported to cause a variety of diseases, including meningoencephalitis, cerebral cryptococcosis, pulmonary cryptococcosis, acute disseminated cryptococcosis, and pneumonia. The development of disease is predominantly a consequence of immune deficiencies of the host innate immune system [2]. The pathogenesis of cryptococcal infections can be divided into two types: the admissibility of the organism in the organism's tissues and the immunodeficiency in the host innate immune system [3]. The innate immune system is composed of macrophages and neutrophils. Macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infections, as they release cytokines that promote the activation of the immune system [4]. The host innate immune system is characterized by macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells [5]. The innate immune system is also composed of dendritic cells (DCs) and microglia. Mouse macrophages are characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [6]. The role of macrophages in the innate immune system is related to the immunological status of the infected mouse.


## Methods
The U-cellular fraction was adjusted to .0 mg/mL and used for the assay, which contained a p-value of 0.05. All assays were performed in triplicate. The U-cellular fraction of the assay tube contained 0.2 mg/mL of p-glycoprotein and 0.2 mg/mL of the soluble fraction, which contained 0.25 mg/mL of p-glycoprotein and 1.0 mg/mL of the soluble fraction. The assay tubes were incubated at 30°C for 30 min and absorbance of the urea-sugar solution was measured at 440 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices).

2.3. Intracellular SDS Analysis
The intracellular staining of C. albifoxi with different concentrations of the d-galactosidase was performed as described previously [18]. Briefly, cells were stained with calcein-AM (1 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. After the incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and washed three times with PBS. The supernatant was collected and further incubated with 0.4% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C.

2.4. Quantification of the Inducible Protease Activity
The total activity of the d-galactosidase was determined by the method described previously [19]. Briefly, the enzyme reaction mixture contained 0.1 mL of the pre-diluted 2-fold serial dilutions of the l-lysine substrate, 0.1 mL of the 1.0-mg/mL of p-glycoprotein, and 1.0 mL of PBS. The reaction was performed in a total volume of 200 µL, containing 0.1 mL of l-lysine substrate, 0.2 mL of 0.02% SDS, and 0.2 mL of 1.0-mg/mL of p-glycoprotein.


## Results
Inhibition was carried out by incubating cells with . marneffei and L. albifoxi, respectively, at 25, 45, and 60 min. K. marneffei inhibited the growth of all strains and L. albifoxi was not inhibited (Figure 5A). Similarly, inhibition of the growth of S. marneffei and S. marneffei of L. albifoxi were not synergistic and inhibited the growth of all strains and S. marneffei was not inhibited (Figure 5B).

In vivo antifungal susceptibility testing of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei strains
In order to evaluate the antifungal potential of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei in vivo, the susceptibility of each strain was evaluated in the liver and spleen. No significant difference was observed in the susceptibility of the two strains. In contrast, susceptibility of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei was higher in the liver (Table 3). All of the strains showed increased sensitivity in the liver compared to the spleen.

In vitro antifungal activity of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei strains
In vitro antifungal activity of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei was evaluated by the colony counts and the MIC values of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei were compared. No differences were observed in the ability of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa.

In vitro antifungal activity of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei strains
The MIC values of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei against P. aeruginosa and P. aeruginosa typhimurium were compared by a checkerboard assay. The MIC values of L. amazonensis and L. marneffei were similar to each other. L. amazonensis and L. marneffei showed a higher MIC value for P. aeruginosa and a lower MIC value for P. aeruginosa compared to P. typhimurium.

## Discussion
The following discussion is focused on the potential of the present study to demonstrate the efficacy of the oral and oral lavage regimens of S. sclerotiorum against S. brasiliensis, S. epidermidis and S. aureus in a systemic infection model.

The results of the combined treatment with MRSV and 2 mg/kg of S. sclerotiorum resulted in successful control of candidiasis in infected mice.
