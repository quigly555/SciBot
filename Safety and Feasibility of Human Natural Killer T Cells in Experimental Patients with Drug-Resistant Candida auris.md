## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection of wide geographic distribution. Worldwide, over one million cases of cutaneous sporotrichosis are reported. Here we report a case of cutaneous sporotrichosis in a 40-year-old man with hemophagocytosis and diffuse large cell lymphoma. The patient presented with a three-week history of nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath for which he was sent to have a biopsy performed. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5-mm-sized peritaemolar tissue mass 20 cm in diameter. A biopsy of the lesion revealed a mild granulomatous sporotrichosis. The patient had a favorable prognosis for disseminated sporotrichosis. Although cutaneous sporotrichosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients, the diagnosis of this disease is usually delayed because the lack of specificity of the phenotypes can lead to delayed diagnosis of disseminated or subcutaneous infections. Thus, the case serves to illustrate the importance of recognizing cutaneous sporotrichosis as an important clinical problem in organ transplantation and provides information about managing this severe condition.

A 40-year-old Greek man had an outstanding one-month history of nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.


## Introduction
Fungi are of great interest in recent years as a source of bioactive molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. Candida species are commonly found in the hospital environment and are exposed to a broad spectrum of infections, including invasive, disseminated, and non-invasive fungal infections (1, 2). In some cases, Candida species can be isolated from the environment as pathogens or commensals, and in others, the organism is not isolated from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract (3, 4).


## Methods
All animal studies were performed in accordance with the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Healt. The animal studies were approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kaohsiung Medical College.

Primary efficacy and secondary efficacy studies
Primary efficacy studies were performed using the “Evaluation of Effect of Purity of Infected Conidia” (PAL) assay (Sangon). Three strains of Candida albicans (C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. glabrata ATCC 90028) were tested and compared with the control (n = 10). Purity of infection was defined as a decrease in turbidity in comparison to that of the control. The samples were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. After the addition of 1 mL of 1% w/v potassium ferricyanide (KF) solution, the optical density at 570 nm was measured with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The secondary efficacy of the assay was evaluated using the “Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA”) assay (Sangon). Three samples of Candida albicans (C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. glabrata ATCC 90028, and C. auris ATCC 62290) were tested. The fluorescence of the samples was measured using an ELISA reader (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The fluorescence in the control group was also assessed with the ELISA, as previously described (Guo et al., 2015).

Fluorescence of the microorganism (Candida albicans ATCC 90028) was also analyzed using a microplate reader (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).


## Results
In order to determine whether treatment with human killer cells could produce clinically relevant responses, we first determined the ability of human TL cells to kill . albicans and C. neoformans in vitro. We did not observe any significant differences in the fungal burden in the lungs of TL-challenged mice, nor in the brains of TL-challenged mice, even when TL cells were cultured at a dose of 0.1 µg/ml. The intracellular killing capacity of human TL cells was also low, and in the brains of TL-challenged mice the intracellular killing capacity was 3-fold lower than that of control mice.

Hemolysis of Human TL Cells with T. reesei L.A. Infection
We first assessed the effect of human TL cells on hemolysis of C. albicans. We measured the hemolytic index (HIG) and the percentage of total and free hemolymph of all human TL cells cultured in vitro. The HIG was significantly higher in TL-challenged mice than that in control mice. The HIG of the TL-challenged mouse was 1.9 (1.8-2.0) × 10^-6, and the HIG of the control mouse was 1.5 (1.6-2.0) × 10^-6. In the experiments described above, the HIG of the TL-challenged mouse was 2.0 (1.0-2.5) × 10^-6, but the HIG of the control mouse was 2.5 (1.5-3.0) × 10^-6.

Hemolysis of Human TL Cells with T. reesei L.A. Infection
Our next aim was to determine whether the inhibitory activity of human TL cells on human T cell-challenged patients with drug-resistant Candida auris could be attributed to the recognition of the antifungal activity of human TL cells. We performed in vitro inhibition assays using a combination of 10 µg/ml of DPPH or DIP-uPA. The concentrations of DPPH and DIP-uPA were tested against TL cells.


## Discussion
albicans on . auris pathogenicity using cell wall proteins (CLPP1, CCLPP2, and CCLPP3) and cell surface proteins (CLPP1, CCLPP2, and CCLPP3). Our previous studies on C. auris pathogenicity have been conducted in vitro using human cells with the use of oligo- and polyacrylamide (PA) antibody. In the initial murine infection, only the cell wall proteases CCLPP1, CCLPP2, and CCLPP3 were able to activate the cell wall protease-encoding genes, and the PAB-expressing cells were able to kill C. albicans cells. However, after the PAB-polarized PEP-pulsed immunoglobulins were injected into the infected mice, only PEP-polarized immunoglobulins (LIPI, LIPI-II, and LIPI-III) were able to induce the expression of C. auris pathogenicity genes (Fig 3). We demonstrated that the expression of C. auris pathogenicity genes was induced in C. albicans by exposure to LIPI, LIPI-II, and LIPI-III. Moreover, C. auris genes were upregulated in the presence of LIPI, LIPI-III, and LIPI-IV (Fig 3). However, after LIPI, LIPI-III, and LIPI-IV, expression of C. auris pathogenicity genes was downregulated (Fig 3). In contrast, C. albicans genes were induced in the presence of LIPI, LIPI-II, and LIPI-III (Fig 3). The results of our previous study indicated that the expression of C. auris pathogenicity genes was upregulated in the presence of LIPI, LIPI-II, and LIPI-III (Fig 3). Therefore, it is possible that the expression of C. auris pathogenicity genes is induced by exposure to LIPI, LIPI-II, and LIPI-III.
