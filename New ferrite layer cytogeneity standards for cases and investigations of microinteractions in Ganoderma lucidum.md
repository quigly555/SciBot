## Abstract
The genus Trichosporon includes important plant pathogens, endophytes, and opportunistic pathogens of humans, animals, and plants.


## Introduction
Although the development of antifungal drugs has been relatively rapid, resistance to many antifungals is still a major problem [1, 2]. These problems arise from two main factors: drug toxicity, which can cause a limited therapeutic effect, and the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms. The treatment of fungal infections has been largely based on the use of amphotericin B-based drugs, which possess low toxicity and minimal drug-drug interactions [3-5]. However, drug-resistant microorganisms are also encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU) [6]. It is very important to prevent life-threatening invasive fungal infections, and to treat patients with invasive fungal infections. In addition, the development of new antifungal drugs and the high costs associated with the production of the drug are major factors that limit the economic and clinical use of some of the most promising antifungals [7, 8]. Therefore, new approaches to prevent and treat fungal infections are urgently needed.

Phenotypic and phenotypic analyses are the gold standard for the interpretation of phenotypic and phenotypic data [9-11]. The phenotypic analysis of chemical structures, especially in the case of organic compounds, is the gold standard for the interpretation of phenotypic data [12]. However, the phenotypic analysis of chemical structures and biochemical characterization of biological molecules has been relatively limited. Phenotypic and phenotypic methods that can detect phenotypic differences between fungi and bacteria are necessary for the protection of their organisms.

Melanins are pigments that are formed by the oxidation of phenolic compounds to carbon compounds.


## Methods

.4. Cell Lines and Bacteria
Aspergillus niger (ATCC 32066), Penicillium citraticum (ATCC 39032), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90112), Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 29212), Aspergillus niger and S. cerevisiae (ATCC 90112) were grown at 37°C in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 200 g for 3 days. These organisms were then subcultured onto blood agar (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 2-3 days. Yeast cells were purified using a standard method [40]. Bacterial cultures were prepared by inoculating an equal volume of tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich) with a cell suspension of 5 × 10^6 CFU/ml. Bacterial cultures were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and were then adjusted to a concentration of 5 × 10^5 CFU/ml. These bacterial cultures were then subcultured onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The same procedure was followed for other bacterial cultures.

2.5. Cell Lines and Bacteria
C. neoformans were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich). To perform cell lines, in order to eliminate any potential transporters, 1 mL of a freshly prepared stock culture was added to each well of a 24 well plate (Nunc) and cultured at 37°C. The cells were counted and adjusted to the appropriate density in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). All cultures were performed in a humidified incubator at 37°C. After 48 h of culture, cell numbers were determined by counting the number of CFU and the number of yeast cells that were stained with India ink.

2.6. Lipid Content
Lipid content was determined using the formula as previously described [41]. Briefly, 10^7/ml culture of C.


## Results
. Clinical Characteristics
The results of the study population were categorized into six groups according to the type of clinical conditions. A total of 462 patients were enrolled. A total of 104 (23%) patients presented with multiple cryptococcal infections. The median age was 50 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21-54), with 34 (12%) patients being men. The median duration of the study was 16 months (IQR 6-17). The median time to the initiation of antifungal therapy was 4.8 months (IQR 1.4-6.2). The most common underlying conditions were diabetes mellitus (n = 122, 54%), HIV infection (n = 87, 22%), and cryptococcal meningitis (n = 33, 21%). The most common underlying conditions in patients with other conditions are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Susceptibility of Patients to the Antifungal Treatment
The median duration of follow-up was 33 months (IQR 9-56) with a median duration of 3.7 years (IQR 2.3-7.5). The most common underlying conditions in patients with other conditions are shown in Table 2. Patients with multiple cryptococcal infections presented with an increased risk of disseminated cryptococcal infection (3.5 times, 11.4% vs. 2.1 times, 23.9% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.001).


## Discussion
As previously described [30], . glabrata was isolated from the soil of São Gonçalo dos Santos [31]. In addition to those species identified as E. dermatitidis, other species of C. glabrata, such as S. reilianum, C. lusitaniae and C. glabrata, were also found to be present in the soil of the Piauí State of Brazil [32], [33]. In this context, C. glabrata was also identified as a member of the C. lusitaniae group [31].

The glycoside hydrolase family 6 (Gly6) is a family of genes involved in the hydrolase and glycosylation of the glycoside bond of the aromatic ring [34]. Gly6 is a large family of genes encoding the enzymes in glycosylation and hydrolase. Gly6 is a glycosyltransferase family (GT) of enzymes, which is involved in the glycosylation of the glycoside bond of the aromatic ring [35]. Gly6 is also a family of hydrolase enzymes, which are involved in the glycosylation of the glycoside bond of the aromatic ring [36]. The family of glycosyltransferases was also identified in the P. lucidum genome (Figure 2).

The first step in the glycosylation of the glycoside bond of the aromatic ring was glycosidic acid synthase (GAS), which is a glycosyltransferase of the ß-oxidation of ß-oxidation substrates. GAS is a cysteine-rich, highly conserved protein family of proteins, which is involved in the transfer of substrates from ß-oxidation to the hydroxylation of ß-oxidation substrates [37]. The first step of the glycosylation of the glycoside bond was glycosidic acid synthase (GAS), which is a cysteine-rich, highly conserved protein family of proteins, which is involved in the transfer of substrates from ß-oxidation to the hydroxylation of ß-oxidation substrates [37].
