## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis, also known as Waldo's caliber malignancy, is an unusual hematological presentation. It usually starts as a pericardial nodule or mass and progress into a lung mass that was 1 cm in diameter at the time of diagnosis. Due to the severity of the lung mass and the lack of a bronchial placement at the time of diagnosis, it is necessary to initiate diagnostic thoracoscopic embolization procedures to begin the treatment. However, biopsy of the central nervous system (CNS) and computed tomography (CT) images of the lung lesions have shown that pulmonary cryptococcosis has only been described as a single mass. The presentation of the chest and the complications associated with the operation have not been described.

We report a case of a 61-year-old man with a rapidly progressing history of subacute lung cancer and a poorly controlled histological process complicated by the presence of biopsy, histopathology, and treatment of inflammation.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (Rezende et al. 2016). IFIs are a common manifestation of cancer, inflammatory diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, and their incidence has increased over the past several decades due to the development of immunosuppressive regimens. This increased incidence is attributed to an increase in the frequency of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, the emergence of organ transplantations, and the use of immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disorders.

One of the most significant risk factors for the development of IFI is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have shown a potent antifungal activity against a wide range of fungi and can act as a second messenger in the biofilm environment. The inhibition of C. albicans and C. tropicalis biofilm growth can inhibit growth of filamentous fungi such as C. glabrata and C. krusei, and also can increase virulence of Candida and Cryptococcus spp. (Seider et al. 2016).

Fungi can live both in self-incompatibility and in the presence of extracellular pathogens (Domsch et al. 2010). The natural biofilm system is an important factor that enables cells to survive under a wide range of environmental conditions. It is a complex structure consisting of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular matrix (Steenkamp et al. 2008). The cell wall is the major organelle in the cell cycle, and is essential for the viability of fungi and their survival in the environment.

The cell wall is composed of three interconnected components: an inner layer, comprised of chitin, glucans, and proteins, and a high-mobility extracellular matrix (EMI).


## Methods
. The animal studies were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Navarisco (UNA) and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Federal University of Navarisco (UNA). The experiments were performed under protocols approved by the UNA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). In addition, the genotypic analysis was performed on Candida dubliniensis. The diagnostic fungal burden of Candida species in the bronchoalveolar lavage was assessed by the broth microdilution method. In the quantification of the CFU, the dilution method was used to determine the viable counts and the CFU/mL was considered the endpoint for this analysis. The results were interpreted according to the “Exact method” of the CLSI M27-A2 guidelines, which are based on the method of Dunnett and Muench [36] and the method of Bartlett [37]. The interpretation of the results of the assays was approved by the UNA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Navarisco (UNA).

Ethical statement
The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Navarisco (UNA/REC/AU/PRA/3). The animal experiments were performed in a separate laboratory (UNA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) and in accordance with the ethics of the research committee of the University of Navarisco (UNA/REC/AU/PRA/3).

Fungal identification
The fungal isolates were identified using the culture method. The species name and species identification were recorded as described by the document “Manual of the National Center for Biotechnology Information” (NCBI). The identification of the isolates was done using the fungal culture method.

Plant collection
The soil samples of P. nordicum were collected in April 2008 from Mulago City, Visayan Province, Sri Lanka. The samples were collected from four different plants: P. nordicum CMA-01 (pH 6.0), P. nordicum CMA-02 (pH 7.0) and P.


## Results
Diversity and distribution of the filamentous fungi
The total number of fungal strains isolated from the skin, blood, and urine samples of 15 individuals (0.5% of the total) was low (Table 2). The number of filamentous fungi isolated from blood and urine samples was very similar, ranging from 1.3×10^5 CFU/ml (Table 2) to 2.5×10^5 CFU/ml (Table 2) and from 1.6×10^5 CFU/ml (Table 2) to 1.5×10^6 CFU/ml (Table 3). The most common species were Aspergillus sp., Aspergillus sp. A-2, and Aspergillus sp.
