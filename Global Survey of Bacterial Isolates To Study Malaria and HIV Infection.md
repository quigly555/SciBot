## Abstract

The study was a cross-sectional survey carried out in Kampala, Uganda, investigating the prevalence of Malaria and HIV in a community hospitalised populatio. Data was collected through interviews of medical staff and patient records in the first year of the study, October 2012 to March 2014. All Malaria cases were reported to the national hospital in affected communities. Characteristics of Malaria cases and results from the interviews with the respondents are presented.

A total of 380 patients were interviewed. The mean age of the study participants was 44.2±8.1years. Fifty percent (373/377) were males. The proportion of males was significantly lower (46.8% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001). Fifty percent (296/377) of the patients were immunocompromised, and 70% (247/377) were not using any anti-malarial medications. Malaria cases were more likely to be from HIV/AIDS (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4-5.3) and from other causes (OR 8.3, 95% CI: 1.5-19.7). Patients without evidence of disease were more likely to have fever (OR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.7-9.1) and to have meningitis (OR 8.4, 95% CI: 1.9-31.6).

Malaria was more prevalent in the first year of the study compared with the second year. Malaria was associated with poorer prognosis, lower CD4 counts, and higher odds of death in HIV/AIDS patients. The high prevalence of Malaria among HIV/AIDS patients can be explained by the need to treat this disease more aggressively.

Malaria is a significant contributor to HIV transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa. Africa accounts for one in five Malaria cases. We sought to determine factors associated with the development of this disease and to characterize the epidemiology.

We used data from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2012 data to investigate demographic and risk factors of Malaria cases in Uganda. We used case-based surveillance to compare the frequency of development of Malaria and HIV disease. We also conducted secondary data-analysis to evaluate the extent of the risk.

187 patients developed Malaria from January to March 2011. The incidence was 30.6% in the period. HIV seroprevalence was =30.


## Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells are CD4^+ T-cell-deficient mice, which have been used as models to study immune responses to various infectious and non-infectious diseases [1,2,3]. However, the role of NK cells in innate immune responses to viral infections is still not well defined. Indeed, there are no data about the role of NK cells in the host defense against viral infection. Here we describe a rare case of a premature murine infantile immunodeficiency syndrome (NIS) model of NIS, with a severe case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) without NK cell depletion.


## Methods
In the first year, 68% of the patients who reported to be HIV positive were referred to the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS), whereas in the second year, 60% of the patients were referred to NCH. In the third year, the NCHS had an additional 18,938 cases of HIV infection, and 36% of the patients were referred to NCHS.

In 2015, the number of HIV infections in Africa increased by 39% compared to the previous year and 34% compared to the previous year. In 2016, the country was divided into two parts: the south and the west. The south is mainly characterized by the malaria endemicity, and the west is characterized by the higher incidence of the other diseases. The difference in the HIV incidence between the two regions was calculated as follows: HIV incidence per population divided by total population.

2.2. Definitions
We used the following definitions for the term “clinical and/or epidemiological”: a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of HIV based on WHO-STUDY criteria [19], a patient with a suspected HIV infection based on the WHO-STUDY criteria [20] or a patient with a seroconversion based on the WHO-STUDY criteria [21] or a patient with a positive test for HIV based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [22] or a patient with a positive CSF India-Korea Cryptococcal antigen (ICC) assay [23].

2.3. Definitions
The following definitions were used: “A suspected HIV infection” was defined as the diagnosis based on a chest radiographic chart or if the patient required hospital treatment due to viral infection, as the diagnosis based on a CSF or radiological chart, or a patient with a positive CSF India-Korea Cryptococcal antigen (ICC) assay, which is known to be the most common infection of HIV patients [24].

2.4. Definitions
“A suspected encephalitis” was defined as the diagnosis based on a CSF pleural fluid ( pleural fluid) smear or in the CSF with a positive CSF India-Korea Cryptococcal antigen (ICC) assay [25].

## Results
.A. (NCCLS) were used to predict whether the presence of microorganisms in food or beverages would impact on the development of malaria and HIV infection. Table 2 shows the results of this study.

Table 3 summarizes the results of the study for the different types of microorganisms found in the food and beverages.

The prevalence of bacteria in food and beverages is higher in men than women
A large proportion of all bacteria were detected in the blood of men (42.7% in the study, and 24.6% in the group with different gender). However, the prevalence was not higher in women than men.

A study in Kenya revealed that in 2015, there were 21,839 cases of malaria in the entire country, and one case in 2014. More than half of the cases (23.5%) were from rural areas. The prevalence of bacteria in food was higher in men than women (24.4% in the study, and 24.7% in the group with different gender). However, the prevalence of bacteria in beverage was higher in men than women (28.3% in the study, and 29.4% in the group with different gender).

The prevalence of bacteria in women was higher than men in 2015
The prevalence of bacteria in women was higher in 2015 than in 2014 (23.2% vs. 11.9%, respectively) (Table 4). In 2016, the prevalence of bacteria in women was higher than men in 2014 (21.5% vs. 11.3%, respectively). In 2015, the prevalence of bacteria in women was higher in 2015 than in 2014 (24.2% vs. 12.3%, respectively).

A study in Ethiopia demonstrated that in 2016, there were 49,624 cases of microorganisms in the blood, including men (40.8%) and women (20.6%). The prevalence of bacteria in women was higher in 2016 than in 2015 (27.7% vs. 8.5%, respectively) (Table 4).

Table 5 summarizes the prevalence of bacteria in food and beverages.

The prevalence of bacteria in men is higher in women than men in 2014
The prevalence of bacteria in men was higher in 2014 than in 2015 (24.6% vs. 12.3%, respectively) (Table 5). The prevalence of bacteria in women was higher in 2014 than in 2015 (23.


## Discussion
fumigatus and . amyloliquefaciens genomes. The reads were also from the A. fumigatus genome (27, 27). The remaining reads were from the B. amyloliquefaciens genome, which contained the most reads (26, 29). The fungal reads were most similar to bacteria from other kingdoms such as Eukaryotes, Archaea, and Plants (28). However, the fungal reads were different from bacteria from other kingdoms such as Plants, Archaea, and Viridiplantae (29, 30). We also found that the A. fumigatus genome contained a large number of genes, which was not surprising because A. fumigatus is a plant pathogen and that a number of fungal genomes are similar to those from other kingdoms (29, 30). It is likely that the differences in fungal reads between A. fumigatus and other plant pathogenic fungi could be due to the different cultivation conditions of A. fumigatus. However, the A. fumigatus genome contained the most genes, which were not similar to bacterial genomes (27).

The similarity in A. fumigatus reads between bacterial and fungal genomes could be due to differences in fungal and bacterial metabolism. The fungal reads were more similar to bacterial reads from the same kingdom (26), as the A. fumigatus genome contained the largest number of genes (30). However, the bacterial reads were more similar to bacterial reads from the same kingdom (28). We also found that the A. fumigatus genome contained the largest number of genes (30), which was not surprising because A. fumigatus is a plant pathogen and that a number of fungal genomes are similar to those from other kingdoms (29, 30).

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the A. fumigatus genome contained the largest number of genes (30), which was not surprising because A. fumigatus is a plant pathogen and that a number of fungal genomes are similar to those from other kingdoms (29, 30). The comparison of the A. fumigatus genome between the two kingdoms, although the same number of genes, was not surprising because A. fumigatus is a plant pathogen. However, the comparison between the genomes of the two kingdoms was not surprising because the A.
