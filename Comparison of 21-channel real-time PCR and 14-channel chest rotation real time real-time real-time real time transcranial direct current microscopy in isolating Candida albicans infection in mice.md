## Abstract
The calcineurin pathway is a conserved group of proteins that are essential for growth of a variety of diverse organisms, including fungi. Calcineurin A (CaN) is calcineurin-rich proteins that fold like self inactivating elements but are capable of activating many more protein-rich target proteins. In addition to conserved protein kinases, CaN also has a variety of other machinery functions, including catabolism, meiosis, and localization. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in understanding the CaN-related machinery and system functions that have contributed to define the molecular genetic structure of the filamentous fungi that are found throughout the world. CaN is still largely unknown to basic species about its biological activities, and we highlight its potential as a model system for the study of fungal virulence mechanisms.


## Introduction
The human body harbors a vast array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and microalgae. The large diversity of microorganisms and their metabolic properties makes it a key step for studying the interactions among these microorganisms and their host cells. The two main groups of microbes are yeasts and molds (both taxa and species) that inhabit the human body. Many yeasts are opportunistic pathogens that cause infection in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV infection, cancer, leukemia, and chronic wounds, or those undergoing organ transplantation [1]. Other yeasts and molds are parasitic, which cause chronic infections in the host that are often fatal. For example, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans are associated with outbreaks in the immunocompromised, and the etiology is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the respiratory tract to disseminated infections [2]. A similar pathogenic pattern is observed in other yeasts, such as Debaryomyces hansenii, and Cryptococcus gattii, which are known to cause infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV infection or in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation [3].

The yeast/molecular type diversity is important for understanding how yeasts and molds contribute to disease. Yeast species generally colonize healthy individuals, but can cause disease in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplant patients, and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Yeast infections are also known to affect immunocompromised individuals, such as those with sarcoidosis, cancer, and organ transplants [4].

The C. albicans complex is comprised of four distinct species, C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. C. albicans species are common in the environment and can cause candidiasis [5]. In healthy individuals, C. albicans can grow as a commensal and in the gastrointestinal tract, as an opportunistic pathogen, or as a saprophyte, a pathogen that causes both mucosal and systemic infections [6]. C. albicans infections are usually asymptomatic and can be cleared by the host immune system. However, patients infected with C.


## Methods
Fungal strains
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The growth of the fungal isolates was carried out in 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C and 200 rpm in a temperature-controlled incubator (Cambrex).

Preparation of antifungal drugs
Antifungal drugs (e.g. fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, and voriconazole) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.3% in sterile distilled water, and then diluted with DMSO to the concentration of 0.03% in order to obtain an effective concentration of 1.0-10 µg/ml. The stock solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions in distilled water and poured on a YPD plate.

## Discussion
Skeletal organization and organization of scaffold II in an eukaryotic cell
In the eukaryotic cell, scaffold II is a scaffold composed of a C-terminal sequence with a conserved amino acid motif and is characterized by the presence of three heptahedral- and arginine-termini (Fig 1). The C-terminal amino acid motif is located in the first amino acid of scaffold II and the arginine-termini are adjacent to the C-terminal sequence of the conserved motif.
