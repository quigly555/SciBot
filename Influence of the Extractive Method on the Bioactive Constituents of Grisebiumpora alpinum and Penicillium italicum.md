## Abstract
The action of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies in the circulation has been the subject of several studies, which have implied that HIV antibodies inhibit HIV immune responses. This conclusion was verified in a HIV-negative patient with a spontaneous HIV infection, in a subcutaneous lesion, in a subcutaneous lesion, and in a lung mass, which were negative for HIV antibodies. In another HIV-negative patient, the herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV) antigen was negative in the serum and in the spleen. The HSV antigen was positive in the brain mass and in the lung mass.

The mechanism of the negative HSV antigen response in this patient was also confirmed by the negative HSV antigen in the brain mass and in the lung mass. Therefore, the patient had a different clinical course, which was more like a herpes simplex syndrome-like pattern, in which the herpes simplex virus antigen was negative. In addition, HIV can induce brain mass, which is more like a meningitis-like response, in HIV-negative patients. In the lung mass, HIV antibodies might induce a meningitis-like response.


## Introduction
The genus Clitopilus, typified by C. peugeotii, was described from a Cape Floristic Region (Virginia) in which more than 400 species have been recorded. In the South, C. peugeotii was the only species described from the Atlantic Forest (Williams et al., 2004; Noordeloos et al., 2006). In the North, C. lunata, C. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii were the only species reported from Populus forests in the United States (Noordeloos et al., 2006). In the European Region of Spain, C. neoformans was the only species described from Portugal (Noordeloos et al., 2006). In Italy, C. guilliermondii and C. pyrena are distributed in the coastal regions of southern Italy (Barros et al., 2010; Porcini, 2010; Piacciotto, 2012), and from the Atlantic Forest in the southeastern region of the country (Barros et al., 2010). In Italy, C. pyrena is distributed in the coastal regions of the city of Cagliari, in the city of Genoa, and the city of Tuscany (Piacciotto, 2012).

Species of Clitopilus are found mainly in the Mediterranean area and in the mountains and on hills (Béligon, 2011; Della Terra et al., 2015).


## Methods
First, the production of yellow oil was performed on a blend of 10 g of dextrose, 2 g of L-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 10 g of n-hexane, 10 g of phenol, 10 g of potassium hydroxide, and .0 g of agar. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the oil was extracted with 0.1 mL of EtOH (1.5 mL). The crude oil was recovered by filtration using a 0.22 µm-pore-size filter (pore size 0.45 µm, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and extracted with distilled water. The combined EtOH and water extracts were diluted with distilled water to obtain pure water-EtOH (5:1). The crude water extract was prepared in a one-pot method by combining 1 mL of EtOH and water extracts and heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The EtOH-water extract was diluted with distilled water and the resulting extract was separated by centrifugation at 13,000× g for 10 min and the solid phase was recovered. The EtOH-water extract was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The EtOH-water fraction was separated by column chromatography on silica gel. The EtOH-water fraction was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The purified EtOH-water fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The combined EtOH-water and water extracts were diluted with distilled water and separated by silica gel. The EtOH-water and water fraction was separated by column chromatography on silica gel. The purified EtOH-water and water fractions were combined by column chromatography on silica gel and the eluted EtOH-water fraction was dissolved with methanol to afford pure water-EtOH (5:1).

2.3. Determination of the Pure Water-EtOH Concentration
The pure water-EtOH concentration was determined by HPLC on a Shimadzu HP-5e Gemini (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an HP-5 column (Shimadzu, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.


## Results
Identification of the Chitin Binding Site of the ScnB^g1847
The Chitin binding site (CBB) of ScnB is predicted to be located at the C-terminal region of C-terminal domain of the ciliates of N-linked glycoproteins (Fig 1A). The binding of ScnB to ScnB is supported by a significant decrease in the binding affinity for ScnB in the presence of H_2O_2 compared with the absence of H_2O_2 (Fig 1B). The ScnB binding site is known to be responsible for the binding of ScnB to ScnB and also binds to the ScnB binding site in S. cerevisiae [19], [20], [22], [23].


## Discussion
[21,22. The results of the morphological analysis indicated that the Penicillium species produced the highest concentration of the extractive extract when compared to the other species. The results of the morphological analysis revealed that the species Penicillium spp. showed the highest bioactive compounds with the highest IC_50 values (Figure 2). The crude extract of Penicillium spp. was prepared by the use of ethyl acetate (1:1) to give the crude extract of Penicillium spp. (Table 1).
