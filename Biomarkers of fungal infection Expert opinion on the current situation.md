## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is an etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different carbon sources in the mycelia of P. brasiliensis and to identify factors influencing the growth, physiology, and antifungal susceptibility of P. brasiliensis to antifungal agents. The results indicated that different carbon sources significantly influenced the growth, and these included osmotic stress, glucose concentration, lactate, sucrose, and amino acids. The mycelia grew as expected with glucose as the main carbon source, followed by yeast, the most important antifungal agent. Furthermore, the growth of P. brasiliensis was strongly affected by lactate, sucrose, and amino acids. The susceptibility of P. brasiliensis to antifungal agents was evaluated using the Strong ANSLE and the Swiss-Prot structures as well as the MIC values. The MIC values of antifungal drugs were 0.5% for mycelia, 8.0 µg/ml for mycelia, and 64 µg/ml for mycelia.


## Introduction
Fungi can cause severe infections that can lead to life-threatening complications [1-3]. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with weakened immune systems. The main opportunistic fungal pathogen is Candida albicans, but the other fungi are more rarely encountered. While Candida glabrata accounts for more than 70% of all fungal species in the blood, the other species, such as C. tropicalis and C. krusei, account for less than 5% of all fungi. Candida albicans accounts for more than 85% of infections caused by this fungus, and is the most common cause of bloodstream infection. Candida albicans causes up to 30% of all candidemia [4]. As an opportunistic pathogen, C. albicans causes most of the human infections, with a mortality rate of up to 40% [4].

Candida albicans is usually resistant to most antifungal drugs, which leads to the emergence of resistance to these drugs [5,6]. Resistance to many antifungals, including polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins, is increasing in parallel with increasing numbers of patients with underlying chronic disease and who are taking all available antifungal therapeutics [7].

The development of antifungal resistance is a major concern in recent years, especially in the era of echinocandins, which target different types of cell wall components and have broad-spectrum bioavailability [8].

The polyene amphotericin B (AMB) is a single dose of orally administered, polyene broad spectrum antifungal agent. AMB acts by binding to the ergosterol in the cell membrane, which is recognized by the receptor Glc3 [9]. It inhibits cell membrane ergosterol synthesis, which prevents the cell from being engulfed by fungal cell membranes [10]. Although AMB is well tolerated, its prolonged use may increase the probability of fungal resistance to AMB.


## Methods

The ability of the fungicides to induce resistance to the tested fungicide is often referred to as resistance to fungicide-inhibiting agent (FACIA) [39. Fungicides commonly used in combination with other fungicides have been identified as the most effective fungicides [40], [41].

## Results
neoformans and . albicans; Concurrent clinical presentations of C. neoformans infection and pathogenesis of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata; C. glabrata infection, pathogenesis and outcome of C. neoformans infection; and co-infection of C. neoformans and C. glabrata; both C. neoformans and C. albicans are the most common cause of fungal infection in humans. The burden of infection in the CNS is also a major cause of C. neoformans infection. The following recommendations for clinical management of candidiasis in patients with candidiasis: Using bioethanol as the only method of diagnosing candidiasis; Using a fluconazole as a potential therapeutic agent; Using a combination of fluconazole and amphotericin B as a sole antifungal agent; Using fluconazole alone as a second-line treatment for C. albicans; and Using fluconazole/miconazole combination for C. neoformans infections.

C. neoformans infection is common in the CNS, but the incidence of C. neoformans infection has never been reported in the early stages of the disease. Candida infections are usually caused by candidaemia. Candida species are classified into two main classes, namely, C. neoformans and C. albicans. C. neoformans infections occur predominantly in the CNS (15% of all candidosis patients); in addition, C. albicans infection has been identified in a low percentage of C. neoformans patients (1%) and C. albicans infection has been reported in a high proportion of C. neoformans patients (4%). The prevalence of candidiasis in the CNS is unknown, but it has been found in a high proportion of patients infected with C. neoformans and C. albicans. Candida infections in the CNS have been found to be caused by Candida species, including C. albicans (31.9%), C. parapsilosis (24.2%), and C. glabrata (10.1%). The prevalence of candidiasis in the CNS is unknown, but it has been found in a high proportion of patients infected with C. albicans and C. glabrata.


## Discussion
The analysis of ECVs revealed that fungal endocytotic vesicles can be either formed via the synthesis of a non-autotransformed fungal endo-vesicle or via the biosynthesis of a non-autotransformed fungal endo-vesicl. The latter process is more challenging, as the fungal cell wall contains numerous a- and ß-glucans. In the former, these structures are subject to electrostatic interactions with other cell wall components. In the latter, the endocytic vesicles are directed towards the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix, forming a surface for protein synthesis and degradation [50].

Amino acid in the cell wall is responsible for the synthesis of a- and ß-glucans and for the attachment of fungal pathogens to the cell wall [51]. In addition, a- and ß-glucans in fungal endosomes are also involved in the interaction with the cell membrane and in the degradation of proteins [52]. A major challenge in the fungal pathogenicity is to synthesize a- and ß-glucans, which are an important component of the cell wall of most species of fungal pathogens [53]. In the current study, a-glucans were detected in the ECVs of A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger and A. versicolor, which are known to contain a-glucans, and A. flavus, which contains a-glucans [54]. This suggests that the ECVs of A. fumigatus and A. terreus are involved in the formation of fungal ECVs. Interestingly, in A. flavus, the biosynthesis of a-glucans is stimulated by the presence of a-glucans [55]. In the two A. fumigatus ECVs, a-glucans are only found in the ECVs of the two ECVs containing the a- and ß-glucans, respectively. This could suggest that the ECVs of A. fumigatus are required for the biosynthesis of a-glucans.
