## Abstract
The rapid development of new antimicrobial drugs is a major factor in the influence of drug resistance in microbial pathogens. The use of new antimicrobial agents in the therapeutic arsenal has increased over the last years, and the present paper focuses on evaluating the effect of hydrocortisone ointment on the resistance of Candida species to hydrocortisone (Large scale production of human chitosan, a human peptide of the polysaccharide portion of hemicellulose that is used as a biological preservative in food and pharmaceutical industries, and development of hydrocortisone as a biocontrol agent against Candida species. The evaluation of the effect of hydrocortisone ointment on the growth of multiple Candida strains was carried out by using an agar well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all the tested Candida species were determined to be 0.03-0.5 µg/mL for hydrocortisone ointment, 0.06-0.25 µg/mL for hydrocortisone monomer, 0.5-0.6 µg/mL for hydrocortisone monolayer, and 0.25-1.0.1 for all the other Candida species. The antifungal activity of the tested compounds was observed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and against other fungi and protists. The main compound, hydrocortisone, showed the highest activity against Candida spp. The present study highlighted the potential of hydrocortisone ointment against various microbial strains.


## Introduction
Pulmonary fibrosis (Flu) is a common pathological condition that affects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Pulmonary fibrosis results from hematological malignancies, pulmonary solid organ transplantation, and other complications. The most common pathological lesions are acute, subcutaneous, pulmonary, and/or subacute forms. In patients with active pulmonary fibrosis, persistent and intense inflammation of the lung tissue is produced and produced during the course of the disease.

Intrapartial therapeutic approaches have been recommended for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.


## Methods
[36.

The specificity of the assay was calculated using the method of the manufacturer (Omega Bio-teck, USA). The positive control of this assay (without the compounds) contained normal saline.

3.3. Evaluation of Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the extracts against C. albicans ATCC 90112 was evaluated by the method of Luria-Bertani (LB) method [37]. Briefly, the stock solution of the test compound (100 µg/mL) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the yeast extract (1% w/v) in distilled water. The test was performed in 96-well microplates, with the wells containing 100 µL of the test compound in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:10. A solution of 100 µL of saline was added to each well, and the plates were allowed to dry before the addition of 100 µL of DMSO. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Multiskan Go, USA). The MIC value was defined as the lowest concentration that caused 50% reduction in turbidity compared to that of the control.

3.4. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the extract against C. albicans ATCC 90112 was evaluated by the method of Böhmer et al. [38]. Briefly, the stock solution of the test compound in DMSO was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the yeast extract (1% w/v) in distilled water. The test was performed in 96-well microplates, with the wells containing 100 µL of the test compound in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:10. A solution of 100 µL of the test compound in DMSO was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to dry before the addition of 100 µL of DMSO. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Multiskan Go, USA). The MIC value was defined as the lowest concentration that caused 50% reduction in turbidity compared to that of the control.

## Results
albican. In this study, we evaluated the oral candidiasis of 10-wk-old C. albicans-infected volunteers, which has been shown to be a promising etiological agent for C. albicans-induced oral candidiasis (17). We found that C. albicans-infected volunteers were highly susceptible to C. albicans infection, and that the number of yeast colonies was greatly decreased in the oral cavity of the oral candidiasis patients (Fig 2A). Although the oral candidiasis patients presented with oral candidiasis were completely resistant to C. albicans infection, a greater number of yeast colonies was observed in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients compared to the control group (Fig 2B). These findings suggested that the oral candidiasis patients had a high virulence factor in the oral cavity, and the results indicated that the oral candidiasis patients are more virulent than the control group.

In addition, a significantly higher percentage of fungi was found in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients compared to the control group (Fig 2C). In addition, the presence of a higher percentage of Candida in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients may contribute to the increased oral candidiasis.

The Total Colonies and the Total Oral Membrane Discardance (TCD) of the Candida in the Oral Cavity were Decreased in the Oral C. albicans-Induced Oral Candidiasis Patients
The relative frequencies of Candida in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients are shown in Table 1. In this study, the total Candida was significantly decreased in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients compared to the control group. The number of Candida was significantly decreased in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients compared to the control group, but the total Candida was not significantly decreased in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients compared to the control group. There was a significant difference between the total Candida and the control group in the total Candida levels in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients (Fig 3). In addition, there was a significant difference between the total Candida and the control group in the total Candida levels in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients (Fig 3).

We then assessed the total oral Candida content in the oral cavity of the candidiasis patients.


## Discussion
brasiliensis and . hubeiensis also appeared to be similar to those of the Candida species (Fig 1). However, the major difference between P. brasiliensis and the other Candida species was the capsule. P. brasiliensis encodes the cell wall-associated protein Arp1 and the major difference between P. hubeiensis and P. brasiliensis is the absence of a capsule (Fig 1). Both P. brasiliensis and P. hubeiensis contain a cell wall-associated protein Arp1, but P. brasiliensis has a capsule similar to that of P. hubeiensis (Fig 1A). The absence of a capsule in P. hubeiensis (Fig 1A) was also observed in the Candida species. However, the absence of the capsule in P. brasiliensis was not observed in other studies [27], [28].

The most significant difference between P. brasiliensis and P. hubeiensis was the absence of a capsule. The presence of a capsule in P. hubeiensis and P. brasiliensis was not observed in other studies. The absence of a capsule in P. hubeiensis and P. brasiliensis was not observed in other studies [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].

P. hubeiensis encodes a serine protease. Serine proteases are unique among Candida species and are involved in the biosynthesis of sterols. The presence of serine protease in P. hubeiensis was not observed in other studies [31], [32]. In our study, the absence of serine protease was observed in P. hubeiensis.

The presence of a serine protease in P. hubeiensis was not observed in other studies. The absence of serine protease was not observed in other studies [32].

P. hubeiensis encodes a putative T-cell receptor. The absence of a T-cell receptor in P. hubeiensis was not observed in other studies [32]. In our study, the absence of a T-cell receptor in P. hubeiensis was not observed in other studies [32], [33].

P. hubeiensis encodes a putative T-cell receptor.
