## Abstract
We have previously reported that fucosyltransferases (TFs) are involved in biosynthesis of the mycotoxin fucosyl neurexin (Fused). The present study aimed to investigate the role of a two-component system, namely, a-1,2,4-triazole receptor (LRR) and the p38 MAPK, in the inhibition of fucosyl transferase (FP) from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. The effects of the two-component system on the fungal Fused enzyme activity of LRR were analysed. Fucosylation of LRR was confirmed by the inhibition of Fucoszloë lactone and by indirect inhibition of the Fluorine that is directly related to the infection process. Fucosylation of LRR was also inhibited by indirect inhibitors such as the ketoconazole fungicide ketoconazole (KTCM19), Ficonazole (FTC20), and the ß-asarone (AFN). The inhibitory activity of the two-component system was further confirmed by the study of the transcriptome of the FucosZ family member Fucor circinelloides.


## Introduction
The lipoproteins TCA cycle and the ER are critical in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels (Hutcher and Koopmans, 2008). In contrast to the other eukaryotes, many eukaryotes, including most fungi, display a lack of glycosylation catalysts. Glycosylation is common in eukaryotic organisms and is essential for many biochemical processes, including protein folding, protein export, and cellular metabolism (Sulcak et al., 2001; D'Souza and Khan, 2010). In fungi, glycosylation has been implicated in the regulation of proteins, enzymes, and membrane integrity processes (Pu et al., 2001; Kumaran et al., 2007). Glycosylation is an epigenetic process in which specific sugar donors are incorporated into the ER membrane for the formation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, lipids, and other proteins (Brazca et al., 1996; D'Souza and Khan, 2010). Glycosylation is regulated by multiple regulators, including the Dgt2 protein, the chaperone Pga1, and the Rtl1 protein (Hutchison and Talbot, 1996; Hutchison and Talbot, 2001; D'Souza and Khan, 2010). Recently, a new fungal glycosylation pathway was reported (Kumaran et al., 2008). The TCA cycle and the ER are two important pathways in fungal metabolism (Hutcher and Koopmans, 2008). In addition, the glycosylation pathway in yeasts has been shown to be regulated by the ER, a key regulator of protein export (Duarte et al., 1998; Chaston et al., 1999; Bugg et al., 2002).

## Methods

Construction of cDNA sequences for . albicans
The cDNA sequences for C. albicans were obtained from the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/cryptococcus_neoformans/MultiHome.html) using the primers listed in Table S2. The cDNA sequences for C. albicans were obtained from the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/cryptococcus_neoformans/MultiHome.html). The cDNA sequences for C. albicans were obtained from the ATCC, Dental Institute of California, and the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/cryptococcus_neoformans/MultiHome.html). The cDNA sequences for C. albicans were obtained from the ATCC, Dental Institute of California, and the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/cryptococcus_neoformans/MultiHome.html). The primers used for PCR amplification of the cDNA sequences for C. albicans are listed in Table S3. PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 2.5 mM MgCl_2, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 1.25 U of each of the following: 1x Go Taq, 0.25 U of each of the BigDye, and 1x Re-Ferment Lysing Buffer (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The PCR reaction was performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and an Eppendorf FastStart DNA Assay Kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The thermal cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The primers for PCR amplification of the cDNA sequences for C. albicans were designed using the Primer3 online tool (http://www.expasy.org/tools/primer3.html).


## Results
Therefore, we have examined the impact of PC12 on the fungal virulence of . albicans. Surprisingly, the fungal burden of the lungs was higher in the co-cultures with B-12 than with the control (Fig 2E). The co-cultures with B-12 did not produce a significant difference in the CFU values among the three fungal strains (Fig 2E), indicating that the fungal burden in the co-cultures was not influenced by PC12. We also evaluated the impact of PC12 on the fungal virulence of C. albicans using the mouse inhalation model. The fungal burden in the co-cultures was higher in the lungs than in the co-cultures with B-12 (Fig 2F). The fungal burden in the co-cultures with B-12 was also higher than with the control (Fig 2F). These results indicate that PC12 contributes to the host response to C. albicans in a mouse inhalation model.

In order to further evaluate the impact of PC12 on fungal pathogenesis, the fungal burden in the lungs was quantified by CFU for different fungal strains (Fig 3). The CFU values for the different fungal strains were similar in the co-cultures with B-12 and the control (Fig 3A). The CFU values for the different fungal strains were also similar in the co-cultures with B-12 and the control (Fig 3B). This is consistent with the fact that the CFU values were similar in the co-cultures with B-12 and the control with PC12 (Fig 3B). The results indicate that PC12 can exert a positive impact on fungal pathogenesis in a mouse inhalation model.

The effect of PC12 on fungal cell-cell adhesion
The effect of PC12 on the adhesion of C. albicans was also tested using the mouse inhalation model. The effect of PC12 on the adhesion of C. albicans was found to be dose-dependently dependent (Fig 4). The CFU values were comparable between the co-cultures with B-12 and the control with PC12.


## Discussion
We also showed that the airway effect of VFV-infected mice was significantly enhanced, and IFN-<U+03B3>-induced airway dysfunction was significantly reduced in VFV-infected mic. These results suggest that VFV-infected mice have a significantly increased airway effector functions, such as IFN-<U+03B3>, and that IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated airway inflammation may contribute to the avirulent phenotype of VFV-infected mice.

VFV-induced airway inflammation is mediated by IFN-<U+03B3> and occurs in the vesicles and cerebrospinal fluid. IFN-<U+03B3> is produced by eosinophils and macrophages, and its production is activated by factors such as IL-12, IFN-<U+03B3>, and IL-4 [19]. IFN-<U+03B3> is produced by neutrophils and monocytes, and its production is enhanced by IL-12 [20,21]. IFN-<U+03B3> is produced by IL-4 and IL-13, and its production is increased by Th1 and Th17 cytokines, such as interleukin-2 [22]. IL-12 is produced by neutrophils and activated macrophages and is secreted by macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes [23]. IL-17, which is produced by neutrophils, is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells [24]. IL-18 is produced by monocytes, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells [25]. IL-23, which is produced by monocytes, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells, is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells [26]. IL-18 is produced by monocytes, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells [27].
