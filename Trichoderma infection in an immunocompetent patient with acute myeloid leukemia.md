## Abstract
Extracellular viral particles (VLPs) are ubiquitous viruses that can infect virtually every organ and system of the body. While most of them are likely to be found in the blood and lung, enterocyte, and spleen, there is a growing number of them that are found in the bloodstream. These viruses can, therefore, very easily be transferred between tissues and enterocytes, and can pose a threat to the host. Viral proteins called vLPs are very easily accessible from the bloodstream and can be divided into viral membrane proteins (vMLPs), the enterocyte and spleen protein types (SPPs), and a less diverse group of viral proteins called vLDLPs (VDPs). VLPs are found predominantly in the enterocyte, and VDPs are mainly found in the lung and spleen, with a few exceptions. The lung and lung medulla have been shown to be a very rich source of new VLPs, with over half of all VLPPs found in these regions being from patients with asthma, Crohn’s disease, and Crohn’s disease-related conditions. The lung is the area where most enterocytes and SPPs meet, and the lung, in fact, is the most biodispopogeneally distributed organelle, with the lung being the most common site of VLP-encapsulated VLP-infected enterocytes and SPPs comprising the vast majority of VLP-infected enterocytes. The lung has become the most biodispopogeneally distributed organelle, with over half of all VLPPs found in these regions being from patients with Crohn’s disease, Crohn’s disease-related conditions, and Crohn’s disease-related conditions such as asthma, Crohn’s disease-related liver disease, cancer, and auto-immune diseases. Finally, there is the very rich source of viral proteins found in the lung and lung spleen, which are likely to be used as viral surrogates in viral functions, such as drug delivery, in immune responses against viruses, or as virus-carriers and/or vaccine surrogates.


## Introduction
Progressive degeneration of the optic nerve has been a serious and often fatal disease in humans. Optic neuritis optica is the first and most common intracranial neuritis in humans. Optic neuritis optica is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the optic nerve, with visual acuity of approximately 100/µµm, and a degenerative optic sulcus that is approximately 40/30 that of the optic sulcus. Optic neuritis optica is a significant cause of vision loss in young patients, with 70-80% of those affected developing optic neuritis optica. Optic neuritis optica is a common and serious optic neuritis optic sulcus infection in patients with HIV/AIDS [1], [2]. In these patients, optic neuritis optica is the most common and serious pathology. Optic neuritis optica can cause a variety of optic neuritis and optic neuritis in the non-AIDS population. Primary optic neuritis optica is also a contributing factor in vision loss in patients with HIV/AIDS. Other pathogenic fungal species can cause optic neuritis optica, including Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Paracoccidioides lutoridii. In patients with primary optic neuritis optica, the optic neuropathies are usually mild, with recovery usually during the course of infection and/or only briefly after surgery or radiotherapy [1]. Optic neuritis optica can lead to a variety of non-AIDS related conditions such as retinal maculopathy, neurodegenerative disorders, and optic neuropathy, pharyngitis, and retinal necrosis [1].

We present a patient with optic neuritis optica and discuss the various manifestations and management.


## Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Rio de Janeiro and written informed consent was obtained from all the animals involved.

Animals and plant
The animal experiments were conducted according to the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purpose, with the exception of the study on mycelial and cell culture. Female BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All animal experiments were performed at the Federal University of São Paulo.

Fungus and yeast
The fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 32069) was cultured on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar (0.67% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.02% bile salt, 0.5% dextrose, 0.015% NaCl, 0.1% KCl, 0.01% MgSO_4·7H_2O, 1.5% KH_2PO_4, 0.003% CaCl_2, 0.001% ZnSO_4, 0.01% thiamine HCl, 0.02% MnCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.002% FeCl_2, and 0.003% CuCl_2) in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (Greiner Bio-One, Heidelberg, Germany). Plates were incubated at 35°C, and colony count was performed by colony counting at the end of the incubation.

Fungal cells and yeast
The yeast C. albicans strain SC5314 (serotype A, MATa), was used in this study. The C. albicans strains were cultured on YPD agar medium.

## Discussion
Patients with acute leukemia, tuberculomas, or hematological malignancies are at increased risk for invasive disease such as cryptococcosis and are at increased risk for meningoencephalitis [12.

In our patient, the initial presentation was very similar to acute leukemia, and she did not have fever or any signs of meningeal irritation. In addition, she had a normal CSF profile, which allowed for the measurement of a normal cell count and the subsequent diagnosis of cryptococcosis. Her normal CSF profile was also compared with that of other patients with acute leukemia, tuberculomas, and meningoencephalitis. The normal CSF profile was also very similar to that of those patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the Cryptococcus gattii complex. As shown in Table 1, her CSF profile did not show any signs of cryptococcosis.

The only site of inflammation in the brain was the liver, which was the second site in our patient. The liver is a well-established site of inflammation in patients with advanced HIV infection, and its role in the etiology of CNS cryptococcosis is controversial [13]. In addition, the fact that the liver is also a common site of inflammation in patients with HIV disease [14] could be related to the fact that the liver is not usually the primary site of inflammation in patients with HIV infection. It is possible that in our patient, there was no involvement of the liver from the previous episodes of cryptococcosis. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the patient had a severe chronic infectious disease and her CSF profile did not show any signs of inflammation.

The reason why the patient did not respond to the initial antibiotics was because of the difficulty in the treatment. The initial treatment with the first antibiotic was not successful, and the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. This patient had a good response to antibiotics, which could be related to the fact that the patient had a good response to antibiotics. The patient responded well to the second antibiotic and was treated with the second antibiotic. The patient also did not have any further signs of disease and a good response to the second antibiotic. The patient did not have any neurological symptoms or signs of cerebral edema, which could be related to the fact that she did not have any signs of cerebral edema. The patient did not have any signs of meningeal irritation, and the patient responded well to the initial antibiotics.
