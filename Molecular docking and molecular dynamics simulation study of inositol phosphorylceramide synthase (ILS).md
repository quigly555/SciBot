## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a neglected fungal infection, which is acquired in large part via inhalation of spores in the fungal environment of cattle and sheep. Spores are among the first host cells to develop granulomatous lesions, a large percentage of granulomatous lesions are not identified clinically and the majority of cases are caused by the fungal pathogen Sporothrix schenckii. Spores are generally considered as a cell type/sex/race only, and sporotrichosis is only rare. Spores are considered sexually independent and are not a part of the differential diagnosis when the disease is found in both sex and age groups. Spores may be divided into two types: mycelial, yeast, and myceloid. The most common manifestation of sporotrichosis is destruction of the infected cell wall, with an average of about 100,000 colony-forming units/mm3 per infected individual. We describe here a case of a premature passing of a spore, which was thought to be a premature passing of spores from a premature passing individual.


## Introduction
 1999; Calderone et a., 2005; Calisto et al., 2008). Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase is activated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and the lysosomal membrane ATPase activity (M_i) domains of the lysosomal membrane transporter protein IKS1 and the glycerol-binding protein IKS2 (Chong et al., 2010; Chet et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2014; Klarich et al., 2014). Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase is also required for cell-to-cell communication, as it regulates the secretion of ATP and mediates their export from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. Phospholipase 2 (PlB) and PlcB are also important for inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity, and Plb and PlcB are involved in the generation of the anion chain and the transport of the anion to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase is also involved in apoptotic cell death and autophagic cell death (Dai et al., 2015).

Phospholipase 2 (PlB) and phosphatidylinositol-12-phosphate (PI3K) are two important enzymes involved in the transport of phospholipids and inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-6-phosphate (PIP) (Boccardo et al., 1999; Calderone et al., 2005; Calisto et al., 2008). PI3K is a negative, multistep protein kinase that was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been found in many other fungi, including humans, mice, and insects (Boccardo et al.


## Methods
Fungal strains and culture
The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Plasmid vector pBSH1 (mock strain, pBS2) was used for propagation of these strains. All strains were cultured in Sabouraud broth (BD) at 37°C and used for quantitative culture on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 30°C for yeasts and 37°C for filamentous fungi.

Expression of a functional GATA1 promoter and transposon sites in C. albicans
The plasmid pBSH1 was used for gene editing in C. albicans using the sgRNA-binding cassette [55]. The sgRNA-binding cassette was synthesized using the primer mpgRNaseH (Supplementary Table S1) and the transposon sites (Supplementary Table S2) in the sgRNA-binding cassette as previously described [46]. The sgRNA-binding cassette was transformed into the strain C. albicans ATCC 90028 by electroporation [56]. Transformants were selected on PDA medium and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Transformants were screened for sgRNA expression by PCR using primers listed in Supplementary Table S3.


## Results
Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase is responsible for the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) chain, which is important for phosphatidylinositol (IP) biosynthesis and hence the production of inositol phosphorylceramide (IP(II)P) (Fig 4B,C). Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity is decreased by an unknown mechanism [4]. Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity is also decreased by the inositol phosphatase inhibitor simvastatin [3,10].

Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity is decreased by simvastatin [3]. A decrease in the activity of the enzyme was observed in the inositol phosphatase inhibitor simvastatin [3]. Simvastatin inhibits the enzyme inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, it is still not effective against simvastatin [3]. Inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity is decreased by simvastatin [3]. Simvastatin reduces the activity of simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner [3]. Simvastatin also reduces the activity of simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner [3]. The inhibition of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity in simvastatin is consistent with the activity of simvastatin in the treatment of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (IPS) in S. cerevisiae [7,8].

A decrease in the activity of simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner was observed in the inositol phosphatase inhibitor simvastatin [3]. Simvastatin inhibits inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity in a dose-dependent manner [3]. Simvastatin also inhibits inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity in a dose-dependent manner [3]. Simvastatin also inhibits inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity in a dose-dependent manner [3].


## Discussion
toruloides in vivo

The inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (PIPS) was first identified in rat brain cells [21] and was involved in the activation of the intracellular signaling cascades, including MAPK, IL-1ß, and IL-6-dependent signaling pathways in a . toruloides infection model [27]. Inositol was first synthesized from glucose and then by phosphomidate-mediated phosphorylation followed by phosphomidate-dependent phosphorylation (PPMK) in yeast [28]. Inositol can be obtained from either glucose or glycerol, and therefore, the production of specific phosphomidate can be obtained from both. The inositol pathway was first identified in human brain (PDA) by a study with human T cell activated macrophages [29]. Since then, it has been described that the inositol pathway of T cell has been highly activated, and the inositol-related gene (IL-4) and downstream gene, IL-4A, is expressed by the human fungal cell line C. neoformans and the human lung cell line H99<U+03B3> [30]. IL-4 was first identified in a human brain cell line (C57BL/6J) and subsequently, IL-6 was identified in another human cell line (H99<U+03B3>) [31].

The inositol pathway of R. toruloides has been described previously by studies in human brain [32, 33] and in vitro [34]. In this study, we identified the inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (PIPS) in rat brain cells and observed that it is involved in the activation of the intracellular signaling cascade, including IL-1ß and IL-6-dependent signaling pathways. However, the results are not consistent with our results. It is possible that the inositol pathway of R. toruloides is a different phenomenon than the one reported in human brain cells. In fact, the activation of the inositol pathway was reported previously by a rat model of R. toruloides infection [14]. In this study, we found that the activity of the inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (PIPS) was increased in the infected rat brain and that this phosphorylceramide synthase was also involved in the activation of the intracellular signaling pathway.
