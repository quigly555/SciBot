## Abstract
Since the first description of a family of asparagine in the last two decades, the phylogeny of this fungal group was not well-studied. Consequently, the present study deals with the analysis of a large collection of ascospore populations from China and USA, which comprise a significant portion of the phylogenomic data for this group. We used data from two types of asparagine mutants (A/D2F and A/D3F) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the phylogenetic groups of this fungal group. For the purpose of the study, we generated an orthologous phylogeny according to the results of the concatenated alignment analysis of all available genome sequences. This orthologous phylogeny was resolved by using concatenated alignment data from the relative mRNA isoforms of the translation elongation factor 1-a (EF-a), the translation elongation factor 2-a (TE-a), the ß-tubulin domain (tub), and the ß-axonase (ax).


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious infectious diseases, causing millions of deaths every year. The current World Health Organization (WHO) definition of TB as “bacterial, mycobacterium, or protozoan” has an extremely high degree of heterogeneity. The main TB risk factor is the host´s immune status, as well as the host´s immune status, which can influence the TB risk factors [1]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the most common cause of TB, can infect both HIV and non-HIV infected patients, causing an estimated 500,000 deaths each year [2].


## Methods
Briefly, 10^7 . fumigatus spores were inoculated into Petri dishes and incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. The number of spores in the culture media was measured after the cells were washed and incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. The mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed, and resuspended in methanol to obtain the final cell concentrations of 2 × 10^3-5 × 10^4 A. fumigatus spores/ml. Then, 1 ml of methanol was added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Mycelia were then collected by filtration, washed, and resuspended in methanol to obtain the final cell concentrations of 10 × 10^5-10^7 A. fumigatus spores/ml. Then, 1 ml of methanol was added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Mycelia were collected by filtration, washed, and resuspended in methanol to obtain the final cell concentrations of 10 × 10^3-10^7 A. fumigatus spores/ml. Finally, 1 ml of methanol was added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Mycelia were collected by filtration, washed, and resuspended in methanol to obtain the final cell concentrations of 10 × 10^4-10^5 A. fumigatus spores/ml.

Microscopy
For microscopic observation, 2 ml of each sample was examined using a Philips CM100 microscope (FEI Company, USA) equipped with a camera and a Nikon TE2000e digital camera. For each sample, a total of 4 µl of the cell suspensions was used for microscopic observation. A total of 10 µl of cell suspension (1 × 10^3 A. fumigatus spores/ml) was examined from the point of a spore tip using a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting microscope. The microscope was equipped with a Gatan 5800 digital camera and a Nikon EZ-NIH digital camera.


## Results
We established a macrophage-based assay, using 1 × 10^5 conidia/mL of UV-B irradiated UV-B for 24 h, and followed the effects of irradiation on filamentatio. The results showed that the treatment with UV-B significantly reduced filamentation in wild type macrophages, whereas that with UV-B had no effect on filamentation in mutants with reduced levels of filamentation (Fig 5A,B). These results suggest that vitamin D3 deficiency affects the growth of A. fumigatus by promoting filamentation, and that deficiency in vitamin D3 does not affect virulence in this pathogen.

To investigate the effects of vitamin D3 deficiency on melanization, we compared the melanization of wild type and mutant cells in the presence of vitamin D3. Wild type cells showed slightly reduced melanization when compared to the wild type. The melanization of the mutant cells was reduced by an average of 1.0-fold when UV-B was combined with vitamin D3, which was significantly higher than that when UV-B was combined with fluconazole (Fig 5C). These results suggest that vitamin D3 deficiency affects the growth of A. fumigatus by promoting melanization and virulence, and that vitamin D3 deficiency does not affect virulence in this pathogen.

The Effects of Vitamin D3 Deficiency on Vegetative Growth, Mating Type, and Iron-Proteoid Production
The effects of vitamin D3 deficiency on growth, mating type, and iron-proteoid production are shown in Fig 6. We found that the effects of vitamin D3 deficiency on vegetative growth and mating type were similar for all strains tested. However, the effects of UV-B deficiency on the development of conidiophores, and conidial formation, were distinct for the mutants with reduced conidiophore production. This result suggests that vitamin D3 deficiency affects the development of conidiophores, and conidia production, of A. fumigatus by promoting conidial formation.

Role of Vitamin D3 Deficiency in Iron Metabolism and the Regulation of Iron Metabolism in A. fumigatus

The effects of vitamin D3 deficiency on iron and its regulation in A. fumigatus were also investigated.


## Discussion
In contrast to <U+0394>Vectin-3-deficiency strain, the <U+0394>Vectin-3-deficiency strain is expressed ubiquitously in the vacuole, where it is present in the cytoplasm and in the cytosol, where it is present in the liver and in the blood [36. Consequently, Vectin-3 deficiency has no obvious role in the pathogenicity of C. albicans, nor does it affect the virulence of C. neoformans. Moreover, Vectin-3 deficiency has no obvious impact on the immunopathology of C. neoformans infection, suggesting that it is a product of the Vectin-3-deficiency pathway.

Vectin-3 deficiency did not affect C. neoformans virulence in mice [24], [35], but Vectin-3 deficiency decreased virulence in C. neoformans, C. albicans, and C. gattii [25], [37], suggesting that Vectin-3 deficiency is a novel virulence factor. The relationship between Vectin-3 and calcium is less clear, but calcium signaling is required for C. neoformans development and cell-mediated virulence [37], [38]. In C. neoformans, Vectin-3 is involved in calcium signaling and calcium homeostasis [25], [39]. In C. albicans, Vectin-3 is involved in the regulation of chromatin remodeling, calcium homeostasis, and calcium transporters [25], [40]. We found that Vectin-3 expression in C. neoformans was upregulated in the hyphal phase, but not in the conidia phase. The expression levels of Vectin-3 in C. neoformans was upregulated in the hyphal phase, but not in the conidia phase, suggesting that Vectin-3 is involved in calcium signaling and calcium homeostasis. In contrast, expression of Vectin-3 was decreased in the hyphal phase in the <U+0394>Vectin-3 mutant, and in the conidia phase.
