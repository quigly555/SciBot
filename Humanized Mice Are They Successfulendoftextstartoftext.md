## Abstract
This study was designed to determine the prevalence of HIV infection and risk factors of invasive candidiasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Nairobi.

500 patients were enrolled in this study, and HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, Kaposi’s sarcoma, cytomegalovirus infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes simplex virus type (TMV) infection, and cryptococcal meningitis were excluded. Patients were followed up for 14 months. Stool samples were collected from blood, genital organs, and joints at baseline and 6 months after diagnosis of SLE. Sixty-two percent of the samples were positive for HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and cytomegalovirus infection. SLE was diagnosed in 11.2% of the study patients, and in 5.5% of the whole study population, the mean estimated prevalence was 7.4%.


## Introduction
This includes the ubiquitous yeasts, that can cause serious diseases in humans and animals, and the relatively uncommon molds, which can cause serious or even fatal disease in less immunocompromised individuals (.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV], as well as Cryptococcus). The overwhelming majority of infections caused by these organisms are among the opportunistic fungal pathogens, that acquire their nutrients from the environment by inhalation, and then they undergo asexual reproduction (or asexual reproduction without contact with the host), in which spores are produced by asexual development and dispersed by the wind to new organs or tissues, to persist for a long time. However, the majority of human infections are caused by the fungi themselves, that acquire nutrients from the environment by either mating or by the motility of asexual spores, which either of the two strategies are not distinguishable.

Sexual reproduction of fungi is widespread and commonly observed in nature. It is usually observed between the yeasts that are commonly found in nature, in which the spores are dispersed by the wind, and where the spores germinate into hyphae. These spores are then sequestered from the host by asexual spores, which are produced by the wind. The wind acts not only on the windborne fungal propagules, but also on the reproductive structures of the spores that form the hyphal coils. This process of sequestration and dispersal of spores is called wind dispersal (also called wind-assisted speciation (SWS)), which is a phenomenon of life in eukaryotes and also in prokaryotes (reviewed in [1]). The wind acts mainly by bending the physical and chemical properties of the air and physical particles present in the air by raising the density of the air by a factor of 10, compared to air at a given distance. The air at a given distance is denser and more dense, while the particles are denser and more dense. The ratio of the two densities is called the effect of the wind [2] and is determined by several factors, such as the density of the air present in the particles and the relative humidity in the microenvironments of a given sample. The effect of the wind on the effect of the wind on the secretion of virulence factors, such as secreted proteins and cell wall proteins, is called the effect of the wind [3].

Cell culture
Human hematopoietic stem cells (HS-293) were obtained from the Human foreskin Research Institute (HPRRI) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone-Clon and BioMerieux) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 U/mL). The cells were maintained in complete darkness at 37°C with 5% CO_2 in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO_2 in a shaker at 200 rpm in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO_2.


## Results
The median age of the study population was 50 years (range, 9-93 years. Among the patients with recurrent TBI, the median age was 56 years (range, 11-90 years) (Table 1). The incidence of TBI was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.1-5.2%), and the incidence rate of death was 3.9% (95% CI, 1.3-5.3%) per 100 patient-years of follow-up (Table 1).

A total of 2,551 patients (55.2%) had at least one documented ESR (Table 2). A median duration of ESR was 12.6 (range, 3-24 months). The mean duration of ESR was 43 days (range, 11-88 days). The overall rate of ESR was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.5-7.2%) per 100 patient-years of follow-up (Table 2).

The most common underlying disease in the 2,551 patients was diabetes mellitus (75.4%), followed by other underlying conditions (24.5%). The most common underlying disease in patients with proven TBI was hypertension (27.9%). Patients with proven TBI had a higher risk of dying than those with non-TBI diabetes mellitus (50.7% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.001). In contrast, patients with non-TBI diabetes mellitus had a higher risk of death (22.8% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.001). The overall rate of mortality in patients with proven TBI was 18.2% (95% CI, 1.5-34.2%).

A total of 2,929 patients had a previous history of TBI. Of these, a total of 1,744 (25.7%) patients had a history of acute rejection of the blood culture at the time of the TBI. The incidence of TBI was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.6-2.0%). The rate of death was 8.7% (95% CI, 1.0-14.4%).

Treatment and outcome of patients with proven TBI
Of the 1,929 patients with proven TBI, 831 (21.7%) received empiric antibiotics.


## Discussion
However, the rapid development of sequencing technologies has hampered their use as part of deep-sea research, with the aim of developing a more complete understanding of the microbial diversity and diversity dynamics at the deep endospher. These efforts have led to an increasing trend in using genomic information for deep-sea studies. It is important to note that the genomic data for deep-sea research is obtained from deep-sea cables and not from direct ocean waters. Therefore, the sequencing depth of the deep-sea cables used in this study was the same as that of the marine cables used in the deep-sea studies carried out by Jacques Panneves and colleagues [6].

One of the most common problems in the study of deep-sea microbial communities is the use of genomic information to study microbial communities at the deep endosphere. Although the metabolic diversity of the deep-sea bacterial communities was comparable to the marine communities, the microbial diversity and abundance of bacterial phylotypes and taxa were significantly different between the deep-sea marine and the marine communities. In contrast, the bacterial communities of the deep-sea marine and the marine communities were identical in terms of phylotypes and abundance (Figure 1, Table 1). These results demonstrated that the deep-sea microbial communities were similar to those of the marine communities (Figure 1).

The results also revealed that the bacterial community composition of the deep-sea communities was significantly different than the marine communities. The community of the deep-sea communities was composed of different bacterial phylotypes and taxa, which are consistent with the results of previous studies on the microbial communities of the marine and the deep endosphere [7]. The bacterial community structure was largely similar between the deep-sea and the marine communities. The bacterial community structure was dominated by Proteobacteria, a group of highly diverse bacterial phylotypes, with the highest number of OTUs in the deep-sea communities (5 OTUs per deep-sea community) compared to the marine communities (4 OTUs per deep-sea community). The presence of Proteobacteria in the deep-sea communities was also confirmed by the high diversity of the bacterial community in the deep-sea communities compared to the marine communities (4 OTUs per deep-sea community).
