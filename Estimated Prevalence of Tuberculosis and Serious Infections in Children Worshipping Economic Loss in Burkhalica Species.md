## Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. The HIV/AIDS population in this country is estimated at 727,000, with males predominately affected by HIV infection. Central nervous system (CNS) infections are the second leading cause of CNS infections in young people. Predominant clinical features observed in patients with HIV/AIDS are the inflammatory and immune features. CNS involvement is usually an early manifestation of opportunistic infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis, or an early diagnosis of CNS vasculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the standard method for diagnosis of CNS infection. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, laboratory analysis is rarely performed due to a lack of interest among central government.


## Introduction
This result is particularly relevant given the anticipated lack of economic recovery in the affected Burkhalia specie.

Burkholderia pseudomallei, also known as pyogonial, is a gram-negative bacterium, which is endemic in many countries and is responsible for severe TB disease in humans. It can survive in the respiratory tract, skin, and on the mucosa of the respiratory mucosa and can also infect other tissues including the lungs and brain. Pyogonial infections are very difficult to treat, with only six to eight cases per million person-years, with a mortality rate of about 50% (11). A large burden of disease has been caused by Pyogonial bacteria in the Burkholderia genus, and although these strains are not as prevalent as those in other endemic groups, they still cause high morbidity and mortality.

The pyogonial route of infection is carried out by a group of microorganisms called “bespers”. Bespers are defined as the spread of a bacterial species from one place to another by a single type of infectious particle (12). Bespers are classified as “high-bespers” or “low-bespers” based on the ability of bacteria to grow above a threshold of growth (12). A “high-bespers” group includes Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium jeikeum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus (13). Bespers can be established by the colonization of specific bacterial strains in patients, by the secretion of toxins, by the formation of biofilms, and by the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. In addition, some of the biofilms are involved in transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (14). Bespers can be established by direct diffusion from one host strain to another, by the production of antibiotic-resistant biofilms, or by the attachment of biofilms to surfaces, or by extracellular bacteria that can escape from biofilms (15).


## Methods
In addition, the frequency of TB cases in children had been reported to the Cameroon National Agency for Health and Social Services (CNAHS) by the National Agency for Health Statistics (NAHSS) in April 2010 (Table 1.

Among the 1,224 children (>1 year old), 716 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Of the 1,224 children with TB, 4 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Among the 1,143 children with pulmonary TB, 2 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Among the 1,406 children with meningitis, 1 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Among the 1,446 children with meningitis, 2 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Among the 1,332 children with bronchial, 1 were prevalent in their underlying disease. Among the 1,210 children with diarrhea, 1 were prevalent in their underlying disease.

One of the first steps in the prevention of TB was the introduction of antibiofilm reduction regimens, which were approved by the Cameroon National Agency for Health and Social Services (CNAHS) in 2009. The next step in the prevention of TB was the introduction of antimicrobial resistance training. The last step was the introduction of the surveillance program, which was approved in June 2011.

In the first year, the program was implemented in 40 children (13 men, 6 women, and 1 child with a tertiary or active immunodeficiency) with tuberculosis, 23 children (10 men, 9 women, and 1 child with a tertiary or active immunodeficiency), and 6 children (13 men, 10 women, and 1 child with a tertiary or active immunodeficiency). The program consisted of the introduction of 8 training modules for TB management, 1 training module for vaccination, and 1 training module for the management of non-bud-specific-tyrosine-bacterial-susceptible-protease-resistant (NSS-BP-R) [15], [17]. There were a total of 3 training modules for B. brasiliensis and 3 for other bacteria. In addition, a two-day training program was developed to better prepare the children for the training program. The first training module was developed to provide children with information on the history, clinical course, and the management of TB.


## Results
While there is a strong correlation between the prevalence of serious bacterial infection and the prevalence of serious infectious infection, the prevalence of serious infectious infection is not dependent on the economic loss of Burkhalica specie. We observed that prevalence of serious bacterial infection was not dependent on the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 2). Similarly, the prevalence of serious infectious infection was not dependent on the presence of Salmonella sp. (Table 2). In addition, prevalence of serious bacterial infection was not dependent on the presence of Streptococcus spp. (Table 2). Thus, the prevalence of serious bacterial infection was not dependent on the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

There is a correlation between the prevalence of serious bacterial infection and the prevalence of serious infectious infection (Table 2). However, the prevalence of serious bacterial infection was not dependent on the presence of Salmonella sp. (Table 2). Similarly, the prevalence of serious infectious infection was not dependent on the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 2).

Of the 903 children in this study, 709 (15%) were male and the median age at diagnosis was 34.5 years. This study is the first to report the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Burkhalica species. The prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Burkhalica species was estimated to be 10.8% (16). The prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Burkhalica species was estimated to be 2.4% (3).

The prevalence of serious bacterial infection was estimated to be 0.9% (1). The prevalence of serious infectious infection was estimated to be 0.3% (2).

The prevalence of serious infectious infection in children with the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae was estimated to be 0.1% (3).

Prevalence of serious bacterial infection in children with the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was estimated to be 0.1% (4).

In this study, the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae was estimated to be 0.1% (5).


## Discussion
 (range .0-24.0) episodes per 100,000 children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis. Although the prevalence of tuberculosis in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis is much lower than that in adults with tuberculosis, it is likely that this is due to differences in the epidemiology of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a highly prevalent disease in humans, which may be the reason why HIV patients tend to be more prone to TB infection. While TB infection in children is significantly more common than that in adults, it is possible that the prevalence of TB infection in children is also a major factor driving the severity of severe and fatal infections in adults with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis. In contrast, tuberculosis was the most common cause of severe and fatal infections in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis, with a median of 4.1 episodes per 100,000 children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis.

Our results suggest that individuals with higher burdens of tuberculosis may have higher risk factors for severe and fatal infections in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis, such as higher levels of immunosuppression, more frequent hospitalization, and more severe infections. These factors may have influenced the severity of severe and fatal infections in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis, and their severity may be associated with longer hospitalization and longer time to hospitalization. The risk factors for severe and fatal infections in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis are likely also associated with higher HIV infection rates, and these factors could also affect the severity of severe and fatal infections in children with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis.

The results of our study show that individuals with the highest burdens of tuberculosis in adults with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis have higher risk factors for severe and fatal infections in children. This may be due to a higher burden of tuberculosis in adults with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis compared to adults with BSI-IIE Tuberculosis.
