## Abstract
The mammalian host GcCR7a has been shown to be a potent regulator of melanin synthesis and virulence in pathogenic fungi. GcCR7a has also been shown to influence melanin production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cell lines. In the yeast, the expression of GcnR7a is positively regulated by the Magnaporthe oryzae melanin synthase (MAP) protein, which is functionally and transcriptionally regulated by the phycomete Arabidopsis thaliana.


## Introduction
Biotechnological bioprocesses are used in the preparation of raw materials such as composites, cement, polymers, fabric and paper. The most common polymers used in this industry are bamboo, straw, egg yolk, clay, clay cement, polymers, polyethylene and polyethylene (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) [1]. Binder and yolk are used in different industrial processes such as cement, plastic and paper [2,3,4]. However, their role in the textile industry is not well known. Binder and yolk are used in the textile industry because they are very useful in the textile industry. They are used in the textile industries because they are very useful in the textile industry. They are used in the textile industry because they are useful in the textile industry. They are used in the textile industry because they are used in the textile industry.

## Methods

In vivo studies
Cryptococcus neoformans strains were grown overnight in liquid YPD at 30°. The cells were diluted to an OD_600 of 0.1 in fresh YPD and then grown for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were diluted to an OD_600 of 0.2 in fresh YPD and then grown for further 24 h. Cell suspensions were prepared by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and washed twice with PBS. The cell suspension was adjusted to a final OD_600 of 0.5 by adding 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then stained with India ink (Becton Dickinson) and imaged on a Nikon Coolpix 7 digital camera equipped with a digital camera. The data was collected by an Olympus IX-47 inverted microscope equipped with a DP10 camera.

The growth rate was determined by using an inverted phase contrast microscope and the cell number was measured using ImageJ (version 1.49b2, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The cells were counted in 100 randomly selected cells from a microscope slide. The number of cells in each sample was divided by the number of cells in the slide. The growth rate was expressed as the ratio of the number of cells in the treated group to the number of cells in the untreated group.

## Results
neoformans . neoformans virulence factors. The Chs4 gene was recently sequenced by a genomic analysis and genome-wide analysis of C. neoformans (16). The Chs4 gene is absent from the genomes of two closely related C. neoformans species (18), and we identified a full-length C. neoformans C. neoformans Chs4 gene in the genome of a healthy human (19). We thus performed a BLASTn analysis of the C. neoformans genome and compared it with that of the healthy human, as well as the NCBI database, which contains a collection of fungi. Our BLASTn analysis identified five putative C. neoformans C. neoformans Chs4 homologs, which include the gene encoding a protein with a conserved catalytic triad, an important virulence factor, and a subunit of the RNA-dependent protease Src. These five proteins are known to play key roles in the virulence of C. neoformans (8). The functional characterization of the five genes identified in our BLASTn analysis (Chs4 in the C. neoformans genome and Chs3 in NCBI database) is presented in Fig 1A.

Chs4 is important for C. neoformans virulence and C. neoformans virulence
Having identified three well-characterized virulence factors in C. neoformans, we further assessed the role of Chs4 in virulence. The importance of Chs4 in virulence was first reported by the fact that the chs4<U+0394> strain was highly susceptible to S. aureus and C. neoformans (8). We therefore tested whether the chs4<U+0394> strain was more virulent than the wild-type strain. The chs4<U+0394> strain was selected for further analysis because the chs4<U+0394> strain is a lethal pathogen of C. neoformans (24). Therefore, we next tested the virulence of the chs4<U+0394> strain in a murine model of cryptococcosis.


## Discussion
neoformans va. grubii strain H99-1 (a strain previously described as “virulent” in this study) and a C. neoformans var. neoformans strain S288c-1 (a strain previously described as “irritant” in this study) that is both avirulent and avirulent in mouse models of cryptococcosis (19). The two C. neoformans strains (S288c-1 and S288c-2) were both avirulent in mice, but serological tests revealed that both strains could not grow on serum or serum containing BSA and did not produce sialotoxin.

The C. neoformans var. grubii strain H99-1 (a strain previously described as “virulent” in this study) that we used in our study was avirulent in mice and in mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii (S288c-1). The serological serological results demonstrated that C. neoformans var. grubii strain H99-1 was avirulent in mice, but not in mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii (Figures 1, 2, 3). This indicates that the avirulent strains of C. neoformans var. grubii are not the cause of the avirulent strains of C. neoformans var. grubii that cause infections in humans.

In addition to the serological tests, we conducted a serological analysis of the serum samples from two other human patients and two C. neoformans var. grubii isolates. The C. neoformans var. grubii strain S288c-1 serological test was positive in all the patients and in all the isolates tested (Figure 3). The C. neoformans var. grubii strain H99-1 serological test was negative in all the patients and in all the isolates tested (Figure 3). We did not perform a serological analysis in our study.

In summary, our studies revealed that the serological test performed in our study of C. neoformans var. grubii can detect C. neoformans var. grubii, but not C.
