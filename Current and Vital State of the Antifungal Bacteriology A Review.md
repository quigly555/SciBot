## Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. These complications are difficult to treat and often result in terminal complications in critically ill patients. Combination or combined antifungal therapies are indicated for this group of patients.

We report a case of a 46-year-old male presenting with signs and symptoms of meningitis and ataxia, concurrently with the administration of Amphotericin B and flucytosine. He survived and recovered after a high-dose of 3 months of treatment.

The potential of combination or combined antifungal therapies is worthy of further investigation. This case demonstrates that combining antifungal therapy with fluconazole may be a valuable approach in the management of CNS infections.


## Introduction
Mycotic infections are rare in immunocompromised patients, including AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and patients with other immunosuppressive diseases. However, the incidence of infection has increased dramatically in recent years with a large number of cases reported from all over the world, including in India and the United States.1, 2, 3 In these cases, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are seen as a complication of many other immunosuppressive disorders.3, 4

IFIs are life-threatening complications in immunocompromised patients, especially those with impaired cellular immunity and other underlying diseases. The best-characterized cases are those caused by Aspergillus and Cryptococcus species.4, 5, 6, 7 However, other fungi, such as Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, and non-Aspergillus species, have also been reported as important causes of IFIs in immunocompromised patients, including HIV patients, transplant patients, and patients with various underlying conditions.4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Despite the great advances in antifungal therapy, the mortality rates due to IFIs still remain high, reaching over 50% in some countries and more than 80% in India.


## Methods

The validation of the MIC determination was performed on yeast isolates obtained from patients with HIV-1 and Hepatitis-1 conditions [14. The MICs of the tested compounds were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [15].

The assay for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was performed as in [16]. The MICs of the tested compounds were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [15].

In the antifungal susceptibility testing, the MICs of the tested compounds were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [15] and the MICs of the tested compound were determined according to the CLSI M38-A2 [17].

The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [17]. The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test that causes 80% of mortality in patients with symptoms and no visual response. The MFC values were expressed as the lowest concentration that resulted in no growth, and the MFC value was considered to be the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) [17].

To determine the MICs of tested compounds, the MICs of the tested compounds were also determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [17]. The MFC values were defined as the lowest concentration of the test that resulted in no growth, and the MFC value was considered to be the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) [17].

The antifungal activity of the test compounds against the test organisms was determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [17]. The antifungal activity of the tested compounds was evaluated against an inoculated human keratinocyte cell line as in [18].

The MICs of the tested compounds against the test organisms were also determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [17] and the MICs of the tested compound against an inoculated human keratinocyte cell line as in [18].

4.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC_50) and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC_90) of the Test Drugs
The MIC_50 of the tested compounds against the test organisms was determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 [17].

## Results
fumigatus were identified as potential contaminants by automated screenin. The identified compounds were subjected to a detailed analysis using a combination of the chemical shift thresholds employed in the antimicrobial literature (Table 3). In this study, a chemical shift threshold was established to detect the chemical shifts in the composition of the extracts. The molecular formula and HRMS mass spectra of all the compounds identified by the chemical shift threshold were obtained by SDS-PAGE, MS and Q-RT-PCR (Table 4). The molecular ion profiles of the extracts were qualitatively and qualitatively identical to those of the chemical shift threshold (Table 4).

The chemical shift threshold (Table 3) was used to evaluate the diversity of the extracts (Table 3). Compounds 1-3 were identified by the chemical shift threshold (Table 3). The observed chemical shifts were in accordance with the published literature [6], [7]. For example, the presence of benzyl alcohol and 1,2-benzyl alcohol in the extracts of A. fumigatus were confirmed by the chemical shift threshold of 28.5 ppm, which was consistent with the accepted literature [7], [8]. As shown in Figure 1, the presence of benzyl alcohol and 1,2-benzyl alcohol is consistent with the published literature [6], [7], [8], and [9]. The presence of benzyl alcohol is also consistent with the published literature [6], [7], [8], and [9]. Moreover, the presence of 1,2-benzyl alcohol is consistent with the published literature [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The chemical shift threshold (Table 3) was used to evaluate the diversity of the extracts (Table 3). Compounds 1-3 were identified by the chemical shift threshold (Table 3). The observed chemical shifts were in accordance with the published literature [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. In addition, 1,2-benzyl alcohol and 1,2-benzyl alcohol are consistent with the published literature [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].


## Discussion

A previous systematic review of the literature showed that the mortality rate associated with amphotericin B-induced Lymphoma in HIV-uninfected patients was 20-fold higher than the mortality rate associated with the other agents of invasive Candida sp. [16]. In our patient cohort, mortality was not associated with amphotericin B in our study. Although mortality in HIV-uninfected patients is well-known, its morbidity and mortality are associated with the incidence of amphotericin B-related Lymphoma.

The results of this review were consistent with previous reports that show that mortality associated with amphotericin B-induced Lymphoma in HIV-uninfected patients is significantly higher in patients treated with non-neutropenic therapy (n = 25) [16].

Our review also found that mortality associated with amphotericin B-induced Lymphoma in HIV-uninfected patients was significantly higher than mortality associated with the other agents of invasive Candida spp. Amphotericin B is not recommended in the treatment of invasive Candida spp., due to the toxicity and toxicity of this agent.

The results of this review were consistent with the results of a previous systematic review of the literature and demonstrated that mortality associated with amphotericin B-induced Lymphoma in HIV-uninfected patients was significantly higher than mortality associated with the other agents of invasive Candida spp. Amphotericin B is not recommended in the treatment of invasive Candida spp., due to the toxicity and toxicity of this agent [16].

The results of this review are consistent with previous reports that show that mortality associated with amphotericin B-induced Lymphoma in HIV-uninfected patients is significantly higher than mortality associated with the other agents of invasive Candida spp. Amphotericin B is not recommended in the treatment of invasive Candida spp., due to the toxicity and toxicity of this agent [16].
