## Abstract

A total of 104 patients with definitive confirmed adult granulomatous infection were evaluated at diagnosis of adult CSF abnormalities at diagnosis of measle.

A total of 101 (63%) patients had CSF abnormalities on admission: 56% with Löwenswear and 52% with Helicobacter pylori. The mean age of the patients was 61.5 ± 9.2 years (SD ± 8.9). The mean duration of infection before hospital discharge or complete recovery from hospital was 62 ± 9.3 months (mean ± 4.5 months). The median age of diagnosis of granulomatous infection was 41 ± 9.6 months (SD ± 23.8), and 70% of the patients were not receiving any immunosuppressive treatment at admission. The ME Panel showed a significantly increased sensitivity compared to urine test (P < 0.0001).

Our study demonstrated that patients with adult granulomatous infection had a significantly higher rate of definitive confirmed adult CSF infection compared to those without adult granulomatous infection. Our findings provide the first evidence for increased risk of adult granulomatous infection in a transplant setting.

L’esito delle donne è una strategia a causa di diffusione di vari tendenze “modifica” (uso fondamentale, uso fondo - efficacia) per il ritardo nei pazienti adulti a rischio. La comunicazione della fitta comunicativa precoce e la creazione di un’azienda fondamentale per il paziente sono eseguite una risorsa per via di esaurimento. Lo scopo del nostro studio è stato quello di valutare la diffusione della donna trattata in età ad una casa vaccinale a rilevanza del 20° settimana.

È stata valutata la diffusione della donna sottoposta a vaccinazione (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) ottenute al fine di valutare l’adesione alla vaccinazione alla presenza.


## Introduction
The genus of oomycetes, of which Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Curvularia are the most important plant pathogenic fungi, infecting almost all plant species in the family Araceae, including the plant host genus Pinaceae, as well as several economically important crops. The most commonly isolated species are A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. niger, and many species are capable of causing serious infections in humans, especially in intensive care units (ICU) and patients with haematological disorders. Many of the infections caused by these fungi are associated with the respiratory tract, especially in the immunocompromised [1].

In Europe, A. flavus is an important pathogen for several reasons. First, most of the immunocompromised patients with oomycosis are treated by antifungal drugs, which are not readily available in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, including Italy, Greece, and Spain. The high rate of morbidity and mortality in these patients reflects this fact. Second, the widespread use of antifungal drugs in the past two decades has made the development of new drugs and formulations increasingly cost-effective. Third, the long duration of the available antifungal agents is a major factor limiting the number of effective treatments available in most countries, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Fourth, A. flavus is an opportunistic pathogen, and the long incubation period required for virulence is expected to delay the development of new antifungal drugs and antifungal therapies. Fifth, the increasing emergence of resistance to current antifungal therapies, as well as the emergence of drug resistance, makes A. flavus a global health threat.

In the course of a survey of fungi and plants, we collected over 10,000 plant and animal samples.


## Methods

Tests of Human Burden
The performance of the Meningitis and Fungal Tumor Testing (MALFA) were evaluated in clinical studies performed by the Federal University of Goiás (UFG) with the supervision of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFG-MSG) and the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFG-MGR) and the University of São Paulo University of Medical Sciences (UFG-SPS) with the supervision of the Federal University of Goiás (UFMG-GCS.

Tests of Human Burden
The performance of the Malbadia Tumor Test (MTT) was evaluated in the context of a positive CSF culture of the organism. The following criteria were used to determine the results of the MTT: (1) culture positive for C. albicans, (2) culture negative for C. tropicalis, (3) positive for C. glabrata, (4) positive for C. dubliniensis, (5) positive for C. krusei, (6) negative for C. glabrata, and (7) positive for C. parapsilosis.

Tests of Human Burden
The performance of the MTT on the results of the MTT was evaluated in the context of a positive CSF culture of the organism. The following criteria were used to determine the results of the MTT: (1) culture positive for C. albicans, (2) culture negative for C. tropicalis, (3) positive for C. glabrata, and (4) positive for C. parapsilosis.

## Results
Molecular phylogeny of the Fusarium spp
The Fusarium spp. phylogeny was reconstructed using the concatenated LSU, tub2, tef1 and rpb2 sequences for all sequenced isolates and to the best of our knowledge the closest known representative of the genus Fusarium. The ITS phylogeny showed that all isolates from F. spp. were morphologically similar to those of F. solani (Figure 1), but F. solani was clearly distinguished from F. solani by its significantly longer telomere length (200 bp vs. 150 bp) and the larger telomere lengths of all isolates (Figure 2).

The basidiomycete phylogeny of F. solani is based on the ITS phylogeny and the tef1 phylogeny. The tree, in which the Fusarium spp. isolates clustered together, was subjected to BLASTx and the resulting topologies were shown in Figure 3 and 4. The topologies of both the ITS and tef1 phylogenies were very similar (Figure 3). The tef1 phylogeny was only able to resolve the sister-group relationship between F. solani and F. solani-fusarium (Figure 3).

A phylogeny of the Fusarium spp. isolates was reconstructed using the combined LSU, tub2, tef1 and rpb2 sequences for all isolates and the basidiomycete phylogeny was established (Figure 5). The topologies of the phylogeny were identical to the topologies of the ITS phylogeny except for the placement of F. solani in the R.


## Discussion
There was a diagnosis of Me/D within the first 24 hours of CSF examination and the patient was discharged from the hospital, with no follow-up for 6 day.

When did the early diagnosis occur? Early diagnosis of Me/D within the first day of CSF examination has been described in many cases [6,7,8,9]. In the literature review, only three cases were diagnosed with ME, two were ME meningitis, and one was ME lung cancer. The patient who had ME had a 2-month course of ME. The patient who had ME had a short course of ME. This may be due to the short duration of illness and the inflammatory response to the infectious disease and the lack of symptoms and signs that we have seen in this patient. Our patient also had ME at a later stage of illness and we had been investigating the symptoms of ME for more than 2 months. The patient who had ME had an extended course of illness with a subsequent relapse of ME. The patient who had ME had a negative blood culture and a negative Me on brain biopsy. This patient also had ME on brain biopsy but had no subsequent relapse. It has been reported that ME is the most common ME infection in humans [10].

What is the diagnosis of ME? It is easy to diagnose ME, but is difficult to diagnose ME with the help of clinical studies, diagnostic PCR and specific PCR. The disease of ME may be asymptomatic and superficial, as in this case. There are no known cases of ME with non-CNS involvement. When the patient with ME was referred to a primary care unit in an intensive care unit in our hospital, there were no clinical or radiological signs of ME. This may have been due to the fact that the patient had a good response to the initial treatment. A follow-up of the patient with ME is not usually required for the follow-up. We refer patients with ME to the emergency room or the local emergency departments, where they may need to be treated.

What is the diagnosis of ME? ME is a slow disease with mild to moderate clinical signs of inflammation and neutrophilia. It usually takes 2-4 weeks to develop symptoms and a diagnosis is usually made by culture of the CSF.
