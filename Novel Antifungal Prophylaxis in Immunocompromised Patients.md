## Introduction
A 33-year-old male patient presented with left leg weakness, and bilateral pain in the abdomen was noted by the patient's physician. He did not have typical signs or symptoms. The patient had no recent history of traveling or travel-related illness, and was taking antiplatelet drugs. He had no history of hypertension, and was taking no more than 80 mg/day of IVED. The patient's contact information was returned to him on June 30th, 2016. The patient had no history of travel, travel, or any other travel-related factor. There was no history of drug interactions, and no medications were in use at the time of admission. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a high-grade fever, with serum albumin level ranging between 75 and 100 IU/mL. The patient was later transferred to a second Level 1 hospital (Plate Neurology Units, Neurology Referral Unit, Seoul, South Korea) for laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of lymphadenopathy. The patient was subsequently discharged with a low-grade fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and mild back pain. He was subsequently discharged with a low-grade fever, headache, and mild back pain in lieu of a fever, and pain in the abdomen was minimally altered.

On admission, the patient was well. There was no swelling, and the patient had a productive day. He had a mild cough and cough without hemiparesis. The patient was cooperative with the medical staff and was not lethargic or delirious. On days 3, 6, 14, and 19, the patient was transferred to another Level 1 hospital.

On day 23, the patient's fever improved to a minor headache. The patient was transferred back to Level 1. The patient's headache persisted for 10 days. On day 25, the patient was discharged with a high-grade fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and mild back pain. He was transferred back to the Level 1 hospital.


## Methods
A total of 2,849 patients (.2%) were immunocompromised, with an average of 10 episodes of CNS infection during the study period. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Wisconsin Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB). Patients were randomly assigned into groups of five (five patients per group). All immunocompromised patients received 400 mg/kg of HEPES, 400 mg/kg of oral G418, or 400 mg/kg of fluconazole at the beginning of the study. All the drugs were given at the recommendation of the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin Medical Center.

Two weeks before the start of the study, patients were randomized to receive either 400 mg of fluconazole (previously, 400 mg of fluconazole was administered daily), 400 mg of gabapentin (previously, 400 mg of gabapentin was administered daily), or 400 mg of flucytosine (previously, 400 mg of flucytosine was administered daily). The first day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the second day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the third day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the fourth day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the fifth day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the sixth day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the seventh day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the tenth day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin. On the eleventh day, the patients were given 400 mg of fluconazole and then 400 mg of gabapentin.

## Discussion
A long-standing question in epidemiological research is whether there are any genotypes that can be selected for in a population with limited genetic resources. Genetic loci in the human host may be selected for by several mechanisms. For example, the expression of genes encoding serine/threonine/amino acid transporters may be selected for in a population with limited genetic resources (Skelton et al. 2013). In addition, genetic screens may be conducted on large populations with limited resources, and they may also be selected for in populations with limited genetic resources (Sander et al. 2011).

We have previously reported that the C. gattii serotype D strain is capable of mating and generating asexual spores (Larsson et al. 2001). This genotype is characterized by a single (Korf1) serotype D genome and is thus not likely to have evolved to tolerate the hostile conditions encountered in the human host. This is because serotypes D and E are genetically distinct from each other in that they are both derived from serotype A, which is the serotype D strain of C. neoformans (Wong et al. 2002). However, in the present study, we observed that serotype D is capable of producing sexual spores. In contrast to the serotype A strains, which produce spores, we observed that serotype D is also able to produce ascospores (Figure 3B). A caveat in the present study is that we did not look at the ascospore production of serotype D because it is not a typical fungal sexual morph, as that would require serotype D and E strains of C. neoformans. However, our results suggest that serotype D and E strains may be as diverse as fungi can be, including C.
