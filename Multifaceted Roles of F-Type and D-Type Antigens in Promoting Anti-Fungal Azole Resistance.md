## Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the anti-Kanto sensu lato (S-K-L) activity of the anti-forg protein diethylamino group and compare it to that of the other two d-amino group.

The anti-Kanto sensu lato (S-K-L) activity was evaluated by measuring the expression of the Hog1, Hog2, and P-type ATPase super-family genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The levels of intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-1 (PI3-AMP) levels and extracellular phosphatidylinositol 3-ketosaccharide (ETK) were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The anti-Kanto sensu lato activity was measured by measuring the expression of PI3, PI6, and P-type ATPase super-family genes by ELISA. The levels of these genes were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The anti-Kanto sensu lato enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was able to distinguish between 2 and 4 d-amino-d-amino acids, thus identifying them as either inhibitory or inhibitory for K-L-L enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).


## Introduction
The rDNA fragments are characterized by a short length and are abundant in the cell wall of the pathoge. However, a more complex composition of rDNA fragments can be observed in the host tissues and also in the fungal cell wall. In the fungus, host defense against the fungal pathogen relies on the ability of the fungus to utilize extracellular extracellular resources for growth. The secreted components and proteins involved in extracellular secretion are well-known in the yeast and fungal kingdoms, including chitin, mannan, glucans, ß-glucans, and other components, as well as in other fungi. In yeast, chitin and mannan are secreted from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins to form chitin deacetylases (C deAMPs), which are mainly found in the Golgi complex. The secreted proteins are derived from the cell wall and consist of proteins with different molecular weights (e.g., chitin deacetylases, CDAs), with different molecular weights in different fungal species and species of Candida and Cryptococcus, and enzymes with different activities (e.g., phosphatase, endoplasmic reticulum, and protein kinase) [6, 7]. The chitin deacetylase activities of the secreted proteins are mainly associated with the transport of various components of the cell wall, such as proteins with different molecular weights, such as chitin deacetylases, CDAs, and proteins with different activities (e.g., phosphatase, endoplasmic reticulum, and protein kinase). The secreted proteins with different molecular weights are released from the secretory pathway and enter the secretory pathway, which is mainly mediated by secretory vesicles and secretory vesicles secretory system (SSP). The secretory system consists of the ß-glucan synthase (SBS) and chitin deacetylases (C deAMPs). The SBS and C deAMPs belong to the outer membrane protein (OMP) family of proteins. The SBS and C deAMPs are also found in the secretory system.


## Methods
monocytogenes, the following tests were performe. L. monocytogenes strains were grown on Sabouraud agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 28 °C for 48 h. The mycelial plugs of L. monocytogenes were excised and transferred to a clean paper bag. The agar pieces were put on a clean glass slide and then placed in a clean petri dish. The agar pieces were covered with plastic wrap and incubated at 28 °C for 2 days. F-Type and D-Type antifungal drugs were added to the agar pieces at a ratio of 1:5. The plates were incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. The mycelial plugs of L. monocytogenes were excised, and the agar pieces were placed on a clean glass slide and then placed in a clean petri dish. The agar pieces were then covered with plastic wrap and incubated at 28 °C for 4 days. F-Type and D-Type antifungal drugs were added to the agar pieces at a ratio of 1:5.

## Results
To validate our current knowledge, we built a database of F-type and D-type epitopes from databases of protein-protein interaction (PPA) proteins and developed a structural prediction system based on the B (nuclear translocation factor) and C (cellular targeting factor) domains (33. The database contained 19, 7, and 10 unique protein-protein interactions, respectively, that were common to all four F-type and D-type receptors, and 2, 2, and 2 F-type/D-type interactions that were unique to the B (nuclear translocation factor) or C (cellular targeting factor) domain. The F-type/D-type receptors contained two to three unique interactions, which were common to all four F-type and D-type receptors, and the D-type receptor contained two unique interactions, which were common to all four F-type and D-type receptors. Thus, we hypothesized that F-type and D-type receptors may interact with other receptors in the F-type or F-type/D-type/B (nuclear translocation factor or cellular targeting factor) or F-type and D-type receptors in the F-type/B (nuclear translocation factor or cellular targeting factor) receptor or F-type and D-type receptors, respectively.

We next analyzed the surface expression of the identified F-type and D-type receptors using a flow cytometry assay (34). When the F-type receptor was present in the plasma membrane of the healthy control, a substantial influx of fluorescent dye was observed, indicating the fluorescent signal was localized to the plasma membrane (Fig 2). A similar flow cytometry assay was performed using a rat serum antibody (Figure 2). The F-type receptor was also present in the plasma membrane of the HUVEC (data not shown). These results suggest that F-type and D-type receptors are not exclusively localized to the plasma membrane in F-type/D-type receptors but are also involved in the proinflammatory responses.


## Discussion
fumigatu. Moreover, transcription of a subset of F-type genes (F-C, F-A and F-G, respectively) was significantly upregulated in response to azole antifungal drug treatment in A. fumigatus. The expression of the F-type genes is regulated by multiple azole drug classes including the triazole, posaconazole, and posaconazole (29, 30). Furthermore, azole resistance is related to the upregulation of a subset of F-type genes in response to azole antifungal drug treatment (31).

The F-type genes involved in azole resistance are identified in A. fumigatus and are involved in azole drug resistance and azole resistance in other fungi (32). In contrast to A. fumigatus, expression of a small set of F-type genes was upregulated in response to azole antifungal drug treatment in A. fumigatus. However, the expression of the F-type genes involved in azole resistance is different in response to azole antifungal drug treatment in A. fumigatus. For example, in response to azole antifungal drug treatment in A. fumigatus, the expression of a subset of F-type genes was significantly downregulated (Figure 4A), while the expression of the other F-type genes was significantly upregulated (Figure 4B). A. fumigatus F-C, F-A and F-G, respectively, is required for synthesis of azole-type coenzyme A-containing nucleotides, whereas A. fumigatus F-A is required for the synthesis of azole-type coenzyme A-containing nucleotides (Figure 5). F-C and F-A are all important nucleotide coenzyme A-containing nucleotides in the DNA and are essential for the assembly of nucleotide coenzyme A-containing nucleotides (32). In A. fumigatus, the expression of a subset of F-type genes was significantly upregulated in response to azole antifungal drug treatment in A. fumigatus.
