## Abstract
Fungal and bacterial communities have a complex structure and are continuously reshaped by interactions between soil nutrients, biocrust and microbial factors. With the increased diversity of these environmental factors, there is a greater need to understand their roles in fungal community formation. By examining soil microbial communities, we found that root length influences fungal community composition. Fungal communities were more dependent on root length than bacterial communities. Relative to the control, the relative contributions of root length and bacterial community size were most pronounced for days, weeks and months. In soils with continuous growth, the relative contribution of bacterial community size was greater than that of fungal communities. Relative to controls, root length was not a determinant for bacterial community size or for soil bacterial community composition. A combination of available spectrophotometric approaches indicated that the relationship was more stable than continuously changing observation. In soils with continuous growth, the relative contributions of root length and the bacterial community size were more dependent on the soil nutrient.


## Introduction
Granulomatous fluid, granulomatous erythematous erythematous stomatitis (GSH) is a rare granulomatous condition which can lead to death within 6 months to life. Its incidence is highly prevalent in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and some Indian subcontinent provinces. There are around 25,000 cases and about 50% of cases are in South East Asia. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, productive cough, and/or erythema with or without headache. The symptoms of GSH are nonspecific, usually asymptomatic and often nonspecific, and may be present for 6 months to a year. The symptoms may be severe, and patients may die within a few days or more. GSH is a rare complication in immunocompromised patients and the most common is acute renal failure [1, 2]. The most common risk factors are immunosuppression, and/or organ transplantation.

Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is an opportunistic pathogen of rice, which is an important food source for many people worldwide. It is the most destructive disease that has been reported in the last 200 years [3]. It has a worldwide distribution. The infection starts with an inhalation of spores or conidia. The conidia differentiate into hyphae and establish a disease structure called the germ tube. The germ tube develops into an appressorium, a penetration peg, which forms the penetration wound.

The fungus is able to survive within the host and can survive in the environment for extended periods of time.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The C. neoformans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains used in this study are maintained in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) at the Department of Clinical Medicine, Seoul National University, Korea.

Cryptococcus neoformans strains and culture conditions
The C. neoformans strains used in this study were C. gattii wild type, C. gattii mutant, and <U+2206>cna1 mutant strains from the clinical isolate collection of the College of American Pathologists, admitted to the hospital from Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. Strains were cultured at 30°C on yeast-extract agar (YTA) or yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) plates.

To induce drug resistance, strains were inoculated on YPD agar plates containing 50 µg/ml of kanamycin. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The inhibition of drug resistance was confirmed by the presence of a clear zone around the colonies.

C. gattii strains
To test the inhibitory effect of the C. gattii strains on C. gattii, a murine model of disseminated candidiasis was used. The C. gattii strain was grown in YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. C.


## Results
To identify a potential aspergillus, the DNA sequences of these four aspergilli were sequenced using a GenBank Sequence Analyzer progra. The sequences of these aspergilli were used as queries to search for homologs of the fungal genes that are known to be present in fungal genomes. The results revealed that all four aspergilli have the same genome as the aspergillus species.

In order to confirm the presence of the fungal genes in these four aspergilli, a single set of isolates were selected for sequencing. The strain CBS19615 was selected for further analysis. The strain CBS19615 was previously used in the genome sequencing of aspergilli of several aspergilli [26, 27]. The CBS19615 strain was isolated from a wheat field in Indonesia. The CBS19615 genome sequence was shown to be unique and the isolate was named as Aspergillus terreus nigroboletus. In the analysis of the aspergilli, the two main bands of the aspergilli are overlapping. The aspergilli from the three aspergilli with the three most common species are grouped in the same cluster and are also found in the same cluster with the aspergilli from other species. This cluster also contains the aspergilli from the four aspergilli (Table 1). This analysis showed that the four aspergilli are grouped in two clusters.

The DNA sequence analysis showed that the aspergilli in the three aspergilli of each species are distinct. The three aspergilli in the four aspergilli are grouped in a cluster with the aspergilli from the aspergilli from the aspergilli from the other species. The aspergilli in the aspergilli from the aspergilli from the other species are found in a cluster with the aspergilli from the aspergilli from the other species. The clusters were clustered into three clusters (Table 1). The cluster was found to be distinct from the clusters in which the three aspergilli were isolated.


## Discussion
is distributed in the different species of aspergilli, suggesting that this species represents a suitable biological system for the investigation of the aspergilli as well as the fungal isolate. In addition, the aspergilli from the Pannicataceous Terrestris species were tested against the various fungi and they were found to be resistant to all tested strains. The aspergilli of the Pannicataceous Terrestris species were also tested against the isolates of Candida species, Rhodotorula spp. and Aspergillus spp. by culture-dependent methods and by an aspergilli-specific primer pair, which has been used to obtain all Aspergillus terreus Nigroboletus Nigroboletus sakuranagamensis isolates and is used to identify fungal species from which to perform a screen to identify fungal strains with high susceptibility (61). The aspergilli of the Pannicataceous Terrestris species were tested against the different fungi tested and they were found to be resistant to all the tested strains. The aspergilli of the Pannicataceous Terrestris species were also tested against the isolated strains of S. aureus (31) and Candida spp. (15). In addition, the Pannicataceous Terrestris species were tested against the isolates of C. albicans (14) and S. pyogenes (23). All these fungal species were found to be resistant to the tested fungal strains.

The Pannicataceous Terrestris species were tested against the Pannicataceous Terrestris strains and were found to be resistant to all the tested fungal strains. In addition, the Pannicataceous Terrestris isolates were tested against the Pannicataceous Terrestris strains and were found to be resistant to all the tested fungal strains. The Aspergillus terreus S. sakuranaga sp. is also distributed in the species of Pannicataceous Terrestris and is isolated from the Pannicataceous Terrestris species. The Aspergillus terreus sakuranaga sp. has been reported as a potent fungal fungicide (32).
