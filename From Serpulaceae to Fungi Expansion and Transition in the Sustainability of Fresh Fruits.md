## Abstract
We report the first case of unilateral porcine IFN-gamma-binding protein (P3BP) autoantibodies in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient with non-focal aspergillosis (NP)-immune miliary lesions. Porcine IFN-gamma protein (PigP) was identified in blood from 76 patients with NP. The diagnosis of NP-immune miliary lesions was based on tissue findings and not on the presence of PigP autoantibodies. The IgG and IgM levels of Porcine IFN-gamma proteins were increased in serum and were elevated in the spleen and liver from treatment with 100 mg/L of a porcine anti-PIg (PigP-IP) monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1A3. IgG was sera low in all treated patients, while IgM levels were high in all NP-immune miliary lesions patients and were elevated in the spleen and liver from treatment with MAb M13/A3 (PigP-IP-IP-M13) (MAb 1A3). Immunodiffusion was not a diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of NP-immune miliary lesions. Autoantibodies to IgG and IgM were not detected in serum or the spleen from treatment with IgG-IP-IP-M13 (MAb 1A3) or IgM-IP-IP-M13 (MAb 2A3), but antibodies to IgG were not detected in the liver or kidney from NP-immune miliary lesions patients.


## Introduction
The genus Oidium, O. rubus, O. biessence, O. terreus and O. tenuieri are considered the most important filamentous fungi known to grow on plant materials. Numerous species of O. rubus are also known to grow on various substrates including fruit, bark, stems, leaves and flowers. Some species can be found on branches, vegetables, herbs and animals. Some species also cause diseases in humans.

O. rubus is a member of the Oidium rubus complex that is found on different substrates. It can also cause superficial and potentially lethal infections on the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes of the mouth and upper respiratory tract. O. rubus has a worldwide distribution, causing diseases in humans, animals, birds, reptiles, plants and other animals. O. rubus is responsible for the severe skin diseases, such as pityriasis versicolor, bacteremia, phaeohyphomycosis, keratitis, atopic dermatitis and ocular infections. O. rubus has a worldwide distribution and has been isolated from almost all substrata, especially fruit, bark and leaves of various plants. However, O. rubus is considered an important pathogen because of its aggressiveness, resistance to common drugs and its high susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs.

Although O. rubus is known to be the most successful pathogen on plant material, it is also responsible for causing several other diseases that are difficult to treat. The most significant diseases are those caused by O. acridum, O. restrepiensis and O. betraracearum. Other O. rubus species are found in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. The distribution of O.


## Methods
The previous study showed that the Southeastern Pacific coastal area is not suitable for the growth of citrus fruits in terms of the disease severity and disease severity, which are increasing in Malaysi.

The study was conducted with the aid of the Department of Conservation and Forestry of Malaysia (CCIFM), University of Malawi (Malaysia). It was arranged in accordance with the local authority guidelines. In brief, citrus trees of the Southeastern Pacific coastal region were selected for a sampling experiment.

Three species of Fruits (Fagus sylvatica, Fusarium sylvatica and Fusarium sylvatica) were selected for the study. They are listed in Table 1. The selected fruit trees were randomly selected and were placed in the study plots. The trees with a green cover of white fruit pulp, with a yellow/red coloration, were selected for the study. The trees were collected at the Botanical Gardens, Government of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, from September 2016 to January 2017. The trees were maintained in the Department of Plantation, University of Malawi (UPM), University of Malawi.

The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the National Research Council and the Malaysian Association for the Assessment and Utilization of Horticulture (MAHEA). The study was approved by the UPM Research and Ethics Committee (MCA/2013/1913). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The samples were collected in a plastic container (12 cm × 4 cm) and were placed in a clean sterile container (8 cm × 2.5 cm). The samples were immediately placed in a sterile container (1.5 cm × 3 cm) and were allowed to dry at room temperature. The samples were placed in a plastic container (15 cm × 4 cm) and were allowed to dry at room temperature. The containers were air-dried for a period of 3 days.

The samples were also placed in a clean plastic container (10 cm × 5 cm) and were allowed to dry at room temperature. The samples were placed in a clean plastic container (20 cm × 10 cm) and were allowed to dry at room temperature. The samples were stored at room temperature (25 °C) until further use.


## Results
veronii as a potential source for fumonisin and . vulgaris as a source of fungal pathogens, we propose the establishment of two new banana varieties: P. vulgaris and P. veronii (Table 2). The banana varieties are named as follows: P. veronii (introduced as P. vulgaris) and P. veronii (constructed as P. vulgaris). The concept of a new banana variety is most appropriate for the management of the new banana varieties because it can be a serious threat to the quality of fruit. To guarantee the existence of P. veronii as a potential source of fungal pathogens, fruit must be prepared before starting fresh fruit production. The banana varieties have been widely used for the management of fruit diseases such as dandruff, dandruff-related complaints, and fruit rot, as well as for the protection of the environment and healthy lifestyle of fruit [18]. Therefore, we propose to establish two new banana varieties, P. veronii (introduced as P. vulgaris) and P. veronii (constructed as P. vulgaris), by introducing the new fruit must as the first choice for the management of dandruff, dandruff-related complaints and fruit rot, as well as for the establishment of a new banana variety by introducing P. vulgaris as the first choice for the management of dandruff, dandruff-related complaints and fruit rot. The establishment of a new banana variety by introducing P. vulgaris as the first choice for the management of dandruff, dandruff-related complaints and fruit rot, is highly desirable [19,20,21]. The banana varieties are already considered a threat to the health of banana plants [22,23]. These problems can be resolved by using the development of new banana varieties. However, fruit must be prepared before starting new fruit production to ensure the preservation of the healthy lifestyle of banana plants. The establishment of new banana varieties should be completed in a timely manner, by adding fresh fruit into fresh fruit production.

## Discussion
It was then postulated that species belonging to these phyla may be important to the ecosyste. A total of 14 phyla were detected in the soil samples, including 16 phylotypes belonging to 4 phylotypes of the phyla Blastocladiella and Epicoccum. This is a species-rich ecosystem in which many species are abundant and have been associated with several forest species. The Fungi have been found in soils from soil in California and the Fungi are of great ecological significance to agricultural areas of California, such as the almond and apple stands in Santa Catalina, CA [25]. Furthermore, Fungi were identified in almond trees from the South Pacific Ocean [26] and in almond trees from the Pacific Ocean in Australia [27]. The Fungi are considered beneficial saprophytes that fix a variety of plant metabolites, including sugars and amino acids [28].

The presence of several phylotypes of the phylotypes Blastocladiella, Epicoccum and Aspergillus species in the soil samples may be related to the production of alcohols and fatty acids by these fungi. The presence of these phylotypes is associated with the production of bioactive compounds such as melanin and cellulose in these fungi. Additionally, the availability of sugars and amino acids in the soil may provide microbial biomass for Fungi and other microbial communities.

The total number of phylotypes identified in the soil samples from three locations (Sacramento, California, San Francisco and New York) was as follows: phylotypes Aspergillus, Chrysozyma, Saccharomyces, Cryptococcus and Sphingobium. The phylotypes Cryptococcus and Sphingobium were not detected in the soil samples of San Francisco and New York, but they were detected in the soil of San Francisco. This suggests that they may play an important role in the soil ecosystem of the United States and that they are present in this soil.

The phylotypes Cryptococcus, Epicoccum, Saccharomyces and Cryptococcus were not detected in the soil samples of San Francisco and New York. However, they were detected in the soil of San Francisco.
