## Abstract
An international survey of panfungal strains using culture-dependent methods was conducted to determine the diversity and phylogeny of the genera Botrytis cinerea, B.uberbicola, B.ygosterensis, Burkholderia cepatia, Colletotrichum blattae, Fusarium graminearum and G. circinelloides, in the genera Lepidella and Rhizoctonia. Based on DNA sequence data of the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU, 28S) and the internal transcribed spacers and par large subunit genes, the species F. circinatum is recognised in the genera Botrytis, B. cinerea, B.ygosterum, B.uberbicola, B.ygis, B.ygis bispora, B.ygopancen, B.usielloides, B.yanidiali, B.vincristinum and B.yunnanum. The genus Fusarium is restricted to the genera Botrytis, B. cinerea, B.ygosterum, B.uberbicola, B.ygis, B.yanidiali, B.virginalis and F.cinerea. The genus Rhizoctonia is restricted to the genera B.cinerea, B.clypeum, B.virginalis, B.yanidiali, B.


## Introduction
The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased over the past decades due to the widespread use of immunosuppressive therapy. It is now recognized that cryptococcal infection is an important complication in AIDS patients [1-4]. In Brazil, the largest country in Latin America where the majority of cryptococcal cases occur, there is a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis [5]. It is unclear if the elevated risk of cryptococcal meningitis is due to an underlying cryptococcal infection and its inflammatory features, the underlying condition, or an immune defect. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the association of the cryptococcal meningitis test results and immune defects with the cryptococcal infection.


## Methods
A total of 113 . fumigatus clinical isolates from China were included in this study, which included clinical isolates CEA10, CEA10-6, CEA10-13, CEA10-14, CEA10-15, CEA10-16, CEA10-20, CEA10-21, CEA10-23, CEA10-28, CEA10-30, and CEA10-33. These strains were previously cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30°C (C. neoformans) for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The cells were then suspended in RPMI-1640 medium containing L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL.

Candida albicans ATCC 90028, A. fumigatus ATCC 25923, and A. fumigatus ATCC 204304 were obtained from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) and stored in -80°C until use. The isolates were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth at 37°C and subcultured once a day for 7 days. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium containing L-glutamine and 10% FBS.

Antifungal Activity of Ampicillin against A. fumigatus
The A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus isolates were obtained from the Chinese Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates CEA10-6, CEA10-14, CEA10-15, and CEA10-20. The fungal strains were previously cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth at 37°C for 24 h. The cultures were then diluted and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), and the inoculum was adjusted to 1 × 10^4 CFU/mL.

Antifungal Activity of Ampicillin against A. fumigatus
The antifungal activities of Ampicillin against A. fumigatus were evaluated by the method of Hsheng et al.


## Results
% in the cohort with early death (n = 2), .5% in the cohort with early death (n = 3), and 2.5% in the cohort with early death (n = 3). No difference in the percentage of deaths between the first and the second year was observed.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningitis
A total of 466 (7.9%) patients were diagnosed with Cryptococcus meningitis. The median age was 58.3 years (range, 20-91 years) (Table 3). The median initial diagnosis was cryptococcal meningitis based on CSF culture results. There were 464 (1.9%) patients with CSF culture results of cryptococcal meningitis. The median initial diagnosis was cryptococcal meningitis based on CSF cryptococcal antigen results. There were 466 (7.9%) patients with CSF CSF culture results of cryptococcal meningitis. There were 467 (1.7%) patients with CSF CSF culture results of cryptococcal meningitis. There were 713 (5.2%) patients with CSF CSF culture results of non-cryptococcal candidiasis.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningitis
The median age was 50.3 years (range, 15-60 years) (Table 4). There were 548 (3.6%) patients with CSF culture results of cryptococcal meningitis. The median initial diagnosis was cryptococcal meningitis based on CSF culture results. There were 436 (3.9%) patients with CSF culture results of non-cryptococcal candidiasis. There were 469 (1.5%) patients with CSF CSF culture results of cryptococcal candidiasis. There were 472 (1.6%) patients with CSF CSF culture results of non-cryptococcal candidiasis.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningitis
The median age was 57.6 years (range, 27-77 years) (Table 4). There were 516 (2.5%) patients with CSF culture results of cryptococcal meningitis. The median initial diagnosis was cryptococcal meningitis based on CSF culture results. There were 459 (3.


## Discussion
The therapy is then continued for one to two week. Treatment begins when a cryptococcal antigen test is positive for cryptococcal antigen in blood or urine samples.

Cryptococcus neoformans can be difficult to diagnose, as it is difficult to distinguish from C. gattii and C. albicans in clinical specimens (5). One recent study by Tomita et al. has reported that a fluconazole-based treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans infection was successful in patients with C. gattii infection (7). Although the treatment is not specific, fluconazole can be administered as a consolidation phase treatment with fluconazole in conjunction with amphotericin B and/or flucytosine for at least two weeks (7).

The most common clinical presentation of cryptococcal meningitis is headache, fever, and vomiting. Other common symptoms include altered mental status, altered physical and mental status, altered consciousness, and altered laboratory workup. Other common findings include neck pain, altered mental status, and seizures (5).

The most common symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis in Japan are headache, fever, and vomiting, with the most common presenting symptom being neck pain. Fever is a common presenting symptom of cryptococcal meningitis, which is clinically indistinguishable from other diseases (4). Headache can also be caused by cryptococcomas, such as asthma or neurosyphilis (4). In the current study, we observed an increased incidence of cryptococcomas in patients with cryptococcomas in the setting of cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcomas are typically caused by C. neoformans and C. gattii, and can present as white lesions in the brain. It is possible that cryptococcomas may also be caused by other infectious agents, including cryptococcal meningitis. Our patient’s condition was quite good, with a complete resolution of symptoms with no apparent neurological signs.

Our patient had a history of meningitis. This was a common presentation for cryptococcomas, including headache, fever, and vomiting.
