## Abstract
The sponges have been recognized as a rich source of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of various diseases. The use of these plants has been validated for the prevention of fungal infections, as well as for the treatment of other neglected diseases. This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding the use of the sponges as therapeutic agents for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases, including fungal infections.

## Methods
The method consists of two steps: one is the preparation of the co-culture, followed by the addition of the substrate (yeast extract, glucose or casein as substrate) and the second one is the co-culture incubation for 48 h at 30 °C, which is the incubation period of co-cultur. The effect of co-culture on the bioactivity of yeast cells was determined by measuring the absorbance of each well. The bioassay was carried out on each of four biological replicates of 50 µg/mL of co-culture, using co-culture as substrate. The concentration of co-culture that caused a decrease in biofilm growth (log mean reduction (LMRD)) was calculated by dividing the mean biofilm growth of the control group was treated with the same amount of substrate. The results are presented as the mean ± SD.

## Results
It has been reported that co-composting microorganisms are capable of producing a wide spectrum of biomolecule. Co-composting microorganisms are often found to be able to survive and proliferate at high temperature, which is conducive to their enhanced growth and development. Co-composting microorganisms have been described as resistant to the protection afforded by the preservation of environmental variables. Co-composting microorganisms have also been reported as able to adapt to changes in temperature and carbon source [1]. The use of high temperature as a temperature stressor has been associated with rapid adaptation of microorganisms to different environmental conditions [4]. In this study, co-composting microorganisms were found to be more sensitive to a range of stresses, from chemical stress to high temperature (Fig 5). In general, co-composting microorganisms showed more sensitivity to various stresses, such as heat stress, oxygen depletion, high salt and high temperature, than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). The growth of co-composting microorganisms was found to be inhibited in the presence of high temperature (Fig 5), indicating that co-composting microorganisms were capable of maintaining a wide range of environmental stress conditions.

Co-composting microorganisms showed less sensitivity to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). Co-composting microorganisms showed more sensitivity to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). The growth of co-composting microorganisms was inhibited in the presence of high salt stress (Fig 5), indicating that co-composting microorganisms were able to survive and thrive at high salt stress.

Co-composting microorganisms were also found to be more susceptible to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). Co-composting microorganisms showed more susceptibility to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). Co-composting microorganisms showed less sensitivity to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5). In addition, co-composting microorganisms showed more susceptibility to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5).

Co-composting microorganisms were also found to be more susceptible to high salt stress than the control microorganisms (Fig 5).


## Discussion
neoformans and . albicans at pH 5.4 and 37°C is a typical feature of C. albicans, as the enzyme is expected to hydrolyze the fungal cell wall. Additionally, the lipophilic nature of the C. albicans cell wall in co-culture has been shown to inhibit the activity of its phospholipase C and subsequent enzymes of C. albicans biofilm formation (Frisch et al. 2007). However, our results showed that the enzyme activity of C. albicans strains isolated from Ruxolitinib biotechnology has a very low and very low activity at pH 5.4 (15.2 and 0.0). This may be due to the fact that Ruxolitinib is a non-specific, non-acid-tolerant, non-cofactor for C. albicans (and some other C. albicans strains) (Bänzahl et al. 2008). Another reason could be that the enzyme is not present in the cell wall of C. albicans, which may explain the lower activity of C. albicans.

In addition to the activities of enzymes and lipids, the enzyme activity of C. neoformans was significantly decreased in co-culture with P. aeruginosa at pH 5.4 and 37°C. The activity of P. aeruginosa is one of the main antimicrobial enzymes in the cell wall of S. aureus (Gonçalves et al. 2008). This suggests that the enzymes are not able to degrade the cell wall and that the enzyme activity of P. aeruginosa is related to its cell wall. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent and most important antimicrobial enzyme in the cell wall of S. aureus (Khan et al. 2005). Furthermore, the enzyme activity of P. aeruginosa was significantly decreased in co-culture with C. albicans at pH 5.4 and 37°C. This suggests that the enzyme activity of P. aeruginosa is related to the cell wall.

The presence of P. aeruginosa in the Ruxolitinib biotechnology has also been reported in biofilms formed by other yeasts (Gao et al. 2011).
