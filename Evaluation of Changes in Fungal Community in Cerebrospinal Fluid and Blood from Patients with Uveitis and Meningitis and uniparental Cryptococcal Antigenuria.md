## Abstract
Aneuploidy is an essential feature of eukaryotes. In animals with polyploidia, cells of opposite mating type typically display both progeny and as many as four progeny. However, in humans where cross-differences between the two progeny can be detected, the number of progeny can be variable. In fungi where crosses between the two progeny have limited growth and are therefore a large barrier to diagnosis of uveitis or meningitis is usually small. Here we report the case of a 74-year-old man who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) and had a healthy progeny. The combination of symptoms and high clonality was a feature of uveitis. Despite treatment, the son showed only mild symptoms, thus underlining the risk of cross-reaction and the need for careful patient selection. In humans where cross-differences between progeny and under-appreciated progeny can be detected, the number of progeny can usually be discriminated accurately and we can perform progeny “clinical characteristics” screening by a standardized algorithm. The results of our algorithm were comparable to those obtained by clinical tests, indicating that the case of the under-appreciated progeny is comparable to that of the fully sequenced sonoma. Our case emphasizes the importance of the choice of treatment as the treatment of uveal uveitis or meningitis is rarely seen in human studies and the algorithm presented in our paper may not be able to replace the therapy of the under-appreciated progeny.


## Introduction
For instance, increased CRAG1 gene expression was found in patients with uveitis and meningiti. In contrast, the changes in CRAG2 gene expression correlated with other inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis and allergic airway hyperreactivity (AKH) [20], [21]. Additionally, CRAG2 expression has been detected in patients with septicemia, and thus, CRAG2 is frequently considered as a potential biomarker of the disease status, especially in patients with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) rejection [22].

In general, the normal microbiota (i.e. the microbiota) is highly active in the urinary tract and is responsible for the colonization of the urinary tract, urinary tract biopsy, and other tissues [23]. However, in patients with diseases such as uveitis, inflammation, or septicemia, the normal microbiota may be compromised. In addition, the microbiota may affect the quality of life and affect the immune system, resulting in the development of various inflammatory conditions such as, nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and inflammatory demyelinating bowel disease (IDCD). IDCD is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder characterized by intestinal mucosal injury and mucus plugging and is characterized by involuntary contractions of the gut mucosa, which may or may not be accompanied by symptoms of inflammation, colitis, or an overgrowth of mucus [24].

At present, the majority of studies have focused on the effect of immune recovery on the gut microbiota, however, the role of immune recovery on the gut microbiome remains controversial, and the exact contribution of immune recovery is poorly understood. In this study, we compared the changes in the microbiota of the fecal swabs of patients with IDCD with those of healthy controls and found that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was associated with IDCD severity. A non-exclusive group of patients with IDCD was recruited from a large collection of fecal swabs collected from the stool of healthy individuals to evaluate the effect of immune recovery on the gut microbiota. The effects of immune recovery on the gut microbiota were tested by correlating the changes in the bacterial and fungal communities with the changes in the levels of total cholesterol, total amino acids, and glycine.


## Methods
Each experiment was repeated three times and each set was analyzed with three independent experiment.


## Results
The following groups of antifungal peptides were included in CACA: CAAG-labeled peptides (PPA, GTP, and Zn-SNP), antifungal peptides, and FAs: CAAG-labeled peptides, CAAG-labeled peptides, and FA.


## Discussion
However, the results obtained from multivariate analysis indicated a significant difference in the number of fungal species in the blood of patients with . pneumoniae infection. The results showed that the fungal community in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Uveitis and Meningitis was significantly different. The results suggest that the number of fungal species in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Uveitis and Meningitis was significantly different. This result further strengthens the hypothesis that fungal community in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection is significantly different from the general population.

The antifungal resistance to azole drugs, especially fluconazole, is closely related to the fungal colonization in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial infection, although the data concerning resistance in fungal infections are not yet available. In the present study, the antifungal resistance to fluconazole and azole drug was significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection. The results of our study showed that the antifungal resistance to fluconazole and azole drug was significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection. The results also showed that the antifungal resistance to azole drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection was significantly higher. Our results are in agreement with the results of a previous study on the antifungal resistance of Candida albicans to fluconazole and itraconazole, in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection. The results indicated that the antifungal resistance to fluconazole and azole drug was significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection. This result further strengthens the hypothesis that the antifungal resistance to fluconazole and azole drug was significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with M. pneumoniae infection.

The antifungal resistance to antifungal drugs is associated with the lack of tolerance to antifungal drugs, particularly fluconazole, which is a potent antifungal drug. The data indicated that the antifungal resistance to fluconazole was significantly higher in patients with M. pneumoniae infection.
