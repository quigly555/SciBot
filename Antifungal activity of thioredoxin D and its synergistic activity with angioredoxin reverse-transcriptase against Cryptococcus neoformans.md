## Abstract
The Cryptococcus gattii species complex contains several species of fungi with different mating types (MAT) loci. The MAT loci for Cryptococcus are ancestral, divergently arranged, and recombining over time. The molecular genetic mechanisms that have been identified to date do not fully account for their ancestral regions. The current revision of the molecular genetics of the Cryptococcus species complex includes: 1) identification of mating loci by sequence similarity-specific comparative analysis of five mitochondrial loci; 2) description of mating loci that are unusual in the two species complexes and contribute to unique phenotypic traits; 3) identification of eight genes that are unusual for this species and contribute to the unique genic traits of this species; and 4) genetic validation of these 8 genes. Cryptococcus species complex members include numerous strains with different mating types and a number of strains that are not homozygous, mutatorous, homozygous, or mutated. These features, along with the numerous unique strains that may be involved, have led the authors to include the Cryptococcus mating locus only in the MAT of this species complex.


## Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are secreted by virtually all types of organisms, including bacteria and fungi, and have a wide range of modes of action. They are involved in several processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival (Wisplinghoff, 1995). AMPs have diverse biological activities and are involved in many important physiological processes including growth, metabolism, apoptosis, immunology, and wound healing (Rispail and Stebbinghoff, 1997). Several types of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been studied in detail. They are classified as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are either cytotoxic (pathogen-associated molecular patterns), antimicrobiallytic (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or non-cytotoxic (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) (Clayton and Debeau, 2003). In this review, we will discuss the latest advances on the classification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of AMPs and the effects they have on the development of antimicrobial therapy.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are characterized by the ability to persist and spread within the host cell, whereas the non-cytotoxic PAMPs have a less defined life cycle and are more likely to persist and disseminate through the bloodstream and other organs (Fernandes et al., 2005; Peleg et al., 2006). Non-cytotoxic PAMPs are composed of a relatively small number of cAMP molecules, which are distributed across all biological kingdoms, including bacteria, fungi, and other eukaryotic cells (Hoffmann et al., 2006). The characteristics of antimicrobial peptides and AMPs have been extensively studied in bacteria, where many have different biological activities, and where they are of interest for their pathogenicity. For example, bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to be able to produce membrane-bound molecules, termed anti-viral molecules (Kendrick, 2013), which are able to kill the bacteria.


## Methods

Expression of Cdc42::Cdc42-Rho gene in . irregularis
Expression of Cdc42::Cdc42-Rho (Cdc42) was expressed in R. irregularis by plating onto PDA plates. Cells were grown at 25°C for 3 days. Then, the culture was diluted with water to OD_600 = 0.4. Then, the culture was exposed to light and a 100 µl aliquot of culture was spread onto PDA plates containing 1% Angioredoxin D. Then, the plates were incubated at 25°C for 24 h and the C. neoformans colonies were counted. The probability of survival was estimated as a Kaplan-Meier method.

Quantitative PCR
The expression levels of the Cdc42 gene in R. irregularis were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as described by Roeder and Zueslin [53]. The cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 µg of total RNA using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). The qPCR reactions were performed with the GeneAmp PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR primers are shown in Table S1.

Phylogenetic analysis
The sequences of C. neoformans and C. gattii (CGC43) were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers: CGC43.1; CGC43.2; CGC43.3; CGC44.2; CGC44.3; CGC45.2; CGC47.2; CGC47.3; CGC47.4; CGC47.5, and CGC48.3; CGC49.3). The sequences of C. gattii were obtained from the Fungal Genome Initiative (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fgi/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with MEGA version 5.0. The neighbor-joining tree was reconstructed using the rapid bootstrap method [54]. The trees were displayed in FigTree v1.4.4.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the software package STATISTICA v5.0.


## Results
 µM) to inhibit the growth of . neoformans. We investigated whether thioredoxin D (1.0 µM) inhibited C. neoformans growth by inhibition of the growth of the fungal cell line J774.1 (Figure 1A). C. neoformans was cultivated in YM medium supplemented with 10 µM thioredoxin D. The growth of C. neoformans was inhibited by increasing the thioredoxin D concentration to 5 µM. The fungal growth was inhibited by increasing the concentration of 5 µM to 10 µM, but the growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 100 µM. The growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 50 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D, as the growth was inhibited by increasing the thioredoxin D concentration to 5 µM (Figure 1B).

3.3. Thioredoxin D-Induced Growth Dissemination and Cell Wall Integrity in the Presence of Antifungal Drugs
In order to better characterize the effects of thioredoxin D-induced growth inhibition on the fungal cell wall integrity, we also investigated whether thioredoxin D-induced growth inhibition affects the fungal cell wall. As shown in Figure 2, the expression of CD80, the major negative component in the fungal cell wall, was significantly decreased in thioredoxin D-treated cells compared to control cells. The growth of C. neoformans was inhibited by increasing the thioredoxin D concentration to 10 µM. The growth was inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 100 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D. The growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 50 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D. The growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 100 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D. The growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 50 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D. The growth was not inhibited by increasing the concentration of 10 µM to 50 µM in the presence of 10 µM thioredoxin D.


## Discussion
 2017. It has been reported that thioredoxin D and its derivatives have antifungal activity against C. neoformans and C. gattii (Roe et al., 2005). However, in our study, the synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against Cryptococcus neoformans was not assessed.

The synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against C. neoformans is an interesting observation. We observed that the synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against C. neoformans was not due to the inhibitory effect of the drugs on the cell wall. However, the synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against C. neoformans was not due to the inhibitory effect of the drugs on the cell wall.

The studies on thioredoxin D and its derivatives show that the effect of thioredoxin D and its derivatives on the cell wall is mainly due to the inhibition of the cell wall components (Gadd et al., 2005; Geisseler et al., 2006). In addition, it was reported that the inhibitory effects of thioredoxin D on C. albicans were mainly due to its interaction with ß-1,3-glucan and glucan (Tsujimoto et al., 2014). The authors also showed that the cell wall components C-27-glucan and C-18-glucan were also inhibited by thioredoxin D, which may be due to the interaction with ß-1,3-glucan and glucan.

We also found that the synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against C. neoformans was due to the inhibition of the cell wall components, such as ß-1,3-glucan and glucan. However, the synergism of thioredoxin D and its derivatives against C. neoformans was not due to the inhibition of the cell wall components, such as ß-1,3-glucan and glucan.

It has been reported that the inhibition of the cell wall by thioredoxin D has an important role in the virulence of C. neoformans (Gadd et al., 2005). In addition, a Th1-type response has been observed for C. neoformans and C.
