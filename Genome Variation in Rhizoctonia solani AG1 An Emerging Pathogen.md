## Abstract
Plants are known to have many beneficial mechanisms for the treatment of cancer. The complex interactions between plants and cancer cells, as well as the mechanisms underlying cancer treatment remain poorly understood. The plant pathogen Colletotrichum gypseum is a major factor in various types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancer, and we here report the genome sequences of two lineages of the lineages, which are likely to represent the first incongruence of cancer-causing cells. We also show that a large proportion of the incongruent sequences are from non-cancer cells, which is surprising since most of the incongruent genes have been reported to be highly or exclusively acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from acellids. We hypothesize that the low density of the genome represents a result of the ancient acquisition of a wide range of novel genes and that the incongruent introgression of cancer-causing genes and/or products could be of assistance during genetic exchange, either between different strains or between different hosts. We also show that an increasing proportion of the incongruent sequences could be derived from the non-cancer cell line and may aid in the integration of genome-wide transcriptomics data to the design of molecular networks, such as cancer and the human pathogen.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogenic yeast that is found in the environment in all environmental niches. The spores are borne primarily by its alveolar epithelium and can be inhaled by humans, resulting in the development of meningitis. It is therefore of prime importance to prevent acquisition by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients and to investigate methods to prevent infection by this pathogen.

A variety of strategies have been used by professional phagocytes to control the yeast, including macrophage phagocytosis, cytokine production and antibody production. Macrophages have a dual-function role that involves cell-mediated immunity and are able to phagocytose and kill the yeast, leading to death of the host (1). In contrast, Th1 and Th2 immune responses against C. neoformans (Cn) are generally restricted to Th2 type and Th17 type cells, respectively. Consequently, a key step in the control of Cn infection by macrophages is the activation of these cytokines, which culminate in production of cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-22 by IL-18 and IL-23 by IL-24 (2). The activation of macrophages by Cn involves the induction of IL-1R and IL-18R, which are key mediators of macrophage activation (3).

Although the mechanisms involved in the control of macrophage phagocytosis and the induction of IL-4 and IL-13 by Cn are well studied, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of Cn infection. In this study, we report the first detailed knowledge of the macrophage response to Cn infection in macrophage.


## Methods
We use this species as a representative of the human group of Rhizoctonia specie. In order to distinguish between Rhizoctonia species from other Rhizoctonia species we used the Cryptococcus neoformans strain CEA10 [11] as a control. We used a genus-specific version of the species name to distinguish the Rhizoctonia species from the other Rhizoctonia species (CEA10: Cryptococcus neoformans).

Statistical analyses
SPSS (version 20; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. We used the Mantel-Cox test to compare the differences in frequencies of morphological changes between the groups of Rhizoctonia species and their relative frequencies among the Rhizoctonia species. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics, version 19.0. To identify differences in morphological changes between the groups of Rhizoctonia species between the two groups of Rhizoctonia species, we used two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. In the first group, differences in morphological changes were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for categorical data and Student’s t-test for continuous data. In the second group, the differences between the groups of Rhizoctonia species between the two groups of Rhizoctonia species were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous data. For the second group, differences in morphological changes were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for categorical data and the Dunn’s multiple comparison test for continuous data. The significance of differences between the groups of Rhizoctonia species was estimated using a two-tailed Student’s t-test for continuous data. Differences in morphological changes between the groups of Rhizoctonia species between the two groups of Rhizoctonia species were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for categorical data and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous data. In the second group, differences in morphological changes were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for categorical data.


## Results
We identified five clades in the phylogenetic tree of the fungal genom. The first clade included the basal clade of the Helotiales, Rhizomucor sp. P21, which is well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, and Fig S2). The second clade included the Helotiales and Trichoderma, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, and Fig S2). The third clade included Helotiales and Thermogastrema, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, and Fig S2).

The fourth clade included Helotiales, Trichoderma, and Thermogastrema, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, Fig S2). The fifth clade included the Helotiales, Trichoderma, and Thermogastrema, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, Fig S2). The final clade included the Trichoderma, Thermogastrema, and Helotiales, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, Fig S2).

The long-supported clade included the Helotiales, Thermogastrema, and Thermogastrema, which are well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, Fig S2).

The long-supported clade included the Helotiales, Thermogastrema, and Thermogastrema, which are both well separated from Helotia in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Fig S1, Fig S2).

We further analyzed the plant pathogenicity factor gene cluster using the PFAM phylogeny. We identified five genes that were highly conserved among the four plant pathogenicity factors.


## Discussion
The total number of RP genotypes identified in AG1-1 is similar to that of AG1-1 and that of the other two AG1 clade. However, the rate of RP genotype turnover is relatively lower in AG1-1 than in AG1-2. In AG1-2, RP genotypes that had been deleted at a low frequency were identified in 5.3% of the total number of genotypes. In AG1-2, the number of RP genotypes was reduced from 3.9% to 1.5% of the total number of RP genotypes. In AG1-3, the number of RP genotypes was reduced from 5.3% to 1.5% of the total number of RP genotypes. This reduction was similar to the rate of turnover in AG1-2 and AG1-3. This reduction in RP genotypes may be due to the genetic instability of Rhizoctonia solani AG1 and AG1-3, which are highly resistant to cell wall-damaging agents [31,32].

The number of RP genotypes in AG1-1 was similar to that of AG1-2 and that of the other two AG1 clades. However, the rate of RP genotypes turnover in AG1-1 was similar to that of AG1-2 and that of the other two clades. The decreased number of RP genotypes in AG1-1 and AG1-2 suggests that AG1-3 and AG1-3 are more resistant to cell wall-damaging agents than AG1-1 and that these two clades are more resistant to cell wall-damaging agents. In addition, the rate of RP genotypes turnover in AG1-2 was higher than that in AG1-1. This indicates that the strain AG1-3 may be more resistant to cell wall-damaging agents than AG1-1. However, the number of RP genotypes in AG1-2 was similar to that in AG1-1, suggesting that the strain AG1-3 is more resistant to cell wall-damaging agents than AG1-1.
