## Abstract
This study was designed to determine the incidence and prevalence of various opportunistic infections in children in Lilongwe, Malawi. The aim was to provide epidemiological data and to evaluate the quality of health services provided to HIV/AIDS adults in Lilongwe.

A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Lilongwe between August 2011 and July 2012. Data was collected through interviews of hospital staff, electronic medical records, clinical records, household surveys, community survey, and community-society reports. Data was cleaned and sanitized so that it can be readily retrieved elsewhere. Data was analyzed using Epi-Info 3.5.1 and Microsoft Excel.

A total of 448 children (median age 10 years, IQR: 4-12) were enrolled in the study, of which 448 (75%) were HIV positive and had not been treated in a previous episode of HIV infection in the past 6 months. Among the various data types, routine immunization information was used to request data on children’ prevalence of various opportunistic infections, risk factors for infection, use of the appropriate tools and provide diagnostic tests. About half of the children had received the recommended first line of antiretroviral therapy (ARV) in the study, which is known to the community for opportunistic infections. Amongst the various data types, the use of the NX-HODI-SMART viral co-receptor encephalitis testing system was the most common method of testing children for HIV infection. The prevalence of opportunistic infections among HIV positive children in Lilongwe was 2.9% (124) and that of the HIV negative children was 5.8% (73) in the study. There was no difference in the prevalence of various risk factors for infection among children in the study between those from Malawi (n=351) and those from Uganda (n=26) as shown by chi-square test, with children in particular from Malawi having a higher prevalence of fever of fever (6.5% vs. 0.6%, p=0.02) and headaches (11.4% vs. 0.7%, p=0.03) compared to those from Uganda.

The study showed that HIV screening and treatment in Lilongwe was associated with an increased prevalence of various risk factors for various forms of infection.


## Introduction
Aspergillus niger is a fungus that has been used as a plant pathogen for the last several decades as a biocontrol agent against a wide range of pathogenic fungi including black yeasts, filamentous fungi, and pathogens from different phyla. A. niger is a saprophytic mold found in nature and has been used as a biocontrol agent for a long time by humans. A. niger is a widely used pathogen and has been used in a number of different systems for the treatment of various diseases such as infections of the respiratory, central nervous system, and urinary systems [1-3].

A. niger is a heterotrophic fungus that is biotrophic and grows as a mold. This fungus can grow in different environmental conditions (liquid, brine, salt, oxygen, and temperature) as well as in the presence of host organisms, such as soil, deadwood, deadwood trees, and decaying trees. A. niger can also be found in a wide variety of environments such as soil, air, water, and lakes, which may be used as a biological control agent for fungal diseases. A. niger can cause infections in humans and animals, and in some cases have been reported to cause fatal infections in immunocompromised patients [4-6].

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a natural product of A. niger against a panel of pathogenic fungi and to investigate the potential of A. niger as an effective, biodegradable, and biodegradable drug.


## Methods
We used a carbon atom as the template for the application of a Nano Tool (NTA) device with a nano-scale microfuge, generating a mesh in a fraction of 1 mm^. The nanocomposite-based nano-scale microfuge is highly effective and could be used to quantify the quantification of carbon atoms on a nanoscale scale [30]. The Nanoscale Nano-Tool (NTA) tool has been used to quantify the carbon atom distribution in the NTA. It is designed to follow the shape and size of the carbon atoms, as well as the structure of the structural carbon atoms [30,31]. The tool is a rapid, integrated system that can be applied to a range of scales, from the terrestrial to the oceanic. The Nanoscale Nano-Tool is a powerful tool and can be used for quantification of chemical, physical, and biological systems. The Nano-Tool can be used to design and quantify complex graph and atom densities in a NTA grid [30,31].

All of the nanoparticles were dissolved in PBS and then combined with a nanoscale control solution, to obtain the concentrated nanoparticles. Nanospray was used to dissolve the dispersed nanoparticles. The concentration of dispersed nanoparticles was determined by a Nanoscale Nano-Tool (NTA) [30]. The concentrated nanoparticles were then tested for their stability on solid media. The nanospray was dissolved in PBS and then combined with a nanoscale control solution. The concentration of dispersed nanoparticles was determined by a Nanoscale Nano-Tool (NTA) [30]. The dispersed nanoparticles were then tested for their stability on solid media. The nanospray was dissolved in PBS and then combined with a nanoscale control solution. The dispersed nanoparticles were then tested for their stability on solid media. The nanopospray was dissolved in PBS and then combined with a nanoscale control solution. The dispersed nanoparticles were then tested for their stability on solid media.

Zeta potential, Zeta frequency, and particle size distribution
To determine particle size distribution, the samples were taken from the air, and then heated at 100 °C, for 2 min, and cooled at 100 °C, for 1 min, to obtain the Zeta Potential, Zeta Frequency, and particle size distribution.


## Results
. Chemistry
The sugarcane bagasse used in this study was prepared from solid fraction, which included the crude extract and Tween 80. In general, the Tween 80 is a colorless color. In addition, the color of the sugarcane bagasse was phenolic. The amount of Tween 80 was 0.3% and 0.2% when the fractions were submitted to shaking, respectively. These substances were further purified by normalization using a specific ion exchange chromatography. The purity of the purified sugarcane bagasse was above 90%. The activity of the purified sugarcane bagasse against P. aeruginosa was evaluated in the presence of an amide of methylene blue. The amide produced by the amide reaction gave the maximum activity at 100 µg/ml and was less toxic than the reducing agent. The effect of amide on P. aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa complex, and P. aeruginosa complex were also evaluated. The amide was more active than the reducing agent. The amide with the highest activity was the one with the lowest concentration. In the presence of the amide, the activity was higher than that with the reducing agent. The two different compounds were added to the solvent mixture and the product was analyzed by colorimetric chromatography. The reaction mixture showed significant color changes (Figure 1).

3.2. In Vitro Fungicidal Activity
The in vitro antifungal activity of the sugarcane bagasse was evaluated in an in vitro assay.


## Discussion
The largest expansion of the yeast gene pool in the yeasts, and in the saprophytes, is seen for the yeast-like LACN2, and by a narrow focus on the C. albicans strain H99 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In this model, the multiple exon splicing and the subsequent assembly of the genomic DNA are employed to generate a pool of ~100 LACN2 genes (Figure 3).

The Saccharomyces sensu stricto genome was divided into two subpopulations: those with the larger genomes (C. albicans and S. cerevisiae), and those with smaller genomes (Heteroloboseomyces hirsutum and S. commune). The size of the Saccharomyces sensu lato genome was approximately twice that of the C. albicans genome (21-27 Mb) (Figure 3A). Thus, we found that S. commune is an obligate aerobic species with a genome of approximately 10 Mb. This large size of S. commune is the largest genome in the basidiomycota, a group that includes the Ascomycota and the Tremellomycetes (Figure 3B). The genomes of S. commune and S. commune are ~30 Mb larger than C. albicans (~35 Mb), and thus their genomes have the potential to be as large as the S. commune genome.

To date, only three species, S. commune, S. octosporus and S. commune-have been reported to be able to synthesize bioactive compounds [12,21]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an obligate aerobic species that grows at high temperature and pH [22]. The fungus is a member of the Saccharomyces genus and has been reported to produce bioactive compounds such as thioglycan [23], alkanes [24] and alkanes-like compounds [25,26]. Bioactive compounds derived from these fungi are widely reported in literature, such as nitric oxide [27] and thioglycans [28], and are also considered to be bioactive.
