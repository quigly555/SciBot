## Introduction
TLR9 is able to sense and interact with several proteins such as protein kinases (PKBs), which function as effector proteins that regulate the response of the parasite to the hos. In this sense, TLR9 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of the parasite. In this sense, TLR9 can act as a regulator to regulate the response of the parasite to the host. In this sense, TLR9 can interact with proteins that are involved in the transport of enzymes, which are involved in the formation of biofilms and the establishment of a microenvironment. For example, TLR9 can regulate the expression of several virulence factors, including the production of melanin, the production of urease and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Kap-1 and Bdr1).

The majority of human diseases are caused by parasitic protozoan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Toxoplasma gondii. In humans, the development of disease depends on the interaction between the parasite and the host. The interaction between the parasite and the host can be observed in different stages of the infection process. However, the involvement of TLR9 in this interaction remains unclear.

Toxoplasma gondii is a basidiomycetous yeast that is found in the soil and in the blood of humans and other animals. Infection occurs by the inhalation of infectious propagules from the environment into the lungs. The infection starts with the inhalation of conidia from the pharynx. In the liver, a spherule named the aß-cells differentiate into the hyphal form of the parasite. The infection starts when these cells differentiate into yeast cells. In the lungs, the a-cells are found in the yeast form and they spread to other organs such as the brain, where the infection spreads and spreads throughout the body. In the brain, the infection starts in the leukocytes and spreads to other cells, such as lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PLDs). There are three main stages of the infection process. The first stage consists of the engulfment of the pathogen by the alveolar macrophage and the phagolysosome is found inside the phagolysosome.


## Methods
Therefore, the role of TLR9s in the maintenance of plasma lipid peroxides is now considered as a potential site of Toxoplasma gondii infectio.

The TLR9s are a polymorphic monomer in the green fluorescent protein family of Toxoplasma gondii [14]. The presence of a polymorphic TLR9 in Toxoplasma gondii is believed to be essential for the growth of T. gondii [15]. Therefore, the presence of a polymorphic TLR9 in T. gondii is considered an essential characteristic of the organism in the presence of Toxoplasma gondii.

Infection of T. gondii with Toxoplasma gondii was performed using the thioglycolate-mediated approach [16]. The thioglycolate-mediated technique was used to obtain a very stable plasmid containing a Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasma gondii-like protein, which was then transformed into T. gondii. The plasmid was transformed into T. gondii T-1 (TR3), T-2 (TR2), T-3 (TR3), and TR-4 (TR4) cells. The positive transformants were selected on YPD media supplemented with thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then cultured on YPD agar plates for 2 days at 30 °C. The number of yeasts was counted using a hemocytometer. The positive transformants were selected for subsequent DNA extraction. The thioglycolate-mediated procedure was repeated once more.

## Results
It is known that only a few genes involved in oxidative stress response (HAT, CSL1, CSP2) are required for Toxoplasma infectio. These genes are known to be downregulated in TLR9-deficient strains (Fig 2A).

To investigate the function of TLR9 in the response to infection, we constructed strains that lack the HAT-containing gene (HAT2) and tested its role in Toxoplasma infection. In a previous study, we found that TLR9 expression is induced in response to infection by human Toxoplasma (21). This gene is conserved in all eukaryotes and is involved in the production of cell wall and virulence factors. In yeast, it is encoded by the Tmhx gene, which is expressed at high levels (22).

To test whether deletion of HAT2 affected the response to infection, we generated a strain expressing the HAT2-tagged gene HAT2 in the <U+0394>hctl gene background (23). The virulence-related gene hctl1 is a transcription factor that is known to be upregulated in HAT2-deficient yeast (22). The results of our RNA-Seq analysis were consistent with the RNA-seq results. Our RNA-Seq analysis identified an increase in the expression of the HAT2-like transcription factor hctl1, consistent with the RNA-seq data. As shown in Fig 3, hctl1 transcript levels are higher in the <U+0394>hctl strain than in the <U+0394>mhx strain. These results are consistent with the RNA-Seq data, and the increased hctl1 transcript levels may be an indication of enhanced virulence.

TLR9 Expression Is the Same Genotype in Response to Infection with R. oryzae and R. oryzae-specific Strains
In order to further explore the role of TLR9 in the response to Toxoplasma infection, we measured expression of other TLRs, including the HAT2-tagged gene HAT2, in the <U+0394>hctl strain.


## Discussion
It is also the first report of the potential use of TLR9s as therapeutic targets in Toxoplasma infection. Here we report that TLR9s play a role in the development of Toxoplasma infection, as well as Toxoplasma infection in infected mice.

The role of TLR9s in infection has been studied in several pathogenic fungi, including Blastomyces dermatidis, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Blastomyces dermatidis [12]-[14]. In Toxoplasma infections, TLRs, like other innate immune receptors, are involved in host-pathogen interactions. TLR9s are involved in the regulation of the host-pathogen interaction. TLR9s are also implicated in Toxoplasma cell wall integrity and cytokine production [15]-[18]. The expression of TLR9s is upregulated in Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, as previously reported [19]. TLR9s also play a role in regulating intracellular pathogenicity of Toxoplasma spp. in human and mouse models [20]. In addition, the role of TLR4 in Toxoplasma infections has been investigated in several strains of Toxoplasma [20]. TLR4 is also involved in cell wall integrity, but its expression is not increased in Toxoplasma gondii infected mice [19].

We showed that the TLR4 gene is significantly upregulated in Toxoplasma gondii infected mice and it was significantly downregulated in infected mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii. The expression of the TLR4 gene was significantly downregulated in infected mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii. These data suggest that Toxoplasma infection is caused by infection with Toxoplasma gondii, but the mechanism is different from that of infection with Toxoplasma spp. [20].

In addition to TLR4, other receptors, including Dectin-1, Leu-C1, and TLR6, are involved in the production of IL-6 [21].
