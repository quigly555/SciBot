## Abstract
Several studies have been developed regarding the antifungal potential of plant extracts against human pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans and C. auris, the two common causes of common invasive candidiasis in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients worldwide. As a result, it is increasingly important to develop new antifungal strategies and novel drugs to overcome the common resistance and resistance to these fungi, which have become increasingly common in modern medicine. Moreover, the natural occurrence of many plant natural products, including extracts and the essential oil of plant origins, have been reported as potential natural sources of antifungal agents. In this context, it is important to analyze the possible effects of different plant chemical constituents on the bioavailability of different antifungal agents, in particular against Candida spp. and C. auris, the two common cause of common invasive candidiasis in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients worldwide. This review aims to provide an overview of the natural occurrence of plant extracts against human pathogens and the possible antifungal action of extracts and essential oils against these pathogens.


## Introduction
The ability of . albicans to grow in biofilm environment may be due to its metabolic flexibility, which allows the organism to use a wide range of carbon sources including glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins (12). The utilization of fatty acids is also an important source of biofilm formation as many studies reported that the increasing availability of omega-3 fatty acids is not only beneficial for the host, but also promotes the growth of biofilm cells, which is also beneficial for the host (13). Moreover, fatty acid metabolism has been shown to be an important factor for the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and neurodegeneration (14). The utilization of amino acids is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids as a contributing factor to the growth of biofilm cells (15). However, the utilization of n-3 fatty acids has been reported to be essential for the growth of C. albicans in biofilm environment as it is essential for the growth of C. albicans in the presence of fatty acids as the sole carbon source (16). The utilization of n-3 fatty acids is also crucial for the growth of C. albicans in the presence of fatty acids as the sole carbon source.

The beneficial role of n-3 fatty acids in the growth of C. albicans has been demonstrated for several years.

## Methods
Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PB. A final volume of 2 ml was added to each well, with the addition of 10 µl of PBS. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the number of CFUs was determined. The percentage of cells that grew to the indicated percentage was calculated by using the following formula:

2.5. Statistics
All experiments were performed in triplicate. The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.

2.6. Fungal Growth Curve
To analyze the growth of fungi, the inoculum was prepared by transferring the test fungus suspensions (1.0 × 10^5 CFU/ml) into Petri dishes containing sterile medium (0.67% yeast extract, 1.0 × 10^5 yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% dextrose, 1.0 × 10^5/ml) and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C. The plates were then transferred to a growth chamber and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The number of CFUs was determined. The fungal growth was considered to be stationary when it reached the stationary phase, and as a change of color when it reached the stationary phase. To determine the number of CFUs per milliliter, a blank was prepared in order to determine the fungal growth rate. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test.

2.7. Fungal Growth Curve
The endophytic fungi were cultured on PDA for 2 days. The culture medium was then removed, and the fungal cells were collected by filtration through Miracloth. The fresh fungal culture was mixed with the mycelium and the mycelium pellet was transferred to a sterile Petri dish containing PDA (1% agar, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% KCl, 0.1% MgSO_4, 0.2% KH_2PO_4, 0.01% CaCl_2, 0.01% ZnSO_4, 0.01% MnSO_4, 0.01% FeSO_4, 0.01% Na_3MoO_4, 0.


## Results
albicans (. neoformans and C. parapsilosis) were the most highly resistant to penicillin (Figure 4). Furthermore, the most resistant C. albicans strains to penicillin were C. glabrata (C. albicans CGMCC 2.3550), C. parapsilosis (C. neoformans CGMCC 2.3630), and C. glabrata (C. albicans CGMCC 2.3635).

Effect of penicillin concentration on the growth of C. glabrata

We evaluated the effect of penicillin concentration on the growth of C. glabrata using different concentrations of penicillin. We found that the highest concentration of penicillin (25 µg/ml) significantly inhibited the growth of C. glabrata in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 0.5 µg/ml penicillin, the growth of C. glabrata was significantly inhibited when 0.3 µg/ml penicillin was used. After 24 h of incubation, the growth of C. glabrata was significantly inhibited by 0.5 µg/ml penicillin. As shown in Figure 5, the growth of C. glabrata was significantly inhibited when 0.1 µg/ml penicillin was used. The lowest concentration of penicillin (25 µg/ml) significantly inhibited the growth of C. glabrata when 0.5 µg/ml penicillin was used. The lowest concentration of penicillin (25 µg/ml) significantly inhibited the growth of C. glabrata when 0.2 µg/ml penicillin was used. The lowest concentration of penicillin (25 µg/ml) significantly inhibited the growth of C. glabrata when 0.3 µg/ml penicillin was used.

We further evaluated the growth of C. glabrata in the presence of the different concentrations of penicillin in the absence and in the presence of 0.5 µg/ml penicillin. C. glabrata growth was significantly inhibited when the concentration of 0.2 µg/ml penicillin was used. After 24 h of incubation, the growth of C.


## Discussion

The majority of the bacterial species causing human fungal infections are capable of detoxifying and damaging free radicals [49. However, it was found that several of the strains of Cryptococcus spp. are capable of producing antioxidant enzymes, which are involved in the detoxification of free radicals [50]. Most of the other species in this group are considered to be opportunistic pathogens [51].

2.4. Protein Related Genes
The protein of proteins involved in oxidative and biotic stress responses, such as proteases, lipases, and lipases, was detected in the present study. Some of them are involved in stress response and cellular detoxification in fungi, including Aspergillus fumigatus [52], Penicillium expansum [53], and A. fumigatus [54]. However, it was found that they are only found in filamentous fungi and not in bacteria. Also, the protease gene was not detected in the present study, suggesting that it might be involved in the degradation of exogenous proteins.

2.5. Fatty Acid Metabolic Classification
The fatty acid metabolic pathways of S. aureus were analyzed in this study, including the fatty acid synthase and the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) pathways. The results showed that the fatty acid metabolic pathways are involved in the metabolism of triglycerides, fatty acids, and fatty acid esters. Among them, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is one of the key enzymes in the synthesis of aldehydes, which is one of the key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis [55]. In addition, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of aldehydes, which is one of the key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis [56]. In the present study, the fatty acid metabolic pathways of S. aureus were identified. It was found that the fatty acid metabolic pathways are involved in the metabolism of triglycerides, triglycerides, and triglycerides esters. Among them, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is one of the key enzymes in the synthesis of aldehydes, which is one of the key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis [57].
