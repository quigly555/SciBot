## Abstract
A 14-year-old previously healthy female presented to the ER with a 1-day history of dyspnea, cough, and dyspnea with hemiparesis. She had a seizure and was treated with multiple classes of antifungal agents, including fluconazole, and was subsequently diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) due to a milder form of the disease. After extensive workup, she was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis complicated by Pema-Schuster syndrome. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain lesions and multiple discrete nodules in the temporal quadrant. This was confirmed on histopathology as the pulmonary cryptococcosis was growing in parallel in both lungs. Pema-Schuster syndrome was successfully treated with fluconazole and antifungal therapy. This case illustrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with unexplained pulmonary symptoms and perform a detailed history when working up such an incongruent infection.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes disease in immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing organ transplantation, neutropenia, or chemotherapy. In the United States, the vast majority of HIV/AIDS patients are coinfected with C. neoformans. It is estimated that 10-25% of HIV/AIDS patients in the United States die from cryptococcosis. This is especially true in resource-limited settings where HIV-related opportunistic infections are prevalent.

In resource-limited settings, the most common symptoms of cryptococcosis are fever, productive cough, and productive skin lesions. These are usually associated with exposure to contaminated soil, hot, humid environments, contaminated water, exposure to contaminated animals, and contact with patients with compromised immune systems. In resource-limited settings, the other risk factors are malnutrition and use of broad-range antibiotics. There are a number of risk factors that may predispose patients to the development of cryptococcosis including, but not limited to: HIV/AIDS, prolonged hospitalization, use of corticosteroids, use of broad-range antibiotics, and broad-range immunosuppressive medications.

Cryptococcosis has been reported to affect immunocompromised patients in the setting of HIV/AIDS (eg, neutropenic patients) and in the setting of systemic corticosteroids (eg, amphotericin B) therapy (Santamaría et al., 2019). We present a case of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with systemic corticosteroids.


## Methods
Ethics statement
All animal studies involving human participants and controls were conducted in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 98-198; 128 Statutes of the United States of America, 17 U.S.C. App. 32) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (protocol #2014-07-01). The protocol for the rodent experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas Tech University (Protocol #2011-01).

Animals
Male C57BL/6 (BALB/c) mice (5-6 weeks old) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the University of Texas Health Science Center. They were housed in individual ventilated cages. The mice were provided with food and water ad libitum.


## Results
However, the literature suggests that CNS is not the primary mechanism to prevent cryptococcal meningiti. Thus, we next asked whether a central nervous system (CNS) is the primary mechanism to prevent cryptococcosis in immunocompromised patients.

In a previous study, we reported that the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was increased in immunocompromised patients receiving amphotericin B (AmB) or fluconazole (Flu) compared to non-immunocompromised patients [9]. To assess the efficacy of a central nervous system (CNS) for controlling cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients, we first compared the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. In a second study, we reported that immunocompromised patients receiving AmB or fluconazole had a more significant increase in cryptococcal meningitis compared to non-immunocompetent patients [17]. We next asked whether the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients would be associated with the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent patients.

We performed a multivariate analysis of risk factors for cryptococcal meningitis (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), adjusted for age, comorbidities, comorbidities, and treatment group) and the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent patients versus non-immunocompetent patients, with a multivariate logistic regression model of risk factors (AOR, adjusted for age, comorbidities, comorbidities, and treatment group) was established as the first independent risk factor for cryptococcal meningitis. As shown in Table 2, the AOR was 0.8-1.5 in immunocompromised patients and 0.8-1.2 in non-immunocompetent patients, while the AOR was 0.6 in immunocompetent patients and 0.8-1.2 in non-immunocompetent patients.


## Discussion
This association has been noted previously, with mortality rates ranging from 1 to 27% in HIV-infected individuals [18. A previous study also found that CD4^+ T cells are at higher risk for developing cryptococcosis when CD4^+ T cell counts are below 50 cells/µL [19].

A recent study also showed that CD4^+ T cell counts are significantly associated with mortality [20]. In this study, we found that there was a statistically significant association between CD4^+ T cell counts and mortality. This finding is in line with other studies that have shown a relationship between CD4^+ T cell counts and mortality in HIV-infected individuals with cryptococcosis [20, 21]. However, the association between CD4^+ T cell counts and mortality was not as strong, as was the association between CD4^+ T cell counts and a CD4^+ T cell death. Our study also found that CD4^+ T cell death was associated with a CD4^+ T cell survival of 4.8% in the absence of CD4^+ T cell counts. Thus, the relationship between CD4^+ T cell counts and CD4^+ T cell survival in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with previous studies.

Our study also found that CD4^+ T cell counts were significantly associated with increased mortality in HIV-infected individuals. This finding is in line with studies done in immunocompetent patients. In a previous study, we also found that CD4^+ T cell counts were significantly associated with increased mortality in immunocompetent individuals [20]. However, this was not a large study and we did not examine patients with CD4^+ T cell counts below 50 cells/µL. Therefore, we did not examine patients with CD4^+ T cell counts below 50 cells/µL.

Our study found that CD4^+ T cell counts were significantly associated with increased mortality in immunocompetent individuals. This finding is in line with previous studies that have found that CD4^+ T cell counts were significantly associated with increased mortality in immunocompetent individuals [20, 21].
