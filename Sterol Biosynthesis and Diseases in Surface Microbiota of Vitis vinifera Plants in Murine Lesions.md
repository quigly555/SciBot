## Abstract
Itraconazole is a well-accepted antifungal that has well-recognized medical and African origins. However, the bioactivity of azoles and other azole drugs is still poorly understood in South Africa, which has the means by which to offer effective antifungal therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the putative effects of the three major azoles in combination with itraconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus, and the possible mechanism by which it could be used as a natural or clinical alternative agent. Combination studies were conducted in eight clinical strains of A. fumigatus, as well as five clinical strains of A. niger NRRL 23189 and five clinical strains of A. niger NRRL 70028. All eight clinical strains were resistant to azoles, with a significant difference in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between the azoles used (50 and 250 µg/ml). The combination treatment did not affect the viability of A. fumigatus in two out of eight (90%) isolates, and azoles were not an option for the survival of outgroup. In conclusion, combination therapy with itraconazole showed to be an effective alternative for treating A. fumigatus infection in the laboratory, and in the clinic in the laboratory of a competent physician.


## Introduction
The sexual dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is a member of the phylum Candida albicans and is a major human fungal pathogen.


## Methods
The original species VvV was deposited in the Mycology Herbarium of the Institute of Botany, University of São Paulo and was named VvV-L. All VvV plants were purchased from local markets, where the VvV cultivar was used to differentiate VvV-L1-C (a black powder with a color resembling vinifera) and VvV-L2 (a black powder with a purple color resembling vinifera). The voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the Botân Tropicana State University.

Bacterial and fungal strains were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 37 °C and were harvested on the day of harvesting. The bacterial and fungal isolates were identified by morphological and molecular tests. The bacterial strains were maintained in 20% (v/v) glycerol at -80 °C and were inoculated into 2 ml of fresh PDA broth. The fungal strains were maintained on PDA plates at 25 °C.

Fungal growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA) was performed as described by S. N. Elongéra et al. [21] and in Bactec (Bactec™ Bactec™, México) and Gentra Puccini (Gentra™, México) medium. Bactec™ Bactec™ medium consists of 2% (w/v) glucose, 1.0% (w/v) peptone, 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) ammonium sulphate, 0.02% (w/v) ammonium sulphate, 0.02% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) glycerol at pH 6.5. The same medium was used for the determination of fungal growth on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium.


## Results
mucilaginosa, which were designed to characterize the fungal community in the surface microorganisms of the . vinifera clinical samples. The RT-PCR results indicated that all samples with high RNA abundance showed high levels of DSE. In addition, high levels of SSE and DSE were detected in all samples. The results indicated that all samples with high RNA abundance had high fungal diversity. The results were consistent with the microbial community results.

Comparative Analysis of Richness of the Mapping
The richness of the Mapping Analysis (AP) method was evaluated with the three rRNA gene regions, including five regions in the UMEC ITS region, one region in the E. coli, and three regions in the DSE region, using three different PPI-predicted primers. In addition, the AP method was used to evaluate the richness of the mapping and the PPI-predicted regions, respectively. The results showed that the richness of the mapping and the PPI-predicted regions was higher than the richness of the mapping region (Fig 3).


## Discussion
It has been reported that PEA and PSE1 are key enzymes in the accumulation of PGE_2 in marine brown algae (36. PGE_2 is an essential precursor of PGE_2 in plants (37). PGE_2 is produced by several cellular components including cell wall and cell membrane components in plants (38). In this study, we demonstrated that PGE_2 was accumulated in Vitis vinifera plants at both the vegetative and photorespiratory stages.

PGE_2 is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cell wall components in plants (39). In this study, we observed that PGE_2 was accumulated in Vitis vinifera plants at both the vegetative and photorespiratory stages. The accumulation of PGE_2 in plants could be related to the cell wall alterations which were observed during the vegetative and photorespiratory stages. The accumulation of PGE_2 could be linked to the presence of ROS in the plant cells. It is known that the expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase 1 (CAT1) is up-regulated in red algae during vegetative growth, but not during photorespiratory growth (40). Our data showed that PGE_2 accumulation in Vitis vinifera plants could be related to the increase in the production of PGE_2 in plants. Our results suggest that the accumulation of PGE_2 could be linked to the presence of ROS which could lead to the accumulation of PGE_2 in plants.
