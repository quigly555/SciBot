## Abstract
Itajahya is a member of Phallales (Dictyostelium pallidum), which is a notorious plant pathogen. Itajahya spp. represent the main flavonoids for a wide range of industrial and food products. Despite their evolutionary relationship with itajahya, there are still a limited number of commercial commercial alternatives for itajahya, and the gene clusters for itajahya are incomplete. The discovery of a functional genomics platform for the putative members of the genera of the genera of Phallales, which includes itajahya-like genera such as Phallidiella and Phallidiellopsis, has provided an opportunity to analyse the gene content and organisation of this diverse group of genera. Phallidiella sapomoniata, for example, has only four genes (2% of the total genes), and these genes are not assigned to any specific clusters of itajahya, such as the clusters of itajahya-like genera such as Phallidiella and Trichoderma. The Xylobasidiales, a group of the Agaricomycetes, are another group of the Agaricomycetes. These agaricomycete genera include the type species of Amaryocladosporium, the type species of Colophosporium, the type species of Drosophila, and the genera of Discosia, Cladoria, and Diaporthe. They are distributed in Europe and North America and are usually found in conifer-infested forests dominated by Phalaris, Eucalyptus, and Phylloporus. In recent years, itajahya diversity of the genera Sporidiobolus and Coniella has increased, and they are placed on the same or closely related evolutionary cluster of plesiomorphic fungi with Sordariomycetes.


## Introduction
The fungal genus Candida encompasses clinically important fungal pathogens of humans, plants and animals. Of the over 200 species of human and veterinary pathogenic yeasts, Candida spp. are responsible for over half of all human and veterinary candidemia (DiCosmo et al., 2012). Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a serious fungal disease with high morbidity, mortality and serious health care costs, and mortality due to systemic candidiasis is high (Baker and Johnson, 2002; Baker and Johnson, 2003; Uchida et al., 2014). The pathogenicity and antifungal activity of Candida spp. are largely due to their high cell density and cell-to-cell stability (Baker and Johnson, 2002; Uchida et al., 2014). Cell-to-cell communication is an important mechanism for the interaction of fungi and bacteria to form biofilm (Uchida et al., 2014). Fungal biofilms are extracellular networks that form between fungi and bacteria, forming a barrier between the infection and the environment. Conventional mucosal antifungals are ineffective against Candida spp. and are associated with serious adverse drug reactions (FAIR, 2011).

## Methods
They were prepared as described by Senhor et a. (2009). The cells were prepared by growing the Arabidopsis leaves in pots at 25°C for 6 days. The growth of Arabidopsis plants was done in the dark at 28°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000× g for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS and subjected to TEM by lysing the cells with 1% formaldehyde. The cells were washed again with PBS, and then the preparations were dried on a rotator at 40°C for 24 h. The dried cells were dissolved in 0.1% TritonX-100 and stored at -20°C. The cells were counted with a hemacytometer and diluted in PBS to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/ml. The cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/ml in PBS.

TEM was carried out by lysing the cells with 1% formaldehyde and washing the samples with PBS. Then, the cells were treated with LETS-SDS-PAGE and the dye was solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were then washed with PBS and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by a CellTek II. The samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and then with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and then with 0.5% BSA in PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody to the following proteins: GST-FITC, a 3'-UTR-binding protein (5'-AGAGTTTGATCGAATTCCTGGCTCTC-3'; Cy5.5-APCATCGTTGCTGGCCAGTTCC-3'; GST-FITC, a 3'-UTR-binding protein (5'-CTTCTCATCGAACACAAGAGC-3'; Cy5.


## Results
In the Arabidopsis extract from Isoar, four monocyte-like cell populations were observed, and in the other extracts the three monocyte-like populations were observe. These results suggested that Arabidopsis extracts are able to form monocytes and monocytes-like cells, and they may produce monocytes-like cells.

In the first extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed and in the second extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed. In the third extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed, and in the third extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed. In the fourth extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed and in the fourth extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed. In the fifth extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed and in the fifth extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed. In the sixth extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed and in the sixth extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed. In the seventh extract, the two monocyte-like populations were observed and in the seventh extract the two monocyte-like populations were observed.

## Discussion

The overall classification of stem cell extracts by our group is based on the fact that the stem cell extracts are not only highly glycosylated but also have a wide range of glycosylation properties that are different from those of other glycosides (.g. carboxylic and mono-glycosylated as well as palmitic). These glycosylation properties are probably more prominent in the mature extracts of Arabidopsis, which may be due to the cell wall and/or polysaccharides structures that are specific to the species (e.g. in Arabidopsis). These compounds are mainly found in glycosides and are known to have a wide range of other glycosides (e.g. in the presence of glycosides with the d-xylose group, chitin and other phenolics). Some of these compounds were identified in our studies in Arabidopsis and are often found in other plants as well. Such glycosylation properties have also been observed in a few other glycosides (e.g. glycoside H, C and N, and their use in plants), such as in the case of N-myristoyl-phosphate (mPTP) [53,54] and isomeric and a-keto-tert-butyl-phenol derivatives [55]. The enzymes in the glycoside chain (glycoside-carbohydrate and glycoside-protein) are also highly glycosylated (Table 1 and Additional file 6) [56]. These glycosylation properties are present in the metalloproteins of the stem cells of Arabidopsis (Table 1) [57,58,59], but not in the glycoside-carbohydrate-like structures of other stem cells. The present study was focused on the identification of glycosides in the stems of Arabidopsis, in order to determine the presence of glycoside specificities.

The phenoloxidase/phenoloxidase (Pka-Pka) system has been described previously [60], and its presence in Arabidopsis samples was confirmed in our study. Pka-Pka is a glycoside with the monomeric form, and it has been described as a good substrate for a number of other flavonoids (e.g.
