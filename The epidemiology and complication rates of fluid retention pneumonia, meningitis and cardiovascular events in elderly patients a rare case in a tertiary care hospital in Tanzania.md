## Abstract
Insects that live in bioaerosols must be well prepared, and foods with free radical oxygen radicals are susceptible to attack. Many of these microorganisms are microbes that study the air and cell biology to obtain a good solid-state for the production of chemicals. They can also study the formation and secondary metabolism of the food matrix. The production of chemicals is an important process that is connected with the food-meals systems. The process depends on the microorganisms and their metabolism. The analysis of the radicals present in the organic matrix, the time consuming steps, and the order of the time involved in the analysis. The studies are carried out to establish the chemical reactions leading to the formation of the matrix. The analysis includes the identification of the groups of radicals present in the matrix, their formation, chemical reactions leading to formation of the matrix, the inhibition of the formation of the matrix by inhibitors, the formation of the matrix with physical and chemical modifications, and the control of the formation and secondary metabolism of the matrix. The results indicate the importance of this research. It is believed that the chemical reactions leading to the formation of the matrix lead to the production of the best ingredients, the isolation of the best ingredients, the isolation of the best ingredients not isolated, the isolation of the best ingredients, the isolation of the best ingredients that make the best use of the matrix and the control of the formation and secondary metabolism of the matrix.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis is a common and potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for the timely treatment and treatment of cryptococcosis. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is a major determinant for the clinical presentation of cryptococcal disease, and it is highly sensitive to a variety of fungal infections, including cryptococcal meningitis (Majjarvi et al., 2017). CrAg levels range from 2.5 to 18 µg/ml in serum, and are significantly higher in adults and children than in adults and children (Zaragoza et al., 2015). CrAg is also required for full virulence in the yeast-to-filamentous (Yusev et al., 2013), and even for survival in the host (Zawieja et al., 2015). The optimal antigen concentration for optimal clinical presentation depends on several factors, including antigenic concentration, antigenic density, and antigenic composition of circulating blood (Crawford et al., 2014). However, low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries are the major causes of fungal meningitis and mortality in these settings (Rajkumar et al., 2017).


## Methods
Field sampling and sampling
The field sampling was performed in 2016 in the eastern Dzuro Mountains in Dzuro National Park, Anantapur District, Anantapur district, Anantapur District, Balakrishnan District, and Anantapur District, Anantapur District, Maitra district. The field sampling was conducted on April 6, 2016 in an area of 30-50 m, with a mean annual rainfall of 1062 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 18.5 °C. The dry soil was collected on May 10, 2016, and the field sampling was conducted on June 14, 2016. The Dzuro National Park (DNP) is a semi-arid, open, semi-dry (1 year) and temperate (5 years) National Park with a mean annual temperature of 1247 mm, and a mean annual rainfall of 888 mm. The temperature, seasonality and soil properties of the soil samples were measured in May, 2017, and June, 2017. Soil samples were collected at 6, 10, 12, 14 and 16 days after the field sampling. Soil samples were also collected on the second and third days after field sampling.

Soil collection and DNA extraction
The soil samples were collected in a sterile and well-ventilated, metal-sealed plastic container containing 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v:v:v), followed by filtering through sterile gauze. The soil samples were also filtered through sterile gauze to remove the organic matter of the soil. The organic matter was extracted from the soil by adding 0.


## Results
% (.1/100,000) and 1.1% (0/33,000) in elderly individuals, respectively [9]. The incidence of urinary tract infections has declined in recent decades in South Africa and Tanzania [9].

The incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-positive and HIV-negative elderly patients is estimated to be 1.7% (1.9/100,000) and 1.2% (0/33,000), respectively [9]. A total of 668 patients were diagnosed with urinary tract infections in Africa in 2015 (17.1%). The incidence of urinary tract infections was reduced in Africa (0.9% in 2015), although the number of HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals was not statistically significant. However, the incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults was 1.2% (1.3/100,000) and 1.4% (1/33,000), respectively [9].

In 2013, the incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-positive patients was estimated to be 1.7% (1/100,000). The incidence of urinary tract infections was reduced in Africa (0.9% in 2013) but was not statistically significant. However, the incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-negative individuals was reduced in Tanzania (0.3% in 2013). The incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-negative adults was 1.1% (0/100,000) and 1.1% (0/33,000).

The prevalence of urinary tract infection in HIV-positive elderly patients is estimated to be 1.7% (1/100,000) and 1.2% (0/33,000) in 2015, respectively [9]. The incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-positive patients was estimated to be 1.7% (1/100,000) and 1.1% (0/33,000) in 2015, respectively [9].

In 2013, the incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-negative elderly patients was estimated to be 3.1% (1/100,000). The incidence of urinary tract infections was reduced in Africa (0.7% in 2013) but was not statistically significant. However, the incidence of urinary tract infections in HIV-negative elderly patients was 1.


## Discussion
Our results support the case of a patient in a tertiary care hospital in Tanzanian, a low-income country with low HIV prevalence, pneumococcal pneumonia and meningiti. Despite the poor pre-ART status and high rates of pneumococcal pneumonia, which have been associated with poor outcomes, an increase in hospitalisation and a decrease in deaths in these patients was observed. This was accompanied by a decrease in the number of deaths in HIV patients. The association between HIV and pneumococcal pneumonia is limited to a small proportion of patients, and is not linked to treatment.

Meningitis was observed in 12% of the cases and pneumonia was observed in 8% of the cases. The most common cause of meningitis was meningococcal pneumonia with a mortality rate of 11.5%. The most common cause of pneumonia was mycobacterial pneumonia with a mortality rate of 2.3%. HIV-related meningitis was seen in 10% of the cases and pneumococcal pneumonia in 8% of the cases. A number of previous studies have reported meningitis as a main cause of meningitis in HIV patients [34, 35]. In our case, the patient was an HIV-infected adult in Tanzania and had a good clinical response to high-dose steroids, all of which were administered before the onset of severe pneumococcal pneumonia.

The presentation of meningitis in a patient with meningitis is often non-specific, but may be associated with the immunocompromised state of the patient, such as immunocompromised people, diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis [34]. Although HIV-infected patients may have a higher risk of HIV infection, there is no evidence to support the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV patients [34].

Pneumococcal pneumonia is a rare disease with a mortality rate of 25% [36]. This is a rare disease with a low prevalence in Tanzania. We reported a case of pneumococcal pneumonia in a patient in a tertiary care hospital in Tanzanian. The patient had received allogeneic tacrolimus and fluconazole, but he was not responding to tacrolimus and fluconazole. The patient was discharged with a reduced course of tacrolimus and fluconazole.
