## Abstract
The extracts were tested against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. The extracts were also evaluated against the opportunistic pathogens, the plant growth and stress, and the defense system. The MIC and MFC were determined by broth microdilution method. The antifungal activity was determined by the disc diffusion method. The plant growth was measured by the time-kill method. The antioxidant activity was determined by the deoxynivalenol (DON) assay. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The antifungal activity of the stem bark extracts was determined by measuring the DIC50 values. The MIC values of the extracts were higher than that of the control. The MIC values of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The activities of the extracts were evaluated against five Gram-positive and seven Gram-negative bacteria and the defense system using the broth microdilution method. The scavenging activity was determined by measuring the scavenging constant. The antioxidant activity of the stem bark extracts was determined by the non-steroid scavenging assay. The antifungal activity of the extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts was higher than that of the control. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The MIC values of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to 2 µg/mL. The activities of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to 16 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to 24 µg/mL. The antioxidant activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to 48 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.03 to >16 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts ranged from 0.05 to <32 µg/mL. The MIC of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.05 to 12 µg/mL. The MIC of the stem bark extracts ranged from 12 to > 32 µg/mL. The activity of the stem bark extracts ranged from 0.


## Introduction
Uptake of fresh fruits is the mainstay of meat consumption in the United States and worldwide. Fresh fruits are usually considered to be a high quality food because of their nutritional values, flavor and aroma. However, the composition of the pulp and/or tough soft tissue of fresh fruits varies. The pulp is used for pulp, paper, pulp and paper, and the amount of starch and proteins are very important. The pulp is usually used for the delignification of foods, such as vegetables and fruits. The pulp-based delignification method is recommended for fresh-cut vegetables and fruits. In general, fresh fruits are used for pulp, paper, pulp and paper, and the delignification method is used to prepare fresh-cut vegetables, fruits, and/or tough soft tissues. However, some non-processed hard tissues are considered to be poor delignification materials. For example, the pulp-based delignification method is considered to be a waste product because it does not eliminate the pulp and soft tissue that are important for delignification. To reduce the cost and labor involved in the delignification process, the pulp-based method is used in many countries. Delignification involves the use of various materials, such as organic, in various parts of the process, and the delignification method is not required in most countries.


## Methods
The bacterial strains were cultured in Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) at 35 °C for 7 day. The cultures were then inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of nutrient broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar). Bacterial suspensions (1 × 10^6 CFU ml^-1) were prepared by taking a loopful of the bacterial suspension (100 µL) in 0.05% Tween 80 and filtering through Miracloth (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). The filtrate was then diluted 1:10 and used for the determination of MIC. The bacterial growth was visualized by the addition of 0.1% trypan blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the growth was expressed as optical density (OD) at 625 nm.

2.4. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of extracts from stem bark of L. barberonii (L.barberonii)
The extraction of stem bark extract was performed according to [10], with modifications. The stem bark was treated with various concentrations of TFA (0.2%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%, 0.01% and 0.001% v/v) and then sterilized in 70% ethanol. The sterilized stem bark was used as the inoculated inoculated medium. The spore suspension was inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of nutrient broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) and then the bacterial suspension was added into the flasks. The filtrate was then diluted 1:10 and used for the determination of the MIC. The spore suspension was then diluted 1:10 to get a final concentration of 0.01% v/v and used for the determination of the MIC. The MIC values were determined for the isolates from the inoculated and the control. The MIC values for the other organisms were determined using the same protocol.

2.5. Plant and Drug Content
The plant material used in this study was the bark of L. barberonii (L.barberonii) isolated from the bark of a herbaceous tree.


## Results
The extracts from the stem bark of the stem bark were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of . pneumoniae and S. pombe by 5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml respectively (data not shown).

The ability of the extracts from the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus to inhibit the growth of S. pneumoniae and S. pombe were further tested by the inhibition of the growth of E. coli by 4 µg/ml and 2 µg/ml respectively (Table 2).

The extracts from the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus showed strong antifungal activities against S. pneumoniae and S. pombe (Table 2).

3.2. Evaluation of Antifungal Activity of Extracts from Yancelet rhizopus
The extracts from the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus exhibited antifungal activities against S. pneumoniae, S. pombe, and E. coli. The extracts from the stem bark of the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus showed antifungal activities against S. pneumoniae and S. pombe (Table 3).

The antifungal activity of the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus against S. pneumoniae and S. pombe was evaluated using the 4 µg/ml of M. tuberculosis antifungal compound sodium nitrite (MIC = 64 µg/ml), followed by the presence of 100 µg/ml of DMSO. The activities were compared between the three extract preparations (Table 4).

The antifungal activities of the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus were evaluated against S. pneumoniae and S. pombe by the susceptibility test (MIC > 256 µg/ml) and the susceptibility test (MIC = 64 µg/ml) (Table 5).

3.3. Antifungal Activity of Extracts from Yancelet rhizopus and Antifungal Activity of Extracts from S. pombe
The antifungal activity of the stem bark of Yancelet rhizopus against S. pneumoniae and S. pombe was evaluated using the 4 µg/ml of M.


## Discussion

As observed in previous studies, the MIC of different compounds ranged from .7 to 9.2 µg/ml, which is in agreement with the previous studies in other species of the genus. According to the previous studies, the values of MIC were similar to those obtained for other species of the genus.

3.3. Antimicrobial Activity
The inhibitory effects of some compounds against the fungi of the genus Yancelet have been previously reported [18], which may be attributed to the presence of various compounds. The inhibition of the microbial growth by phenolic acids (E.C.L.) was reported in the case of piperitin, which was isolated from the bark of the genus [19].

The inhibitory effect of eugenol (E.C.L.) on the growth of the yeasts was also reported by Wang et al. [20].

The MIC of eugenol was 2.3 µg/ml, which is in agreement with the previous studies in the case of the two genera, namely Rhodotorula and C. neoformans.

The MIC of eugenol against the clinical isolates of R. arrhizus was 2.5 µg/ml. This value was in agreement with the previous study.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of A. terreus was 2.2 µg/ml. The value of eugenol against the strain of C. neoformans was 2.8 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. albicans was 2.1 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. neoformans was 2.3 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. neoformans was 2.4 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. albicans was 2.6 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. neoformans was 2.3 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. albicans was 2.8 µg/ml.

The MIC value of eugenol against the strain of C. neoformans was 2.
