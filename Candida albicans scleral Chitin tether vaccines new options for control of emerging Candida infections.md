## Abstract
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pathogen of corneal ulcers. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent cause of inflammation, and its ability to induce interleukin-17 (IL-17) production in vitro is not known. To gain a better understanding of the mechanistic link between IL-17 and the development of ulcers, we evaluated the effects of IL-17 on the formation of peritrophic scars in vitro. Peritrophic scars formed by Aspergillus were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We observed that IL-17 production was induced only in peritrophic forms, but not in full thickness. IL-17 was more abundant in peritrophic lesions than in nonperitrophic lesions of corneal ulcers. IL-17 was produced in a dose-dependent manner and was preferentially released in the necrotic tissue. Transmitting electron microscopy, microarray analysis, and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that IL-17 specifically binds to peritrophic cells and regulates their inflammatory response. Furthermore, we observed that IL-17 was released mainly from peritrophic lesions at early time points by local T cell responses. Our results suggest that IL-17 binds to peritrophic cells via a TLR9-type receptor system, and that IL-17 plays a role in peritrophic formation.


## Introduction
The main fungal pathogens of humans, including Candida, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, are among the most common causes of fungal bloodstream infections.


## Methods

The vaccination was performed as previously described [35. Briefly, two week old female BALB/c mice were immunized by intravenous injection of one dose of Vaccinia (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at day 4, and the next day, the mice were infected by intranasal instillation of a 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/g of body weight. The mice were anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane in a L-shaped, volume-controlled chamber. For the control group, the inoculum was 2.5 × 10^6 CFU/g. The mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection, including lethargy, lethargy, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Mice were euthanized by CO_2 asphyxiation and their kidneys were collected for DNA extraction. The organs were weighed and homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS. The homogenates were serially diluted, and 10 µl of each dilution was plated onto chocolate agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 7 days. The number of CFU of Candida-positive colonies was counted. The Candida-negative colonies were further confirmed by plating their homogenates onto nutrient-poor (N-M) agar plates.

2.3. Oral Toxin Susceptibility Testing
The Oral Toxins Susceptibility Testing (OTX) was performed according to the CLSI [36]. Briefly, each mouse was immunized with Vaccinia in the presence of 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/g of body weight. The mice were anesthetized by injection of 3.5% isoflurane in a L-shaped, volume-controlled chamber. The mice were allowed to inhale 3.5% isoflurane in PBS and then the upper chamber was aspirated. The upper chamber was then removed and the upper layer of PBS was removed. The upper layer of PBS containing Toxins was aspirated and air-dried. The Toxins were then diluted in PBS and tested against Candida by the broth microdilution method. The MIC of the test was defined as the lowest concentration of the test that prevented the growth of Candida.

## Results
albicans using a vaccine schedule that includes both an early-viable (.e., about 2 weeks before infection) and a tetanus-containing (i.e., no vaccine) vaccine schedule. It is now available in the USA and Canada.

The efficacy of the tetanus-containing vaccine schedule is expected to be very high. According to the CDC, tetanus-containing vaccines cause death in approximately 5-10% of patients with C. albicans infections [7]. Eliminating the tetanus-containing vaccine schedule would save lives by eliminating C. albicans infections that are typically fatal. In our study, we had previously shown that the initial tetanus vaccine schedule was safe and feasible for most patients (Table 4). It is possible that a new tetanus vaccine schedule will be developed soon.

## Discussion
auris on the vaccine against . auris-KM-VITAM-VITAM and C. auris-KM-VITAM-VITAM combination vaccines (Figure 4). The study was led by Chen et al. [11] who showed that C. auris and K. marxianus are the main pathogens of K. marxianus in Australia. This is the first time in Australia that combination of VITAM and KM-VITAM will be developed to control K. marxianus infection.

In this study, we found that combination vaccines were effective against K. marxianus infection. Previous studies have shown that the combination vaccines were effective against K. marxianus infection, but not against C. auris [11]. Our study did not show significant increase in virulence of K. marxianus compared to K. marxianus alone. The combination vaccines also showed better immune response against K. marxianus compared to K. marxianus alone.

The combination vaccines are an excellent vaccine and have been shown to be safe and effective against the C. auris infection in humans. It has been suggested that combining the combination vaccines with K. marxianus vaccine would be a safer vaccine [22]. However, it remains unclear if the combination vaccines will be effective against K. marxianus infection.

The combination vaccines also showed better response against K. marxianus infection. Previous studies have shown that the combination vaccines are more effective against K. marxianus infection than VITAM or KM-VITAM [11]. However, this has been shown to be different in the two vaccines. In VITAM the vaccine was effective against K. marxianus alone. In VITAM the vaccine was effective against K. marxianus alone.

In the previous studies, K. marxianus was only found in association with a single vaccine. However, there was a single vaccine that was not effective against K. marxianus infection. In the current study, we found that K. marxianus was more susceptible to combination vaccines. The results indicate that combining VITAM and KM-VITAM will be a viable option for the development of a combination vaccine.
