## Abstract
The rapid development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its accompanying discovery that HIV-associated viral replication is driven by novel molecules is revealing. We recently described the release of a genome-wide scan of PlaMNCaP, a plant RNA-binding protein (PRP) that directly targets PlaMNCaP to the plasma membrane, a region of the cell that contains the viral replication machinery. Our work shows that the plasma membrane of PlaMNCaP is indeed the gateway to viral RNA. It contains the machinery for PlaMNCaP virus-induced virus-host fusion (PIKF) and the promoters of the viral genomes that lead to its transient and rapid replication in the host cell. The release of plasminogen in the plasma membrane, we discovered, could be a signal for plasmid propagation, a process that involves the release of plasmin mRNA. Plasma plasminogen also forms part of the viral genome, a region of the cell that is not yet fully assembled. We found that plasmids carrying plasminogen can readily be recruited to viral replication in the presence of host plasminogen. We also identified plasminogen as a key factor that regulates the development of meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected patients. The plasma plasminogen-driven process of viral replication was coherent, as shown in the computer simulation studies and in the protein docking studies, of two-partner, or cooperative-plasmids merging in a bipolar system. We also identified a major contributor to plasmid plasmid release: the nuclear release of plasminogen and a recognition of the nuclear binding pocket by nuclear rRNAs. We conclude that PlaMNCaP is a PIKF-producing parasite with a unique and cleaved plasma membrane, which is not flanked by other cellular and viral membranes.

A genome-wide scan of a plant-pathogenic fungus indicated that plasmids are frequently assembled in a bipolar distribution and that plasminogen is central to both. We sequenced the genome of PlaMNCaP and compared its transcriptomes to that of the host, both in vitro and in in in vitro, and found that P. mamillana has a bipolar distribution and that the distribution is stable for all but one plasmid.


## Introduction
Candida species are recognized by at least six major immune cells, namely, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, C-receptor, TLR and Neu4-12. Candida albicans is the most common and most important cause of candidemia in humans (1). The most common C. albicans species, including C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C.


## Methods

Bacterial strains and preparation of the inoculum
The bacterial strains and the inoculum used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S. They were cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) broth at 37 °C for 48 h. The fungi were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Difco^tm, Burlington, ON, Canada) at 37 °C for 3 days. The bacterial culture was prepared by inoculating the media at a density of 2 × 10^6 CFU/mL on the bacterial agar. The culture was grown at 30 °C for 7 days.

Fungi were then suspended in PBS (0.85% NaCl) and adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. Then, 10 µL of the suspension were spread onto the surface of PDA plates. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C.

The surface sterilized, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution was prepared by dissolving the fungal inoculum in PBS. Then, the suspension was filtered using a 0.22 µm filter, and the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured. The test organisms were inoculated in triplicate and the results were expressed as the average number of yeast/cell and the standard deviation of mean inhibition value (SDV).


## Results
dermatitidi. The anti-bacterial autoantibodies were designed to evaluate whether the antibodies could protect B. dermatitidis against B. dermatitidis infection. The anti-bacterial autoantibodies were incubated with the anti-bacterial anti-brucellosan antibodies, and the anti-brucellosan antibodies were then tested for their anti-brucellosan autoantibodies against B. dermatitidis. The anti-brucellosan antibodies were incubated with the anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies. The anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies were incubated with the anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies for 10 min before the addition of the pro-brucellosan antibodies. The anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies were tested for their anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan autoantibodies against B. dermatitidis. The anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan autoantibodies were also incubated with the anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies for 5 min before the addition of the anti-brucellosan anti-brucellosan antibodies.


## Discussion
pseudomallei-specific anti-brucellosan autoantibodies on . trichospore-associated B. trichospore-associated cells, the initial challenge of B. pseudomallei cells was performed with synthetic B. trichospore-containing oligosaccharide as a substrate. B. pseudomallei cells were grown in low density and pretreated with either 10 mM TrpO_2 or 10 mM TrpO_2, while B. trichospore-containing oligosaccharide was pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2. Cultivation in the presence of 10 mM TrpO_2 was used as the sole challenge. As shown in Fig 2A, B. pseudomallei cells were treated with 10 mM TrpO_2, and B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2. As shown in Fig 2B, B. pseudomallei cells were treated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 3 h, while B. pseudomallei cells were treated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 2 h. As shown in Fig 2C, B. pseudomallei cells were treated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 3 h, while B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 2 h. Cells were harvested and treated for 1 h with 10 mM TrpO_2. As shown in Fig 2D, B. pseudomallei cells were treated for 1 h with 10 mM TrpO_2, and B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 3 h. Cells were harvested and treated for 1 h with 10 mM TrpO_2, and B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 3 h. Cells were harvested and treated for 1 h with 10 mM TrpO_2, and B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 2 h. Cells were harvested and treated for 1 h with 10 mM TrpO_2, and B. pseudomallei cells were pretreated with 10 mM TrpO_2 for 3 h. As shown in Fig 2E, B.
