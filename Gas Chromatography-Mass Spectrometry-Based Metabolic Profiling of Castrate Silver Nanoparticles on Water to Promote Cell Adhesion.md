## Abstract
The fungal cell wall is a thick, elastic membrane that is the first barrier that all cells need to protect themselves against attack by an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of antifungal drugs. The structure of the cell wall is an important factor in regulating virulence, eukaryotic cell wall architecture, and a major resistance pattern in many fungi. Therefore, new antifungals that target the cell wall are urgently needed. The cell wall is an essential factor in regulating fungal morphology and a major determinant in controlling pathogen virulence. The cell wall is also the first barrier that all cells must protect themselves from attack by antifungals. Here, we report the characterization of a new polyketide compound from the Caribbean tree, Lathyrus eunicolorum J. Inkin (Phytolacc: P. inkin), and we show that it has a dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-based molecular mass of ~39 kDa.


## Introduction

Iron is an important element that is tightly bound to the cell by iron permeases and is one of the most abundant redox mediators in the bod. However, the iron available to cells in excess is toxic and can result in cells developing resistance to invading pathogens, causing cellular senescence and eventually death. Therefore, mechanisms controlling iron homeostasis are complex and may be directed towards the activation of cellular iron storage, which could provide a source of iron for pathogens. The complex mechanisms by which organisms can acquire iron during infection, and how they acquire iron from the environment may provide insight into iron acquisition and trafficking pathways during infectious processes.

The fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus has evolved mechanisms to evade the host immune response. Under iron-limiting conditions, A. fumigatus proliferates in a tightly controlled, multilayered network and uses the iron as a sole source of energy. A. fumigatus employs various iron acquisition and secretion mechanisms to escape the host immune response. It employs a network of secreted iron acquisition proteins to overcome iron-limiting host defenses and proliferate in the cytoplasm, but also utilizes ferroxidases to facilitate intracellular iron transport [32]. The extracellular iron is stored in the vacuole, bound to the cell iron-storage proteins and transported to the intracellularly localized iron stores [32-35]. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that A. fumigatus utilizes the iron sequestration system to scavenge iron from its environment [30, 31]. The ferroxidases from A. fumigatus are capable of reducing the extracellular concentration of ferroxidases from the cytoplasm to less than detectable levels [31]. Recently, our lab has demonstrated that iron acquisition from the environment is crucial for A. fumigatus to survive iron deprivation [31].

Iron acquisition and secretion have been extensively studied in the model fungus A. fumigatus, which has evolved mechanisms to acquire iron from its environment, and to utilize ferroxidases to facilitate intracellular iron transport [33]. In this study, we characterized the iron acquisition and secretion mechanisms of A. fumigatus. We have determined the substrate specificity of the main ferroxidases from A. fumigatus.


## Methods
The pellet was resuspended in 300 µl of methanol (.8% v/v) and dried with paper towel. Subsequently, the sample was centrifuged at 8000× g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was discarded. The sample was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, eluted with elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 1% SDS). The column was eluted with elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 0.01% NP-40, pH 7.5) and was dried with paper towel. The eluted fractions were recovered and used for the analyses of the amount of Calcaspases in the sample by flow cytometry and analysis of calcein hydrolase (CHH). Calcein hydrolase (CHH) was identified by the method of Adcock and Timmerman [48]. For the determination of Calcaspases, 1 ml of sample was mixed with 1 ml of 3% CH_3CN in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 8000× g for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and dried with paper towel. The CHH was defined as the amount of calcein hydrolase that binds to the C. albicans cell wall, in accordance with the method of Adcock and Timmerman [48]. The CHH was expressed as the amount of calcein hydrolase that binds to the C. albicans cell wall.

To analyze the amount of calcein hydrolase (CHH) that binds to the cells, 1 ml of sample was mixed with 1 ml of 5% CH_3CN, and centrifuged at 8000× g for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and dried with paper towel. The CHH was defined as the amount of calcein hydrolase that binds to the cells, in accordance with the method of Adcock and Timmerman [48].


## Results

In order to understand the chemical composition of the Pu^2+-Pu^2+ complex, the Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was analyzed by spectrophotometr. In the Pu^2+ complex, the Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was composed of an aliphatic Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex and a monovalent Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex, whereas the Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was composed of an oxygenated Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex. The Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex and the Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex were found to be highly similar in terms of their chromatographic appearance and molecular weight. The Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was further characterized by HRESI-MS using the spectrophotometric methodology. As shown in Figure 1F, a Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was clearly observed in the HRESI-MS spectra, as it was previously reported for Cu^2+-Pu^2+. The Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was also clearly observed in the HRESI-MS spectra. The Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex was also observed in the HRESI-MS spectra of the Cu^2+-Pu^2+ complex.

## Discussion
The C-14-GFP-Fungi supernatant was purified and incubated with different concentrations of CaCl_2 for 2 h, and the percentage of C-14-GFP-Fungi supernatant was identified (Table 3. The broth microdilution method was also used to study the growth of the fungal yeast, conidia, and spores. The cell-free fraction was used to determine the percentage of fungi and the growth of the fungus in the broth microdilution method (Table 3). The results showed that the C-18-GFP-Fungi supernatant was the most effective form for the growth of the fungus, but the same concentration of CaCl_2 was used for the growth of the yeast, conidia, and spores.

The high cell-free fraction was used to study the viability of the fungus in the broth microdilution method. The broth microdilution method was performed on the growth of the fungus in the broth microdilution buffer (100 mM NaCl, pH 4.5) for 2 h at 25 °C. The results showed that the C-18-GFP-Fungi supernatant was the most effective form for the growth of the fungus in the broth microdilution buffer (50%). The results showed that the C-18-GFP-Fungi supernatant was the most efficient form for the growth of the fungus in the broth microdilution buffer (100%). The results showed that the C-18-GFP-Fungi supernatant was the most effective form for the growth of the fungus in the broth microdilution buffer (50%).

The protease and the protease-to-protein conversion were investigated using an optical density technique.
