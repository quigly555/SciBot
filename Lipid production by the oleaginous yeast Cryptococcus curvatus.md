## Abstract
The integron is a type of protein with two domains: a carbohydrate recognition domain and an N-terminal amino acid/proteasome exchange process. We report for the first time that the integron is part of two different structures: a high mobility group and a carbohydrate-binding domain. The carbohydrate-binding domain is located at the GX center of the carbohydrate transmembrane network and forms an extended loop that cuts across the N- and C-terminal domains. We found that the carbohydrate-binding domain of C. curvatus is required for the trafficking and synthesis of the N-esteron flanking the C-terminal domain.


## Introduction
It is estimated that more than 2.6 million people worldwide die each year from invasive fungal infections, and the number of deaths related to antimycotic and antimycotic antibiotic resistance is increasing [1-3]. It is estimated that approximately 15,000 deaths have been estimated so far in 2017 [4]. The most common fungal pathogen is Candida glabrata, which causes a variety of diseases, mainly in immunocompromised patients, including life-threatening disseminated candidiasis [5]. In addition, C. glabrata is also responsible for a wide range of other life-threatening diseases, such as cryptococcal meningitis and septicemia, as well as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [6]. The development of resistance to multiple classes of antifungal agents is a serious concern and therefore, there is an urgent need for better antifungal treatments [7]. In this regard, some natural products have been developed and are being used for various therapeutic purposes [8-11]. For example, marine sponge Phacidium acaciae was reported to possess antimicrobial activity [12] and has been used as an antifungal agent [13]. As a result, it has been used in different therapeutic applications, such as wound-healing therapy [14], antibacterial therapy [15], anti-inflammatory therapies [16], antifungal drugs [17], and wound healing and prevention [18].

Another interesting natural product with antifungal activity is plant extracts, such as Mentha sp., Juniperus sp., and Piper sp. [19]. They are rich in phenolic and flavonoid compounds, with about 70% of the phenolic content being related to their antifungal activity [20]. The anti-fungal activity of medicinal plants is based on their biological activity. For example, the plants have anti-fungal activity in vitro [21], in vivo [22], and in vitro against the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [23]. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that some phytochemicals can have various pharmacological activities [24-26].


## Methods
(1956) with minor modification. Briefly, yeasts were cultured at 37 °C in an orbital shaker (250 rpm) for 3 days, and then, they were cultivated at 37 °C in an orbital shaker for a further 4 days. The yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in 1 ml of 1x PBS. The cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and the concentration of extracellular yeast was determined by the method of Galagan et al. (1956).

2.4. Methylation assay
The activity of the ergosterol-like S-glycoprotein pathway in the keratinocytes of L. monocytogenes and D. melanogaster was determined using the method of Klüfer and Miller (1956) with slight modifications. Briefly, yeast cells were cultured at 37 °C in an orbital shaker (250 rpm) for 3 days, and then, they were cultivated at 37 °C in an orbital shaker for a further 4 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in 1 ml of 1x PBS. The cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and the concentration of extracellular yeast was determined by the method of Klüfer and Miller (1956) with slight modifications.

2.5. Non-specific binding of ergosterol
The non-specific binding of ergosterol to the ß-glucosidase-like domain was determined by the method of Hase et al. (1957) with slight modifications. Briefly, yeast cells were cultured at 37 °C in an orbital shaker (250 rpm) for 3 days, and then, they were cultured at 37 °C in an orbital shaker for a further 4 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and resuspended in 1 ml of 1x PBS. The cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and the concentration of extracellular yeast was determined by the method of Hase et al. (1957) with slight modifications.

## Results
SDS, a commonly used antifungal drug used to treat fungal infections [26], inhibited the proliferation of . curvatus in the presence of SDS. However, in the presence of SDS, the oleaginous yeast was unable to proliferate. In addition, the oleaginous yeast did not produce any lipids in the presence of SDS (Fig 4A). The effect of these compounds was dose-dependent, and the effect was synergistic. The addition of 50 µM of SDS to the oleaginous yeast was synergistic (Fig 4B). These results suggest that SDS is a major oleaginous lipase inhibitor.

3.2. Oleaginous Yeast Lipase Is Highly Dependent on Fusarinine and Phenylalanine
In S. cerevisiae, a mixture of Fusarinine and Phenylalanine, an oleaginous yeast lipase, is used as a model to analyze the relationship between oleaginous yeast lipase activity and the production of lipids. F. verticillioides is a representative oleaginous yeast lipase used in various studies [28,29]. To evaluate the dependence of oleaginous yeast lipase on Fusarinine and Phenylalanine, the oleaginous yeast was treated with this enzyme and then compared with the control. The results indicated that the concentration of Fusarinine in the medium is not related with the growth of the yeast.

3.3. Effects of SDS on Lipid Production by the Oleaginous Yeast Lipase
SDS treated yeast cells were cultured in the presence of 50 µM of SDS and the concentration of Fusarinine was monitored. The results showed that the concentration of Fusarinine was significantly higher when compared with that of the control, but not in the presence of SDS (Fig 5). The concentration of Fusarinine was also significantly higher in the presence of SDS, but not in the presence of SDS, when compared with that of the control (Fig 5).

## Discussion
We have previously shown that lipase activity by the yeast . curvatus is dependent on the cell wall integrity of the cell wall, but not on the lipid content [15]. This has been confirmed by other studies [56]. In this study, the activity of lipase activity by C. curvatus was recorded at a higher concentration (10.6 mg/L) of lipase-D-like lipase (LxL-D-LxL) than that of other lipase-D-like lipase inhibitors, such as D-cadinol (Dc), xylitol (xylitol), erythritol (erythritol), and mannitol (methanol) [16]. The other lipase-D-like lipase inhibitors (Dc, Dx, and DxL) inhibited the activity of lipase-D-like lipase by D-cadinol (Dc), xylitol (xylitol), mannitol, and ethanol. Thus, the lipidase-D-like lipase can be classified into three types, which may be different from previous findings [16].

The in vitro activity of Lipase-D-like lipase by C. curvatus could be attributed to the substrate specificity of the lipase-D-like lipase substrates and to the ability of the enzyme to cross the cell wall. This has been confirmed by other studies [57]. In this study, it was found that the lipase-D-like lipase by C. curvatus could bind with the cell wall integrity of C. elegans and penetrate into the cell membrane. The enzyme also showed a decrease in the activity of LxL-D-LxL lipase-D-like lipase (LxL-D-LxL) when compared to other lipase-D-like lipases. The activity of lipase-D-like lipase by C. curvatus was also recorded at a higher concentration of lipase-D-like lipase (10.6 mg/L). The enzyme activity of lipase-D-like lipase was recorded at a higher concentration of lipase-D-like lipase (10.6 mg/L) than that of other lipase-D-like lipases.
