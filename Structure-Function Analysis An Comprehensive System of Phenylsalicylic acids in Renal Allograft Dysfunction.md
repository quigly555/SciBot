## Abstract
Aneuploidy is an important feature of eukaryotes and, in particular, of fungi, has been considered to be associated with pathogenesis. However, the role of these cells in the establishment of aeuploidy and subsequent chromosomes has recently been less studied. In the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, a hyper-sensitive strain, we recently demonstrated that this cell type has aneuploidy with two mating types, a and a. In this study, we characterized the expression of two mating types of C. neoformans and found that these cells are able to suppress the formation of two mating types in strains with different mating types. Interestingly, C. neoformans cells lacking mating type a produced progenotrophs and there was an increase in their phenotypes in absence of mating type a. These cells were able to suppress the formation of two mating types, which indicated that they are able to suppress the generation of unspecific single-spored cells in C. neoformans. Suppression of the generation of unspecific single-spored cells was also observed in cells lacking mating type a. Because the expression of two mating types in a C. neoformans strain was found to suppress the generation of unspecific single-spored cells, we suggest that there is a cross-kingdom interaction between the two mating types that is responsible for the attenuation of virulence in C. neoformans.

In this study, we investigated the regulation of mating type a in C. neoformans. We found that the recombinant C. neoformans mating type a has an effect on mating phenotype and the production of unspecific single-spored cells. Cells lacking mating type a were less virulent and had lower numbers of unspecific single-spored cells in the progenotroph strain S2A. These data suggest that the mating type in C. neoformans is an effector factor that controls unspecific single-spored cell in C. neoformans.


## Introduction
The authors have provided a well-written article, with reviews of over 40 papers on N- and O-salicylic acids (Succinarians, 2013; Jameau et a., 2014). The authors have also included some well-written reviews of recent publications in this area. Nevertheless, the papers cited in this review are mainly focused on N- and O-salicylic acids, and their application to human and animal health and disease is very little discussed. Moreover, the literature is scanty on N- and O-salicylic acids, and there is no discussion on their medical relevance. The authors highlight some of the most common side effects of N- and O-salicylic acid use, and it is important to point out that the scientific literature on N- and O-salicylic acid is rather lacking, and the best studied group are those associated with hepatotoxicity (Lacoste et al., 2014).

All the works cited in the paper are presented in an open access publication, so that the reader does not have access to them. The text is available at: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-text.

In the abstract, the authors propose a method for screening for N- and O-salicylic acids in urine. A number of limitations of this method have been briefly discussed. First, urine samples may be taken from patients with normal renal function, who might be suspicious for N- and O-salicylic acids. Second, the method may be biased. Finally, the method may overestimate the risk for specific infections, and overestimate the risk for other infections. It is not clear how the authors' assumptions about the incidence and prevalence of infections are justified.

We provide here a detailed overview of the limitations of the method, its strengths and weaknesses, and our current state of knowledge on the field of N- and O-salicylic acid screening. We do not attempt to provide comprehensive reviews of all the published literature on N- and O-salicylic acid. Instead, we focus on the literature that has dealt with the use of the method to assess the risk for specific infections.


## Methods
Three different groups were defined by the following groups: (1) non-serological groups; (2) culture-based groups; (3) tissue-based groups; (4) necrotic groups; and (5) inflammation-based group.

4.2. DADS Analyses
For the analysis of the metabolic pathways in terms of signal transduction and membrane potential, the following parameters were used: the metabolic rate, the lipid peroxidation rate, the sugar peroxidation rate, the reduction in free fatty acids, the lipid peroxidation rate of free fatty acids, and the change in free fatty acids concentration. The results were expressed as the mean value Â± standard deviation (SD).

4.2. DADS Analyses
The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction (K_m and K_cat) were determined in terms of K_cat values and K_cat values (Lengel and Halpern, 2011). K_cat values were determined in terms of the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 6.0 and K_cat values were calculated as the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 6.0. The K_cat values were calculated in terms of the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 5.5. The K_cat values were calculated in terms of the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 4.5 and K_cat values were calculated as the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 4.5. The K_cat values were calculated in terms of the rate of lipid peroxidation at pH = 5.5.

4.2. DADS Analyses
The intracellular and intracellular efflux rates were determined in terms of the rate of intracellular peroxidation at pH = 6.0 and the rate of efflux at pH = 4.5. The intracellular rate was calculated as the ratio of the intracellular rate at pH = 6.0 and the intracellular rate at pH = 4.5. The intracellular rate was calculated as the ratio of the intracellular rate at pH = 6.0 and the intracellular rate at pH = 4.5.


## Results
In the present study, we developed a system to assess the activity of a functional enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase in renal tissue by HPLC analysi. In our system, two reaction groups were used: 1) single group, 2) reaction group, and 3) reaction group. As shown in Fig 4, the enzyme reaction group 2 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 3 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 4 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 5 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 6 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 7 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification. The reaction group 8 of enzyme-free unilevel, linear, Q-acyl hydroxylase activity was activated with the addition of 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 h followed by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to purification.


## Discussion
cruzi was impaired, and the other Sre1-type AAHs were functionally impaired, with all AAs being upregulated in the TcNDR1 mutan. Interestingly, TcNDR1 is a GATA factor involved in regulating the expression of a number of fungal proinflammatory genes, including pSTAT1 (the transcription factor for IL-6), pSTAT5 (a GATA-protein-mediated repressor of IL-1), and a GATA-repressor, pSTAT3 (the transcription factor for IL-4 and IL-13). The TcNDR1 mutant had decreased levels of some proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, the GATA-repressor, pSTAT3, was upregulated in the TcNDR1 mutant, and the TcNDR1 gene could control the expression of the downstream AAs in T. cruzi. In contrast, the expression of the GATA-repressor, pSTAT3, was upregulated in the TcNDR1 mutant, but the TcNDR1 gene could not control the expression of the downstream AAs. Although TcNDR1 is highly expressed in the plasma membrane of the mammalian host, the expression of the TcNDR1 gene was only upregulated in the TcNDR2 mutant, and this is consistent with the TcNDR2 mutant having a different promoter and activator system in vivo [25].

The TcNDR1 expression is highly regulated in the plasma membrane of T. cruzi. In contrast, the expression of TcNDR1 is downregulated in the plasma membrane of T. cruzi when compared with TcNDR1 overexpressing the TcNDR1 gene in TcNDR2 mutant. In vivo, TcNDR1 was upregulated in the plasma membrane of T. cruzi in the presence of IL-10, and IL-10 induced TcNDR1 expression in TcNDR2 mutant [25]. These results demonstrate that TcNDR1 is functionally important for T. cruzi development.
