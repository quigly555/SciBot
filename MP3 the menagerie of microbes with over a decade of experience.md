## Abstract
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is a common commensal of humans, causing upper respiratory tract infections, yeast- and dermatophytes-associated sepsis and dermatosis and other chronic conditions. However, epidemiological studies on patients with noncryptococcal infection have shown a small number of patients with C. glabrata infection who are not infected by the fungal pathogens. We were able to diagnose these patients as being immunocompromised, which might indicate that they might have acquired the fungal infection through immunosuppressive treatment.


## Introduction
The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the most prevalent infectious fungal pathogens. It is widely distributed in the environment and is found in soil, water and bird droppings. It is present in pigeon droppings, decaying wood, pigeon skin, and decaying branches in soil.

## Methods
The selected fungi were . oleracea, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

Morphology and growth of the fungi
The fungal cultures were grown on standard nutrient media in Petri dishes for 24 h at 30 °C in the dark. Fungal spores were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, washed with sterile PBS, and suspended in sterile PBS. The growth rate was determined by measuring the diameter of the mycelial plug by measuring the diameter of the colony. For the preparation of fungal powder, the fungus was suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS. The preparation of fungal powder was performed as previously described [41].

To determine the growth of the fungal strain, the mycelial plug of the S. oleracea strain was placed in the center of a Petri dish, and the Petri dish containing the fungus was filled with 2 mL of PBS. The fungal culture was then poured into a Petri dish containing 1 L of sterile PBS and the mycelia were collected by filtering through sterile gauze. The mycelia were then washed with PBS and the mycelia were suspended in sterile PBS. The number of CFU/mL was determined by plating on 2% of PDA (Gibco/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 days.

Preparation of fungal powder and determination of fungal viability
To determine the fungal viability, the mycelia of S. oleracea strain were washed with sterile PBS, and then the mycelia were suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS and the mycelia were subjected to a series of centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, and then the mycelia were suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS. The mycelia were then suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS and the fungal pellets were suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS. The mycelia were then subjected to a further centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and the pellets were suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS. The fungal pellets were then subjected to another centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and the mycelia were then suspended in 1 L of sterile PBS and the fungal pellets were subjected to a series of centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min.


## Results
The present study identified an up to 40% increase in mortality of HUVECs during treatment with standard L-NAMEs in the . neoformans HUVEC group at 48 hours after challenge, which is not statistically significant. The study also observed a small decrease in the mortality rate of HUVECs treated with L-NAMEs in the C. neoformans HUVEC group at 24 hours after challenge. The death rate of HUVECs treated with L-NAMEs was much lower compared to the C. neoformans HUVEC group. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the mortality rate was observed in the HUVEC group treated with L-NAMEs at 24 hours after challenge. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that L-NAMEs have a beneficial effect on the C. neoformans HUVEC group during treatment with L-NAMEs.

L-NAMEs inhibit fungal growth in mice
A C. neoformans HUVEC group was injected with L-NAMEs for 24 hours at 24 and 48 hours after infection. After 24 hours, the number of fungal cells was measured in the lungs and brain, and the fungal cells were enumerated by microscopic culture. We found that L-NAMEs had no significant effect on the number of fungal cells in the lungs, spleen, or brain at 48 hours after infection. However, L-NAMEs significantly reduced the fungal growth in the lungs, spleen, or brain of HUVECs infected with C. neoformans, which was also observed by the C. neoformans HUVEC group (Fig 3).

L-NAMEs affect the immune response in C. neoformans
To investigate whether L-NAMEs inhibit the immune response in C. neoformans, we tested the response of HUVECs to L-NAMEs and the effect of L-NAMEs on the immune response. The L-NAMEs significantly reduced the HUVEC group survival rate at 24 hours after infection. However, the HUVEC group still had significantly better survival rate compared to the C. neoformans group (Fig 4). Furthermore, L-NAMEs reduced the number of CFU in HUVECs infected with C. neoformans.

L-NAMEs have positive effects on growth of C.


## Discussion
The immune system is a complex, multi-organised, and dynamic organ that is highly responsive to disease condition. The immune response to the infection is highly regulated by several factors, such as the level of cellular IFN-<U+03B3> in the immune cells, as well as the cytokines such as IL-1, IFN-<U+03B3>, TNF-a, and IFN-<U+03B3> [40]. The IL-1, IL-6, IL-13, IL-23, and interleukin-13 are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Cryptococcus [40]. The activation of the human complement system in response to C. neoformans infection provides an alternative to the need for the production of specific cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13 [41]. The lymphocyte subset in the lymphoid organs is also essential for the adaptive immune response to infection, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases [42]. The immune response to the fungal infection in the human body is highly conserved and varied between different pathogens, but immune cell differentiation has been well studied [43]. The present study also showed that a distinct Th2 and Th17 cell subset was significantly increased in the lung of patients with cryptococcal infection.

In the present study, there was an increase in the CXCR4 gene (CXCR4 gene) in the lung of patients with cryptococcal infection. The CXCR4 gene is a key player in the transcription of genes related to cell wall synthesis, cell morphology, and immune responses to fungal infection in the host. A recent study demonstrated that CCR4 has an important role in the regulation of cell morphology and immune responses to fungal infection, and plays an important role in the development of immunodeficiency in the host [44]. The CCR4 expression is associated with virulence and survival in mice [45]. In the present study, CCR4 expression was increased in the lung of patients with cryptococcal infection.
