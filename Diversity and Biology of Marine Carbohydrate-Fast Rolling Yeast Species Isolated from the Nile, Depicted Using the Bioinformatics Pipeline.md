## Abstract
Fluoridated nuclear magnetic resonance (FMR) spectra of a collection of rare and endangered mycobacterial and fungal isolates, from the Azeri-origin (Azer Peninsula), from the coast of Sicily, from the Iranian plateau to the coast of Bessarria, were analysed to evaluate their FMR spectral features, to analyse their relationship with culture-dependent molecular assays, and to assess their sensitivity. The most abundant spectra associated with the culture-isolated spectra of the isolates were: a) Corynespora rhamnosus-type strain CNR YSII (Yegic) and CNR YSIII (Yegic) (carynespora-type Xylaria) with a median of 1.83 and 2.53 cm, respectively; b) Aspergillus nidulans Xylaria (A. nidulans) with a median of 1.43 and 2.37 cm, respectively; c) Aspergillus-fucus complex (Fusarium) with a median of 1.49 and 2.87 cm, respectively; d) Aspergillus-Varroa maryensis with a median of 1.32 and 2.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom is a complex ecosystem with more than 10 million species, of which only about 100 are pathogenic [1]. The importance of the fungal kingdom in human health has been growing very rapidly, and these fungi are among the most important causes of infections in the world [2,3]. The fungal pathogens are widely distributed in the environment, including humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms, which represent an important source of food and drinking water contamination in many parts of the world [4]. The infection process of fungal diseases, such as candidiasis, as well as other fungal infections, is complicated by their complex interaction with the host immune system [5].

In this context, several pathogenic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Sporothrix schenckii, are found in the blood of patients with various diseases. In general, the pathogenic fungi are facultative intracellular, which allows growth in the human tissues and cells at high ambient temperature. The yeast-to-hypha transition is important for pathogenesis. The hypha-mediated pathogenicity of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans was shown in vitro [6,7] and in vivo [8]. The yeast-to-hypha transition is also involved in the pathogenesis of some other fungal pathogens, such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Sporothrix schenckii, and in the regulation of virulence [9]. The yeast-to-hypha transition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other human fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans [10], and the response of these pathogens to the yeast-to-hypha transition is related to the secretion of different factors, such as adhesins and enzymes [11].


## Methods
These species are the highest diversity in the genus Nile, which was chosen based on the sequence data from the release of the yeast genome project (PDB code 20180807. Additionally, the bacteria were listed in the sequence data of the taxonomic high committee of the Federal Republic of SÃ£o Paulo (FRESP-FROM).

The gene database was downloaded from NCBI, and a table was assigned to each species and the species name. In addition, the sequences of the species were imported into the Blast2GO program (version 1.4.0) (http://www.blast2go.com) (version 1.4.0) to calculate their sequence similarity. The program, which is based on the UniProt database, was used to determine the homology of the bacterial and the yeast sequences. The program, which is based on the BLAST search, was used to determine the taxonomic identity of the two sequences. The fungal species were assigned the highest taxonomic priority taxonomic priority.

The fungal species were classified into different subclasses by using the BLAST search algorithm against the NCBI database of fungal taxa. The BLAST program was used to identify the taxonomic positions of the taxonomic classifications. The taxonomic classifications were then used to assign species to different genera. The fungal species were then compared with those of bacteria and yeast using the BLAST and UniProt BLAST algorithms. The results were then filtered using the following criteria: (1) the number of sequences within the taxonomic class was less than 10 and (2) the identity of the bacterial species was greater than 90%.

The BLAST analysis was conducted using the method of Kruskal-Wallis (KW) and the E-value was set to be 1e^-15. The cutoff value for e-value was set at 10^-5. The blast and confidence threshold was set at 95%.

## Results
The marine yeasts were selected based on their bioinformatics profile and their ability to tolerate different pH value. Several of the selected marine yeasts have been shown to be resistant to various stresses, including low pH, extreme temperatures, nutrient limitation, and other environmental stresses (Rocha et al., 2011; Schuster et al., 2015). The bioinformatics pipeline may be useful for marine-specific marine yeasts isolated from the Nile because many of these marine yeasts were recently reported as resistant to all three environmental stresses (Table S3). To assess the specificity of the selected marine-specific marine-specific yeast species, we quantified their ability to survive, replicate, and multiply in various environmental conditions (Table S4). In contrast to other marine yeasts, the marine yeasts that showed significant sensitivity to low pH values (Table S4), the marine yeasts that were more sensitive to extreme pH values were those that were more resistant to salt stress (Table S4). For each of the six selected marine yeasts, we also assessed their ability to grow in different stress conditions (Table S5). We selected the six selected marine yeast species because of their ability to grow in acidic or alkaline environments (Table S5). The best growth conditions were temperature-sensitive conditions (Figure 3). At pH values of 6.5, 9.0, and 13.5, the most sensitive marine yeasts grew well in pH-sensitive (5.0), alkaline (9.0), and constant (15.5) environments. At pH values of 10.0, the most sensitive marine yeasts were growth in acidic (5.0) environments. At pH values of 6.0, 9.0, and 13.5, the most sensitive marine yeasts were growth in constant (15.5) environments. The most sensitive marine yeasts were growth in acidic environments.

To assess whether the bioinformatics pipeline can be used to accurately predict species composition, we first used a database of species with known phenotypic characteristics to predict their taxonomic composition using the Bayesian cluster analysis pipeline (Davies et al., 2011). For each selected marine yeast species, we chose four common species and compared their composition to each other using the six species' profiles of phenotypic characteristics (Table S6).


## Discussion
In contrast, the microbial community associated with acetate and acetyl acetate is relatively few (in contrast to the marine microbiota associated with phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase) [25.

Bioinformatics pipeline was applied to the Northern Hemisphere microbial community to find those that do not have access to phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase and those that do not have access to acetate and acetyl acetate. The results were shown in Figure 3. The diversity of marine bacterial and fungal communities in the Mediterranean area was significantly higher than that in the Mediterranean Sea [25]. Marine fungi are known to be less colonized than plants and algae [26]. The marine fungi have been associated with many diseases, including diet, herbivory and farming [27]. Marine fungi are important decomposers and are able to reduce plant wastes in the Mediterranean Sea [28]. The marine fungal community was also significantly higher than that in the Mediterranean Sea [25]. Although the Mediterranean sea is the main destination for the production of fatty acids [29], marine fungal communities are found in the marine environment [30].

The bioinformatics pipeline was applied to the marine microbial community to find those that do not have access to phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase and those that do not have access to acetate and acetyl acetate. The results were shown in Figure 4. The marine fungi are known to be less colonized than plants and algae [30]. The marine fungi have been associated with many diseases, including diet, herbivory, and farming [31]. The marine fungi have been found to be more colonized than plants and algae [31]. In contrast, the marine fungi did not have access to phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase, which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase.

Bioinformatics pipeline was applied to the marine bacterial community to find those that do not have access to phenoloxidase and cellobiohydrolase. The results were shown in Figure 5. The diversity of marine bacterial and fungal communities was significantly higher than that in the Mediterranean Sea [25].
