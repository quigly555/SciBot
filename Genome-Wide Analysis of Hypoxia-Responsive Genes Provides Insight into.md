## Abstract
The Pathogenesis of Zoonotic Bipolar Disorders (PBD) includes multiple cellular and genetic mechanisms, which are dependent on the Dectin-1 alpha (Dectin-1a), a serine/threonine/threonine/amino acid protein of the small GTPase family of eukaryotic organisms. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of Dectin-1a in the cellular response of patients with a spectrum of PBD, focusing on the preclinical studies, and the clinical evaluation, in order to determine the best treatment modality for these patients.

Thirty preclinical studies were enrolled, and seven were precluded by the use of data from single-center studies. Five studies (N = 41) were from the National Health Service, and three were from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (CO-IFTC). The other six studies (N = 79) were from small international institutions.

Dectin-1a was the most abundant protein in the plasma of patients with a spectrum of Zoonotic PBD (n = 22.9%) and was significantly enriched in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with a median cell count of 47 cells/ÂµL (IQR, 11-73) and an overall nuclei-dependent expression pattern (50% lower in the plasma and 60% higher in the CSF of patients with a spectrum of Zoonotic PBD compared to healthy controls).

Our results suggest that Dectin-1a is an important negative regulator of Zoonotic PBD in these patients, which may be due to the ability of Dectin-1a to mediate different cellular responses.


## Introduction
Aspergillus nidulans, the causative agent of the disease formomyuroidosis, is the most common fungal pathogen of the central nervous system (CNS) (1). In fact, the number of cases diagnosed in the CNS of patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) is estimated to be over 1.5 million annually (2). Current treatment of IA is mostly limited to combination therapy with antifungals and anti-HIV/retroviral therapy (4). The use of antifungals in the treatment of IA is associated with adverse outcomes, including life-threatening hemoptysis, myelosuppression, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and death in the majority of cases (5,6).


## Methods
malayi was collected from a male patient with a chronic oral infection of the footpad of his footpa. The disease was diagnosed on a clinical basis, based on histopathology and microbiology and then the pathogen was identified. As a positive India ink stain was observed in the footpad and on microscopic examination of the wound, the pathogen was identified. Pathogenicity was considered as positive if it was present in the footpad or in the oral cavity.

The clinical data, including skin, mucus, edema, and the urogenital area were collected from the microbiological examination. The histopathological data was collected from the urogenital examination and the urogenital area was analyzed. The percentage of the urogenital area was recorded as the percent of the skin area. The percentage of the oral cavity was recorded as the percent of the oral cavity. The urogenital area was divided into three dimensions: 1) on the upper side, 1.5 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm, 3.5 cm, 4.5 cm, and 5 cm, 6.5 cm, and 7.5 cm, respectively. The percent of the oral cavity was recorded as the percent of the oral cavity. The percentage of the urogenital area was divided into four dimensions: 1) the width (3-4 cm) of the urogenital area, 3 cm, 5 cm, and 7.5 cm, and 2) the depth (3-4 cm). The percentage of the oral cavity was divided into five dimensions: 1) the depth of the oral cavity, 2 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm, and 3 cm, 6 cm, and 7.5 cm, 3.5 cm, and 8.5 cm, 4.5 cm, and 8.5-11.5 cm, respectively. The percentage of the oral cavity was divided into six dimensions: 1) the width (3-4 cm), 2 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm, and 3 cm, 5 cm, and 6-7.5 cm, respectively. The percentage of the oral cavity was divided into seven dimensions: 1) the depth of the oral cavity, 2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm, and 3 cm, 6 cm, and 7-8 cm, respectively.


## Results
We identified 447 genes that were common to both types of stress (Figure 1A, Additional file 4: Table S5. The Hap2-SSH2 gene set contains 1231 genes (including 447 genes in the Yap1/Hap2 type) that are differentially regulated in response to hypoxia. We found that the Hap2-SSH2 gene set contains many genes that are activated in response to hypoxia, including the Hap2-SSH2 protein kinases, the Hap2-SSH2 phosphatase, the Hap2-psRNA synthetase, and the Hap2-psRNA biosynthetic enzyme (Additional file 4: Table S5).

In addition, we identified the Hap2-SSH2 gene set contains genes that are activated in response to oxidative stress (Additional file 4: Table S5). We found that the Hap2-SSH2 gene set contains several genes that are activated in response to oxidative stress, including the Hap2-SSH2 protein kinases, the Hap2-psRNA synthetase, and the Hap2-psRNA biosynthetic enzyme. We found that the Hap2-SSH2 gene set contains genes that are activated in response to oxidative stress (Additional file 4: Table S5).

To further explore the potential roles of the Hap2-SSH2 gene set in hypoxia-responsive gene expression, we determined the expression levels of the Hap2-SSH2 gene set during the first 10 days of hypoxia, and then compared the levels of Hap2-SSH2 during the second 10 days. In the first 10 days of hypoxia, the levels of Hap2-SSH2 were significantly down-regulated compared to the levels in the first 10 days (P < 0.05).


## Discussion
cerevisiae hypoxia-responsive genes in . cerevisiae revealed that the transcript level of hypoxia-responsive genes varied between the two different strains [12], our current study revealed that the transcript level of the hypoxia-responsive genes varied between the two strains in both strains. Notably, the transcript level of the hypoxia-responsive genes varied between the two strains of the type strain R265, while the transcript level of the other hypoxia-responsive genes varied between the two strains of R265. These results suggest that the genes involved in the biosynthesis of sterol biosynthesis may be differentially regulated between strains of R265 and R265.

Protein-protein interaction and mitochondrial membrane fusion
The hypoxia-responsive genes were found to be involved in a number of protein-protein interactions. These include mitochondrial reductase, tyrosine kinase, glutamine synthetase, and N-acetylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of these proteins were found in all of the strains of S. cerevisiae. In the R265 strain, the first three proteins are found in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 6A, Figure 6B), while the other three are found in the cytosol and mitochondria (Figure 6C, Figure 6D). Thus, the two cytoplasmic proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of proteins. The proteins involved in the biosynthesis of these proteins were also found in the R265 strain (Figure 6C, Figure 6D). The biosynthesis of these proteins is a key event in mitochondrial membrane fusion and the formation of mitochondrial pseudohyphal. In yeast, S. cerevisiae, the glycosyltransferase is required for the glycosylation of the 5' end of the mitochondrial membrane. The glycosylation is also an important event in the biosynthesis of 5' UTRs [34]. The glycosyltransferase is the key enzyme in the glycosylation of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria and mitochondria are the two most important organelles in the mitochondrial membrane.
