## Abstract

A retrospective chart review of all adult patients admitted to our hospital from 2007 to 2015 was performe.

Three hundred and seventy-four patients were enrolled, 63% were male, 89% reported immune suppurative disorders, and 64% had known cases of immune suppurative disorders.

A history of immune suppurative disorder was detected in 31% of patients.

Complications were diagnosed in 10% of patients with immune suppurative disorders and in 23% of patients with known cases of immune suppurative disorders.

Complications involving the central nervous system (CNS) were detected in 34% of patients.

Complications involving other organs (i.e., the lungs, kidneys, and brain) were detected in 46% of patients.

Complications involving the brain (i.e., mycobacteria, Cryptococcus, and myeloid cell lymphoma) were detected in 11% of patients.

Complications affecting the lungs (i.e., tuberculosis, Chagas’ disease, Hodgkin's disease, and Chagas' lymphoma) were detected in 12% of patients.

Complications affecting the lymph nodes (i.e., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and the urogenital system (i.e., Epstein Barr virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acanthamoeba spp.) were detected in 46% of patients.

Complications affecting the liver (i.e., histoplasmosis, Kaposi's sarcoma, Cryptococcus, leprosy, Hodgkin's lymphoma), and the spleen (i.e., Epstein Barr virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and MDR-associated lymphocytic polyploid tissue granulomatous liver disease) were detected in 24% of patients.

In this single-center study, we describe the most frequent findings of complications in patients with immune suppurative disorders: complications that affect the CNS, such as immune suppurative disorders, such as toxoplasmosis, leprosy, and Acanthamoeba spp.


## Introduction
The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is a commensal of the skin and the oral cavity. It colonizes the human skin and mucosal surfaces in a healthy human being without causing any apparent disease. In the healthy human body the yeast can be isolated from the skin, on the hair, on the nails, on the hair shaft, and on the mucosa, and in the oral cavity, but only in very low numbers. This is the case in patients with eczema, dermal ulcer, or other skin conditions [1-3]. The incidence of candidiasis is very high in healthy people, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% in patients with eczema and/or skin conditions [4]. In a few cases, the mortality rate has exceeded 50% [5-7]. The incidence of superficial candidiasis is approximately 50% in healthy people [8-12]. The annual incidence in patients with skin and nail diseases is about 1.7 million worldwide, and the mortality rate is about 300,000 per year [13]. The incidence of life-threatening infections is very high. The mortality rate of patients with oral candidiasis is between 23 and 40% [14].

In the case of fungal infections, the patients are mostly debilitated and debilitated, and usually infected by the same organism. The fungus is found in the environment, either in the soil, on living tissues, or in the skin of the patient. In these cases, the causative organism is often a microorganism with a tropism for the skin.


## Methods
The second largest hospital in Anhui Medical University, which is located in the Hubei Medical University Hospital, is a tertiary health care center with a large, hospital-based academic hospital setting with approximately 1,500 bed. There is no specific antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection, which is caused by a lack of stable and stable antiretroviral therapy (ART)-approval and therefore not a significant risk factor for HIV infection [11]. During the study period, approximately 10% of all HIV-infected adults admitted to the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University Hospital were in the CD4 count <250 cells/µL, which is among the highest of any hospital in Anhui Medical University Hospital. The risk of HIV infection was considered to be low in HIV-infected adults in the hospital. The cohort consisted of HIV-infected adults with a CD4 count <250 cells/µL, but without any history of antiretroviral therapy.

As a control, we performed blood work with 1 out of 3 HIV-infected adults, including 2 HIV-infected adults with a CD4 count <250 cells/µL, and 1 out of 3 HIV-infected adults with CD4 count <250 cells/µL. The blood work was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Health, China [22]. In addition, all work with HIV-infected adults was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Health, China [23].

To determine the susceptibility to antiretroviral therapy, we performed blood work with 1 out of 3 HIV-infected adults. After blood work with 2 out of 3 HIV-infected adults, we performed blood work with 1 out of 3 HIV-infected adults. All blood work with HIV-infected adults was performed in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Health, China [24].


## Results
. Characterization of the Cryptococcal Biofilm Classifier
We selected the Cryptococcal Cryptococcal Biofilm Classifier (CBB) to identify the most common strains of Cryptococcal biofilm that could be identified in the C. neoformans genome. The most common strains of C. neoformans C. neoformans C. neoformans were identified using the three different algorithms of BLASTp, KEGG and MCM. The list of all the most common strains identified by the three algorithms are shown in Table 2. Of the three algorithms, BLASTp was the most commonly used for the identification of Cryptococcal biofilms in the C. neoformans genome. KEGG was used for the identification of strains with low virulence in the human and mouse models. MCM was used to identify strains with high virulence in the human and mouse models. The results of the BLASTp algorithm are shown in Table 2. KEGG was used to identify strains with high virulence in the human and mouse models.

3.2. Prediction of The Enzyme Composition of the Cryptococcal Biofilm Biofilm Classifier
Based on the results from the BLASTp algorithm, the E. coli BLAST3 (CsrB) (GenBank accession no. C_003240186) was used to predict the structure of the C. neoformans biofilm biofilm biofilm classifier. The results are presented in Table 3. The results of the BLASTp algorithm are shown in Table 4. KEGG was used to predict the structure of the C. neoformans biofilm biofilm biofilm classifier.

The E. coli BLAST3 (CsrB) was used to predict the EC number for the C. neoformans biofilm biofilm classifier. The results are presented in Table 5. The results are presented in Table 6. The EC number of the Cryptococcus BLAST3 (CsrB) was also used to predict the structure of the C. neoformans biofilm biofilm classifier. The results are presented in Table 7.


## Discussion
The majority of patients were HIV-infected patients, which was consistent with previous studies [15,17. We have previously reported that primary cerebral malaria was a rare event (2/33) among patients with HIV and that cerebral malaria was rare among patients with HIV and that the median age of HIV-infected patients was 41 years [15].

Although the risk of cerebral malaria was very high, it did not correlate with neurological deficit. Interestingly, this difference could be related to the small sample size. The more severe cases of cerebral malaria were more likely to have underlying neurological disease and the more severe cases were more likely to have cerebral malaria. This may be explained by the fact that cerebral malaria is not a rare disorder in humans [18], whereas cerebral malaria is rare in tropical countries such as Indonesia [19], Papua New Guinea [20] and Thailand [21] and is rare in South Africa [22], as well as in Tanzania [23]. We have also shown that cerebral malaria is not a rare disorder in patients with HIV, and cerebral malaria was rare in patients with HIV, although rare in non-HIV patients. This may be due to the fact that the majority of patients in our study were HIV-infected patients, and the median age of HIV patients in our study was 36 years [14].

In our study, there was a significant difference in the outcomes between HIV-infected and uninfected patients, suggesting that HIV infection in patients with HIV may be related to the development of cerebral malaria. However, the association between HIV infection and cerebral malaria was not significant (OR=3.6; p=0.027).

The clinical presentation of cerebral malaria in HIV-infected patients is a heterogeneous spectrum. It is multifactorial, with various presentation patterns, and some patients present with headache, altered mental status and focal neurological deficits. Others present with fever, fatigue, vomiting and seizures, but this is not consistent with the clinical presentation of cerebral malaria. Others present with lymphadenopathy, peripheral neuropathies and focal neurological deficits. Others present with lymphadenopathy, seizures and meningeal enhancement [4]. The only individual who had severe cerebral malaria was a patient with cerebral malaria.
