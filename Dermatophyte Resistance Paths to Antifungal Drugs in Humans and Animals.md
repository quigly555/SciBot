## Abstract
The appearance of Cryptococcus gattii in the North American Pacific Northwest (PNW) in early 2016 was unusual and resulted in the complete abandonment of this fungus by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and widespread resistance. C. gattii has not been reported to infect humans and was isolated from environmental and plant debris in the PNW. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C.


## Introduction
Although . neoformans is globally distributed, cryptococcal infections are most common in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients undergoing treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [1-3].

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is also a significant opportunistic fungal infection that can be fatal if untreated. Inhalation of Cryptococcus yeasts into the lungs results in a lung infection, which results in the development of cryptococcomas, the most common of which are encapsulated yeast cells, and usually disseminates to the central nervous system (CNS) and is fatal if left untreated [4-6]. To survive and thrive in the lungs, Cryptococcus must be able to adapt to the harsh environmental conditions that exist within the pulmonary alveoli. C. neoformans employs several strategies to evade the alveolar epithelium and that include high-affinity nutrient-limiting systems, such as the use of extracellular polysaccharides, capsule, and melanin, and the secretion of a large number of enzymes such as chitin, glucuronoxylomannan, and chitin synthase [7, 8]. These secreted enzymes are thought to be essential for the survival and replication of the yeast cells within the alveolar macrophage phagosome [9, 10]. Therefore, the high levels of capsular polysaccharides, which can be recognized by the cryptococcal cells, inhibit their internalization and may inhibit the growth of the yeast cells [11].

Based on the above facts, we investigated the ability of Cryptococcus to adapt to the cryptococcal cell environment using a method that involves high throughput screening of the infecting cells using high throughput techniques. Here we report a screening method that targeted the cytoplasmic enzymes of the cryptococcal cells and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) enzyme of the pathogen C. neoformans to identify proteins that specifically inhibit the growth of the pathogen.


## Methods
Plant and soil
Two plant species (E. vulgaris and E. vulgarisea) were chosen from the collection of the Forestry and Agricultural Research Service (FAR) (Table 1). These plants are taxonomically different from each other in the collection of the FARS (Table 1). The species were used as one of the samples for the RSM study. The plant specimens were deposited at the Institute of Forest Products (IFP), Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

Inoculation of plants

## Results
albicans was dependent on azole resistance in humans (Boparipa et a., 2013). We found that the fungicidal effect of tetracycline against C. albicans was dependent on azole resistance, and therefore we investigated the fungicidal effect of tetracycline on the C. albicans culture supernatant of mice. We used qPCR to monitor the effect of tetracycline on the culture supernatant of C. albicans. When the C. albicans culture supernatant was supplemented with the azole or tetracycline, the wild type and the mutant strain were both significantly more sensitive to the drug than the control strain, while the mutation in the gene coding for C. albicans completely abolished the sensitivity (Fig 4). However, the mutant strain did not show any statistically significant difference in sensitivity to the drug (P = 0.29 for all comparisons).

Mutation in C. albicans alters azole resistance
To further investigate whether the azole resistance of C. albicans is associated with azole resistance, we examined the azole resistance of C. albicans by determining the azole resistance of the mutant strain and the control strain. In order to evaluate whether mutations in the gene encoding for C. albicans CNAG_05216 (designated CNAG_05216^T) are involved in azole resistance, we complemented the deletion mutant by introducing the CNAG_05216^T allele in the C. albicans C. albicans transformant C-21 (C-21A1) and reconstituting the CNAG_05216^T allele in the C. albicans transformant C-22 (C-22A2). The CNAG_05216^T mutant and the control strain were grown in YEPD at 25Â°C for 1 h, then the medium was collected, and the colonies were stained with FM4-64. The results demonstrated that the C. albicans CNAG_05216^T mutant was more sensitive than the control strain to the drug (Fig 5).

To further determine whether the azole resistance of C. albicans is associated with azole resistance, we examined the azole resistance of C.


## Discussion
However, the safety of antifungal drugs in humans has been studied in a small number of studies, including those that analyzed the use of antifungal drugs in clinical practice [22], [25], [26. In this study, we performed a retrospective study to compare antifungal drugs between patients with HIV and healthy controls, using a group of patients with a combined history of HAART and CLL. The multivariate analysis showed that antifungal drugs were more toxic than the oral drugs. The data from the multivariate analysis revealed that CLL had the highest risk of death, with an odds ratio of 1.6 for every 100 mg of antifungal drug. In the multivariate analysis, the risk of death was associated with CLL, with an odds ratio of 1.5 for every 100 mg of antifungal drug.

The results from the multivariate analysis showed that the risk of death was higher for CLL in HIV patients. We can conclude that CLL is a highly toxic drug with an adverse effect on patients with HIV. The safety of antifungal drugs in HIV patients has been studied in a small number of studies. In one study, the association between CLL and CNS infections was studied in mice. [27] In another study, the association between CLL and a history of HAART was also investigated in humans. [28] However, these studies were performed in small number of patients, so the results were not generalizable. The results from this study showed that patients with CLL had a higher risk of death. The study by Zhao et al. was one of the largest studies of CLL in human beings. [29] The study reported that CLL has a higher risk of death than the oral drugs. The risk of death was 2.2 times higher for patients with HIV. The results of this study showed that CLL was more toxic than the oral drugs. The results from this study suggested that CLL was a very toxic drug to HIV patients.

In this study, the association of CLL and AIDS-related diseases was demonstrated. The results showed that CLL had the highest risk of AIDS-related diseases, with a risk ratio of 1.9.
