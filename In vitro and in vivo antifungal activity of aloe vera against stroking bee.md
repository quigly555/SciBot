## Abstract

Aloe vera significantly inhibited the growth of the three insect species (Fungi: .6-19.0 µg/g, Acanthamoeba castellanii 6.8-31.4 µg/g, and Acanthamoeba carribbica 0.7-20.1 µg/g) in the presence of urokinaseptin (100% inhibition rate, 12.4-times higher than that of DGR-169/R). Aloe vera synergistically inhibited the growth of Acanthamoeba and stroking bee in the presence of urokinaseptin (97.4-fold and 96.7-fold, respectively). In contrast, the aloe vera antagonist, ivermectin, inhibited the growth of A. castellanii and stroking bee in the presence of urokinaseptin (91.2-fold and 86.7-fold, respectively). In addition, aloe vera synergistically inhibited the growth of A. castellanii in the presence of urokinaseptin (85.8-fold and 81.1-fold, respectively). In contrast, the aloe vera antagonist, ivermectin, had no effect on the growth of A. castellanii in the presence of urokinaseptin (64.0-fold and 63.5-fold, respectively). In contrast, the aloe vera antagonist, ivermectin had no effect on the growth of A. castellanii in the presence of urokinaseptin (55.0-fold and 39.4-fold, respectively). In contrast, the combination of aloe vera + urokinaseptin inhibited the growth of A. castellanii and stroking bee in the presence of urokinaseptin (78.5-fold and 67.4-fold, respectively).

Overall, aloe vera significantly inhibited the growth of Acanthamoeba species in the presence of urokinaseptin (100%), ivermectin (75%), and urokinaseptin (73%), and in the combination inhibition had no effect on the growth of Acanthamoeba species in the presence of aloe vera (99.4%), ivermectin (73.5%), and urokinaseptin (67.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are a significant threat to crop production worldwide, with more than 20,000 reported cases each year (Brown et al. 2009). The fungal pathogens responsible for IFD are Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans (Stern et al. 2008, 2010). Although C. albicans is the most common etiological agent of IFD, it is also the most common cause of human fungal infections in immunocompromised patients (Stern et al. 2009). However, C. neoformans and C. glabrata account for greater than 90% of all opportunistic infections in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals (Stern et al. 2009). Although C. albicans causes most IFD in the United States, it has also emerged as a primary pathogen in other parts of the world, including Japan, where it is responsible for over 1.5 million life-threatening infections annually (Kaur et al. 2009, 2010). In addition to clinical relevance, C. albicans is also a major cause of wound infections and mucosal infections in healthy individuals (Kaur et al. 2009). The major challenges for the control of fungal infections include the emergence of drug resistance, the increasing incidence of antimicrobial drug-resistant strains, and the emergence of antifungal drug-resistant species (Gourlay et al. 2008, 2010). Despite the global recognition of the importance of C. albicans as a primary pathogen, the incidence of IFD has remained largely uncharacterized.

One of the most important factors influencing the incidence of IFD in the United States is the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that are increasingly becoming standard-beating drugs in both animal and plant research laboratories. These antibiotics are either fungicidal (lantibiotic, fungicidal activity) or fungistatic (antifungal activity). Antibiotic treatment in humans is often based on either combination therapy, and the most commonly used antibiotics are echinocandins.


## Methods
Twelve-week-old male bees were infected with 5 × 10^4 of each strain of . stroking bee and treated with 1 mL of 10% normal saline (NMSS). After 24 h, the larvae were killed and their skin was removed. The larvae were used as control for the inoculation of the culture media. The inoculated larvae were kept in a Büchi-panelled greenhouse at 28°C and the number of dead larvae was recorded daily. The larvae were used as a test of the effects of a variety of chemical agents on the larvae to test the viability of the medium. The experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [23] and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (No. 3.02.2015).

2.3. In Vitro Antifungal Activity of aloe vera against M. lindemora
To evaluate the antifungal activity of aloe vera against M. lindemora, the insect larvae were inoculated with 5 × 10^4 of each strain and maintained at 28°C for 12 h. Then, they were allowed to develop in a Büchi-panelled greenhouse at 28°C for 12 h. The larvae were maintained in a Büchi-panelled greenhouse at 28°C for 12 h. The insect suspensions were prepared by dissolving the yeast cells in 10% normal saline (NMSS) and allowing the suspension to settle at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant (CFU) was removed. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at a wavelength of 340 nm using a spectrophotometer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The antifungal activity was considered as the lowest concentration of aloe vera that completely inhibited the growth of M. lindemora. The concentrations used in the assays were 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 µg/mL. The antifungal activity of aloe vera against M. lindemora was considered as the lowest concentration of aloe vera that completely inhibited the growth of M. lindemora. The assays were carried out in triplicate.

## Results
Cultural application of L. surae as a novel DNA mutagenic agent
L. surae can be used to mutagenize plant DNA in plants or as a novel DNA mutagenic agent. The fungus has been used to study the development of resistance against plant pathogenic fungi and to study the formation of new DNA mutagenic compounds against fungal pathogens.

In the present study, we used the L. surae DNA mutagenic agent L. surae RNAi in the construction of a DNA mutagenic model of L. surae. The results demonstrated that the initial culture of L. surae DNA mutagenesis by L. surae was successful (Fig 1), and the genome sequencing resulted in a total of 13,817,494 bp of sequence (Table 1). The total amount of reads was 11.1 Mb for the first 25% sequence, and the total amount of reads was 100,000 bp for the first 25% sequence.

The L. surae DNA mutagenic agent L. surae RNAi was used to develop a DNA mutagenic model of L. surae. The results demonstrated that the initial culture of L.


## Discussion
In this study we have used C. gattii strains to characterize the intracellular trafficking of C. neoformans in the blood and the effect of C. gattii on the intracellular trafficking of C. neoformans in the blood. Our results are consistent with the notion that C. neoformans is intracellularly trafficked to the brain by C. gattii. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that C. gattii is able to export C. neoformans in the blood, but not the blood, in a manner consistent with the notion that C. gattii intrudes in the blood.

C. gattii is a nonpathogenic yeast that causes meningoencephalitis and meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients. In addition to its widespread distribution in Southeast Asia and North America, C. gattii is also associated with rare and rare human diseases such as fungal meningitis and Cryptosporidium meningitis, both of which are very rare in HIV-infected individuals [6]. C. neoformans is also reported to produce recombinant proteins and cell wall modifications that facilitate infection by C. neoformans [7].

Our results demonstrate that C. gattii intrudes in the blood into the intracellular trafficking of C. neoformans, and that this type of trafficking occurs in vivo. The exocytosis of C. neoformans by C. gattii is a novel mechanism in which the presence of C. gattii cells is required for intracellular trafficking [5]. The survival of C. neoformans in the brain requires C. gattii cells to be transported into the brain. Since the blood cell wall is composed of a large amount of cell wall proteins, it is not surprising that C. neoformans secretes cell wall components that are structurally similar to those found in the brain [4, 7].
