## Abstract
We examined the prevalence of opportunistic infections in Cuba over the years and reported the first such case in a young woman. These observations raise the possibility that the emergence of opportunistic infection may be in part due to Cuban adolescents, in particular children, who, as part of their general health, may be debilitated and under-active.

We examined the morbidity and mortality among patients with opportunistic infections in Cuba. We found that the vast majority of the patients were adolescents, and these patients were not from poor or working classes. Among them, 57% were aged between <10 and 20 years old. The prevalence of the most common opportunistic infection was tuberculosis (68%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (16%), Leishmania rheumatismus (9%), and Chagas not known or unknown (5%). Overall, the overall mortality was 33.9% in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 23.9% in those with pulmonary aspergillosis.


## Introduction
Hepatic inflammation is associated with several inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [1]. The most common inflammatory disease of the liver is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by diarrhoea, colitis, and bloating [2]. The most common IBD conditions are inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis [3]. The most common IBD is not caused by any specific fungus, but rather by IBD-1, a rare disease of the Crohn’s’s’s disease complex (CD) [4], [5].


## Methods
5% ethyl acetate and 1% sodium hypochlorit. The gut tissue was removed, and the contents were plated on fresh SDA. The plate was incubated for 48 h at room temperature. The numbers of colony forming units (CFU) of the fungal strains were counted, and the results were expressed in µM per gram of the gut tissue.

Molecular Analysis of Yeast Substrate Activity
The microbial activities of the yeasts were determined using a previously described method [26], [27]. Briefly, after incubation at room temperature for 48 h with various concentrations of the antifungal agents, the microorganism suspensions were centrifuged at 8000× g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1% acetic acid and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000× g. The supernatant was collected and then subjected to the addition of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The filtrate was collected and evaporated. The amount of reducing sugars present in the filtrate was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC-10; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The GC column consisted of a flame ionization energy of 0.1 m/z and a column temperature of 5°C. The column was operated in a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the injection volume was 10 µl. The temperature of the oven was set at 100°C. The molecular weight of the purified yeasts was determined using the MALDI-TOF MS method. The molecular weight of each yeast in the fraction was determined by means of the electrospray ionization (ESI) and mass spectrometry. The solubility of the compounds in the electrospray ionization method was determined by means of a desiccator for 10 min at 100°C. The compounds in the mass spectrometry method were dissolved in DMSO to be solubilized in water. The solvent system used in the mass spectrometry was as follows: ACN; 100% acetic acid; 1% H_2O_2; and 0.


## Results
. Load and Frequency of Microbiota
The average annual production of the two most abundant bacterial genera, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi, in the dry-chitin-rich potato loast is 43% and 34% respectively. The total amounts of these bacterial genera were 54% and 45% of that in the dry-chitin-rich potato loast, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the total amount of Proteobacteria was 562.5 ± 153.9 g L^-1, followed by 68.7 ± 91.5 g L^-1 Chloroflexi (Table 1), and 17.2 ± 5.7% of Proteobacteria.


## Discussion
In contrast to the other yeasts, some of them did not form a rosette-colored rosette in the nose of . cerevisiae [59]. These findings could indicate that the rosette-colored rosette formation in S. cerevisiae is a consequence of the colonization of the bat-white surface of bats by bats (or other bat species) [60,61]. The rosette-colored rosette formation observed in this study could be a result of the association of S. cerevisiae with bats.

While most yeasts are psychrotolerant, many are psychrotolerant when bat flies are colonized [62,63]. The observation of rosette-colored rosette formation in this study could be due to the involvement of some strains of Cryptococcus neoformans in the bat-white-substrate interactions [64]. In fact, Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of human and murine Cryptococcus neoformans infections [65]. In addition, Cryptococcus gattii is a psychrotolerant yeast that has been reported to form rosettes in the gut of bats [66]. In this study, rosettes were observed in the bat-white-substrate interactions. Therefore, rosettes could be caused by the interactions of bats with bat flies. This observation could reflect the bat-white-substrate interaction, or bat-white-substrate interactions, to the bat-white-substrate interactions, which are considered to be the primary source of bat flies. This is an important question for future research, as bats are ubiquitous and can be colonized by a wide variety of bat flies.

In addition to the bats that colonize the bats, several other bat species are also bat-associated with bats, including P. terricola, P. aeruginosa, and P. sylvatica [65,67]. Although this study is the first study of bat rosette formation in bats, it does not indicate whether rosette formation is an independent and distinct process that occurs in bats or if bat rosette formation is a consequence of bats. Future research is needed to address this question.

The relationship between bat-bat rosette formation and bat-bat rosette formation could also be linked to bats' virulence.
