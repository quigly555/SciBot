## Abstract
This study aims to explore the role of factors present in the gut microbiota of rats during starvation and during mesenteric inflammation in mice. Monitors body weight, blood sugar and fasting body weight were collected from mice at the onset of inflammation. The rat gut microbial community was then analyzed using 16S rRNA and ITS regions to better understand the influence of factors. Findings indicated that low GI total and lower GI hemolymph total had a greater involvement in the onset of inflammation compared to higher GI total, which was independent of factors like total and carbohydrate. No differences were observed in total and carbohydrate digesting between the two groups. Fasting fat, total and total macronutrients were significantly higher in the less severely ill mice, suggesting a non-significant effect of the low GI total versus the higher diet. These findings indicate that factors like gut colonisation, intestinal total and carbohydrate digesting may be related to the onset of inflammation in mice. Therefore, the use of a monoclonal antibody or coagulation factor in mice may have a significant beneficial effect on the immune response.


## Introduction
As the immune system of this species, the bacterial endotoxin toxin of Helicobacter pylori is an effector molecule of the respiratory burst and has an inhibitory role on the pneumococcal endotoxin [28,29. The pneumococcal endotoxin toxin is also involved in the innate immunity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the causative agent of Escherichia coli typhimurium, a respiratory illness that may occur during influenza virus infection [30,31]. In addition to the bacteriostatic effects, the presence of another toxin, monocyte-derived cytokine that inhibits the immune response of mice infected with influenza virus and Staphylococcus aureus, also induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a in vitro [30,32,33,34].

In addition to the innate immune system, the fungal component of the pneumococcal immune system is usually associated with the cellular defense against the intracellular pathogen pneumococci. The pneumococcal immune response consists of the following components: the development of a protective coat consisting of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and, subsequently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the production of soluble neutrophil extracellular traps (SNCs) [35,36,37,38]. The basic components of the pneumococcal immune response are the following: the production of immunoglobulins and anti-pneumococcal immune globulin (IgG) and, subsequently, complement components [39,40,41,42,43]. NETs are formed by a complex network of interacting peptides and immunoglobulins that surround the peptide surface. The formation of the NETs is crucial in the establishment of the protective barrier. They are activated by the extracellular signal peptides (EPSs) and by cytokines and are thus key players in the protective response to pneumococcal infections. In addition to the protective response, pneumococcal infections can also result in the development of other diseases such as end-stage renal disease and cancers.


## Methods

Phylogenetic analysis of . pombe-encoding genes
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome database contains about 200,000 entries representing a total of 2,000,000 bacterial and 1,000,000 fungal sequences (see Table S1). Two non-redundant protein sequences, comprising proteins of diverse carbohydrate and protein types, were used for phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of S. pombe genes were retrieved from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae database (http://www.yeastgenome.org) and compared with their corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequence files (http://www.yeastgenome.org/index.html) in order to determine the amino acid sequence profiles for all proteins. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and the alignments were constructed with MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013).

Construction of the S. pombe-encoding gene replacement construct
For the S. pombe gene replacement construct, the genomic DNA of S. pombe strain CBS138.62 was used as a template to generate a PCR-amplified gene replacement cassette using the primer combination FR1 and FF390 (Sakai et al., 2007; Sakai, 2016). The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used to transform S. pombe strain CBS138.62 by biolistic transformation. The transformants were selected on SD-Leu-Trp-Leu-Ade agar supplemented with nourseothricin (100 µg/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). The PCR products were then purified, and the PCR product was introduced into the yeast strain by biolistic transformation (Yamada et al., 2004).

In vitro virulence assays
For in vitro virulence assays, S. pombe strains were grown in YPD liquid medium at 37 °C, and 100 µl of conidial suspension was added to 50 ml of fresh YPD liquid medium. For the spore suspensions, 10 ml of liquid YPD liquid medium was added to 1 ml of conidial suspension, and the experiment was performed in triplicate.


## Results
Protein-protein interactions in the rat primary system
The fungal cell wall contains multiple polysaccharides, including several multinucleated proteins, which can be formed by the interaction between the fungal cell wall and the host cell. We found that some proteins from the fungal cell wall were also present in the rat primary system (Fig 1). In particular, several proteins, including two manganese-dependent proteins (MMPs) and several proteins with the function of aspartyl proteases, were also present in the rat primary system (Fig 1).

Several MMPs are associated with fungal phagolysosomes and are involved in the regulation of the host response in many fungi [35], [36]. We found that some MMPs were present in the rat primary system but not in the rat phagosome. These observations suggest that these proteins may play roles in fungal phagosome remodeling in other organisms.

MMP-containing proteins are co-localized with other proteins in the host cell
The co-localization of the fungal cell wall with other components of the host cell membrane and other stimuli is a critical step in fungal phagolysosome remodeling [37], [38].


## Discussion
Alternatively, the final test may be a more complex test for determining the size of the pool of lipids, and the effects of long-term supplementation could be more eviden.

In the absence of detectable expression of LipA, the resulting lipids, cell wall contents and cytokines play a role in regulating the protective immunity. Our results suggest that the global balance of lipids and lipid A plays a positive role in the protective immune responses. Our results provide a foundation for further investigation of the role of lipid A in immune regulation and protection.

Protein metabolism
In this study we used a large number of proteins to measure the metabolic activity and the biological functions of the selected bacterial strains. The result showed that the expression of many genes involved in a wide range of metabolic processes and physiological responses were significantly up-regulated in the Pb and PbE. The main reason for this high metabolic activity could be that these enzymes are directly involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, nucleic acids and nucleic acids are converted into amino acids. In addition, proteins involved in protein synthesis were also up-regulated.

As mentioned above, PbE and PbP are the two species of E. coli that form a clade in the PbE cluster and form a well-supported clade together with the PbB and PbA species (p.s. S4A and S4B). These two strains have been shown to be able to produce different types of proteins and substrates in response to different stimuli (e.g. starvation, neutrophils, the immune response).

Genes involved in a wide range of metabolic processes and physiological responses were significantly up-regulated in the PbE and PbP. The expression of many genes involved in a wide range of metabolic processes and physiological responses was significantly up-regulated.

Protein metabolism
Proteins involved in a wide range of metabolic processes and physiological responses were significantly up-regulated.

Protein metabolism is a multi-domain biological process involving the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and amino acids. Among the proteins involved in this process, the production of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, amino acids and other metabolites were significantly up-regulated.
