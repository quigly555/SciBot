## Abstract
This study evaluated the antifungal effects of the combined use of fluconazole (FLC) and voriconazole (Vsv) against the different strains of Aspergillus niger, A. niger, and F. lusitaniae. The antifungal activity of voriconazole was assessed against strains of A. niger, A. lusitaniae, and F. eurotium using the broth microdilution method and the rabbit antifungal assays.

The antifungal activity of voriconazole was evaluated against A. niger strain using the broth microdilution method and the antifungal activity of fluconazole (FLC) against A. niger were determined by the disc diffusion method. The susceptibility of A. niger to fluconazole, voriconazole, and FLC was determined by using the microdilution test kit. Fluconazole and voriconazole were found to be synergistic in the broth microdilution assays. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for fluconazole and voriconazole were found to be 0.0325 and 0.0625, respectively. Voriconazole was fungicidal in the presence of amphotericin B and it was fungicidal in the presence of high concentrations of it.

The results showed that A. niger strain A. lusitaniae was more susceptible to fluconazole than A. niger strain A. lusitaniae. Both factors could explain the difference in the responses of the A. niger strain A. niger and A. lusitaniae. Voriconazole could be considered as an initial stimulus to the yeast cells, which can be followed by a response to the antifungal compounds.


## Introduction
Fungi are known to be responsible for life-threatening infections in the immunocompromised patient (Brown et al., 2015). Current data from the Asian countries are largely based on published cases and epidemiology studies, but there is a lack of detailed information on the incidence and clinical outcome of fungal infections in Asia. In this study, we report the outcome of invasive fungal infections in patients admitted to the Emergency Department in Taiwan. A total of 44 patients (mean age, 57.5 years; including 38.2%), mainly immunocompromised patients with renal diseases, received oral or systemic antifungal therapy.


## Methods

.3. Whole-cell Cytokine Levels and Cytokine Production
Total cytosine levels were measured using the Cytokine Duo-ECL® Reducing Reductase (Sigma) as previously described [15]. Briefly, the samples were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 24 h and then the supernatants were harvested and the reducing power was measured using the Bio-Rad Cytokine staining kit (Bio-Rad). The levels of cytokines, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, and TNF-a in the culture supernatants were quantified using the Bio-Rad Cytokine staining kit. Cytokine levels of Caspase-1, Caspase-2, and Caspase-9 in the culture supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad Cytokine staining kit. The levels of IL-6, IL-17A, IL-6P, IL-17E, IL-22, IL-23, IL-29, and TNF-a in the culture supernatants of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were quantified using the Bio-Rad Cytokine staining kit.

3.4. Cytokine Extraction and ELISA
The Caspase-1, Caspase-2, and Caspase-9 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed as previously described [16]. Briefly, 200 µl of culture supernatant was incubated with 0.5 µg/ml of phospho-Caspase-1, Caspase-2, and Caspase-9 (anti-Caspase-1, anti-Caspase-2, and anti-Caspase-9) in PBS at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml. The reaction was stopped with 1% BSA in PBS and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm.

3.5. Statistical Analysis
The results of the cytokine and TNF-a ELISA assays were compared by the Tukey-Kramer test and were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the samples. All experiments were repeated at least three times.


## Results
001. C. albicans isolates isolated from the skin microbiome in the Infectious Diseases Research Center were high in CENP-A but did not contain detectable CENP-A in the BALF or serum. The level of CENP-A in the BALF was similar to that of the total BALF or serum, suggesting that C. albicans isolates were highly sensitive to CENP-A. No significant differences in CENP-A in the BALF or serum were observed between Candida and S. enterica isolates.

The prevalence of Candida spp. was higher in the skin than in the blood (Table 2). Candida spp. were present in all regions studied. Candida spp. were present in all tissues analyzed, with no clear difference in the prevalence between the skin and blood (Table 2). The skin had a high prevalence of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis (Table 2). However, the prevalence of C. glabrata was lower in the skin than in the blood. The prevalence of C. glabrata was higher in the blood and in the skin compared to that in the blood (Table 2).

The C. albicans Candida spp. clinical isolate was the most prevalent, with more than 40% (n = 32) of the isolates isolated from the skin being C. albicans (Table 3). The isolates were mostly of C. glabrata, but some C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, and a single isolate of C. albicans from a patient with chronic renal failure, showed a higher prevalence in the skin compared to the blood (Table 3). The Candida spp. clinical isolate was the most prevalent in the blood, with more than 40% (n = 20) of the isolates isolated from the skin being C. albicans (Table 3). The C. glabrata clinical isolate was the most prevalent in the skin, with more than 40% (n = 16) of the isolates isolated from the skin being C. albicans (Table 3).

The prevalence of C. glabrata was higher in the skin than in the blood (Table 2). C.


## Discussion
This suggests that the . albicans cell surface is a highly specific and specific environment for the transcription of Sirtuin 1 and the translation of this protein. This was also confirmed by the finding that the Candida spp. can also activate Sirtuin 1 by binding to the promoter of the SIRT gene [34].

The role of the SIRT gene in pathogenicity of C. albicans was confirmed in this study by the finding that Sirtuin 1 expression is increased in the cell wall of C. albicans when compared to that of S. cerevisiae [33]. In C. albicans, the SIRT gene is also involved in the secretion of siderophores [35]. The finding that Sirtuin 1 expression is increased in the cell wall of C. albicans also suggests that the C. albicans cell wall may be a protective environment for the pathogen [36].

The gene expression of the C. neoformans ortholog, C. deuterogattii, was also found to be upregulated in the cell wall of this pathogenic fungus [37]. In addition to the S. cerevisiae ortholog, the C. deuterogattii gene was also found to be upregulated in the cell wall of C. deuterogattii in a C. deuterogattii-like response [38]. C. deuterogattii is a dimorphic yeast with an average cell size of 3.7-4.5 × 3.8-5 µm and a cell wall diameter of 2.6-4.2 µm. It has been reported that C. deuterogattii has a larger cell size than C. neoformans [39]. However, the C. deuterogattii-C. deuterogattii complex is a small, multicellular yeast strain, which has a cell wall diameter of 5.8-6.2 × 1.6-2.0 µm [40]. C. deuterogattii is the yeast species that is usually used for the isolation and characterization of the large, multicellular yeast. The yeast strain C. deuterogattii was obtained from a patient with cryptococcosis and has been used for the isolation of this fungus from serum samples in the form of infection assays [40].
