## Abstract
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a filamentous, hemibiotrophic plant pathogen that causes sclerotium and dieback in a wide range of crop species. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena have remained largely unknown so far. Our previous studies have indicated that the putative sterol biosynthetic pathway is essential for the induction of virulence traits in S. sclerotiorum. In the present study, we used comparative genomics to investigate the roles played by the sterol biosynthetic pathway in virulence and pathogenicity of S. sclerotiorum. This approach revealed that the sterol biosynthetic pathway is differentially expressed between the two mycelial forms in S. sclerotiorum.


## Introduction
., in patients with haematological malignancies, those with neutropenia and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) [1,2,3]. However, the efficacy of the immunosuppressants, especially of the sertraline (SDS) and cyclosporine (Cs), has been limited in some patients [4].

Cs are a first-line of defense against fungal infections in patients suffering from haematological malignancies and those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [5]. The effectiveness of immunosuppressants is compromised by the development of resistance to sertraline, which can develop spontaneously in response to other cytokines and microorganisms, and is associated with severe complications such as end stage liver disease (ESLD) [5]. The emergence of resistance to sertraline is a clinical and economic concern and calls for urgently investigating the mechanisms that modulate the efficacy of the immune system against fungi.

SDS and Cs are two well-known first-line of defense against fungal infections [6,7,8]. Cs are widely used as antifungal agents because of their short half-life from amphotericin B (AMB) to orally administered itraconazole (256 mg orally twice daily), and are more susceptible to inhibition by bacteria and fungi [9,10]. Although AMB and ciclopirox (CIP), the most commonly used antifungals, are well-tolerated by patients, their use in this group is limited and they are associated with side effects such as gastrointestinal complaints, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea [11,12]. The mode of action of AMB is not well understood and the AMB-CIP system has been suggested to have multiple targets [13,14].

Amphotericin B is an azole antifungal agent that inhibits the lanosterol 14a-demethylase (Erg11p).


## Methods
The ARCC is the first primary health care facility in the world that serves HIV/AIDS patients from a broad range of region. The ARCC is the largest tertiary health care facility in the world and is the largest tertiary health care facility in South Africa. The ARCC has a population of approximately 150,000 and has a population of approximately 90,000 in 2000. Approximately 10% of its facilities are HIV free.

The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the recommendations in the Australian Code of Practice for research in medicine (AECOP) [16]. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the ARCC and the IRCC. All participants were informed about the study protocol.

Study design
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental Procedures (European Treaty Series, no. 123) and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals [17]. The ARCC was a referral hospital in South Africa.

Study design
The study involved a retrospective study in HIV/AIDS patients with clinical suspicion of cryptococcal meningitis. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, had no HIV/AIDS diagnosis, or had a diagnosis of malignancy, as determined by a neurologist. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the ARCC and the IRCC.

Study design
The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Clinical Trial of Meningitis model developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (NIAID) (http://www.nibtdw.net) [18]. The study involved 1,000 HIV-1 patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in a generalised hospital setting in Durban, South Africa. The HIV-1 group consisted of HIV-1-HIV patients who had been admitted to the NIAID Clinical Trial of Meningitis model from January 2002 to February 2009. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NIAID. The protocol included an in-patient HIV-1 (HIV-1) intervention, in which patients were screened by India Ink-based assessment to determine whether they were able to perform all their clinical clinical functions.


## Results
brasiliensis va. grubii, 1,424 isolates were identified from 14 bacterial isolates of A. fumigatus and 2,245 from A. flavus. The overall numbers of isolates in each of the two series of isolates are shown in Table 1.

The S. pneumoniae isolates (Group A) and the three S. parapsilosis isolates (Group B) were identified as the most common cause of pneumonia. All S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the S. pneumoniae surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. fumigatus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. fumigatus surveillance study.

The results of S. pneumoniae surveillance studies are shown in Table 2. The S. pneumoniae isolates were identified as the most common cause of pneumonia in the A. fumigatus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the S. pneumoniae surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. parapsilosis isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S. pneumoniae isolates had a culture-positive result in the A. flavus surveillance study. The three S.


## Discussion
dermatitis is a common, life-threatening disease in non-HIV patients with CD4 counts of >200 cells/µ. Patients presenting to our center are typically younger and have a lower risk for infections with immunocompromised organisms (18-27). In this patient, there was no evidence of immunosuppression or other malignancy that could be associated with this condition. Although the risk of B. dermatitis is very low in patients with CD4 counts of =200 cells/µL, in the setting of low CD4 counts, this is not a situation that could be explained by the presence of a malignant lymphoma or AIDS (28). The incidence of B. dermatitis in HIV patients ranges from approximately 2% to 10% (29). In an HIV patient with CD4 counts of =200 cells/µL, the incidence is between 3% and 18%. This patient had a low CD4 count of only 3 cells/µL, and it would have been a missed opportunity to treat this patient with antiretroviral therapy.

The most common symptoms of B. dermatitis are cough, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting (30). To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. dermatitis in a non-HIV patient. The diagnosis of B. dermatitis has rarely been made, though it has been reported in other patients (31).

Diagnosis of B. dermatitis has been made by culture of the central venous catheter. However, there are reports of B. dermatitis in non-HIV patients (32). In this patient, the catheter did not have access to blood, suggesting that this patient was infected with B. dermatitis. We suspect that this patient might have had a high degree of immunosuppression, especially in the setting of HIV infection.

It is well established that B. dermatitis is a life-threatening disease in HIV patients (33). In a study conducted by Sato et al. (34), the median CD4 count in non-HIV patients with B. dermatitis was approximately 7 cells/µL. The mean CD4 count in non-HIV patients with B. dermatitis ranged from 2 to 24 cells/µL (35). The mean CD4 count in HIV patients with B. dermatitis was higher than that in non-HIV patients.
