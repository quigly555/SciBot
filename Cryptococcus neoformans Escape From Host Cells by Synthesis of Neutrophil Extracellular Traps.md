## Abstract
The treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is evolving, and advances in diagnostics are critical for effective prevention and treatment. The objective of this study was to identify antifungal drug susceptibility patterns of common antifungal drugs in invasive yeast infections.

Data from 38 patients with IFI hospitalized with available antifungal therapy (IVT) were analyzed. Antifungal susceptibility patterns of common antifungal drugs in patients with and without IFI were determined.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with tuberculous or granulomatous diseases (STDs) and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients without TB [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. In sub-Saharan Africa, the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS-associated infections has been reported in patients with high levels of HIV/AIDS in Malawi and Uganda [9,10]. Meningitis is the most common form of the disease, with up to 40% of all cases of meningitis resulting from TB [11,12,13]. TB is a multifactorial disease, and both the acquired and the environmental factors play a role in the etiology of meningitis. Environmental factors, such as the presence of water, soil, and other plant components, are associated with the etiology of meningitis in these populations [14].


## Methods
[7. After incubation with the Chaperon, the cells were incubated with 0.1% Chaperon-PEG 6 (pH 6.8) for 10 min, washed, and re-suspended in 0.1% Chaperon-PEG 6 (pH 6.8) and 3'-PEG-6 (pH 3.2) for 10 min. Cells were stained with a 10% (v/v) agarose gel and analyzed by flow cytometry. The GFP signal was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 495 nm (excitation at 515 nm, 495 nm) and 515 nm (excitation at 590 nm, 590 nm) using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

In vivo exposure of mice to M. tuberculosis
The protocol of an in vivo exposure study was followed as described previously [8]. Briefly, 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice were infected with 1×10^5 M. tuberculosis cells via intranasal instillation by intravenous injection of 0.1 mL of 2% mycological solution. In vivo exposure to M. tuberculosis was induced by administration of 1×10^4 to 1×10^5 CFU of M. tuberculosis in 0.1 mL of 1% Tween 20 solution. The mice were then transferred to cages and kept under a 12 h light:dark cycle. The mice were examined daily, and their health status was determined by histological and biochemical examinations. For statistical analysis, data were considered statistically significant at p<0.05.

Histological examination of M. tuberculosis treated with ethyl acetate
To determine the presence of M. tuberculosis in the blood of mice, 10 mice (6-8 weeks old, body weight of 180 ± 15 g) were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated with ethyl acetate, whereas the other group was treated with 1% Triton X-100.


## Results
mellonella survival following infection, the survival curve of . mellonella larvae infected with G. mellonella was compared with the survival curve of the control (Fig 4). The results showed that the larvae were significantly more susceptible to infection with EMCs, suggesting that EMCs are an efficient immunomodulator of G. mellonella. In order to test whether EMCs were able to induce immune responses, G. mellonella larvae were injected with EMCs for 24 hours and then infected with G. mellonella for 12 hours. After 6 hours of infection, larvae were sacrificed and the tissues were harvested and the fungal burden was measured. We observed that the number of EMCs in the lungs of G. mellonella larvae infected with G. mellonella was significantly lower than that of larvae infected with the control (Fig 5). The results showed that EMCs could induce the immune response and induce a stronger inflammatory response in the lungs of G. mellonella larvae compared with that of the control (Fig 5). These results were consistent with the results of the in vitro experiments.

Effects of EMCs on the Microbiological Activity of G. mellonella
To investigate the effects of EMCs on G. mellonella survival following infection, G. mellonella larvae were injected with EMCs and the survival curve of G. mellonella larvae infected with G. mellonella was compared with the survival curve of the control (Fig 6). The results showed that the larvae were significantly more susceptible to infection with EMCs, suggesting that EMCs are an efficient immunomodulator of G. mellonella. In order to evaluate the effect of EMCs on the fungal communities of G. mellonella, the fungal community in G. mellonella was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the samples were analyzed by light microscopy. The results showed that the number of EMCs in the lungs of G. mellonella was significantly lower than that of larvae infected with G. mellonella (Fig 7). In addition, the fungal community in G. mellonella infected with G. mellonella was significantly lower than that in the control (Fig 7). These results indicate that EMCs could induce the immune response and induce a stronger inflammatory response in G. mellonella.


## Discussion
 2009. In addition, the effect of AMR on innate immune response has been reported (Konrad et al., 2013). The use of macrophages in treating acute myeloid leukemia (CNS) leukemia and other solid tumors (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculoma) has been reported (Vacheron et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which AMR treatment was effective in treating a candidemia patient with a candidemia-associated CSF cryptococcosis. The results from this study indicate that AMR treatment is effective in treating a candidemia-associated CNS cryptococcosis.

In addition to our previous report in a candidemia-associated CNS cryptococcosis patient (Krzesyn et al., 2012), our results suggest that AMR treatment is effective in treating a CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis. However, the precise mechanism of AMR's ability to reduce the inflammatory and autoimmune responses is still unclear. AMR’s anti-inflammatory properties may reduce the inflammation and autoimmune responses associated with CNS cryptococcosis. However, our study revealed that AMR’s antifungal activities may increase the inflammatory and autoimmune responses in CNS cryptococcosis. Thus, we speculate that AMR’s antifungal activity may increase the inflammatory and autoimmune responses associated with CNS cryptococcosis.

While our study has several limitations, we have also shown that AMR may have an effective effect in treating CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis. The results presented in this study demonstrate that AMR has a significant effect on the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects of the fungal infection, as well as the immune-mediated inflammatory and autoimmune responses associated with CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis.

The results of our study indicate that AMR’s antifungal activity may be involved in the prevention of CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis. Since AMR’s antifungal activity may enhance the inflammatory and autoimmune responses associated with CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis, we speculate that AMR’s antifungal activity may enhance the immune-mediated immune response associated with CNS cryptococcosis-associated CNS cryptococcosis.
