## Abstract
Pseudomonas gingivalis is the first apagonistic fruit to be harvested in Japan in 2017. This species is reported as belonging to Passalora stromata and represents a new species, Pseudomonas gingivalis sp. nov. (CBS 1350), described from P. gingivalis species collection in Japan.

The species is described as having a brown, slightly to slightly powdery, black, trabruinous skin, broadly cylindrical, and striped ascospores, interspersed among black ascospores, that is looselywoven and somewhat resembling a hila, subarctica or subglacial fjordata in morphology and architecture.

The new species is further distinguished from Pseudomonas on P. gingivalis by its hat-shaped ascospores, rarely observed in the previously known species, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.

The new species is characterised by its well-developedangiospores, rarely observed in the previously known species, and an absence of hat-shaped ascospores.

Pseudomonas gingivalis is also emended to be treated with a selective agent, namely, Pseudomonas putida, an ancestor of P. brasiliensis also affiliated with P. brasiliensis present in the same genus, and an approach to develop a precise method to identify these species in the field, the revised pink star chart is adopted.

The pink star chart of P. gingivalis is a revised model of the apical ascospores, and the ascospores of this new species are characterized by multiple ascospores with ascospores p.sonente, p.s. nov., and p.o.


## Introduction
Intensive laboratory studies are essential for the development of microbiological and clinical microbiology techniques. The availability of refrigeration appliances and refrigeration facilities is a critical factor in the development of new technologies for microbiological laboratory analysis, diagnostic, and microbiology research. The use of refrigeration equipment for laboratory analyses is beneficial for the development of new technologies, as well as for the enhancement of microbiological and clinical microbiology, and therefore, the development of new technologies, such as refrigeration appliances. During the past two decades, the refrigeration industry has received considerable attention, mainly because of the increase in the number of refrigeration industry employees, who work for environmental protection and health. Nowadays, refrigeration is increasingly used in the laboratory because of its ease of operation, its capacity for rapid reaction, and its convenience. Moreover, refrigeration appliances are nowadays commonly used in laboratories because of their low cost and the fact that they are easy to clean, remove, and handle.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AMTS) has been performed in more than thirty-five years, with a current use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Although antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed by microbial cultures, and the procedures are easy to perform, it is still not a routine procedure in microbiology laboratories. AMTS is performed in the context of microbiological and clinical microbiology laboratories, where the performance of AMTS is based on a standardized methodology. Currently, AMTS has been performed in the context of the clinical microbiology laboratory, where clinical microbiology laboratory results are based on a standardized methodology. This procedure has been designed to provide a simple, rapid and sensitive procedure for the detection and identification of pathogens in the context of the clinical microbiology laboratory.


## Methods
digitatum L15 strain [34] and its origin is described in detail in our previous work [35. Briefly, the fungus was grown on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar for 24 h at 25 °C and then inoculated into fresh YPD broth (20 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L glucose, 20 g/L dextrose, 20 g/L agar) and cultured at 37 °C for 7 days. The culture supernatants were collected and concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. To prepare the bacterial extracts, the cultivation broth was supplemented with a 1% trypsin solution (TSD) and was grown at 25 °C for 24 h. After the cultivation of the culture, the broth was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were washed with distilled water. The pellets were then resuspended in 10% trypticase (10 µl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The pellets were collected, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45-µm Millipore membrane filters (Phenomenex). The filtrate was then concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The organic solvents were evaporated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The supernatant fraction was then used for the following analyses.

Isolation of proteins
The F. graminearum strain was isolated from the isolate F. graminearum lysospora (FK1604) as described by Ellman et al. [36]. The isolate was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates for 48 h at 25 °C. The culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of 1% Tween 80 (TSE) and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. After the incubation, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed with distilled water. The pellets were then resuspended in 5 mL of 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 65 °C for 2 h.

## Discussion
We found that Paracoccidioides species induce changes in the cellular metabolic responses to cell surface cues, in contrast to previous studies that use CFSE [10, 13, 19, 40. In contrast to the response to G. mellonella, which is a hemibiotrophic pathogen, Paracoccidioides species induce changes in the cellular metabolic responses to cell surface cues in response to hemibiotrophic nematode C. elegans [10]. We found that Paracoccidioides species induce changes in the cellular metabolic responses to cell surface cues, in contrast to previous studies that use CFSE [10, 13, 19, 40]. Interestingly, it has been proposed that Paracoccidioides species are not directly involved in cellular metabolic responses to C. elegans [10]. Our study shows that Paracoccidioides species are present in different cellular compartments, such as the mitochondria, in response to cell surface cues, rather than to cell wall stressors. This is in contrast to previous studies that used CFSE [10, 13, 19, 40].

Cellular respiration was significantly inhibited in response to Paracoccidioides species in response to cell surface cues, and we observed that this was significantly reduced in response to G. mellonella, whereas the cells of other hemibiotrophs such as C. elegans did not show significant changes in respiration in response to G. mellonella. This is consistent with previous reports that show that the respiratory burst of C. elegans requires the ability of Paracoccidioides species to activate the respiratory burst of C. elegans and to induce respiratory burst [10].

The cellular response to G. mellonella was also significantly impaired, and cells of the lung responded similarly to Paracoccidioides species, suggesting that Paracoccidioides species could be involved in a response to C. elegans. The results of this study show that Paracoccidioides species induce alterations in cellular respiration and cellular metabolism in response to cell surface cues, which is consistent with previous studies that use CFSE [10, 13, 19, 40].
