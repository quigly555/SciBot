## Abstract
A new species of Quail (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota) based on the subtended Quail (BN) is described and illustrated from dead mites, decaying wood and decaying plants. The Quail were cultured on different media, such as methanol, maltitol, ethanol and water, and its growth was evaluated by electron microscopy. The results showed that all media contained a mixture of Quail and Sordariomycetes fungi. The yeast cultivation was performed under constant illumination and kept up to 72 h-1, and its growth was monitored by keeping temperature at 25-37°C. The growth of Quail was inhibited at 37°C. The isolation of yeast from dried plant material was confirmed by the isolation of strains: strains SBM, VYF, WVU, SBS and TBR. All these strains, as well as other yeast strains of Quail, were isolated from dead mite wood, decaying wood and decaying plants, which were collected at mites densities ranging from 13 to 70 kg per 100 m2. The isolation of Sordariomycetes from decaying plant material was confirmed by the isolation of strains: strains SBM, VYF, WVU, SBS and TBR. All these strains, as well as other yeasts of Quail, were isolated from mites and decaying plant material. The isolation of NDB, which is based on a mixture of Quail and Sordariomycetes, was also confirmed. The isolation of NBR was also confirmed and was confirmed by the isolation of NDB only from dried plant material. The isolation of SBM, VYF, WVU, SBS and TBR were also confirmed and compared to Pichia pastoris (Pichia pastoris), which was a yeast isolated from dead mite wood and decaying plant material, and it was shown that it is distinct from Quail.


## Introduction
. Fish and Wildlife Service, http://www.fao.gov/fao/fao-annotation/npp-articles/73862.htm; Author response: The author provided the following detailed notes on the manuscript, which are available at the following URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fao.2014.08.012) [23].

The authors conclude that "the novelty of these results is the impact of the Atlantic rainforest on the wild populations of migratory birds. These birds can easily be used to transport fish products to Brazil, where they can be used for the maintenance of migratory routes and establish new areas of catch and distribution during the rainy season." The authors provide a number of examples of examples of species that can be transported by Atlantic migratory birds, including Salmon (Galleria mellonella) and Salmon (Salmo sali), Salmon (Danio oligospora) and Salmon (Danio slooffii) which are considered the major and most important Atlantic fishes, respectively.

The authors state that "Overall, these results are interesting and will be useful to better understand the key physiological functions of the Atlantic fish, which are dependent on many key nutrients (particularly phosphorus, iron, and sulfur). The central idea of the study is that the levels of these nutrients may influence the behavior of the Atlantic fish, and the results are also consistent with a previous study which reported that the levels of iron and sulfur can influence the Atlantic fish’s behavior toward the birds. This study is important because it provides a starting point to further investigate the behavior of fish populations to adapt to changes in the availability of nutrients in the Atlantic and other oceans.

## Methods
s.gov/). The Florida Fish Species Diversity Institute has also performed a quantitative assessment of the Florida Fish Resources Commission (FRC) (http://www.fsc.gov/). A quantitative taxonomy is defined as a species exhibiting a characteristic characteristic of a particular species over the entire range of that species’s distribution. The FRC is an international scientific body that works to promote the scientific understanding of marine life.

To establish the Florida Fish Species Diversity Institute’s classifications, we used a quantitative assessment of the presence of clades of Florida FSC and the presence of the Florida Fish Resources Commission (FRC). A species has to have at least one representative of the Florida FSC and the Florida Fish Resources Commission’s (FRC) classifications. Additionally, a clade is defined as a species that is present in more than one of the seven Florida FSC’s, and the number of members is equal to or greater than seven members. This is also the case of the Florida Fish Resources Commission’s classifications. We used the following methodologies to determine the Florida FSC’s classifications: i) total species richness; ii) diversity; iii) community composition; iv) diversity of “Class III”; and v) community composition of “Class III”, and the number of “Class III” species is equal to or greater than seven. Finally, the total number of “Class III” species is calculated by dividing the number of “Class III” species by the number of “Class III” species.

The Florida Fish Resources Commission’s classifications were based on the results of a community-based survey and were based on scientific literature. The Florida Fish Resources Commission’s classifications are based on the results of a national survey that documented the presence of Florida FSCs and Florida Fish Resources Commission’s (FRC). The Florida Fish Resources Commission’s classifications are based on the results of a survey that documented the presence of the Florida Fishery in the Southern and Northern Florida States. The Florida Fish Resources Commission’s classifications are based on the results of a study of Florida fish species by Dr.


## Results
elegans, . elegans and C. albicans

In order to distinguish between the two species, we used aerial mycelia to determine the ability of the first of these species to survive and thrive in the environmental environment. The results are illustrated in Fig 2. In all species, we observe a higher number of wild-type flies in the dark, a lower number of flies in the bright green color, and a higher number of flies in the dark than in the dark.

Light plays an important role in the life cycle of C. elegans (O'Donnell and Grutter, 1998). During the early developmental cycle, the fly is divided into two groups: the first is found in the vesicles (vimentin) or in the vacuole (budendula) (Liu et al., 2013). The second is found in the midgut (budendula) and in the basal ganglia (budendula) (O'Donnell and Grutter, 1998). All of these groups are commonly found in the lungs of both mammals and are associated with the feeding-phagia (O'Donnell and Grutter, 1998). All of these fly groups are able to survive in the environment, but only the fly that flies into the dark is able to fly normally (Fig 2). We found that in all the flies that flies into the dark, the flies with the lowest number of flies in the dark are able to survive (Fig 2).

Interestingly, the flies that fly into the dark are able to survive in the early stage of the survival process. First, we found that the flies that fly into the dark are able to survive, even when they are in the early stage of survival, in the wild-type condition. Second, the flies that fly into the dark are able to survive, even in the wild-type condition. The flies that fly into the dark are able to survive in the wild-type condition in all of the flies that fly into the dark, but only the flies that fly into the dark survive in the wild-type condition (Fig 2).

As the flies that fly into the dark survive, the flies that fly into the dark are able to survive in the environment. The flies that fly into the dark are able to survive in the wild-type condition.


## Discussion
Steroids have been shown to be important in the development of many plant pathogens, particularly those causing diseases in plants such as Arabidopsis, where their production is strongly linked to their pathogenicity. Our study on the genome content of the smut fungus Gibellannia hanxianus shows that the genome of this fungus is largely similar to that of a model plant fungus S. macrosperma. This was confirmed in our previous study on Gibellannia hanxianus (Table 1). This highlights the importance of RNAi for the evolution of Gibellannia (and other fungi) and also the importance of RNAi for the development of Gibellannia (Table 2).

The RNAi machinery is generally conserved in all plant pathogens. The conserved machinery includes two distinct transmembrane helices, conserved glycosyl transferases (GATases), and H^+/H^+-ATPases. GATA-mediated RNA polymerases (GAPases) are involved in different biological functions, including RNA silencing and histone modification in plant pathogens. Homologous GAPases in fungi are also involved in the formation of the DNA helices on the RNA helices (HAPX) in fungi (Nicolás et al. 2006; Verma et al. 2008; Srivastava et al. 2011). GAPXs have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication (Konrad et al. 2010; K.C. Kohn, personal communication). In addition to GAPXs, two genes, GAPXI and GAPXII, are found in Gibellannia. These two genes were previously found to play an important role in the development of Gibellannia (Verma et al. 2008; Kohn et al. 2010). We found that Gibellannia Gibellannia has two GAPXI genes, which are homologous to genes in the K.C. Kohn species complex, whereas GAPXII is homologous to genes in other species of the K.C. Kohn complex.
