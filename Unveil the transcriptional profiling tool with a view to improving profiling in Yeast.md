## Abstract
The ability of some fungal pathogens to penetrate host immune cells is critical for the establishment of infection and for the pathogen invasion. Microbes in the genus Candida are the causative agents of Candida pneumoniae infection, a leading cause of illness in immunocompromised individuals. Host innate immune responses against C. pneumoniae have evolved sophisticated strategies for counteracting the infection. This is, in part, due to the complexity and versatility of the innate immune response and the flexibility of immune cells to respond to individual pathogens. The complexity of innate immunity evolved, first, because of the complex genomes of early eukaryotes, and, second, because of the complexity of the host innate immune response and its ability to respond to specific fungal pathogens. The evolution of innate immunity to fungal pathogens and their interaction with innate immune cells have focused on two fundamental cellular functions: elimination of invading pathogens and activation of host immune cells. In fungi, the elimination of invading pathogens has required the activation of specific fungal targets and, above all, has required the interaction of fungal growth factors. The interaction between fungi and innate immune cells has been most intimately linked to the ability of these pathogens to cause disease. It is, however, often difficult to distinguish truly pathogenic from nonpathogenic infections. Furthermore, the interactions between fungi and innate immune cells have evolved in response to different kinds of stimuli, and this has created complexity in the natural and artificial environments that host organisms are forced to constantly deal with these pathogens. This complexity has resulted in complexity in the natural and artificial host environments, resulting in situations that are fundamentally different from those in the natural environment and, therefore, potentially even more complex than what is seen in the natural world. In this review, we will discuss the natural environments that host organisms are forced toil under these very difficult circumstances. The complexity of host responses to fungal infections, and the complexity of innate immune responses that often enable the natural environment to be rendered ineffective, will be highlighted.


## Introduction

The Yeast-Associated Interaction (YITI) pathway has been well characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human yeasts [4-6. The pathway consists of three enzymatic reactions: the s- and ß-chemokines and their ligands, which have various modes of action including adhesion, phagocytosis, phagolysosome assembly and secretion [7]. The s-chemokines are present in the cell wall and have a common ligand type, C-type lectin (CTLD). The ligand is a small protein consisting of a N-terminal protein, such as 2-deoxy-D-mannose, which is expressed by most eukaryotic cells [8]. The s-chemokines are characterized by a C-terminal heme moiety, which binds to the N-terminal histidine residue of the N-terminal glucosamine, forming a linker molecule. Following binding to the N-terminal glycine residue, the glycosyl moiety dissociates from the N-terminal glycine and forms a scaffold molecule, which is then released and activated. The activation of the pathway allows the assembly of the cell wall and formation of the phagolysosome. The activity of the pathway depends on the type of lectin and the site of the lectin binding, which must be determined carefully.

In the yeast pathogen Candida albicans, the S. cerevisiae s-chemokine has been shown to play a role in the cell wall integrity and pathogenesis [9]. The S. cerevisiae s-chemokine is expressed in macrophages and neutrophils, and is involved in the first step of the pathogenic process, invasion of the phagocytic cells. Following phagocytosis, the cell wall is remodeled, and the cell wall is breached. The cell wall is a major barrier and a key organelle for the communication between cells. The cell wall is highly connected in both hemocytes and neutrophils, and it consists of a complex network of polysaccharides, including chitin, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), mannoprotein, and galactoxylan (GXL) [10].


## Methods
One™ v.1.3.

Microarray and transcriptome profiling
The raw sequence data of the three strains were processed for transcriptomic profiling using the YeastOne™ software. The raw sequence data of the three strains were filtered to eliminate un-annotated and duplicated reads, and the transcriptome data of the four strains were processed for transcriptome profiling with the Gene Expression Microarray Analysis software (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/geo/microarray/) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analysis. The Go project (http://www.expasy.org/go/) was used to obtain a taxonomic coverage of all the studied fungi. All the microbial genomes were annotated using the BLAST program [53]. The high-quality reads were aligned to the SILVA reference database (https://www.arb-silva.de) and the species-level sequence-specific coverage was calculated.

RNA-seq
To compare the effect of SSU and HKYZ sequence polymorphisms on transcriptome profiling, we used the RNA-seq software, version 4.6 (Open Biosoftware, USA). The RNA-seq data of the six strains were analyzed using the Illumina technology. The sequencing data were analyzed using the RNA-seq software. The raw sequence data of the six strains were processed for transcriptome profiling with the Illumina Technology Platform (projects ID: 141245, 141246, 141247, 141250, 141251, 141251, 141252, and 141253, respectively) and the Gene Expression Microarray Analysis software (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/geo/microarray/) was used to obtain a taxonomic coverage of all the studied fungi. The gene expression data of the six strains were analyzed using the Gene Expression Software (version 3.1.3; Open Biosoftware, USA) and the Gene Ontology Analysis software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/geo/microarray/) was used to obtain a taxonomic coverage of all the studied fungi. The raw sequence data of the six strains were analyzed with the Gene Expression Software (version 3.1.3; Open Biosoft, USA). The raw sequence data of the six strains were analyzed with the Gene Expression Software (version 3.1.


## Results
Yeast-derived biological processes were classified based on a GO term enrichment score scor. GO term enrichment scores were calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg transformed data matrix (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/en/Benjamini-Hochberg/pfam/en/pdb/pdb.cgi) and the hierarchical clustering was done using the Bayesian clustering algorithm. The normalized result matrix and a cluster analysis were also generated (Fig 4). To determine the influence of cellular processes on the biological processes and to gain insight into the mode of regulation at a functional level, we applied GO enrichment score score analysis to our data to predict biological processes of interest (GO term enrichment score score for biological processes). Our GO enrichment score analysis resulted in a cluster plot (Fig 5) and a significant enrichment score for biological processes (P < 0.05) were obtained for the up-regulated and down-regulated groups (Fig 5). The GO term enrichment score value for the biological processes up-regulated and down-regulated groups (P < 0.05) were the significant enrichment score for pathways (P < 0.05) and the cluster plot plot (Fig 6). These results indicate that GO term enrichment scores predict the modes of biological processes of interest.

Identifying and identifying genes with significant up-regulation and down-regulation in biological processes in the up-regulated and down-regulated groups
To identify genes that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in the up-regulated and down-regulated groups, we used the Bioinformatics program to perform a cluster plot based on the GO term enrichment score (Fig 5) and the hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig 4). The GO term enrichment score value for the biological processes up-regulated and down-regulated groups (P < 0.05) were significantly up-regulated and significantly down-regulated. The cluster plot plot (Fig 5) shows that the biological processes up-regulated and down-regulated groups are distinct.

The biological processes up-regulated and down-regulated groups are well represented in the cluster plot (Fig 6). The GO term enrichment score value for the biological processes up-regulated and down-regulated groups (P < 0.05) were significantly up-regulated and significantly down-regulated.


## Discussion
Additionally, this study revealed that the fungal cell wall has a large number of structures and that a cell wall with the composition of ß-1,3-glucan is common in filamentous fung. In yeast, ß-1,3-glucan is only found in the cell wall of the basidiomycete Fusarium graminearum and is not found in other fungi. It is a unique structural component and a common structural feature of filamentous fungi. The fucose-conjugated cell wall polysaccharides are present in the cell wall of filamentous fungi. In yeast, cell wall polysaccharides are composed of ß-1,3-glucan and mannan, which are the major components of the cell wall of the basidiomycete fungi, and are also present in the cell walls of the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe [45]. Although cell wall polysaccharides are not present in the cell wall of yeasts, they can be found in the cell walls of filamentous fungi. The cell wall polysaccharides are also present in the cell walls of the basidiomycete fungi [46].

The cell wall of fungi is comprised of a complex network of components, such as mannoproteins, mannoproteins, and ß-1,3-glucans, and proteins associated with the cell wall of filamentous fungi. The cell wall is an important structure for fungal cells, and the cell wall is a major structure in fungi that contains the yeast-to-filamentous transitions that occur in filamentous fungi [47]. The cell wall is comprised of mannoproteins, mannose, and galactomannan, which are proteins that are important components of the cell wall of many fungi. The cell wall is composed of a complex network of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes. The cell wall is composed of mannoproteins, mannose, and galactomannan. The cell wall also includes proteins associated with other cell wall structures such as mannoproteins, mannose, and other ß-1,3-glucan structures.
