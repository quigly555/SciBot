## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a globally distributed fungus causing human cryptococcosis. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between C. gattii and the host immune system remain unclear. One intriguing aspect is the role of TLR9. In this study, we show that C. gattii TLRs mediate the upregulation of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines, which are known to regulate the innate immune response. Using a murine model of cryptococcosis, we found that TLR9 is required for the Th2-induced inflammation in vivo. Importantly, we also observed that the strain lacking TLR9 attenuated the antiviral activity of the fungus. These results suggest a novel role for TLR9 in host defense against C. gattii infection, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. These infections are caused primarily by opportunistic and/or invasive fungal species, including Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, and Coccidioides. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common invasive fungal disease in transplant recipients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The mortality due to IA is generally less than 1% [1]. The incidence of IA has increased in the past few decades, particularly in immunosuppressive patients and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy [2-5]. The most common A. fumigatus species in this group is the most common cause of IA, with Candida species and Cryptococcus species accounting for more than 90% of the cases [2,5].

Antibiotic prophylaxis is a commonly used strategy in the management of IA.


## Methods
 µg/mL for patients with hemolysi.

All bacterial strains were grown in liquid CM medium at 37°C overnight, and cells were then washed twice with PBS. One hundred microliters of 10^3 cells/mL culture in sterile water were added to a 24-well plate, and then incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cell suspension was then diluted with sterile water and spread onto CM medium to obtain a final cell density of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. After 24 h incubation, cells were harvested and counted in a hemacytometer, and the number of colony forming units (CFU) was calculated.

In order to determine the bacterium-specific bacterium-specific bacterium-specific response (eg, S. pneumoniae) of the anti-tuberculosis and/or for the primary antibody-protease reactions, a total of 3 µg/mL of rifampicin (S. pneumoniae) or 2 µg/mL of streptomycin (S. pneumoniae) was added to the wells. After 24 h of incubation, the wells were washed with 1 mL of sterile water, and the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended with 1 mL of 1 × 10^6-mL RPMI 1640 medium (with L-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium pyruvate) and serially diluted 1:100 in fresh RPMI medium. Subsequently, 100 µL of 1 × 10^6-mL bacterial suspension was pipetted onto the plate. The plate was then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2. After 48 h, the color of the supernatant was measured with a microplate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, United States).


## Results
Both the immunoreaction and the expression of monoclonal antibodies were higher in the monoclonal antibody-treated group compared to the control group, but the difference was not significan. The monoclonal antibodies were generally lower in monoclonal-treated than in the control group (Figure 2C).

We also compared the mRNA expression of the monoclonal antibodies in the wild type strain. The mRNA expression of the monoclonal antibodies was also higher in the wild type strain than in the monoclonal antibody-treated group, but the difference was not significant. The mRNA expression of the monoclonal antibodies in the monoclonal antibody-treated strain was higher than in the control strain (Figure 2C).

In the case of the antibody-treated strain, the mRNA expression of the monoclonal antibodies in the wild type strain was higher than in the monoclonal antibody-treated strain. The mRNA expression of the monoclonal antibodies in the control strain was higher than in the monoclonal antibody-treated strain (Figure 2C).

Molecular Characterization of Genomic DNA
We characterized the genomic DNA from the two wild type and monoclonal-treated strains, using primers designed specifically for the marker sequences of the C. neoformans MATa locus and the C. albicans MATa locus. The two strains were used in the yeast-to-hyphal transduction experiments, and the genomic DNA was analyzed using a circular PCR array. The mixtures of both primers were subjected to PCR amplification of genomic DNA. The amplicon of each primer was analyzed by RT-PCR, and the products of the amplification products were pooled and used to construct a PCR amplicon for the primers designed specifically for the marker sequences of the C. neoformans MATa locus and the C. albicans MATa locus. The PCR products from both primers were subjected to sequencing and hybridization of the amplified product. The product sequences were analyzed by Northern blot analysis.

## Discussion
Cells with a low number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, but with a high number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, produce a mixture of Hpc1 and Hpc. However, when cells with a high number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines are pooled, CpG can only induce the expression of Hpc2. When cells with a low number of cell lines and a high number of cell lines, but with a high number of cell lines, produce a mixture of Hpc2 and Hpc1, the Hpc2 and Hpc1 are expressed and Hpc1 and Hpc2 are not. Therefore, we also compared the expression patterns of CpG in cells with different cell lines and different cell lines. In both cell lines and cells with different cell lines, the expression of Hpc1 and Hpc2 was only detectable at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. The Hpc1 was expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, and the expression of Hpc2 was expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. The expression of Hpc1 was expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, and the expression of Hpc2 was expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. In the absence of CpG, Hpc2 was only expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL. Cells with a high number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, but with a high number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, produce a mixture of Hpc2 and Hpc1. However, when cells with a low number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, but with a high number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, produce a mixture of Hpc2 and Hpc1, the Hpc2 is expressed and the expression of Hpc1 is not. Cells with a low number of cell lines and a low number of cell lines, but with a high number of cell lines, produce a mixture of Hpc2 and Hpc1, and the expression of Hpc2 is expressed at a concentration of 10 µg/mL.
