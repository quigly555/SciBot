## Abstract

Key informants, self-administered through a mutual support network (MSN), were interviewed retrospectively at enrollmen. Data was extracted using Epi-info and Microsoft Excel. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as the sum of the 95% and the 95% confidence intervals for the 95% and the 95% confidence intervals for the 95% and the 95% confidence intervals for the participants in the AIDS Treatment Phase 2 Group and the AIDS C Emphasis Group (AFCGE) Group.

AFCGE and FCGE-based MSNs were significantly associated with all TB-related variables. In the case of participants in the HIV/AIDS Phase 2 Group and the HIV/AIDS C Emphasis Group, the overall risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the HIV/AIDS CPM group than the HIV/AIDS FPA group (OR: 5.3, 95%CI: 1.8 to 34.2; P = 0.003), and in the HIV/AIDS CPM group the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the FCGE group than in the HIV/AIDS CPA group (OR: 4.2, 95%CI: 1.8 to 39.1; P = 0.005).

Cryptococcal meningitis was associated with higher overall risk of all-cause mortality among HIV-infected adults in the treatment phase 2 and 2MSNs, followed by the FCGE group mortality. These results suggest that the addition of HIV-associated risk factors may have a beneficial effect on overall survival among HIV-infected adults in the treatment phase 2MSNs, with the addition of an additional, yet smaller, effect on overall survival among HIV-infected CPM patients.

Prior to HIV/AIDS, most opportunistic infections (OIs) were deemed TB based on CSF samples from HIV-infected patients, even though CSF was considered to be non-TB in only one out of 17 patients in the HIV/AIDS CPM group and one out of 17 HIV-infected patients in the HIV/AIDS CIPD group.


## Introduction
Viral meningitis, caused by the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) in neutropenic patients, particularly those with impaired T cell function, such as those with diabetes, who receive aggressive immunosuppression and antineoplastic therapy (1). Although the disease may not be clinically apparent, it may cause significant morbidity and mortality in the critically ill, such as those with AIDS, organ transplant recipients, patients with nephrotic syndrome, and those undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy (2). Systemic infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in the ICU, particularly those with low CD4 cell counts. Thus, it is of crucial importance to understand the epidemiology of meningitis in the critically ill in order to determine the cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

## Results
The biochemical characterization of the V. fumigatus erythrocytes
With the aim of studying the physiological changes of V. fumigatus cells upon exposure to host-derived erythrocytes, the anti-erythrocyte antifungals were used to test the anti-erythrocyte antifungal properties. For this purpose, the cell morphology was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ELISA. The morphology of yeast cells was also observed upon exposure to a lysine protease inhibitor (Lipase inhibitor) (Fig 1).

After the antifungal treatment, the cell morphology was maintained at a normal level in the presence of either LPS or TLC. However, cells were abnormally elongated and slightly swollen at the base, and some cells were slightly enlarged (Fig 2). The cellular morphology was also abnormal in the presence of TLC. For some cells, the structure was abnormally irregular (Fig 2).

The cellular morphology was also abnormal in the presence of both LPS or TLC. However, the cell morphology was normal in the presence of both agents. These findings were in concordance with the immunohistochemical staining of yeast cells and with the cryopreserved protein staining of the cell surface by the anti-erythrocyte antibody (Fig 1).


## Discussion
The reason for this discrepancy is that patients with non-CNS cryptococcosis had higher CSF opening pressures than those with cryptococcosi. The higher opening pressure may be associated with an increase in the incidence of intracellular cryptococcosis, which is rare in HIV patients. The present data indicated that patients with cryptococcosis had lower CSF opening pressure than those with HIV infection, which was consistent with previous reports in the literature. The mean opening pressure of patients with cryptococcosis was 57 mm H_2O, which was lower than those in the previous reports (60 mm H_2O, 25 mm H_2O, 25 mm H_2O). However, the patients in the present study had lower CSF opening pressures than those in previous reports, which was consistent with the higher incidence of intracellular cryptococcosis in HIV patients.

Previous reports in the literature reported that the incidence of cryptococcosis in HIV patients was lower than that of non-cryptococcal meningitis [7,8]. The results of this study showed that patients with non-cryptococcal cryptococcosis had lower CSF opening pressure than those with cryptococcosis. Patients with cryptococcosis were not significantly more likely to have low opening pressure than those with cryptococcosis, which was consistent with previous reports in the literature [7,8]. The reason for this discrepancy is that patients with cryptococcosis had lower CSF opening pressures than those with non-cryptococcal meningitis, which was consistent with the findings in the literature [7,8].

Although the CSF opening pressure was the most important factor for diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningitis, the patient had an elevated opening pressure. The high CSF opening pressure in the present study was related to an increase in the intracellular cryptococcal count. However, in a previous study in patients with cryptococcosis, the intracellular cryptococcal count decreased. The lower intracellular cryptococcal count in the present study was associated with a decrease in the intracellular cryptococcal counts in the CSF.
