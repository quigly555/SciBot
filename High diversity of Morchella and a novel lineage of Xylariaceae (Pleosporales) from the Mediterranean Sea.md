## Abstract
The rise in invasive fungal infections has prompted the search for new antifungal compounds. Among the classes of compounds with antifungal activity, quinones with antifungal activity have been reported. In this work, we evaluated the antifungal activities of quinones isolated from these compounds against the Cryptococcus sp. and Candida albicans species complexes. We identified quinones from the compounds by in vitro studies against these fungi. Our results indicate that these compounds have an antifungal activity against both the C. albicans and C. sp. species species complexes. Quinones with antifungal activity can be used to treat fungal infections.


## Introduction
The family comprises a complex of genera that have either derived from or diverged from the Pleosporale. The Pleosporaceae includes about 300 species and is characterised by their polyphyletic or monophyletic genera (17). Currently, the Pleosporales includes 53 species and is divided into three classes, namely the saprobic and the phytopathotropic (ps)peres (12). Species in the genus Psperes are very important to the food industry, as they contain significant diversity, such as many different vitamins, carbohydrates, alkaloids, amino acids, phytochemicals, alkaloids, phytochemicals, and other compounds. They also contain a lot of other compounds which are unknown to the best of our knowledge. Many of these compounds have medicinal properties and some are already used as tonic, astringent, bronchodil, and sedative. Among the known compounds of Psperes, some are reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic, anti-thymocyte stimulating hormone, anti-tumor, and anti-ulcer activity (13). Psperes are considered to be rich in carotenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, and phenolic acids and many others, which are reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immunomodulatory activities (14).

Psperes were first described as a class of phytochemicals (15) that have been used for centuries in folk medicine. Their constituents have been mainly extracted from various plant species including Arabidorella, Puccinia, Syzygium, Hymenaea, and some other plants (16, 17). In the Mediterranean area, Psperes were traditionally used to treat diarrhea, arthritis, asthma, sinusitis, rheumatism, hypertension, rheumatism, cough, urinary tract, prostate cancer, prostate cancer-associated inflammatory disorder, and gastritis (18). The discovery of different phytochemicals, particularly sesquiterpenes, tetracycline, and tetracycline, have led to the development of numerous therapeutic drugs (19). Some of them are already in clinical trials and are being actively evaluated in many countries (20).


## Methods
Morphological and physiological characteristics of the newly identified paralogues were described by our group (.P. & R.N.L.K. 2013; P.N. & R.N.L.K. 2013). The phylogenetic relationships between the paralogues and the closely related Paralogs were also analysed in order to assess the evolutionary relationships between the different groups of Paralogs. In order to do so, we used the sequence alignments of the Paralogs and their close relatives in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships. This procedure was repeated until the final tree of the Paralogs.

3.4. Phylogenetic Reconstruction and DnaSP Analysis
We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the Paralogs from the last comprehensive analysis of their phylogenetic relationships (Mali et al. 2009; P.N.L.K. 2013). The phylogenetic trees of the Paralogs were compared with the best-match tree obtained by the Kimura-2 test using the program MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2011). The phylogenetic analyses were carried out in two steps. In the first step, the maximum likelihood (ML) method was used to test the reliability of the evolutionary relationship between the Paralogs and the closely related Paralogs. The program RAxML (V. Balasubramanian and G. Chatterjee 2016) was used to infer the maximum likelihood tree and compare the support of each clade (i.e., the combined clade) in the tree. The ML tree was then constructed using the program PAUP* (Posada 2008) and the program DnaSP (Pechljäger et al. 2015). In the second step, the concatenated data set was used for Bayesian inference (Daum and Gascuel 2003) and was used to determine the phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic trees were then used to perform a general time-reversible (GTR) substitution model with the following substitution model: Beta-distribution function, which assumes a mixture of random sequence substitution rates and a single gamma distribution of substitution rates, and gamma distribution with fixed rate heterogeneity. The second step was done by the ML method. In the first step, we used the default parameters (GTR model, GTR+I+G) to identify the most likely substitution model of the combined clade.


## Results
The two new Morchella species clustered together with the previous Cladosporium species, which are discussed belo.

## Discussion
In addition, the ability of Morchella to grow in the atmosphere also indicates a potential role for this fungus in atmospheric metabolis.

The present study has provided a comprehensive comparative analysis of Morchella in the marine environment. This is not a comprehensive study of marine fungi, but rather covers the evolution of this species and its ecological niches. The result shows that Morchella has not only a higher diversity compared to other fungal genera, but also different ecological niches. It is now possible to construct a Morchella phylogenetic tree based on two similar taxa, Morchella melanogaster and Morchella ferdinand, which was not possible for the majority of fungi in the marine environment, but they have different ecological niches.

The current study has revealed a new species, Morchella carrionii, and a new genus, Morchella, based on morphological and phylogenetic analysis. The new species is characterized by a low molecular weight, 100 kDa and a unique, wide-variety basidiomycete-like ascomata with pleosporalean to ostiolate hyphae. This is an uncommon species in the marine environment, and was only found in the oceans. However, in the present study, a new species, Morchella lauranhale, was found in the Mediterranean Sea, which was also the same locality where Morchella melanogaster and Morchella ferdinand were also reported [59]. A new species, Morchella sp., was reported in the Antarctic Ocean [60], and was recovered in a marine sediment in the Great Barrier Reef [61]. Morchella lauranhale was also recovered in the Great Barrier Reef, and is characterized by a well-developed, smooth, septate basidiomycete-like ascomata, and the presence of a unique, round, dark-coloured, erumpent, aseptate basidiomycete-like ascomata on the ascus [62].

The concept of Morchella as a new taxon has been popularised by the distribution of Morchella melanogaster and Morchella ferdinand, and is accepted by Morchella melanogaster and Morchella ferdinand.
