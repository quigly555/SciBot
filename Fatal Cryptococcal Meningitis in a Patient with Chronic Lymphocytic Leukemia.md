## Abstract
Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen of humans and is one of the most common causes of opportunistic infections. C. albicans infections are usually treated with amphotericin B. However, resistance to flucytosine and fluconazole-based induction therapy with flucytosine-based induction therapy has been reported. We aimed to characterize the resistance mechanisms of C. albicans isolates obtained from HIV-infected patients with invasive candidiasis.

We reviewed the medical records of all patients with candidiasis and analyzed the patient-patient relationship using logistic regression and Chi-square analysis.

Twenty-five C. albicans isolates were evaluated. Susceptibility tests for Candida albicans were positive in 27/41 (44%) of the patients. The gene expression of these isolates was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Their antifungal susceptibility was determined by quantitative real-time PCR.

The highest resistance was found in Candida albicans isolated from HIV-infected patients with invasive candidiasis. Among these, fluconazole-based induction therapy was effective in 27/41 (44%) and amphotericin B in 21/41 (29%) of the patients, respectively. Resistance was also found in Candida glabrata isolates from HIV-infected patients with candidiasis and non-C. albicans infection.

The resistance of C. albicans to antifungal drugs is very high and we need to improve our understanding of this fungal pathogen. In addition, we need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the antifungal resistance. Our study highlights the need for continued investigation of antifungal resistance mechanisms among Candida spp., suggesting the use of new antifungal agents.


## Introduction
The genus of Monilinia, in which these microorganisms have been isolated for many years, is of great importance to the control of fungal diseases. Monilinia is a monilium-like fungus, and its ability to cause disease in humans, mainly in immunocompromised patients, is well known (Lodder and Krebs, 1980; Doleker and Skaar, 1985; Lin and Tkachnik, 1989). Monilinia spp. are the main causative agents of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia, lymphocytic leukaemia, and rheumatoid arthritis (Nair et al., 2015). Among the numerous immunocompromised patients, immunocompetent individuals are particularly susceptible to infections by these microorganisms. Monilinia spp. are usually isolated from the ears, sinuses, and gastrointestinal tracts of animals, birds, and humans (Segal and Khan, 1984; Prakash, 1984; Thanh et al., 2015). For example, some of them have been isolated from the ears of wild boa constrictors, freshwater fishes, fish that inhabit the lakes of Northern India, and fish that are used as food by humans (Cao et al., 2014).

In this study, we isolated and characterized a strain of C. neoformans from the ear of a Japanese seaweed fish. In this study, we focused on its virulence profile and pathogenicity. A comparative analysis was carried out on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, which is commonly used for sequence-based identification of the members of the Mucorales order (Voglmayr et al., 2015). The length of this spacer was analyzed using RNA-Seq and the result was compared against the ITS region of the fungal genome.


## Methods
We also compared the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with hematological malignancie. All patients were enrolled consecutively and data were analyzed with the following covariates: age, gender, and infection with Cryptococcus (ie, positive or negative cultures) and Lymphocystis peritonitis. The treatment regimens included the treatment with no Lymphocystis inoculation, the treatment with Lymphocystis inoculation, the treatment with Lymphocystis isolation, the treatment with Lymphocystis isolation, and the treatment with Lymphocystis isolation. Patients with recurrent Lymphocystis cryptococcal meningitis were excluded.

Ethics statement
All research involving human participants was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Medicine, University of Nairobi (Protocol No. 4). All participants gave written informed consent.

Data collection
The data were collected using a questionnaire that was designed to provide information about the history and treatment of clinical and laboratory data. The questionnaire included information regarding the clinical features of meningitis and the time of ART initiation. A detailed description of the study protocol is available in the Supplementary Material (Suppl. Table 1). We also included information about the number of days since the last evaluation, including the time interval since the last evaluation, and the CD4 count. The CD4 cell count was performed using a modified version of the technique used in our previous study [20].

We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the relationship between treatment success and the risk of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with chronic hematological malignancies [23]. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between treatment success and the risk of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with hematological malignancies. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between treatment success and the risk of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with hematological malignancies.

## Results
The median time to diagnosis of cryptococcal disease was 20 days (range 1-6. Overall, we found that 50% of the patients had a history of cryptococcal meningitis. Of the patients who were receiving miconazole, 67% were receiving amphotericin B at the time of treatment, and 30% were receiving fluconazole at the time of treatment.

Cryptococcal Meningitis in a Patient with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The patient presented with fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. All patients had been receiving antiretroviral therapy for 6 months. At the time of death, the patient was admitted to a hospital for diagnosis of a gastrointestinal tract infection. He had severe diarrhea. His overall health was normal. He was receiving monotherapy with fluconazole for 6 months and was receiving miconazole and amphotericin B at the time of death. He had a CD4 count of 154 cells/mm^3. His median CD4 count was 116 cells/mm^3. He was receiving caspofungin for 24 weeks, miconazole for 12 weeks, and miconazole for 12 weeks. He had a viral load of 10.5 copies/ml and a CD4 count of 200 cells/mm^3. He had a viral load of 30.5 copies/ml and a CD4 count of 70 cells/mm^3. He was receiving amphotericin B for 24 weeks and was receiving fluconazole at the time of death.

## Discussion
In this patient, the CSF fungal burden was not detecte.

Infections with Histoplasma antigens may be associated with a more severe disease course, particularly during the post-partum period. Histoplasma antigens have been reported to induce inflammation and fungal invasion, and these pathogens may be associated with multiple organ involvement in HIV-associated CM. In addition to the immune response, cryptococcosis can be associated with immunological dysregulation and CNS disease [20]. We observed that the CSF fungal burden and the fungal burden of the CNS were significantly decreased in HIV-infected patients. The decrease in CSF fungal burden in HIV-infected patients may be a response to the increased fungal burden of the CNS during the early phase of HIV infection, which is further exacerbated in the later phase. This might explain the decreased fungal burden in patients with HIV-associated CM during the late phase of HIV infection.

In HIV-infected patients, the median time between ART initiation and HIV-related CM was 2.5 months [21]. The median time of HIV-related CM in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 2.3 months [21]. In our study, the median time of HIV-related CM in HIV-infected patients was 3.5 months [21]. However, there was no difference in the duration of HIV-related CM between HIV-infected patients with and without CM.

Our study demonstrates that HIV-associated CM is associated with a negative serologic serologic profile, which may be due to the fact that HIV-infected patients have a lower serum fungal burden and higher fungal burden of the CSF. This negative serologic profile was in a similar range as the serologic profile in patients with HIV and HIV infection [21, 22]. Our findings are similar to a recent study in African-American HIV-infected individuals [23] and to a study in South African HIV-infected individuals [24]. The negative serologic profile of HIV-associated CM was similar to the serologic profile of patients with HIV in the latter study. HIV-infected patients were more likely to have an increased fungal burden of the CSF compared to patients without HIV infection. This could be due to the fact that HIV-infected patients had a higher fungal burden in the CSF.
