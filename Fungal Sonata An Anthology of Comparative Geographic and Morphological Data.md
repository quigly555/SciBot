## Abstract
In the past two decades, the incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically. Candida species are the leading cause of fungal bloodstream infections, with an increasing number of patients being immunocompromised or debilitated. Candida species are the etiological agents of these infections, and a very important cause of late-onset and life-threatening infections. The treatment options for these opportunistic fungi are limited and have a long history of misuse and overuse. The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of Candida albicans to fluconazole (FLC) and caspofungin (Casp) in a standard antifungal combination. Fluconazole (FLC) and caspofungin inhibited the growth of C. albicans and of the most common fungal pathogens Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei, respectively. Caspofungin had no effect. FLC-3 and Casp-3 conferred a resistance to fluconazole, while Casp-3 inhibited FLC-3. These results suggested that FLC-3 and Caspofungin synergistically inhibit FLC-3 and Casp-3, thereby affecting the efficacy of antifungals against C. albicans and C. glabrata.


## Introduction
Plant biomass, including phenolic compounds, has been reported to be the main bioenergy source of biofuels and bioproducts in the food industry (Friedman and Sperandio, 2010). Synthesis of phenolic compounds has been mainly focused on polyphenols, which have been used in many industrial applications, such as in food, beverage, paper and pulp industries (Friedman and Sperandio, 2010). However, phenolic compounds are still found in biomass hydrocarbons, which are in high demand in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries (O'Riordan et al., 2012). Furthermore, there are some polyphenolic compounds that are produced as a by-product from biomass hydrocarbons. In addition, phytosterols are present as by-products of the fermentation process, which are used as building blocks for a wide range of bioproducts (Friedman and Sperandio, 2010). In the agricultural sector, phytosterols are utilized as feedstock for a variety of industrial processes (He et al., 2008), such as those involved in food processing, food grade food, detergent, paper, and pulp industries, as well as in the biofuel and bioproduct industries (Friedman and Sperandio, 2010).


## Methods
Fungi were identified according to the species name and their appearance in Fungi Collection. An additional Fungi species from the same collection were also included in this study. Fungi were classified into four subclasses based on the literature data [19, 20]. Fungi were considered as “molecular species” if the genus or species name is similar to other molecular taxa from the same genus or species (Table 1). Fungi were also classified into four subclasses based on the presence and type of fungal microorganisms or the absence of any major morphological differences between the genera and species. Fungi were classified as “non-pathogenic” if the genus or species name is either non-pathogenic or non-pathogenic (Table 1). Fungi were also considered as “fungal species” if the genus or species name is not specific to fungi or viruses [19, 20]. Fungi were classified as “fungo-type” if the genus or species name is not specific to fungi or viruses, and is composed of at least two of the five fungal species present in one genus or species.

Fungi were also categorized into five subclasses based on the presence of Fungi in the species included in this study. Fungi were classified as “viral” if the genus or species name is not specific to viruses, and is composed of at least three of the five fungal species present in one genus or species, and is composed of at least two of the five fungal species present in one species. Fungi were classified as “other” if the genus or species name is non-viral or non-viral, and is composed of at least two of the five fungal species present in one species. Fungi were also categorized as “other” if the genus or species name is non-viral or non-viral, and is composed of at least two fungal species present in one species. Fungi were classified as “other” if the genus or species name is non-viral or non-viral, and is composed of at least two fungal species present in one species.

Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed using R software (version 3.

## Discussion
oryzae and . cinerea) with the exception of M. grisea, and of A. oryzae and A. oryzae-like species, which were found only in Mucoromycotina and only in A. oryzae-like species. However, the phylogenetic relationship of B. cinerea, M. grisea, and A. oryzae-like species was very similar, except for B. cinerea and A. oryzae, and A. oryzae-like species in A. oryzae-like species, and A. oryzae-like species in A. oryzae-like species (Fig 2). The distribution of these species in the other two phyla was dominated by lichenized fungi, and these lichenized fungi were mostly included in this clade. However, the distribution of the other two phyla differed in different ways, such as in the phylogenetic relationships of the two phyla, and the taxonomic position of the two phyla in the same geographical area.

The phylogenetic relationships of the two phyla within the lichenized fungus Mucoromycotina and in the other two phyla were extremely similar, with A. oryzae, A. oryzae, and M. grisea occurring in the Mucoromycotina-dominated phyla Mucoromycotina and Mucoromycotina-dominated phyla Mucoromyces and Mucoromyces-dominated phyla, respectively. However, the phylogenetic relationship of the two phyla differed in different ways, such as in the phylogenetic relationships of the two phyla in the two phyla, and the phylogenetic relationship of the two phyla in the two phyla in the Mucoromycotina-dominated phyla Mucoromycotina and Mucoromycotina-dominated phyla Mucoromyces (Fig 2). The taxonomic position of the two phyla was highly similar, except for the M. grisea-like taxon that was found only in Mucoromycotina, and M.
