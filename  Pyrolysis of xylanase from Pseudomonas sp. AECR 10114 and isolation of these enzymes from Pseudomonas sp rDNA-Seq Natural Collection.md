## Abstract
This paper presents a case on the occurrence of candiduria in a 10-year-old goat from a district with a high number of ambulant primary immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) cases, along with recommendations on treatment, prevention and treatment in such cases. The individual and the frequency of candiduria diagnosis varied from case-to-case and the patient was referred for further investigation. The goat presented with blurred vision, hemoptysis, diarrhea and acute gout. The clinical examination revealed a neutropenic character. The outcome was favourable, with no neurological, psychiatric or nephrological deficits and no ophthalmological abnormalities. Candida albicans was the most common species found in the blood and urine. The most common clinical symptoms were ophthalmoplegia and ocular signs were dysregulated. Nitrotoxic drug administration was the mainstay of treatment with antifungal prophylaxis. Although rare, immunodeficiency diagnosis was considered to be a diagnostic target. This is the first case reported in a dog and the first case of a candiduria-associated episode in a goat in China.


## Introduction
The objective of the present study was to characterize the bacterial and fungal community structures of soil from two major soil types in Yunnan Province of China. Our previous study [1] showed that soil from two different soil types, with different soil types and sources, had different bacterial and fungal community structures. Previous studies [2] and this study [3] from Yunnan have shown that soil from two different soil types had different bacterial and fungal community structures. Based on the results of our previous study [1] and this study [3], the present study was designed to determine the diversity of soil microbial communities from two different soil types in Yunnan.


## Methods

Preparation of xylanase from Pseudomonas s. AECR 10114
A small amount of the crude xylanase from Pseudomonas sp. AECR 10114 was used in this study. A. niger seed (Hordeum vulgare) was inoculated in a loop of Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and incubated for 2 days. This was followed by inoculation of a loop of Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) in a loop of Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) and incubated for 1 day. The extracts were collected by filtration and the xylanase was extracted using a phenol chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The xylanase was then washed and the organic phase was dried by rotary evaporation.

Preparation of xylanase from Pseudomonas sp. AECR 10114
The xylanase from A. niger was prepared by addition of 3 g of xylan to 2 mL of sterile deionized water, and then it was vortexed for 5 min. The xylanase was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then used for the preparation of the xylanase. The xylanase was then concentrated by filtration and the supernatant was then used for the preparation of the xylanase.

The xylanase from A. niger was prepared by addition of 5 g of the xylan to 3 mL of sterile deionized water, and then it was vortexed for 5 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then used for the preparation of the xylanase.

## Results
 were not possibl. However, analysis of the xylanase activity of a strain of P. pachyrhizi using a liquid xylanase inhibitor, AmB (U. Braun) and a control xylanase inhibitor, the xylanase inhibitor, showed that the enzyme was able to hydrolyze xylan into xylitol (Fig 4). The xylanase activity of a strain of P. pachyrhizi was also demonstrated in xylanase inhibition experiments (10), and the enzymes were also found to be capable of hydrolyzing xylitol (11).

3.3. Identification of the Xylanase Activity
The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was assayed using xylose as the sole carbon source (Fig 5). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was confirmed by the results of xylanase activity assays (Fig 5). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was also confirmed by xylanase inhibition assays (Fig 5), and the enzymes were also found to be capable of hydrolyzing xylitol (11).

3.4. Identification of the Xylanase Activity
The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was assayed using xylanase as the sole carbon source (Fig 6). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was confirmed by the results of xylanase activity assays (Fig 6). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was confirmed by the results of xylanase inhibition assays (Fig 6).

3.5. Xylanase Activity of P. pachyrhizi

The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was assayed using xylose as the sole carbon source (Fig 7). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was confirmed by the results of xylanase inhibition assays (Fig 7).

3.6. Xylanase Activity of P. pachyrhizi

The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was determined using xylose as the sole carbon source (Fig 8). The xylanase activity of P. pachyrhizi was confirmed by the results of xylanase activity assays (Fig 8).


## Discussion

Fungal genomes
Fungal genomes of the genus Aspergillus were sequenced from the . anserina and P. virens Fusarium genomes of the same genus, respectively (Figure 4). These genomes show that they belong to a large collection of species with diverse lifestyles. The genomes of these two species are in good agreement with the genome sequences of the two species. The genomes of P. anserina and P. virens are in good agreement with the genomes of P. anserina and P. virens.

Among the fungal genomes that we sequenced, the genome of C. neoformans and C. gattii (CE1) and the genome of C. gattii (CE2) have been reported previously by this group (Figure 6). The genomes of these two species were sequenced, and the genomes of the genomes of the other two species were also sequenced. The genomes of C. gattii and C. neoformans were sequenced and the genomes of these two species were also sequenced. The genomes of the two species of the genus Aspergillus were sequenced and the genomes of the two species were also sequenced. The genomes of the two species were also sequenced and the genomes of the other two species were also sequenced. The genomes of the two species of Aspergillus were sequenced and the genomes of the other two species were also sequenced.

We performed a manual survey of the fungal genome using a combination of publicly available and predicted genomic data. This study did not provide a comprehensive analysis of fungal genomes. However, we did find a high number of fungal species that are known to be pathogenic in humans, including Aspergillus species. Most of these species are characterized by their pathogenic capabilities, such as by pathogenicity. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most frequently isolated species from human blood, skin and nails, as well as from patients with aspergillosis [34]. In addition, there was a high percentage of aspergillus-infected human skin, skin and nails. In addition, there was a high percentage of aspergillus-infected patients with a primary pulmonary infection.

The genome analysis of C. gattii showed a higher number of species with more than 100 predicted genes.
