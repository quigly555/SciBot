## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has a worldwide distribution. Coccidioidomycosis causes ~150,000 deaths per year. We previously reported that mice with altered germ tubes are more susceptible to cryptococcosis than mice infected with normal germ tubes. Here we show a correlation between altered germ tubes and resistance to cryptococcosis. We also found that altered germ tubes are an early prognostic marker of Coccidioides species invasion. In a mouse model of cryptococcosis, mice with altered germ tubes had reduced survival compared with control. Complementation of an immunoblot that mimics germ tubes or a germ tube-infected host increases the ability to survive cryptococcosis. Consistent with this, an immunological response is required for Coccidioides species survival. Our results suggest that altered germ tubes are an important, yet underappreciated, risk factor for cryptococcosis and suggest novel pharmacological and genetic therapies to combat Coccidioides disease.

Cryptococcus is the most common fungal pathogen worldwide. Humans with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a higher risk of cryptococcosis compared with non-CF individuals. We investigated the relationship between altered germ tubes and resistance to cryptococcosis in a CF patient with CF meningitis (CFML). We found altered gene expression in germ tubes in response to environmental stress, inflammation, and macrophage activation. Specifically, dysregulated germ tubes were affected in Coccidioides lutzii (CFML), which was resistant to fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), voriconazole (VRC), and amphotericin B (AMB).


## Introduction
The ability of microbes to adapt and adapt to environmental changes is crucial for the accomplishment of many complex and diverse functions. Adaptations to environmental changes, including changes in pH, temperature, sugar concentration and other pH-dependent nutrient uptake, are linked to changes in cell wall composition and secretory proteins, which are important in maintaining cell shape and integrity [1]. The cell wall is a structural interface between fungal and mammalian cells. The cell wall is responsible for the adhesion and constriction of fungal cells, which is important for the establishment of the infection structures [2].

The cell wall is composed of highly dynamic chemical components, such as chitin, the linear ß-(1-3)-glucans and glycoproteins, as well as cell wall proteins, including the cell wall chitin synthase (CpS) and chitinase (Cht) [3-5]. The cell wall chitin is synthesized from a- and ß-(1-3)-glucans by the chitin synthase (Chs) and chitinase (Chs) [6].


## Methods
Fungal Strains
C. albicans ATCC 90028 (serotype A), C. dubliniensis ATCC 22019 (serotype A) and C. albicans ATCC 90028 (serotype B) were used in this study. All strains were cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) at 35°C for 2 days before use. All strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco) at 37°C for 7 days before use.

Plant Material and Processing
The cv. A. thaliana CBS138 was used in this study. The plant was cultivated in a growth chamber at 35°C in the dark for 10 days before use.

Construction of the C. albicans Strains
The plasmid pJAF1 was used as the backbone DNA backbone for the construction of the C. albicans strains. The plasmid pJAF1-CAS-F/CAS-F was used as the backbone DNA backbone for the construction of the C. albicans strains. The plasmid pJAF1-F/CAS-F was used as the backbone DNA backbone for the construction of the C. albicans strains.


## Results
pastoris (9. Therefore, the ability of the recombinant egg-laying mutants to form and fertilize a viable egg in P. pastoris may be reduced in the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant population. This fact is in contrast with the high frequency of eggs that can develop in P. pastoris-mimicking P. pastoris (6). Because P. pastoris has a more heterogeneous population of eggs, it has been hypothesized that the sex determination of the egg-laying mutants may be a reliable indicator of the viability of a mutant population. To test this possibility, we introduced a wild-type P. pastoris and a recombinant mutant P. pastoris into P. pastoris-mimicking P. pastoris-mimicking P. pastoris. The P. pastoris-mimicking mutant population contained a significantly higher number of eggs compared to the wild-type population (P<0.05; Fig 1C).

Expression of the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant P. pastoris is high in the PDB medium
To test whether the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant population is able to produce eggs, we examined the expression of the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant P. pastoris in PDB medium under the control of a GFP signal. As shown in Fig 2A, P. pastoris-mimicking mutant P. pastoris-mimicking PDB medium contained high levels of P. pastoris-mimicking PDB transcript. Therefore, the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant population may be able to produce eggs.

P. pastoris-mimicking PDB medium is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) that are abundant in nature (11). We examined the PDB medium in P. pastoris-mimicking mutant P. pastoris-mimicking PDB medium, and the P. pastoris-mimicking PDB medium contained high levels of MUFAs that are abundant in nature (11). Thus, the P. pastoris-mimicking mutant population may be able to produce eggs.

## Discussion
In contrast, in a laboratory-cultured egg-laying strain, the <U+0394>tiger strain produced similar colonies to that of the parental strain in all of the tested conditions, but the colony sizes and colony-to-bevel ratios of these mutants were much larger than that of the parental strai. These observations are in accordance with the results of a recent study conducted in China [19]. This comparison of mutant phenotypes revealed that these mutants are not only avirulent in the wild-type and wild-type laboratory strains, but also exhibit high resistance to both H. capsulatum and C. neoformans infection, and that these mutants also display higher rates of cell-cell fusion, higher resistance to oxidative stress, and high virulence [16, 18]. These differences in colony growth, cell fusion, and resistance to H. capsulatum and C. neoformans infection are both similar to those of the parental strain. These observations support the hypothesis that the <U+0394>tiger strain is avirulent in a laboratory-based strain, and the ability of the mutant to produce enhanced amounts of the virulence factor, C. neoformans, in addition to the ability to produce cells that are less resistant to the infection.

The expression of the virulence-related genes (vps17, vps24, vps42, and vps59) was significantly increased in the <U+0394>tiger strain. These genes are involved in the production of secondary metabolites, including cecropin-2, cecropin-3, cecropin-5, and cecropin-6, which are involved in the production of eugenol, a substance that is also involved in the production of cecropin [22]. The expression of these genes is up-regulated during infection and the exposure to infection, and the expression of these genes is increased in the presence of H. capsulatum, C. neoformans, and H. capsulatum, which indicates that the mutant can survive and cause infection in hosts. In contrast, the expression of the ssk1 and ssk2 genes in the <U+0394>tiger strain was down-regulated.
