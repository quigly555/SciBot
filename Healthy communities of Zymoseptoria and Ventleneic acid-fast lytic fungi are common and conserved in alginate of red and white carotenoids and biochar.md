## Abstract
The polysaccharides of many plants and animals have antimicrobial properties. The conversion of crude glycerol to glycerol, i.e., by a single-step reaction, is a common process used in industries such as baking, brewing and wine. This process has never been explained by molecular calculations, but molecular data obtained from strain association with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SDS) are consistent with a glycerol-to-glycerol conversion occurring in about 1/3rd of all sugars. There is, however, no report on the possible conversion of raw glycerol to glycerol by strain typing. In this study, we performed multi-gene phylogeny to identify strain-level carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in 59 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also used the amino acid sequences to identify 16 CAZymes in Saccharomyces butyricum, and one additional enzyme, acetyl-CoAase 1, in six strains of S. cerevisiae. Analysis of the sequences of these sequences with confidence indicates that all six S. cerevisiae strains were able to bind glycerol, and all of them could be used as genetic models of glycerol-to-glycerol conversion. However, none of the six S. cerevisiae strains could ferment all of the glycerol to produce acetyl-CoAase, the only identified strain-level CAZyme. These results indicate that strain typing could be a useful basis for identifying strains able to produce acetyl-CoAase. We also analyzed the effects of the strain type on glycerol metabolism by using PCR assays to identify the genes associated with glycerol biosynthesis.


## Introduction
Infectious diseases are threats to all living organisms; however, pathogens are also opportunists, being able to cause devastating infections in non-human hosts such as animals, plants and insects. These infections are caused by a wide range of pathogens, which include viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, among others. Many of the pathogens are found in nature, e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans, although their prevalence is relatively high in certain parts of the world and relatively low in other parts of the world (e.g., United States) (Niemelä and Stabb, 2010; Klarich, 2014). In this article, we will focus on the pathogenicity of some of the most common opportunistic fungi, including A. fumigatus, Candida albicans and Trichosporon asahii, as they may cause fatal infections in humans (e.g., GAE and neutropenia). However, A. fumigatus also causes human infections, which may be difficult to treat, due to the difficulty to cultivate the appropriate drug.


## Methods

Antifungal activity of the compounds
The antifungal activity of the compounds was determined according to the CLSI (2008) metho. The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 5 mg/mL and diluted in sterile distilled water to an A_600 of 0.5. The test was performed in triplicate.

The extract was obtained from three individual roots of the actively growing red and white carotenoids, which were collected in the same way as the roots of the fungaloidoidoid. The extract was diluted with sterile distilled water to the final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and stored at -20 °C. The stock concentration was prepared by dissolving a solution of 10 g/L KH_2PO_4 in 10 mL of aqueous NaOH solution. Then the solution was diluted in sterile distilled water to obtain 1 mg/mL. The suspension was diluted with distilled water to obtain 1 mL of a solution of 0.1 mg/mL. The test was performed in triplicate.

The antifungal activity of the compounds was determined according to the method of Veeck et al. (1999) and Fischer and Muench (1999) with modifications. The test was performed in triplicate.

The extract was obtained from three individual roots of the fungaloidoidoid, which were collected in the same way as the roots of the fungaloidoidoid. The root was divided into five parts: 1. The roots were divided into four parts and 1. The roots were divided into two parts. The root was divided into two parts. Then the extract was diluted in sterile distilled water to obtain 1.0 mg/mL. The test was performed in triplicate.

## Results

Taken together, these data suggest that the microalgae/sclerotia community in the Alsuspilicetum is highly homogeneous with regard to diversity and thus is an important contributor to the diversity of the algal communities present in the Alsuspilicetu. The different phyla, classes and species of microalgae/sclerotia that contribute to the diversity of the algal communities present in the Alsuspilicetum are presented in Table 2. The higher richness of the community of Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi (average values of 18.0 and 16.5, respectively) can be attributed to the higher levels of diversity in the community of Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi than in the Alsuspilicetum (Table 2). The results of the NMDS and the OTU analyses of the Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi can be found in Tables 3 and 4. The Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi are similar to the fungal phyla in the taxonomy of alginate of red and white carotenoids and biocharides, respectively, but differ in the character of the different microalgae/sclerotia species. The OTUs of Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi are similar to the fungal phyla in the taxonomy of red carotenoids and biocharides, respectively.

The diversity of the Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi in the alginate of red and white carotenoids and biocharides, respectively, is higher than in the alginate of red carotenoid and white carotenoid-rich microalgae communities in the Alsuspilicetum (Table 3). The relative abundance of Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi in the alginate of red and white carotenoids and biocharides, respectively, can be seen in Table 4. The relative abundance of Zymoseptoria and Ventleneic acid-fast lytic fungi in the alginate of red and white carotenoids and biocharides can be seen in Table 4.


## Discussion
However, in our study, the metagenomic data from these two genera (Fig 3) showed that the same metagenomic dataset was available in both specie. Therefore, we decided to expand our current study to include metagenomic data from species of Ophiostomatales. In order to investigate metagenomic diversity, we applied the sequences of 28 fungal phylotypes of the Pleosporales, including the Pleosporales and the Helotiales. According to BLAST analysis, the Pleosporales contained several phylotypes belonging to two phylotypes, namely Helotiales and Ascomycota (Fig 4). The Helotiales contained four phylotypes, namely HelotialesA, HelotialesB, HelotialesC and HelotialesD. In our study, two phylotypes (HelotialesA and HelotialesB) were identified as Pleosporales and three phylotypes (HelotialesA and HelotialesB) as Ascomycota. The HelotialesA phylotype (HelotialesA) was distributed in all phylotypes of the Pleosporales. It was found in all the phylotypes of the Helotiales. The HelotialesB phylotype (HelotialesB) was distributed in all the phylotypes of the Pleosporales. The Pleosporales was found in all the phylotypes of the Pleosporales, which is in accordance with the results of previous studies (Tazewona et al. 2018). However, the same phylotype was not found in our study. This phylotype was also present in other phylotypes of the Pleosporales, namely Helotiales and HelotialesB. In our study, the HelotialesB phylotype was present in all the phylotypes of the Pleosporales, which is in accordance with the results of previous studies (Tazewona et al. 2018). Furthermore, the Pleosporales was the only species found in all the phylotypes of the Pleosporales.
