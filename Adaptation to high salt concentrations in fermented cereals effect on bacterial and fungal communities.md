## Abstract
In this study we present a system for studying the interactions of yeasts and filamentous fungi. A yeast strain is characterized by its ability to grow on a wide range of carbon sources and by its ability to alter its metabolism to lose a large proportion of its secretory function as carbon catabolite. Yeasts are known to grow on complex substrates and to release large amounts of metabolites in a process described as metabolic collapse. In this study we have analyzed the yeast response to carbon sources by utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and gas chromatography - time-of-flight (GC-FOV) proteomic approaches. We have also generated yeast-specific transcriptomes, and identified genes which are involved in metabolic control of the yeast growth. These results have led to a comprehensive analysis of the yeast response and identify the enzymes which change their substrate utilization to cause metabolic collapse.

Dimorphic yeasts are a group of very interesting microorganisms that grow on diverse carbon sources. Some of these yeasts are known as filamentous fungi, and these fungi are also known as “mycotoxins.

## Methods
Overnight cultures of each strain were prepared in 10 ml of YPD broth (.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Each culture was incubated in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 200 ml of sterile water, and then transferred to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of YPD broth with or without 1% of glucose. The resulting culture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then transferred to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was incubated in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was incubated at room temperature, and then transferred to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was incubated at 25 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for 4-5 h. After incubation, the supernatant was transferred to a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, and then transferred to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was incubated at 25 °C for 4 h. The supernatant was then transferred to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water. The resulting culture was then placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of sterile water.


## Results
We compared the pH values of different fermentations on microbial communities using a three-dimensional (3D) image analysi. For this, we used a combination of low (pH 6), medium (pH 7) and high (pH 13) fermentations (Figure 1). As illustrated in Figure 1, fermentation pH values of fermentations with low (pH 6) and medium (pH 7) fermentations are significantly different, indicating that low fermentation pH values affect bacterial and fungal communities. The bacterial and fungal communities were dominated by E. coli, with a maximum at pH 7 (Figure 1). These data suggest that fermentation pH values of different fermentations alter bacterial and fungal communities.

To test whether fermentation pH affects the composition of fungal communities, we determined the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cryptococcus neoformans and other fungi in the fermented cereals. As shown in Figure 1, a significant difference in the fungal community of the fermentations with low (pH 6) and high (pH 13) fermentations was observed. In contrast, the microbial communities were dominated by E. coli, with a maximum at pH 6 (Figure 1). These data suggest that fermentation pH values of different fermentations influence the composition of fungal communities.

Fungal community composition and fermentation pH
As the three fermentations were fermented with different fermentation pH values, we compared the fungal community of the fermentations with different fermentation pH values. In contrast to the results from the bacterial and fungal communities, the fungal community of the fermentations with low fermentations was dominated by A. flavus, with a maximum at pH 7 (Figure 2). The fungal community of the fermentations with high fermentations was dominated by A. flavus, with a maximum at pH 7. The fungal community of the fermentations with medium fermentations was dominated by A. flavus, with a maximum at pH 7. The fungal community of the fermentations with high fermentations was dominated by A. flavus, with a maximum at pH 7.

The relative abundances of the bacterial and fungal communities of the fermentations with low (pH 6) and high fermentations were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify potential significant differences.


## Discussion
maltophilia at high sal. The microbial communities were mainly dominated by the S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which are the most frequently detected species in cereals (11,13,17,18). In addition, many OTUs showed increased abundances in the osmotic shock group, which may result in the reduced pH values in the presence of salt, or also to increase the relative abundance of some OTUs in the osmotic shock group. The latter could also lead to the changes in the relative abundances of OTUs in the osmotic shock group.

The dominant genus in the osmotic shock group was Lactobacillales, which was mainly dominated by M. pulcherrima, which is a typical bacterial pathogen in cereals (13). In the osmotic shock group, there were also several OTUs, which were significantly increased in the presence of C. maltophilia (Fig 5). However, the proportion of Lactobacillus and the dominant genus in the osmotic shock group was almost equal to those in the fermentation group. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the osmotic shock group was almost similar to that in the fermentation group, which was in the presence of S. epidermidis. L. brevis was a common contaminant in cereals, including cereals with low pH values (4.6,5). The relative abundance of L. brevis in the osmotic shock group was even higher than that in the fermentation group (1.7%). The relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the osmotic shock group was even higher than that in the fermentation group, which was in the presence of C. maltophilia. The relative abundance of L. brevis in the osmotic shock group was much higher than that in the fermentation group. These results suggest that the osmotic shock group caused the change in the relative abundance of OTUs in the osmotic shock group. In the fermenter group, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and S. epidermidis were almost similar to those in the fermentation group, which was in the presence of C. maltophilia. The relative abundances of L.
