## Abstract
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins are cellular machinery which transfers information about a protein with a function/function relationship among its flagellar proteins. In this study, we analyzed the role of an IFT2 gene in the immune response of mice against a pathogenic murine malaria parasite. We found that IFT2 overexpression caused a reduction in the production of the parasite in wild type (WT) animals compared with recombinant (r)dsa. In contrast, IFT2 promoter depletion also reduced the survival of wild type (WT) mice against a murine pathogen. Therefore, IFT2 is essential for the malaria parasite development and the attenuation of disease in mice. These results suggest that IFT2 is transferred information between the flagellar and regulatory systems in this model of malaria.

Many proteins carry a regulatory function. In mammals, they initiate and control parasite development. In this study, we investigated the role of an IFT2 gene, which encodes a flagellar protein with a flanking a-helix and a-helix. IFT2 encodes a complex flagellar protein which is found in a wide variety of eukaryotes. The flagellar protein FlpA in Fusarium graminearum, for example, controls the formation of the infected cuticle and development of the infected plastid. However, the role of IFT2 in the malaria parasite development and response to the infection is not clear. To identify the IFT2 in FlpA, we cloned an a-helix deletion strain flpA and a flagellar mutant isolate, which are susceptible to infection with the parasite Fusarium falciparum. Our results showed that the in vitro expression of IFT2 and the virulence of the mutant isolate flpA were reduced in the presence of the parasite, indicating that this protein has a role in the virulence of the fungus. The results also indicated that the IFT2 protein FlpA is required for the development of the plastid, since the flagellar protein FlpA was lacking in wild type (WT) animals. The flagellar protein FlpA, which is not involved in the virulence, is not conserved in fungi.


## Introduction
Fungi are known to be involved in the regulation of several biological processes including growth, morphogenesis, cell-to-cell communication, metabolism, immune responses and pathogenesis. One of the important aspects of fungal pathogenesis is the control of environmental nutrients, which includes nitrogen and phosphorus availability. However, increasing demands for nitrogen fixation in agriculture and aquaculture have led to the increased use of phosphorus-starved crops (Dyst et al., 1999). Moreover, several plant pathogens can colonize and cause disease in a susceptible host, often in an animal-mediated or non-animal manner. For example, A. alternata can cause severe wilt diseases in many non-albicans grasses (Darvas et al., 2007), A. nidulans causes powdery mildew diseases in citrus (Wichern et al., 2007), and A. niger causes anthracnose on sweet potato (Selker et al., 2007).

Several studies have demonstrated that nitrogen fixation of plants in hypersaline environments is required for effective infection and growth of the pathogen (Nurschel et al., 1997; Magyar et al., 2002; Baeza et al., 2007; Chaudhary et al., 2007). The regulation of nitrogen fixation in Aspergillus spp. has been investigated in the past two decades (Farr et al., 2012; Nasr et al., 2012), and the molecular details of the amino acid regulation are not yet understood. The major nitrogen sensing receptors in A. nidulans are Nrg1, which is also expressed at high levels in A. alternata (Nasr et al., 2012). In contrast, no signal is detected by the remaining A. nidulans. Nrg1 is a small transmembrane protein that contains a small N-terminal domain, which is known as the nitrogen-releasing domain (NR) and a second large (32-100-fold) and a short N-terminal (100-fold) domain, which are located at the N-terminus and comprise two to seven residues (Magyar et al., 2002; Farr et al., 2012; Nair et al., 2014). In addition to Nrg1, A.


## Methods
This fungus was maintained in Petri dish (8% malt extract, 1% peptone, .5% yeast extract, 1% sodium azide, 0.5% agar) with a light-dark cycle of 1.30, 1.40, 2.40, 2.60, and 3.00 a.m. under a 12:12 light:dark photoperiod. For isolation of Penicillium marneffei from the isolates, the mycelium was digested with yeast extract (1% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich) and then treated with trypsin (0.2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h at 37°C. The mycelium was then extracted with methanol and the extract was dried in vacuum at 40°C. The dried mycelium powder was dissolved in methanol and stored at -20°C.

Preparation of a Penicillium Marneffei Culture
A Penicillium marneffei culture was prepared in PDB (Pontecorvo et al., 1997) according to the method described by Livakova et al. (2013). All Penicillium marneffei strains were maintained on malt extract agar (MEA) (Crous et al., 2009b) at 28°C for 14 days. The culture was then used to inoculate a fresh PDB plate. The plate was then incubated at 28°C for 48 h, and the culture supernatants were collected. The culture supernatants were then used to inoculate fresh PDB plates. The plate was then incubated at 28°C for 72 h. The mycelium was then extracted with methanol and the mycelium was then extracted with EtOAc (50:50 v/v, Sigma-Aldrich) and dried in vacuum at 40°C. The mycelium powder was dissolved in methanol and stored at -20°C.


## Results
were the AFM and the pneumococcal management, as previously described [16. In addition, we performed two pilot studies of the two most widely used pneumococcal management methods, which are shown in the Tables 1, 2 and 3.

The pneumococcal management was initially conducted as a single treatment that was administered within one week to 6 months of infection. One hundred ninety-eight percent of pneumococcal isolates were resistant to pneumococcal isoniazid or gentamicin (Table 1). In addition, the initiation and the extension of AFM were comparable between the two groups (Table 1). At the end of the first year of infection, approximately half of the pneumococcal isolates were resistant to the three antifungal agents used (Table 1).

The pneumococcal and AFM strategies were mutually exclusive, with the pneumococcal isolates exhibiting the highest level of resistance (Table 1). When the first year of infection of the pneumococcal isolate was used, half of the pneumococcal isolates were resistant to isoniazid or gentamicin (Table 1). In the final year of infection, half of the pneumococcal isolates were resistant to amphotericin B (Table 1).

We also investigated the efficacy of the pneumococcal and the pneumococcal isoniazid/ gentamicin treatments as compared to the pneumococcal isoniazid or gentamicin treatment. For the pneumococcal isoniazid/ gentamicin treatment, all the isolates were resistant to isoniazid or gentamicin, whereas none were resistant to amphotericin B (Table 1).

Bacterial isoniazid/ gentamicin isoniazid is essential for protection against pneumococcal infections
Although bacterial isoniazid/ gentamicin isoniazid is not a toxic agent, it has been shown to be effective in preventing pneumococcal infection in patients with pneumonia [12]. In addition, it has also been shown to be effective in treating some forms of penicilliosis in patients with acute pneumonia [11].

To test whether the pneumococcal isoniazid/ gentamicin isoniazid is effective, we performed survival analysis of the isolates after 24-h co-culture with human PBMCs for 24 h.


## Discussion
It has been described as a mild, chronic disease, and involves individuals with primary pulmonary aspergillosi.

Pulmonary aspergillosis can be acquired by inhalation of AFBs and AFB-associated fungi, or by contact with mucosal mucosal fungi or AFBs. The patient may be asymptomatic or present with cough, dyspnea, or chest pain. Pulmonary aspergillosis is more common in immunocompetent individuals. The patient may have a history of previous AFBs or AFB-associated fungi, or may present with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or skin lesions.

The patient may present with a dyspnea, chest pain, and a cough. Pulmonary aspergillosis may also occur in immunocompetent individuals. The patient may also present with a history of previous AFBs.

The diagnosis of AFBs is challenging because the individual may not be immunocompetent or have a history of previous AFBs. The patient may present with chest pain, chest radiography, and other chest radiographic features that are not typical of AFBs. Additionally, AFB-associated fungal infections may be detected in the lung by immunohistochemistry, bronchoscopy, or bronchiolitis.

In the patient with AFBs, the diagnosis is challenging because the patient may not be immunocompetent or have a history of previous AFBs. Furthermore, the patient may present with a dyspnea, chest pain, and a cough. The patient may also present with other chest radiographic features that are not typical of AFBs.

The patient with AFBs is at risk of AFBs-related complications. The patient may present with pulmonary aspergillosis, but the patient does not have previous AFBs. The patient may present with a dyspnea, chest pain, and a cough. The patient may also present with a chest radiographic appearance that may be asymptomatic or present with chest radiographic changes.

The patient with AFBs is at risk of other invasive fungal infections such as invasive aspergillosis, invasive aspergillosis-related mycosis, and invasive aspergillosis-associated bronchitis.
