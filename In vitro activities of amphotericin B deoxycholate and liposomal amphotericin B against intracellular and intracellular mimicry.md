## Abstract
The use of antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced the incidence of mycoses and its complications, including mycoses caused by microsporidia, parasites and saprophytes, including paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most frequent fungal infection of meningitis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis to antifungals, and the effect of fluconazole (FLC) treatment on the fungal morphology and biofilm formation.

A total of 125 FLC-treated PCM patients and 150 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study; these patients were divided into 3 groups: 150, 200 and 250 µg/ml, respectively. The collected data were processed and analysed using SPSS version 11.


## Introduction
Glycosylation is a common mechanism by which amino acids are attached to proteins, and it is a widely conserved molecule that can be studied in many different ways. The first step in glycoprotein modification is the assembly of a protein by means of glycosyltransferases (GTs), which hydrolyze the linear glycogen in order to form an ester bond, thereby transferring a portion of the oligomeric charge to the acceptor protein. The final step is a modification of the glycan-protein complex and glycoproteins. The glycosylation machinery can be divided into two types: the simplest GTs, which are membrane-bound enzymes, and the more complex GTs, which are secretory proteins that are attached to proteins via external glycan structures [1]. In general, the secretory proteins are bound to secretory proteins and then delivered to the extracellular environment where they interact with other proteins, often by transduction into secretory proteins or via surface glycan structures [2]. In addition to the typical secretion of secretory proteins, many other glycosylated proteins are present in other eukaryotic cell types including mitochondria, as well as on plants, insects, and fungi [3].


## Methods
albicans ATCC 90113 was assessed according to the method of Wang et a. [24]. Briefly, C. albicans ATCC 90028 was cultured overnight in potato dextrose broth at 30°C. Cultures were diluted with sterile water to a final density of 5 × 10^6 CFU/mL. C. albicans was inoculated onto the plate and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Then, C. albicans cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with sterile water. Cell pellets were resuspended in sterile water, and the number of CFU was determined using a Neubauer chamber. The assay was carried out with three replicates. The experiments were repeated three times with three different treatments (stain, medium, and dilution).

The antifungal activity of C. albicans ATCC 90028 was also assayed in a 96-well plate with three replicates. C. albicans ATCC 90028 was cultured overnight in potato dextrose broth at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with sterile water. Then, C. albicans cells were resuspended in sterile water, and the number of CFU was determined using a Neubauer chamber. The assay was carried out with three replicates. The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the three replicates. The experiments were repeated three times with three different treatments (stain, medium, and dilution).

P. pastoris was used for the assay of the antifungal activity of C. albicans ATCC 90028. Briefly, C. albicans ATCC 90028 was cultured overnight in YPD broth at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with sterile water, and then resuspended in sterile water. The cell suspension was then adjusted to the density of 10^6 CFU/mL. The assay was carried out with three replicates. The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the three replicates. The experiments were repeated three times with three different treatments (stain, medium, and dilution).

The antifungal activity of C. albicans ATCC 90028 was also assayed in a 96-well plate with three replicates. C.

## Discussion
The ability of amphotericin B to bind a wide range of substrates and to exert a broad range of activities was proportional to the extent of inhibitio. The results presented here add another dimension to the therapeutic armamentarium of echinocandin.

The response of Cryptococcus neoformans to an inhibitor treatment, and to the extent of inhibition, depended on the degree of inhibition. The magnitude of inhibition was inversely proportional to the degree of inhibition. This may be a consequence of the amount of inhibitors administered. In our experiments, a dose of 100 mg/kg of C. neoformans could be administered orally. This dose was chosen to cover the initial (10 mg/kg) dose. An inhibitory effect of 100 mg/kg of C. neoformans to P. gingivalis was observed in our experiments. This was in contrast to previous studies which showed a negative effect of P. gingivalis in the treatment of Cryptococcus infection (8). This suggests that this drug may have a therapeutic value, which may be especially important in patients with disseminated infection.

It is well known that in vitro activities of antifungal agents can be induced by the presence of toxic compounds such as metabolites (34). In this study, the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against the Cryptococcus neoformans strain H99 was strongly proportional to the degree of inhibition. The antifungal activity was inversely proportional to the degree of inhibition. This may be a consequence of the toxic effect of the drug. Our findings have also shown that in vitro activities of amphotericin B are proportional to the degree of inhibition.

The significant difference in the antifungal activity between the levels of amphotericin B and the antifungal drugs was caused by differences in the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a key enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in fungi. The cell wall biosynthesis pathway of fungal pathogens is the major pathway of ergosterol biosynthesis (35). The cell wall of fungal species includes a complex of ß-1,3-linked mannans, which are the major building blocks of fungal cell walls (36). ß-1,3-linked mannans are considered to be essential for fungal viability and growth in macrophages and in C. albicans (37).
