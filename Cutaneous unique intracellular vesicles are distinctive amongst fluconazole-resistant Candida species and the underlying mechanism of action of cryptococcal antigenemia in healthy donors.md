## Abstract
Culture-based identification methods are essential for the accurate diagnosis of cryptococcosis. The fungal smear examination is dependent on the wavelength of the light and requires additional tools with respect to diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and the specificities of the detectiones of different types of cryptococcosis smear samples. Slight heterogeneity was detected in the ITS2 regions among 483 smear samples obtained from patients with cryptococcosis and 738 samples obtained from healthy donors. The variation in the ITS2 region among donor samples was statistically significant. The susceptibility of the fungal smear examination to the antifungal drugs flucytosine and amphotericin B was significantly higher among donor samples (P < 0.001). The results of this study indicate the utility of a culture-dependent approach for the diagnosis of cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
Dendritic cells (DCs) are members of the immune system of the body, being members of the blood-tissue interface the “second layer” (1-4). These cells are recruited by multiple mechanisms, such as through cytokine production, chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules, to the site of infection (5). The importance of DCs as pathogenic cells in innate immunity to infection has been demonstrated (6). In the context of immune activation, it has been shown that DCs are members of the thymus, which have a unique function to detect pathogens, and to sense their own self-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs) (7, 8). In this context, DCs are categorized into seven classes of receptors and five types of receptors: the complement receptor, Fc<U+03B3>RI, interferon (IFN)-<U+03B3>, chemokine receptor (CCR)-1, CCR2, CCR4, and CCR5 (9-13). In contrast, other cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are specialized phagocytic cells that serve as effector cells, and are recruited to the site of infection (14, 15). In the context of infection, DCs are also activated by diverse mechanisms, including signaling pathways, toll-like receptors, caspase-1 and caspase-9-mediated signaling pathways, and immunoreceptor-mediated signaling pathways (16-18).

Over the past decades, several studies have demonstrated the importance of DCs in various processes, including phagocytosis, killing, inflammation, and promotion of phagocytosis and inflammatory responses.


## Methods
In a recent study, a group of patients with Cryptococcus neoformans (. neoformans) were enrolled and two patients (SAIDISSAIDISSAIDISSAIDIS) with typical clinical features of cryptococcal meningitis were enrolled. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to enrolment. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, which approved the protocol for the use of CSF for human studies (E-CEP-001/11-01/2016). The patient was identified as SPL2, and the CSF sample was collected within 6 h of admission. CSF samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5% NP40, 0.2% ß-glycerol, 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.2). Then, the sample was vortexed for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% ß-glycerol, 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.2). Then, the supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.2). The supernatant was discarded and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was stored at -20°C until use.

Lipid Extraction and Purification
The total lipid extraction from lipids was performed according to the method described by Srinivasan et al. (19). The lipids were extracted using a protein extraction kit (eBioscience, Inc., USA).


## Results

.6. Antibody Immunology of C. neoformans+MMV
Antibody-immunotectanily stable RNA-seq analysis was performed on C. neoformans-infected and uninfected mice for all the major clinical manifestations of CNS infection. The majority of the mice were infected by injection of C. neoformans (Table 1). C. neoformans-infected mice showed a trend of increased susceptibility to fluconazole, as evidenced by increased clearance of C. neoformans from the CNS (Figure 3A). In contrast, uninfected mice were found to be more susceptible to fluconazole than C57BL/6 mice (Figure 3B). In addition, C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice showed an increased susceptibility to voriconazole, as evidenced by increased clearance of C. neoformans from the CNS (Figure 3C).

3.7. Effect of Cryptococcal Antibody Resistance on CNS Infection and Brain Inflammatory Cytokine Production
The CNS-infection burden was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4A). The CNS-induced immune response was correlated with the CNS-specific cytokine production. The CNS-induced cytokine production was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4B). The CNS-specific cytokine production was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4C).

3.8. Effect of Cryptococcal Antibody Resistance on Brain Inflammatory Cytokine Production
CNS-induced cytokine production was determined at the cell surface of C. neoformans-infected and uninfected mice. The median CSF TNF-a concentration was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 5A). There was a significant increase in TNF-a production in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 5B). There was a trend of higher TNF-a production in C57BL/6 mice at the cell surface (Figure 5C). There was a significant increase in CSF IL-6 and TNF-a production in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 5D).

## Discussion
 2008.

In contrast to fluconazole-resistant Candida species, the intrinsic VPs are non-ribosomal peptide-rich and have been associated with resistance to fluconazole, and the VPs are fungistatic, antifungal, and VEZs-like (Deng et al., 2004). The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to produce the VPs as a result of a potential adaptation to a novel host environment (Kulkarni et al., 2011).

In this study, we have identified the VPs in C. neoformans, a highly virulent species in humans, mice, and cows (Smed et al., 2014). The presence of these vesicles in C. neoformans is consistent with the high virulence of C. neoformans in humans (Naglik et al., 2009). Similar to C. neoformans, C. neoformans produces two types of VPs: a type I VPs (vEZ1 and vEZ2) and a type II VPs (vEZ3 and vEZ4) (Shen et al., 2014). The identification of the second type of VPs identified in C. neoformans further supports the hypothesis that C. neoformans VPs are present in the human host as well as in other Cryptococcus species, and that the fungus is evolutionarily distinct from C. neoformans. It is possible that the fungus can be identified in C. neoformans and other Cryptococcus species, but not in C. neoformans. The existence of C. neoformans VPs in the human host and C. neoformans, but not C. neoformans in humans, may be due to the different immune status of humans.

C. neoformans is known to produce a number of anti-IFN-<U+03B3> autoantibodies (Naglik et al., 2009). These antibodies are produced by monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils (Fukuyama et al., 2003). While there is evidence that C. neoformans has a unique mode of resistance to anti-IFN-<U+03B3> autoantibodies (Fukuyama et al.
