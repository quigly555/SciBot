## Introduction
Rice blast is a major food problem worldwide, with more than 1 million cases and more than 25,000 thousand deaths per year worldwide [1]. In some areas, like India, there are areas with high rice yield of around 10% and in others, yield is low, thus, rice is imported into these areas as a major feed commodity.


## Methods
The review was also included in the electronic electronic version of the primary electronic review of the same subject in the electronic version of the main revie.

Data management and data management for the electronic edition
The electronic version of the main systematic review was deposited in the Medical Research Archive of Thailand (MRAT) under the study number of MRATN0516. After the availability of the electronic edition, the electronic version of the main report in the electronic edition was lodged in the China Medical Journalists Online (CJJO) at the following online publication address: articleid=PRJEB078.

Nested case definition
Nested case definitions were based on the systematic review of the published literature. Cases were defined according to the current definition of “nested case” in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) [16].

Nested case definition
A nested case definition was established using the definition of “nested case syndrome” of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) [17]. A nested case definition was established using the definition of “nested case” in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) [18].

A nested case definition was established using the definition of “nested case” in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) [23].


## Results
. Biofilm Characteristics
The biofilm formation was characterized by the accumulation of intact biofilm in the mycelial form (Figure 1). The percentage of intact biofilm was higher than that of the biofilm formed by the invasive form of the fungus (Figure 1).


## Discussion
Patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of asthma [5], which may be secondary to chronic diseas. In our setting, patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of smoking [6], which may be secondary to chronic or sustained asthma. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of smoking [6], which may be secondary to chronic or sustained smoking. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6], which may be secondary to chronic or sustained smoking.

In the setting of chronic bronchitis, patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6].

Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. In our setting, patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6].

In the setting of chronic bronchitis, patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6]. Patients with chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease may also have a history of other infectious diseases [6].

Our patient had a history of asthma, which may have contributed to the onset of chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease. We suspect that the patient had a history of smoking. Our patient did not have a history of asthma, which may have contributed to the onset of chronic bronchitis-associated lung disease. We suspect that the patient had a history of other infectious diseases [6].
