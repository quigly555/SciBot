## Abstract

Fungal infections are life-threatening infections with a high frequency and cause by a variety of pathogenic agent. The initiation of infection by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is controlled by different gene transcriptional programs. One of the most important regulatory programs is the transcriptional response to heat shock. The underlying mechanism involves the transcription of differentially expressed genes. Gene expression profiling of Bd identified several genes that are commonly affected by heat shock, and described the effects of this process on gene expression. The regulation of the stress response has been described to be mainly associated with the regulation of the transcriptional response to oxidative damage. The induction of heat shock-induced transcripts, in particular transcripts involved in cell wall synthesis, is, however, controversial and has mainly been reported from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial dye PNA/YPD, and a second XC10 deletion, both of which were associated with severe phenotypes, revealed several potential roles for gene expression. In particular, the expression of several proteins was up-regulated.

The transcriptional response to heat shock differs among fungal pathogens and among healthy host tissues, suggesting that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis may manipulate host responses in a manner that is unique to mammals. Gene expression profiling in Bd revealed that Bd has unique transcriptional responses to different kinds of oxidative stress. The transcriptional response to heat shock is unique in mammals and possibly has an evolutionary significance within the fungal kingdom. The expression of several genes was up-regulated. Gene expression was also distinguishable to other species, particularly other fungal pathogens.

The evolution of gene expression is an event that has to be described in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved in fungal infections. In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional response to heat shock in Bd. We also compared the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and the secondary metabolite secondary respiration. The comparative approach led to the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between the normal and heat shock-induced states. The differential expression results of melanin and secondary metabolite secondary respiration are involved in the host-pathogen interaction and are phenotypically indistinguishable.


## Introduction
Plants have developed various strategies for managing infectious diseases. They can keep the pathogens at bay, or they can they may release them from their bodies by way of dispersal and self-growth [1,2].

Both ways of growing infectious diseases are controlled by infectious agents, which eventually spread to other parts of the body, causing diseases.


## Methods
In the previous study, we studied the effect of RNA polymerase I (rpb I) and miR-144 on fungal invasion in Mice, and the role of cDNA synthesis in Mice Invasio. In this study, we used two different methods, one that includes DNA from Coccidioides and the other that does not. In both methods, DNA was extracted from the two fungi at a concentration of 5 µg/mL using the NucleoSpin Plant II Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and the other one using the Qiagen Plant Genomic DNA Isolation Kit. The RNA polymerase I (rpb I) and miR-144 (rpb I) were used to amplify the cDNA from the DNA extract. The cDNA was extracted using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and the cDNA was then synthesized using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The resulting cDNA was then used for the amplification of the rpb gene in M. citri-micta and M. fructicola. The miR-144 gene was amplified using the CTAB method and the cDNA was amplified using the miR-144 PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The cDNA obtained was then used for the amplification of the gene in M. citri-micta and M. fructicola. For both assays, the PCR products were confirmed by electrophoresis. The MfA and MfB gene sequences were analyzed using the MEGA5 software (version 4.7.1) [38].

Statistics
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparison, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparison. Differences between groups were considered significant at p<0.05. A p-value of less than 0.


## Results
The new gene sequence of . oxysporum FOX1 was recently validated by BLASTx search in GenBank and revealed a novel protein, FOS1, with the FOS1 gene sequence encoding a protein of 835 amino acids. The gene was named FOL1 (GenBank accession number: KJ333287). The new gene sequence of F. oxysporum FOX1 was located in the C. albicans open reading frame (ORF) with the eukaryotic gene pyrG at position 1226 (GenBank accession number: KJ333288). The BLASTx search revealed that FOL1 has the predicted molecular mass of ~44 kDa (GenBank accession number: KJ333289). The sequence of FOL1 was located in the C. albicans open reading frame with the pyrG at position 1228 (GenBank accession number: KJ333288). The BLASTx search revealed that FOL1 has the predicted molecular mass of ~44 kDa (GenBank accession number: KJ333289).

## Discussion
Previous studies have reported that the stress response of host cells is necessary to survive and adapt to the infection, as it plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the fungu. In this study, we have found that C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii have a more complex signaling network that includes the subunits of several protein kinases. These signaling systems are involved in the development of immune responses and protection against infection. However, the precise mechanisms that regulate the development of immune responses are still poorly understood. Here, we showed that C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii have a complex signaling network that includes the subunits of a protein kinase, CpkA, which is a component of the MAP kinase cascade that controls the development of immune response against fungal infections. However, this complex network is different from the other virulence factors and virulence factors, such as mating, cell wall integrity, and growth in the presence of other factors, such as nitrogen or carbon sources, which are required for fungal growth. C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii have a complex signaling network that includes the subunits of a protein kinase, CpkB, which is required for the development of immune response against fungal infections. However, this complex network is different from the other virulence factors and virulence factors, such as mating, cell wall integrity, and growth in the presence of other factors, such as nitrogen or carbon sources, which are required for fungal growth. To gain further insights into the different signaling pathways in C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii, we analyzed the transcriptional and translation level of C. albicans, C. albicans, and Cryptococcus gattii genes in response to fungal infection in mice. We found that C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii have a transcriptional and translational profile that is different from the other virulence factors and virulence factors. Interestingly, C. albicans, C.
