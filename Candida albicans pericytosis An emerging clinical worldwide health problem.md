## Abstract
Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common feature of acute disseminated biliary fistula (FFI) in the setting of advanced HIV. The current evidence indicates that the initial dissemination of AOM may occur in the setting of advanced HIV and may occur in the absence of a known risk factor for the AOM.


## Introduction
Infections caused by fungi are generally more common in people with immunodeficiency, than infections caused by bacteria or viruse. The two pathogens most commonly associated with fungal infections are Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans, both of which can cause infection in healthy individuals, especially if they are immune [13]. The incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically in the past few decades, and the number of infections caused by Cryptococcus has increased by over one-third in the past three decades [14]. This increase is mainly due to the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, solid organ transplants, and cancer, who are at risk of acquiring a fungal infection [15,16]. The yeast-to-hypha transition, a critical step for fungal invasion, is known to play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of fungal infections [17].

Cryptococcosis is caused by the encapsulated basidiomycetous yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans and can be caused by many different species of Cryptococcus. Infection is caused by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells that settle on the skin surface, where they grow and replicate as yeast cells [18]. In healthy individuals, C. neoformans and C. albicans are commensal organisms and harmless to the human host. However, in immunocompromised individuals, C. neoformans can cause life-threatening infections in the immunocompromised host [19].

A number of studies have reported the occurrence of fungal infections in patients with both defective innate and acquired immune systems, such as those with AIDS, solid organ transplant patients, and those receiving chemotherapy [20,21,22,23]. In these patients, cryptococcal infections can be caused by two species of the genus Cryptococcus, namely C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans, which cause cryptococcal pneumonia and meningoencephalitis, respectively. Cryptococcal infections are often associated with immunosuppressed individuals such as those receiving chemotherapy or organ transplantation, patients on immunosuppressive medications, and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy [24].

## Methods
Bacterial strains and media
The C. albicans strain used in this study was C. albicans ATCC 9002 (C. albicans ATCC 90028), which is a clinical isolate from a patient. The C. albicans ATCC 90028 strain is isolated from a patient. It has been shown that C. albicans can produce approximately 80% of the lethal C. albicans-like compounds (8). C. albicans was cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD broth and then 10 times serially diluted in 0.5% (w/v) agarose (HyClone) to obtain the final concentration of 5 × 10^5 CFU/ml. The stock culture was prepared by inoculating a loopful of cells into 500 ml of YPD broth. The number of CFU/ml was determined by plating serial dilutions of the stock culture onto YPD agar plates and incubating at 30°C for up to 72 h. The percentage of viability was determined by plating serial dilutions of the stock culture onto YPD agar plates.

## Results
The most common causes of morbidity and mortality are infection of the skin and other external bodies, and respiratory infectio. As in the case of dermatophytes, the infection of the host can affect the course of disease and cause serious complications, such as skin and urinary tract infections [38,39]. Since the fungal community is the most widely distributed in the tropics, this region is expected to play a major role in the eradication of this fungus.

Asparaginitis is caused by the ingestion of small to large amounts of plant material, such as roots, fruits, leaves and leaves of the plant family. Asparaginitis is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of plant material, such as roots, fruits, leaves and leaves of the plant family, which can be easily absorbed by the host [40]. Asparaginitis affects many plant species in tropical regions, such as Botrytis cinerea, Rhodotorula spp., Fusarium spp., Geotrichum spp., and Candida spp., although it does not cause systemic infection. Asparaginitis can also affect non-wood-degrading members of the plant family, such as Fusarium spp., Geotrichum spp., and Geotrichum spp., which are plant pathogens that have not been identified in the current study.

The presence of Aspergillus spp., which are also members of the plant family, is known to affect the pathogenicity of Fusarium spp. In addition, Aspergillus spp. are considered as pathogenic fungi due to their ability to grow and multiply in human skin and produce an inflammatory response, which leads to skin and blood uveitis and systemic infection [41]. Aspergillus spp. can also cause dermatophytosis in humans and other mammals, and can also produce antifungal compounds that may cause disease in humans [42].

In this study, the current study results showed that the fungal community was highly diverse in the tropical regions, and the other three regions, except the tropical regions, were poorly represented. The genera Aspergillus, Trichosporon, Wallemia, and Cryptococcus are described as Fusarium spp. in this study, but they were not described in the present study.


## Discussion
The spread of Candida sp. in health care settings has been well documented. The rise in the prevalence of Candida spp. in medical centers has provided opportunities for the development of new drugs and vaccines [8].

The present study is the first to report the incidence of candidemia among HIV-infected adults in Denmark. We observed a significant increase in the prevalence of candidemia in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count of 150 cells/µL. The highest prevalence was observed in the HIV-infected population, which was more than double the rate observed in the HIV-uninfected population [9]. In addition, the proportion of Candida spp. in HIV-infected individuals has been observed in other studies [10, 11]. In this study, the prevalence of candidemia was reported to be 4.6%, which was similar to the prevalence of candidiasis in the other studies.

The prevalence of candidemia among HIV-infected patients in Denmark has increased over the past few years. The rate of candidemia in HIV-infected patients in Denmark was reported to be 10% in 1999-2002, and 8.7% in 2004-2005 [12]. In the past few years, the incidence of candidemia has been reported to be declining [13]. In Denmark, the prevalence of candidemia was reported to be 11.9%, which was comparable to the findings in other studies.

The incidence of candidemia has been significantly increasing over the last few years. A significant increase in the incidence of candidemia has been observed in HIV-infected patients. A small number of cases of candidemia have been reported in the past few years. This may be due to the fact that HIV infection is known to affect the gut [14]. The occurrence of candidemia has been reported to be 2.4% in HIV-uninfected patients [15]. Our findings are in agreement with the previous report of a moderate number of cases of candidemia reported in patients with HIV infection [16].

The incidence of candidemia among HIV-infected patients is significantly higher than those of HIV-uninfected patients. A similar increase in the incidence of candidemia has been reported in other studies [5, 6]. The results of the present study indicated that the most common cause of candidemia among HIV-infected patients was oral candidiasis.
