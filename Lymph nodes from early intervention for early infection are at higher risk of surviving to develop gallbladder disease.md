## Abstract
The monotypic genus Leishmania (Pisumnomyces, Pisum), based on P. cruzi, is the etiological agent of the tropical disease Madurella, a member of the order Paracoccidioides, with a worldwide distribution. Little is known about the genetic structure and evolution of Leishmania. In this study, we isolated single loci from a single strain of Leishmania. Whole genome comparative analysis revealed that they are divergently nested within a sister clade, and that they are likely sister to one another. Analysis of the mating type (MAT) region revealed that two of the loci are in different genetic clusters. Analysis of the mating type-complex (MAT1-1-1) and the mating type-complex-1 (MAT1-1-1) revealed that the mating type is expressed in this clade. Homologous recombination in the mating locus from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis generated a strain MAT1-1-1 that is sister to a previously identified paracoccidioidomycete species, but not to any other known paracoccidioidomycete species. However, it is not sister to any other closely related species. Finally, the recombination between MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-2-1 indicates that Leishmania may have lost out of control virulence factor(s) that it acquired. These results establish that Leishmania is a genetically tractable and genetic determinant factor that exerts wild type virulence in this pathogenic fungus.


## Introduction
Thus, early treatment for early infection is crucia.

The current evidence regarding the role of the liver in mediating gallbladder disease is limited. In rodent models, gallbladder fibrosis is predominantly mediated by the phospholipase C cascade, and has been associated with several inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), IBD, and gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), irritable bowel syndrome (OS), and irritable bowel syndrome (ICS).


## Methods
Therefore, the early intervention program should be implemented in a multi-level desig.

In the design of the program, we want to ensure that in order to achieve the best possible outcome for the patients, the patients' overall health and well-being should be improved. Our goal is to achieve a range of health outcomes, from the best to the worst, from the worst to the best, from the best to the best, from the worst to the best, from the best to the worst to the best, from the worst to the best to the best.

The outcome should be assessed by a central objective of the study: to determine the outcome of the disease (health outcomes) in the individual (as well as in the community) and the community (as well as in the community).


## Results
In the absence of early intervention, the risk of developing GBS is decreased at a more early stage of GB.

During early intervention, the risk of developing GBS increases after relapse, which is not associated with the use of corticosteroids. At the time of early relapse, relapse-induced GBS in patients receiving corticosteroids is reduced, but not before. After relapse, the risk of developing GBS is decreased at a more early stage of GBS. At the time of relapse, relapse-induced GBS are reduced and there is a reduction in the risk of developing GBS.

At the time of early relapse, patients with early intervention are significantly younger than those without early intervention. During early intervention, the risk of developing GBS is reduced compared to the risk of developing GBS at a more early stage of GBS.

At the time of relapse, there is a significantly reduced risk of developing GBS at a more early stage of GBS. During early intervention, the risk of developing GBS is increased at a more early stage of GBS.

As with the risk of developing GBS, there is a reduction in the risk of developing GBS at a more early stage of GBS.

In the absence of early intervention, the risk of developing GBS is reduced compared to the risk of developing GBS at a more early stage of GBS.

In the absence of early intervention, the risk of developing GBS is increased compared to the risk of developing GBS at a more early stage of GBS.


## Discussion
In our study, we compared the virulence of C. neoformans and C. gattii in the murine host. We found that C. gattii infection significantly increased the susceptibility to C. neoformans infection and that C. neoformans increased the susceptibility to C. gattii infection. Our data suggest that C. gattii infection increases the susceptibility to C. neoformans infection. The data also showed that the cryptococcal strain used in our study is a C. gattii strain, while C. neoformans strain is a strain from the same species from which C. gattii strains were isolated. The main difference between C. gattii and C. neoformans is that C. gattii strains are resistant to fluconazole, but fluconazole-resistant C. gattii strains are still uncommon [46].

The results of our previous study on C. gattii isolates from animals showed that the percentage of C. gattii isolates was much higher than that of C. neoformans strains [6]. This is in agreement with our previous data that showed that C. gattii is the second most common C. neoformans strain after C. neoformans [6]. However, in our previous study, C. gattii was more prevalent in animals and animals infected with C. neoformans strains [6].

In our study, C. gattii strains were isolated more frequently from animals. C. gattii strains were not isolated from animals. This could be related to the fact that C. gattii strain is not only commonly isolated from animals, but also from animal guts. As a result, C. gattii strains could be isolated more frequently from animal.

The results from our previous study showed that the percentage of C. gattii strains isolated from animals was much higher than that of C. neoformans strains. This could be related to the fact that C.
