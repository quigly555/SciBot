## Abstract
Fungal biofilm is one of the main structures in which different compartments are of significant composition. Characterization of fungal biofilm is commonly performed using a variety of conventional stains, such as Agar, Petri and Ziehl-Neelsen, but the underlying principles are not well defined. Here, we describe the development of an effective technique for the detection of filamentous fungi using an ISHAM-based protocol. A total of 393 matrices were used for the initial design and characterization of fungal biofilms.


## Introduction
Intracranial complications of the central nervous system (CNS) can be caused by a wide spectrum of factors, including fungal infection, immune compromise, injury, infection with intracellular parasites and immune dysfunction, etc.1-3 Neurological and other neurological complications are commonly caused by infection with intracellular parasites (e.g., Mycoplasma spp., Paracoccidioides spp., Histoplasma spp., Toxoplasma gondii) and immune compromise (e.g., toxoplasmosis, retinitis, and encephalitis).1-3 The spectrum of CNS manifestations is much greater in the first few days than in the following days, but the rate of CNS involvement decreases gradually.1,2 Similar patterns of patterns can be observed in the animal model.1,2 Another advantage of animal models is that they allow for studying the pathophysiology of each type of CNS injury, and their management.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and outcome of CNS injury in the patients infected with P. brasiliensis. We took into account the pathological characteristics of the patients and their immune status.


## Methods
coli and its effect on the pathogen, the nematode . albicans was used. The nematode species were grown in a slant shaker (60 rpm) for 4 days at 37°C in potato dextrose broth (PDB) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and then re-grown in 10% PDB at 37°C for 3 days. The nematodes were then added to a 7.5 × 1.5 cm Petri dish containing 10 ml of PDB. The dish was covered with sterile double layer of Miracloth (HyClone, Germany) and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The nematodes were then re-grown on PDB slants at 37°C for 3 days and, finally, to test the antagonistic effect of root bark of black gram on the nematode pathogen, a 6.5 × 1.5 cm Petri dish containing 10 ml of PDB was used.

The mycelial and sporangia of C. albicans were obtained from the mycelium of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) and the sporangia of C. albicans (ATCC 15803) at 37°C in 5% PDB. The mycelia were washed with sterile water and re-suspended in 10 ml of sterile water and then transferred to the PDB plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 days and, finally, to test the antagonistic effect of root bark of black gram on the pathogen, a 6.5 × 1.5 cm Petri dish containing 10 ml of PDB was used.

The antimicrobial activity of root bark of black gram on C. albicans was determined by adding a solution of 0.5% (w/v) (w/w) chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 0.


## Results
pneumoniae and . subtilis, the Gram-negative bacteria (B. subtilis and B. subtilis) of rice, which are mainly used as food supplements [34]. Root bark of black gram showed excellent antibacterial activity against all bacterial and fungal strains tested (Table 4). Root bark of black gram (30.7% relative inhibition) was more effective against B. subtilis (19.4% relative inhibition) than against B. subtilis (12.8% relative inhibition).

3.2. Effect of Root Bark on Macrophage Infection
The results of the MIC values of root bark against B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis were compared using the disk diffusion assay. Root bark of black gram (25.6%) showed the MIC_50 value of 25 µg/mL and MIC_50 value of 5 µg/mL for B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, respectively. The MIC_50 value of root bark against B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis was 12.7 µg/mL and 12.8 µg/mL for B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, respectively. In contrast, root bark of black gram (25.6%) showed the MIC_50 value of 25 µg/mL and MIC_50 value of 5 µg/mL for B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, respectively. The MIC_50 value of root bark against B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis was 0.64 µg/mL and 0.15 µg/mL for B. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, respectively.

3.3. Effect of Root Bark on the G. mellonella Growth Phenotype and the Invasion of the P. aeruginosa Growth Phenotype by P. aeruginosa

P. aeruginosa growth phenotype was evaluated by the growth of the G. mellonella growth phenotype in the presence of root bark of black gram (30.7% relative inhibition) and root bark of black gram (25.6%) (Figure 5). The growth of the G. mellonella growth phenotype was not affected by root bark of black gram (24.8% relative inhibition) and the growth of the G.


## Discussion
 2006) and by Lactobacillus fumigatus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Wang et a., 2015). This is the first report of antimicrobial activity of root bark of the black gram. This species has been previously reported to be highly effective against S. aureus, a member of the Mycoplasma species complex (Bachrati et al., 2014).

The results of the in vitro and in vivo studies in this study show that the antimicrobial activity of root bark bark of the black gram has significant effect on the pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the root bark of the black gram is highly effective against the pathogenic bacteria. This result is similar to the results of a previous study of the effect of root bark and root bark extracts on Salmonella cell growth and growth in liquid media (Oberwinkler et al., 2018). The results showed that the root bark of the black gram is highly active against Salmonella. The results showed that the root bark extracts of black gram showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. This result is in accordance with the results of a previous study showing that root bark extracts of Eucalyptus spp. showed significant activity against S. aureus (Brockow et al., 2017).

The antimicrobial activity of root bark extract against the pathogenic bacteria of fungi is also similar to the results of a study conducted by Singh and Parameshwar (2015). This study showed that the root bark extract of Eucalyptus spp. is an effective antibiotic against the pathogenic fungi. This study showed that the root bark extracts of Eucalyptus spp. were highly active against the pathogenic fungi. The results showed that the root bark extracts of Eucalyptus spp. were highly active against the pathogenic fungi.

The results of the in vitro studies showed that the antimicrobial activity of root bark extracts of black gram (H. gramminis) and root bark extract (P. abietina) was significantly more than that of the extract of the extract of E. coli. This result is in accordance with the results of a previous study in which the antimicrobial activity of root bark of E. coli was strongly demonstrated against the pathogenic fungi (Kröger et al., 2011).
