## Abstract
•The fungal cell employs morphogenesis-related signaling pathways to protect cell. •The cell employs the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway to protect against danger signals. •The cell employs the conserved K+-K+TIR/signal transduction pathway to protect cells.

The pathogenic yeast Candida auris responds to environmental cues.

The fungal cell employs morphogenesis-related signaling pathways to protect cells.

The cell employs the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway to protect against danger signals.

The cell employs the conserved K+-K+TIR/signal transduction pathway to protect against danger signals.

The cell employs the conserved K+-K+TIR/signal transduction pathway to protect cells.

Our previous studies have shown that the K+-K+TIR/signal transduction pathway protects cells against C. auris infection. Here, we investigate whether the cell employs this pathway in pathogenic C. auris, a major fungal pathogen of humans, to survive.


## Introduction
The course of this malignant form of Conservaporthe is still unclear, and it is also unclear if it may progress to a systemic presentation following the use of a variety of antifungal agent. Although the authors report no evidence of systemic fungal involvement in this presentation, the MRI findings in this presentation may indicate an involvement of some sort in the process of Conservaporthe. In addition, the authors report no case of systemic, toxicologic or neuropathologic toxicologic features in this presentation. It is unclear if the MRI findings in this presentation are a result of systemic, toxicologic or neuropathologic features. The authors should point out the possibility of the intracranial pressure being a possible complication in this presentation, which would be critical in the subsequent interpretation of this presentation.

The authors should point out the possibility of a definitive diagnosis of systemic or toxicologic features in this presentation, which would preclude the use of antifungal agents. If the definitive diagnosis is confirmed, the authors should discuss revising their manuscript to reflect the results of a biopsy and/or the results of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study.

The manuscript needs to:

1. Consider the possibility of a definitive diagnosis of systemic or toxicologic features in this presentation, which would preclude the use of antifungal agents. If the definitive diagnosis is confirmed, the authors should discuss revising their manuscript to reflect the results of a biopsy and/or the results of a MRI study.

## Methods
Field samples and chemicals
The fields in the Cameroonian Region of eastern Rantôm (40°5'19.4” N, 23°49'13.1” E) were sampled from February 2017 to April 2018. The field treatments were in accordance with the Cameroonian Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) regulations and the Cameroonian Ministry of the Environment and Forests (MoELF). For field samples, the chemical composition was as follows: acetic acid 0.03% (solvent A: water:0.04% water:0.02% acetic acid:0.02% solvent B: water:0.02% acetic acid:0.02% solvent C: water:0.02% solvent D: water:0.02% solvent E: water:0.02% solvent F: water:0.02% solvent G: water:0.02% solvent H:0.02% solvent I: water:0.02% solvent J:0.02% solvent N:0.02% solvent N:0.02% solvent S: water:0.02% solvent T: water:0.02% solvent V: water:0.02% solvent W: water:0.02% solvent X: water:0.02% solvent Y: water:0.02% solvent Z: water:0.


## Results

We next sought to elucidate the role of the ferric reductase in the rapid growth of . albicans. The reductase is known to be crucial for the rapid growth of filamentous fungi [12], and the low-complexity state of the reductase (0.5-2.5 × MIC) strongly supports its role in the rapid growth of C. albicans. Moreover, the reductase activity in C. albicans was very low. In contrast, the C. albicans mutant with reductase activity <0.5 × MIC showed significant growth retardation (Figure 5, panel B), indicating that the reductase activity in C. albicans is low.

The hypothesis that C. albicans is defective in its ability to grow in high-molecular-weight medium (HMM) was tested in a different C. albicans strain, the wild type (WT), and the C. albicans complementation strain, C. albicans ATCC18694. In addition, we examined the growth of the C. albicans mutant at a concentration of 0.5 × MIC in the presence of the three known inhibitors, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), and aminoglycoside (Aß) (Figure 5, panel C). As shown in Figure 5, the C. albicans mutant exhibited robust growth, albeit at a lower concentration, in the presence of SDS, 5-FC, and Aß. In contrast, the C. albicans mutant with no reductase activity demonstrated poor growth in the presence of these three inhibitors, showing that the reductase activity is low (Figure 5, panel C).

The lack of growth in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate or 5-FC may have caused the inability of the C. albicans mutant to assimilate the nutrients in the medium, which was also seen in the presence of the three known inhibitors, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5-FC, and aminoglycoside (Aß). Thus, the ability of C.


## Discussion
The clinical course is characterized by the presence of multiple and variable abnormalities in blood and sphincter, and is associated with an increase in ibrutin-dependent inflammatory respons. Patients can have a vasculopathy associated with impaired perfusion or with impaired intracellular vesicle trafficking. In our patient, the differential diagnosis was a mild cerebral abscess. We did not find any evidence of neuropathies in the neuropathology report or MRI. Thus, we consider this a rare presentation of a mild vasculopathic syndrome with a low volume of blood that can result in the development of a diffuse infarction.

There is a growing literature showing that infectious etiologies, such as tuberculosis and C. neoformans, the patients with an infectious etiology have a high rate of disability and cognitive impairment [1], [2], [6]. The patient described here is a pediatrician with a long history of severe renal failure, which led to a rapid and severe hemodynamic instability. The patient developed severe hemolytic anemia and decreased metabolism, and a persistent high level of CO_2. This finding was consistent with the patient with severe vasculopathy. The patient with cerebral abscess had no history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses. The patient with cerebral abscess developed an immune-suppressive syndrome. This is in contrast to the patient with cerebral abscess, which is a mild, normal and noninflammatory vasculopathy [6]. The patient with cerebral abscess developed a mild hemolytic anemia and a high level of CO_2. This finding was in contrast to the patient with cerebral abscess, which is a mild, normal and noninflammatory vasculopathy [6].

The patient with cerebral abscess developed a mild hemolytic anemia and low metabolism, and a persistent high level of CO_2. This finding was consistent with the patient with cerebral abscess, which is a mild, normal and noninflammatory vasculopathy [6].

The patient with cerebral abscess developed a mild hemolytic anemia and low metabolism, and a persistent high level of CO_2. This finding was similar to the patient with cerebral abscess, which is a mild, normal and noninflammatory vasculopathy [6].

The patient with cerebral abscess developed a mild hemolytic anemia and low metabolism, and a persistent high level of CO_2.
