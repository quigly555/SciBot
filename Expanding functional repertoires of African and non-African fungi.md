## Abstract
In the microenvironment, fungal growth, nutrient utilization, and the evolution of virulence are governed by the balance between the host and fungi. Host defense responses to fungal infection depend on the ability of the fungi to withstand and overcome the immune response. Fungal virulence, in the context of host immunity, can be viewed in the context of the capacity of the fungus to cause disease. A key aspect of this response is the ability of the fungus to use both innate and adaptive immunity to its advantage. In contrast, fungal attack requires both innate and adaptive immunity to counteract the host attack. This review focuses on the perception of fungal virulence and the contribution of innate and adaptive immunity to control the outcome of infection when the host immune response is insufficient.


## Introduction
For example, the evolution of the phylogenetic trees is striking because the estimated frequency of a given species being associated with a given species is a function of its abundance and diversit. Most African and non-African fungi are estimated to have a much higher number of species, based on data obtained from the fossil records of the fossil records of only five species: T. asteroides, T. asteroides, T. asteroides, T. gambiae, and T. equinum (Chakraborty and Chaudhary, 2016). The number of black fungi with phylogenetic evidence for more than one species is expected to rise substantially, possibly to over one million by the end of the 2040’s, and the number of black fungi with a single species being predicted to rise to approximately 70% of the total (Chakraborty and Chaudhary, 2016). The term ‘black fungi’ has been used in the past to describe a broad category of fungi with numerous species, with which many African and non-African fungi are related but with different morphologies. The term ‘black fungi’ can be applied to any fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus and can include members of the genus Cladophialophora, Aspergillus niger, C. neoformans, and C. gattii (C. neoformans) (Mitchell and Perfect, 2012). In addition, it was used to describe black yeasts with a wide phylogenetic distribution, such as C. neoformans, C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans, C. dehoogii, C. bacillisporus, and C. tetragattii (C. tetragattii) (Crous et al., 2015; Jeffery et al., 2016). Although the number of known species in the genus Aspergillus is relatively small, it is estimated that there are approximately 300 species in this genus (Jeffery et al., 2016).

In this study, we used the phylogenetic tree and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis to investigate the phylogenetic diversity of the African and non-African fungi. For this purpose, we compared the phylogenetic tree to the one from GenBank and the one from GenBank of India, and the MLST analysis was performed using the draft data.


## Methods
Strain and growth conditions
E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (serotype A, VGIIa, strain H99a, strain URA5) was used as the host strain for gene manipulation, as well as for gene-specific amplification. The E. coli strain was cultured in YPD medium at 30°C for 24 h, and then used as a growth control for each strain.

Cells
The C. albicans SC5314 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).


## Results
This expansion of fungi, of which multiple fungal species are available, is supported by the higher rate of African-derived fungal genera than those of non-African fungi, which are diverse in terms of their diversity of fungi and abundance of plant microorganisms (24. This expansion is also supported by the lower number of species associated with the African fungi, as shown by the fact that the number of genera found in the African fungi is higher than those in non-Africans. Overall, our data suggest that the diversity of African and non-African fungi is greater than that of the non-Africans.

Fungal Diversity in the Fungal Community
Among the more abundant genera, the fungal community of the three-dimensional (3D) and 16-spore-shaped (16S) surfaces (Fig 1B) was dominated by Ascomycota, which is dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively. Ascomycota were consistently detected in all three-dimensional surfaces of both surfaces. The Basidiomycota were frequently found in all three-dimensional surfaces, as were Basidiomycota in all surfaces except for the 16S surface, which was only observed in the 16S surface. Ascomycota were found in the 1D surface, and the 16S surface was detected in all three-dimensional surfaces. Basidiomycota were found in all surface samples. Basidiomycota were found in all surfaces except the 16S surface, which was only observed in the 16S surface. These results suggest that Basidiomycota were more abundant in the non-Africa surface than the African surface. The Basidiomycota were found in all surface samples, but only in the 16S surface.

Fungal Community in the Fungal Community
The fungal community of the Fungal community was dominated by Ascomycota, but Basidiomycota were commonly found in both surfaces. Ascomycota were found in all surface samples, and the Basidiomycota were frequently found in all surfaces except for the 16S surface, which was only observed in the 16S surface. Basidiomycota were found in all surfaces except the 16S surface, which was only observed in the 16S surface.


## Discussion

In addition to the small number of members from different taxonomic groups, our study showed that different fungal taxa of the same species and/or different geographical locations within Africa and the USA were represented by several members with different functional repertoire. We observed that the repertoires of N. fischeri and N. castaneum were significantly different from each other (Fig 3B), suggesting that fungal taxon distribution within the USA may be similar to that in Africa.

Different fungal taxa of the same geographical region were represented by members of the same functional repertoires. However, the majority of members from the USA were represented by members of the genus Cryptococcus (Table 1). This group includes members of the genus Cryptococcus that have been reported to be involved in several fungal infections, such as Cryptococcus gattii, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Cryptococcus laurentii (Parsa et al. 2012). Members of this genus also have been reported to be involved in multiple fungal infections, such as Blastomyces dermatidis, Blastomyces capsuligenus, Blastomyces atrovirens, and Blastomyces hansenii (Parsa et al. 2012). Although some members of this genus are characterized by the presence of two-spored sexual structures, as well as by the presence of three-dimensional structures (Fig 3A), they are less commonly found in the USA (i.e., Amylosporum myriocarpum, Amylosporum graminis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) (Parsa et al. 2012). However, Amylosporum myriocarpum, Amylosporum graminis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are also associated with many fungal infections (Parsa et al. 2012).

Members of the Cryptococcus species complex have been reported to be involved in several fungal infections, including Cryptococcus gattii, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Cryptococcus neoformans (Parsa et al. 2012).
