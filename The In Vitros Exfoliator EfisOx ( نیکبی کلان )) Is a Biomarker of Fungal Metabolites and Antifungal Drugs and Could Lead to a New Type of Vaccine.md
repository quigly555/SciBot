## Abstract
The frequency of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has been rising since the 1990s, and new pathogens are emerging, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cryptococcus gattii is considered to be the leading pathogen causing life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of IFIs in a limited number of patients and to determine the characteristics of IFIs. A matched case-control study was conducted at the University Hospital, Cancria.

A total of 225 patients (78.3% women and 72.3% men) were included. The mean age was 52.1 years, the mean was 57.5 years, and the mean haemoglobin was 21.8 g/dl. The mean time to disease was 14.1 years. The median time on antifungal therapy was 218 days on treatment, and the median fraction of resistance to first-line combination antifungals was 2.9%. The median survival was 72.3% after four and 96.9% after 12 months of therapy, for an IFIs prevalence of 3.3%. The median antifungal resistance rate to fluconazole was 70% for C. gattii, 4.2% for C. neoformans, 11.1% for P. aeruginosa, 12.0% for C. neoformans, and 3.9% for other non-neoformans species.

We found that the majority of the patients on antifungal therapy had IFIs, and a majority (67.8%) received multiple triazoles, including voriconazole. IFIs are common in the cryptococcosis group, and a majority (90.9%) were observed before immunosuppressive therapies were initiated. The majority of patients (87.4%) had underlying immunosuppressions. The majority of the patients (87.4%) had underlying immunosuppressive medications. All patients (39%) had underlying immunosuppressions, and the majority of the patients (11.1%) had an underlying immunosuppressiveness. The majority of patients (8.2%) had underlying immunosuppressions.


## Introduction
A 28-year-old Iranian male patient was initially diagnosed with a chronic respiratory illness. A review of available literature revealed that he had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) a.k.A.


## Methods
It was approved by the ethical committee for research into veterinary medicine in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Al-Azhar University (N. 005-2).

In order to evaluate the efficacy of this new tool, the pharmacokinetics of FLC against the central nervous system, we performed several studies with rats (2) and mice (3) and confirmed the efficacy of this tool by quantitative and qualitative studies. A single-point microdilution method was used to determine the effect of FLC on the central nervous system and therefore we validated the efficacy of this method with three independent animal models.


## Results
The in vitro growth of the . tuberculosis strains is shown in Figure 6, which shows the inhibition of bacterial growth by the vaccine EfisOx. In order to determine the role of EfisOx in this study, we tested the effect of EfisOx on the expression of some of the most important genes of fungal metabolism. The analysis of the transcriptional data indicated that EfisOx increased the expression of the most important genes of fungal metabolism in M. tuberculosis (Figure 6). This suggested that EfisOx could inhibit fungal growth in a manner that is similar to the in vitro in vivo vaccine.

In order to further validate the in vitro efficacy of EfisOx, we tested its in vivo efficacy against M. tuberculosis by in vitro growth of the M. tuberculosis strains. The in vitro growth of the M. tuberculosis strains was tested for aflatoxin activity by using a vaccine EfisOx. The results showed that the in vitro growth of the M. tuberculosis strains was inhibited by EfisOx (Figure 7). This was in contrast with the in vivo efficacy of EfisOx, in which the EfisOx concentration in the vaccine was determined to be 10 µM.

M. tuberculosis MbPbCherryp_4

In order to confirm the in vitro efficacy of EfisOx in M. tuberculosis, we used the M. tuberculosis strains MbPbCherryp_4, MbPbCherryp_5, and MbPbCherryp_6. The growth of the M. tuberculosis strains was tested for in vitro growth of EfisOx and EfisPbPbCherryp_4 and EfisPbCherryp_5 strains, respectively. The results showed that the in vitro growth of the M. tuberculosis strains was inhibited by EfisOx (Figure 8). This suggested that EfisOx could exert a synergistic effect on MbPbCherryp_4 and MbPbCherryp_5, which could cause their in vivo efficacy.

## Discussion
 2017.

In our study, in combination with the previous study (in bold) with the new EfisOx antibody sequence, we showed that the EfisOx gene plays an important role in the resistance of Fusarium to azole antifungal drugs (including azole-based regimens). This is the first report that a novel novel EfisOx-based vaccine can be designed to treat fungal disease in immunocompetent individuals.
