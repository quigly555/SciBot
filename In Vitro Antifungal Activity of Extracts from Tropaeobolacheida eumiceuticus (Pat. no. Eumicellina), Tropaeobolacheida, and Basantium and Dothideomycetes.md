## Abstract
In vitro studies with recombinant human leukocyte antigen (HLA-R) in vitro showed that recombinant human LL-37 is the most efficient antigenic delivery vehicle in mice with human leukocyte antigen (HLA-R).


## Introduction
A set of genes that were uniquely identified as having an influence on the morphology of the tibia are E.g., TRF1 and TRF2, respectively. The mechanisms that regulate their expression are largely unknown. Although the majority of the genes have homology, some have an enhancer-like or -like (EL) domain, while others lack this domain [1]. The elm/leakage-like domain (ELMD) proteins (ElMe and ElMe-like) are abundant in vertebrates but absent in invertebrates and the invertebrate homologues are not well characterized [2,3]. ElMe and ElMe-like E.meuropeins (Eme1 and ElMe-like E.meuron 1) are found ubiquitously in a wide range of tissues, including the skin, heart, lungs, brain, and other organs. They have been implicated in multiple biological processes, such as immune response, wound healing, wound repair, and immunopathogenesis [3,4,5].

ElMe and ElMe-like E.meuron 1 have been identified in the skin and in the brain of humans and are implicated in the inflammatory response [6,7,8,9,10]. ElMe-like E.meuropeins have been shown to be important for wound repair and invasive growth in mice [9,11,12,13]. ElMe-like E.


## Methods
paten. Mycelia from the mycelia of P. patens were collected in a greenhouse (Table 1) and ground using a mortar and pestle and the extracts were extracted with 0.1% Tween 80 (30 min). The extracted fraction was partitioned into three sub-components, using sterile water as a mobile phase and the solvent system used was acetone/water (30 min). The second partition was carried out by the addition of methanol/acetic acid (30 min) to a mixture of methanol and acetone (30 min). The extracts were combined and partitioned by 50% acetonitrile (20 min). The solvent system used was acetone/water (30 min). The extract was combined with methanol/acetic acid (30 min) and partitioned by 75% acetonitrile (20 min). The obtained fractions were combined and partitioned by methanol/acetic acid (30 min). The combined fractions were combined and partitioned by 75% acetonitrile (20 min). The combined fractions were combined and partitioned by 75% acetonitrile (20 min). The combined fractions were combined and partitioned by 80% acetonitrile (20 min). The combined fractions were combined and partitioned by 80% acetonitrile (20 min).

Phytochemical Analysis
The hexane fraction from T. rubrum was obtained by crystallization of the hydrolyzed extract from P. patens, using hexane/ethyl acetate/acetone (20:0) as the solvent (50:50) and the resulting solids were evaporated under reduced pressure. The hydrolyzed extract was purified and identified as C-N-hexane using the C-N-hydroxyethylchlorosilane (HMAS) method.

The 3-4-ß-D-glucopyranoside (3-4-ß-D) from the crude extract of P. patens was purified by column chromatography using the Tween 80/hexane column (30:0) as eluent, eluent A/B (0.1:1, 20:0) as eluent B, eluent C/D (0.1:1, 20:0) as eluent E, eluent F/G (0.1:1, 20:0) as eluent H.

## Discussion
Both of these species possess morphological differences and both have an exceptionally thick capsule [12. Tropaeobolacheida has a more mature, thinner, darker-walled and arthroconidia, while Dothideomycetes has a thinner, arthroconidial cell [11]. Dothideomycetes has a thin capsule, but has thick-walled, slightly arthroconidial cell [11]. The Dothideomycetes has an extra capsule and the Dothideomycetes has an extra capsule that is similar to the one of Tropaeobolacheida. Tropaeobolacheida has a thicker capsule and has arthroconidial cell [11]. Both of these species possess capsules that are thick-walled, slightly arthroconidial cell [11].

Dothideomycetes has a thick capsule and has arthroconidial cell [11]. The basidiomycetous Cryptococcus, which is closely related to Dothideomycetes, also possesses a thicker capsule and is similar to Dothideomycetes [11].

Basantium, Dothideomycetes and Dothideomycetes
The basidiomycetous Cryptococcus, which was previously described as a species of Cryptococcus, has been reported as a promising antifungal agent [14]. Cryptococcus, which is closely related to Cryptococcus parainfica, has been reported to possess antifungal activity [15]. Cryptococcus parainfica is one of the most common species of Cryptococcus and has been reported to have antifungal activity [15]. Cryptococcus parainfica is also a rare species of Cryptococcus, which has been reported as a promising antifungal agent [15]. It possesses a more robust capsule and the capsule is similar to that of Cryptococcus parainfica [15]. Cryptococcus parainfica has a slightly larger capsule than that of Cryptococcus neoformans, which is similar to that of Cryptococcus gattii [16]. Cryptococcus parainfica is a species of Cryptococcus that has been reported as promising antifungal agent [16].
