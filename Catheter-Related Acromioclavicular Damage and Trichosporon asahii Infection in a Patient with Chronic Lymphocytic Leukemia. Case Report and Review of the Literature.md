## Abstract
For more than a century, the zoonosis remains a neglected field, due in large part to high mortality and inadequate treatment. Yet, despite efforts, it remains a fact of life threatening infectious diseases. In this study, we have utilized the zoonosis as a platform for drug discovery for the development of novel antimicrobials. The anti-infective activity of curcumin, a plant alkaloid from the Azteca tree, was evaluated in vivo using a murine model of cryptococcosis. Curcumin was active against the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZnN) fungal isolates. The mechanism of action of curcumin was also investigated in the present study. Curcumin was effective against both Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, while Curvularia catenulata was the most effective pathogen against human spirochetes and Eurotiomycetes yeasts. Curcumin was not toxic to mycelial cultures of C. catenulata. Thus, curcumin acts by modifying the host cell response to infection, by affecting the pathogenicity of the parasite, and by altering the T-helper cell function. This work highlights the importance of the host cell response in host defense against a novel zoonosis, one of the most important human infections with a high mortality rate.


## Introduction
The genus Trichosporon, with around 20 species, is characterized by a diverse and finely regulated phytopathological lifestyle, including a fermentation of hydrocarbons, enzymes, and fatty acids, as well as a production of bile salts [1,2,3]. A representative species is currently classified in Trichosporonales, with a phylogenetic position within the order Trichosporonales [4]. Species of Trichosporonales are found worldwide, including tropical, temperate, and subtropical zones, and are capable of producing a wide variety of products, including enzymes, fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, and enzymes with remarkable biotechnological potential [5]. The Trichosporonales are characterized by a yeast-like morphotype, the production of sclerotia, and the production of esters [6,7]. The genus is also divided into several other taxa that produce enzymes, biodegradation enzymes, bile salts, bile acids, siderophores, and other lipid-degrading enzymes, which are distributed throughout the family. Trichosporonales species possess a variety of potential drug-toxin transporters, which play a role in drug resistance [8,9,10].

A major cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients is Trichosporon asahii, the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans [11,12,13,14]. Other species, including Trichosporon acnes, have been reported as being responsible for skin infections in a number of other countries, including Brazil, India, China, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [15,16,17,18]. Although infections are usually caused by species of the genera Trichosporon and Aspergillus, a number of other species have been reported as being associated with other infections, such as Trichosporon acnes, Trichosporon nigrum, Trichosporon moniliforme, and Trichosporon virescens [19,20,21]. A recent study in South Africa identified Trichosporon spp. as the most frequent etiological agent of the most common systemic mycosis, e.g.


## Methods
All of the patients were provided with complete medical record.

Lymphocytes (L) were isolated from blood samples, on venipuncture, and serum samples were collected from these samples by direct venipuncture, and the lymphocytes were lysed by gradient centrifugation. The serum samples were stored at -20°C for further analysis.

The 18-week-old male patient was treated with an intravenous (IV) regimen of E. coli OP50 (sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg, and then with kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg. All patients received amphotericin B (0.125 mg/kg).

In the second patient, a 27-week-old male patient was treated with an intravenous (IV) regimen of 1 mg/kg/day of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg. The patients were divided into two groups, 1-day group and 2-day group. All of the patients were treated with amphotericin B (0.125 mg/kg) and were treated with kanamycin (0.125 mg/kg). The patients were divided into two groups, 1-day group and 2-day group.

A total of 9.0 mL of venipuncture blood was obtained from each of the patients with lymphocytic leukemia. After lysis of the lymphocytes, 1 mL of lysis solution (0.15 M KCl, 0.15 M KOH, 0.15 M sucrose, 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) was added to the lysed lymphocytes. The solution was centrifuged at 5000×g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded.


## Results
Growth characteristics of yeast and filamentous fungal isolates
Yeast and filamentous fungal isolates were isolated from a variety of fungal species and from different hosts (Table 1). Yeast and filamentous fungal isolates were similar to each other in terms of the colony morphology and in terms of growth and conidiation (Figure 1). The most common yeast species were P. aeruginosa and T. reesei. In addition, the most common filamentous fungi were S. cerevisiae and P. chrysogenum. The most common filamentous fungi were A. fumigatus, P. kudriavzevii, and P. fulvum. The most common filamentous fungi were A. niger, P. brasiliensis, P. jirovecii, and S. cerevisiae. The most common filamentous fungi were P. kudriavzevii, P. fischeri, P. brasiliensis, and S. cerevisiae.

Among the fungal isolates, the most common filamentous fungal isolates were P. aeruginosa, P. chrysogenum, and A. niger. The most common filamentous fungi were A. fumigatus, P. brasiliensis, P. kudriavzevii, and S. cerevisiae. The most common filamentous fungi were S. cerevisiae, P.


## Discussion
The patient was a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with CD4 lymphocytopeni. CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare disease in which the immune system is compromised, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the blood [4].

CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare disease in which the immune system is compromised, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the blood [5]. It is also a rare disease in which the immune system is compromised, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the blood [6].
