## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is commonly encountered in patients with hematologic malignancies, most commonly found in patients with hematological malignancies and malignancy who present with interstitial lung disease (ILD). It is very difficult to diagnose this disease under the narrow microscope, because the fungal cells in the lung are polysomally organized and the morphological changes during infection are not obvious. We herein report a case of a 52-year-old man with chief complaints of chest pain, subacute lung metastasis, and intravascular lung involvement that did not respond to treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary cryptococcosis being reported in a chief complaint of chest pain, and we have discussed this with our fellow physicians and hematology providers to find the best treatment of this form of pulmonary cryptococcosis. A final note about frequent site visit information, especially regarding prosthetic devices and devices for intravascular lung involvement is needed.

## Methods
We also provide a detailed description of the model used in this study (Figure 1.

Determination of the immunogenicity of the test drug
The immunogenicity of the test drugs was assessed by using the spleen of the animal model of CNS infections. The spleen of the animal model was obtained from the healthy mouse model. Spleen of the animal model was obtained from the rat model of CNS infections. The spleen of the rat model of CNS infections was obtained from the rabbit model of CNS infections. The spleen of the mouse model of CNS infections was obtained from the human model of CNS infections. The spleen of the mouse model of CNS infections was obtained from the human model of CNS infections.

Measurement of cytokine levels
The level of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a in spleen was determined using a Mouse IL-6 ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytokine levels were measured using a Mouse TNF-a ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The measurement of TNF-a in spleen was performed using a Mouse TNF-a ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IL-6 and TNF-a levels were measured using a Mouse IL-6 ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The levels of IL-8 and TNF-a were determined using a Mouse TNF-a ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The levels of IL-8 and TNF-a in spleen were determined using a Mouse IL-8 ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytokine levels were measured using a Mouse IL-8 ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The levels of TNF-a and IL-8 in spleen were determined using a Mouse TNF-a ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).


## Results
Another very recently described gene-sorter in the brain, DMT1, is required for iron-dependent protein processing in the absence of copper [22. The genome of the new strain is expected to encode for a single copy of DMT1 [11] in the genome. The gene, which encodes for a hypothetical protein of unknown function (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/DMT1), was identified in the genome of a patient with a stroke in the USA [23]. The genome of the new strain is predicted to encode for 1,224 aa of DMT1. Therefore, 1,224 is the smallest DMT1 protein in the genome. The predicted genome sequence of the new strain also encodes for 2,347 aa of DMT1 (Table 2). The genome sequence of the new strain also encodes for 1,750 aa of DMT1.

DMT1 is a sensor of zinc and copper levels in the brain. The genome sequence of the new strain also encodes for 1,296 aa of DMT1 (Table 2). The predicted genome sequence of the strain also encodes for 1,293 aa of DMT1. These results suggest that DMT1 is an integral part of a sensor of zinc and copper levels in the brain.

DMT1 is involved in iron homeostasis
The potential role of DMT1 in zinc homeostasis is discussed below.

Iron-dependent transcriptional activation of DMT1 and Fc<U+03B3>RIIB
The inactivation of the endogenous DMT1 gene, which encodes for a ferredoxin-like iron transporter, led to a marked reduction in the iron levels in the brain [24]. The transcriptional activation of the DMT1 gene in the brain was examined by RT-qPCR (Figure S2). The microarray data (Figure S3) revealed that DMT1 transcript levels were slightly down-regulated in the brain as compared to the control (Figure 2B). The transcript levels of the DMT1 gene in the brain were significantly down-regulated in the new strain as compared to the control (Figure 2B). The iron-dependent transcriptional activation of DMT1 in the brain was investigated by RT-qPCR (Figure S4).


## Discussion
In this study, we showed that in . oryzae, a deletion of the mating-type locus was associated with altered gene expression, in a dose-dependent manner. We also showed that deletion of the mating-type locus reduced the growth of M. oryzae. However, the genes encoding a transporter and a protein kinase were not affected. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that a dual mating-type locus could exist, we were able to provide some support to this hypothesis.

Our results showed that the mating-type locus in the C. albicans pathogenicity gene cluster had a strong effect on the growth and morphology of M. oryzae. These results are consistent with the model that mating-type loci are important for pathogenicity. The C. albicans mating-type locus was also found to be a target for gene silencing in a previous study [39]. The deletion of the mating-type locus in C. albicans is associated with reduced virulence, and the C. albicans mating-type locus is also involved in immune cell activation [40]. The genetic evidence for this in C. albicans is very similar to the previous results. The C. albicans mating-type locus has been deleted in both the B. dermatitidis and S. cerevisiae genomes, and the C. albicans mating-type locus is also involved in immune cell activation [40]. However, the C. albicans mating-type locus is not involved in immunity, and the mating-type locus is not required for pathogenicity of the pathogen [41].

The mating-type locus in the C. neoformans pathogenicity gene cluster was highly regulated. The C. neoformans mating-type locus was only partially functional and required for virulence, but the C. neoformans mating-type locus was also found to be activated in response to stress. This could be because mating-type loci have a strong effect on the transcription of mating-type genes [42]. The C. neoformans mating-type locus has a strong transcriptional response to stress [43]. It was not required for mating-type genes to be expressed, but the cells were found to express their mating-type locus at a high level. This could be because the cell size of C.
