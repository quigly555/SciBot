## Abstract
Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by spores of Bacillariaceae, a member of the family Pezizomycotina. There is currently no treatment for this invasive disease. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the vesicle-mediated delivery of interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) is an essential virulence factor of B. mycoides. However, the delivery of IFN-<U+03B3> in B. mycoides has been rarely reported to cause disease. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to explore the role of IFN-<U+03B3> in virulence and the outcome of infection in mice.

We established a culture medium-independent infection model of B. mycoides in which the levels of IFN-<U+03B3> in the lungs and the mycobiota were measured in vitro. IFN-<U+03B3> was detected in the kidneys of infected mice using immunodiffusion-induced IFN-<U+03B3> or in the kidneys of mice infected with B. mycoides by intravitreal injection. IFN-<U+03B3> treatment of B. mycoides in vitro induced increased lung mycobiota and decreased mycobiota-specific expression of the genes for the mycobiota markers (Protease A, Mucorales, and Arginase 1) and adhesion kinase (Phe-3, and Sknodnazarini). In vivo infection was also induced in mice by intravitreal injection of IFN-<U+03B3> and interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) inactivated the mycobiota in mice depleted with mycobiota-specific IFN-<U+03B3> or IFN-<U+03B3>E in BALB/c mice.


## Introduction
Acinetobacter species are ubiquitous bacteria found in various human and animal tissues, especially in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. The most common sites of exposure are the ears, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. In the case of otitis media, the first step is the colonization of the nasopharynx and the second step is the life cycle of the bacteria. The second step is the process of colonization of the nasopharyngeal tract. The third step is the presentation of the pathogen to the systemic circulation. The presentation of the pathogen to the circulation includes the presentation of the pathogen to the brain, skin, and mucosal organs [1,2]. Acinetobacter species are associated with various diseases such as otitis externa, sinusitis, and infection with human pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The clinical presentation of Acinetobacter species depends on the route of inoculation, the tissue state of the patient, and the individual’s immune status [1,2].

## Results
Polyketides are a diverse group of polyketide-encoding enzymes, which have been used to develop several lipid biosynthetic enzymes [6, 8, 12, 13. Phytopathogenic polyketides are complex, abundant in amount, and composition. Polyketides synthesized by polyketide synthases and polyketide permeases are involved in lipids production and phytohormone biosynthesis. They are also involved in the degradation of monounsaturated fatty acids and in biosynthesis of sterols, which are necessary for maintaining and maintaining the host's lifestyle and immune system [14-16]. Polyketides are expressed in fungal phytopathogens and have been shown to be important in the fungal pathogenicity of the human pathogen C. neoformans [17-19].

Our analysis of the secretomes of F. graminearum revealed a number of well-characterized biosynthetic clusters of polyketides. This included the polyketide permeases (polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, and polyketide permeases), polyketide permeases of the ubiquinone-based multidrug transporter (Ub-MTC), and the polyketide permeases (polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, polyketide permeases, and polyketide permeases) (Figure 2).

The secretome of F. graminearum contains a wide range of polyketide permeases, a number of which have been identified previously in other fungi.


## Discussion
In addition to these fungal polyketides, the cellulose-producing microbes have also demonstrated the capability to produce mannitol and cellulose [60. The ability to produce mannitol is also dependent on the ability of the fungi to degrade mannitol [61], [62]. The fungus Cladosporium fulvum produces mannitol and cellulose [63], [64], [65]. The ability to degrade mannitol is also dependent on the fungi’ ability to produce glucose [65].

In contrast to the ability to produce cellulose, the ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [66]. The ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade glucose [67]. The ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade glucose [68]. The ability to degrade glucose is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [69]. The ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [70]. The fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [71]. The ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [72]. The ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [73]. The fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol is dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [74].

The ability to degrade mannitol was dependent on the fungi’ ability to degrade mannitol [75]. The fungus Cladosporium fulvum uses mannitol as a nitrogen source [76]. The fungus Ustilago maydis, which is a member of the order Lepidoptera, produces mannitol [77]. The fungus Cladosporium fulvum is a member of the order Lepidoptera and produces mannitol [78]. The fungus Fusarium graminearum uses mannitol as a nitrogen source [79]. The fungus Gibberella zeae produces mannitol [80]. The fungus Gibberella amyloliquefaciens produces mannitol [81].
