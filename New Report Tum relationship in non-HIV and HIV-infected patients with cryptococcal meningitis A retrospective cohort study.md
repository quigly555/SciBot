## Abstract
Infections caused by Candida spp. have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. They are usually caused by Candida albicans and/or C. glabrata species, but new and insufficient data are emerging regarding the susceptibility of Candida spp. to fluconazole and amphotericin B. Here, we report the case of a 71-year-old immunocompetent woman with HIV infection who developed a brain biopsy confirming Candida infection while receiving antifungal therapy. A fluconazole-resistant strain of Candida was isolated from the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Microsurgery tests revealed a high-level plasma white blood cell (WCL) concentration of C. albicans in the CSF of the brain and meninges. The patient received standard antifungal treatment. This case illustrates the difficulty in treating candidiasis in an immunocompetent patient and its importance to understand the factors that may be associated with antifungal resistance in a patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Furthermore, the patient was treated with voriconazole for the brain biopsy.

## Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University (Protocol #106/2011.

Patients with cryptococcal meningitis were followed up for 6 months, after which time they were admitted to the hospital and treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.3 µg/ml) and fluconazole (1 µg/ml) for induction of survival. Among the patients, 2 patients with cryptococcal meningitis were excluded due to prolonged hospitalization. Among the patients with non-HIV, 2 patients with cryptococcal meningitis were excluded due to low quality of data.

In order to confirm the clinical status of the patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the University of Malawi Centre for Health Sciences was involved in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University (Protocol #106/2011).

In order to further investigate the clinical and laboratory outcomes, we compared the survival rate of the patients with cryptococcal meningitis and non-HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis. In the survival rate study, we compared the survival of patients with cryptococcal meningitis and non-HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis and non-HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis and non-HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis. In the statistical analysis, we used the data of the 14 patients with cryptococcal meningitis. The survival rate of the patients with cryptococcal meningitis was calculated using the following equation: the survival rate of the non-HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis = (C_T - C_N)×100%.

2.3. Determination of Fungal Strains
The morphological, physiological, and pharmacokinetic parameters of all fungal strains were determined by standard methods, as described in the previous report [35].

2.4. Determination of Fungal Growth
The Fungal Growth Index (FGI) was calculated by the following formula:

2.5. Determination of Fungal Morphology
The microscopic characteristics of all fungal strains were determined by microscopy.


## Results
Beyma, . Höhn.

Although the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis was similar in the two populations, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV infected patients was much higher than in HIV infected patients (Table 1). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients, and the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV infected patients was much higher than in HIV infected patients (Table 2). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients, and the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV infected patients was higher than in HIV infected patients (Table 2).

There were no differences in the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis among patients with HIV infection and among patients with HIV infection (Table 1). There was a correlation between the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis and the severity of clinical symptoms and comorbidities in both the two populations (Table 1).

Among the HIV infected patients, the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 1). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2).

Among the HIV infected patients, the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 1). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2).

Among HIV infected patients, the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 1). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2).

Among HIV infected patients, the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 2). The frequency of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in HIV infected patients than in HIV infected patients (Table 1).


## Discussion
1, -.82, -0.85, and -0.94, respectively, and CI: 0.94, 0.94, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively.

This study is the first to examine the relationship between the outcome of patients with cryptococcal meningitis in a non-HIV-infected adult population. It has shown a statistically significant correlation between death and the risk of death in HIV-infected patients. This relationship has also been demonstrated in other studies, in which the relationship between the risk of death and the risk of cryptococcal meningitis has been shown to be significant [30].

Tumor cell-mediated immune responses to Cryptococcus meningitis are considered to be the most important immune response for the host defense against cryptococcal meningitis, in terms of the development of Th2 cell response and the development of Th17 cell response [31,32]. Patients with cryptococcal meningitis in a non-HIV-infected population are more likely to have high serum levels of C. neoformans and high serum CD4+ T cell responses to the infection [32]. In HIV-infected patients, as well as patients with cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV-infected populations, patients who have a high serum C. neoformans serum concentration are more likely to have high serum C. neoformans concentrations. This finding is in accordance with the finding of a previous study [32] who found that patients with high serum C. neoformans concentrations were more likely to have high serum levels of C. neoformans.

In our study, we have demonstrated that the risk of death in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis is significantly higher when compared to non-HIV-infected patients, regardless of whether they are receiving corticosteroids or antiviral therapy. This finding is in accordance with other studies, in which the risk of death was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis compared to non-HIV-infected patients [32].
