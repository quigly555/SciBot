## Abstract
Fungal infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Invasive mycoses are caused by a wide range of fungal species, including the fungal pathogens Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Candida is a major cause of fungal bloodstream infections in humans and animals.


## Introduction
Microorganisms have been used in various industries for centuries. Especially in the pharmaceutical field, natural products are still the main choice of choice for therapeutic purposes. However, they can be hazardous and often lead to human health problems. In this light, they have been used for a long time as an alternative to synthetic chemical and chemical products. This review will focus on the biological activities of natural products, especially those of medicinal plants, their biosynthetic pathways and their antibacterial and antifungal activity.


## Methods
The BSL1 gene expression level in PBMCs was normalized to that of the human BSL1 gen. The BSL1 gene expression level in the PBMCs was normalized to the background expression level. The BSL1 gene expression level in the PBMCs was normalized to the background expression level. The percentage of PBMCs expressing BSL1 compared to the background expression level was calculated by the following formula:

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The differences between BSL1 and BSL2 in PBMCs and BSL1 gene expression levels in PBMCs were compared using the Student’s t-test and P-values were calculated. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Ethics Statement
Animal studies involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the American Cancer Society (protocol number AICPA-2011-001). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IACUC of the IACUC of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (protocol number AICPA-2016-007).

Human PBMCs Analysis
PBMCs were isolated from nude blood using an in-surgical sterile technique and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). The PBMCs were stimulated with 25 µM of BSL1 or BSL2 (bovine serum albumin [BSA] = 4 µg/mL, human serum albumin = 2 µg/mL, and BSA = 0.5 µg/mL)]. Cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO_2. The culture supernatant was discarded, and the cell lysate was used for RNA extraction. After the addition of DNase treatment, the supernatant was incubated for 18 h at 37°C with 5% CO_2.


## Results
The fungal burden was determined on days 7, 12, and 16 after infectio. Figure 4 shows that the lungs of mice infected with mycobacteria had a higher percentage of CFU at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. In contrast, the lungs of mice infected with the mycobacteria had a lower percentage of CFU at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. The degree of Cytochrome b gene expression in the lung at 6 and 12 days after infection was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the lungs of mice infected with mycobacteria had higher percentages of CFU at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. However, the lungs of mice infected with the mycobacteria had lower percentages of CFU at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. The CFU percentage of CFU in the lungs of mice infected with the mycobacteria was lower at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. The CFU percentages of CFU in the lungs of mice infected with the mycobacteria were lower at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group.

C. neoformans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are Differentially Expressed in the Lungs of Mice Infected with Mycobacteria
To determine whether the differences in lung fungal burden between the two clinical isolates were related to the relative abundance of bacterial cell populations, mouse BALB/c and mouse CD4 T-cell depleted mice were infected with the two clinical isolates. After 8 days of infection, the mice were sacrificed and their lungs were harvested. In contrast to the control group, mice infected with the mycobacteria had significantly higher CFU at both 6 and 12 days after infection compared to mice infected with the control group. In addition, lung fungal burden was significantly lower in mice infected with the mycobacteria compared to mice infected with the control group.


## Discussion
Previous studies have shown that the number of genes in each cell type is highly correlated with the number of gene expression, but the relationship is less clear [31. Thus, the difference between the three models might be due to gene expression differences between the cell types. The fact that these three models show a strong correlation with each other may suggest that a slight difference in gene expression between the cell types could be a result of differences in the gene expression between the cells. In addition, the differences in gene expression between the cell types might result from the differences in the cell type itself.

We have also compared the gene expression of the two different cell types by means of combined approaches. We observed that the gene expression of the cell types was differently expressed, and the results showed that the gene expression of the cell types was significantly different. In particular, the gene expression of the cell types were significantly downregulated in the cytochrome b gene flow between mouse epithelial cells and the human epithelial cells. These results are consistent with a previous study that showed that the number of genes in each cell type is associated with the number of gene expression [12]. In this study, we also found that the gene expression of the cell types was significantly upregulated in mouse epithelial cells. These results are consistent with the finding that the cell types have different gene expression patterns and that the cell types differ in their cell types [12].

The results from this study showed that the gene expression differences between the cell types in the two different cell types could be a result of differences in gene expression. However, in the case of the cell types, the differences in gene expression between the cells were not significant. These results are consistent with previous studies that showed that the number of gene expression in each cell type is correlated with the number of gene expression, but the relationship is less clear [31]. These results are also in agreement with other studies that showed that gene expression changes between different cell types in different cell types occur by gene expression changes in different tissues [16,25]. However, the relationship between the cell types and gene expression level in cells is not clear.

In the case of the cell types, gene expression changes in different cell types were also observed.
