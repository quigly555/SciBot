## Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of late-onset encephalopathy or encephalopathy, characterized by generalized fatality, rapidly growing lesions, and difficulty in neurological function. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is based on fungal culture, and most cases are found in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction
albicans can contribute to the attraction of the host cell towards the fungus and to invasion of the host cell by . albicans. The mechanism(s) of the interaction of C. albicans with the host cell and the essential role of S-palmitoylation in this process has not been identified. However, it has been reported that the palmitoylation activity of C. albicans is involved in its morphological development and the process of its pathogenicity (Krogh and Licht, 2005). Palmitoylation is a major immunosuppressive molecule and in immunocompromised individuals it can lead to the development of diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Huang et al., 2010), cancer (Di Luca et al., 2012), inflammatory diseases (Romani et al., 2009), inflammatory hematuria (Vicente et al., 2006), diabetes mellitus (Romani et al., 2009), hyperlipidaemia (Romani et al., 2009), and osteoporosis (Corti and Pirofski, 2010).

Saccharopine is a C-terminal amino acid that is structurally related to a-methyl-d-proline and serine palmitoyl group (Mannew et al., 2001). It was initially reported to be involved in the mechanism of cell wall remodelling in the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Bovers et al., 2007), but this mechanism has since been shown to be dispensable for virulence (Nascimento et al., 2006). In C. neoformans, palmitoylation is essential for growth and viability. Previous studies have demonstrated that a-methyl-d-proline is important for capsule formation in the presence of the active moiety and for tissue invasion (Romani et al., 2009). The functions of palmitoyl-CoA are mainly associated with the cell wall remodelling, where a-methyl-d-proline is important for the synthesis of the mature peptide side chain (Caporaso et al., 2010).


## Methods
cerevisia. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95°C for 2 min and 200 µl of the reaction solution (1% formic acid) was added to a 10-ml culture flask containing 10 ml of the cell wall-extract-extract-extract medium. The cells were incubated at 30°C for 24 h in a growth chamber. At the end of the incubation, the supernatant was collected, and the viability was assessed by trypan blue staining.

Cell wall-extract-extract-extract-extract medium and S. cerevisiae S. pneumoniae
A 10-ml culture was inoculated into a 2-ml YPD broth (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, and 0.05% sodium bicarbonate) and grown at 30°C for 24 h in a growth chamber. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 10-ml PBS, and the pellets were suspended in 10-ml of PBS. A 100-µl aliquot of the suspension was inoculated into a 1-ml aliquot of a cell suspension medium (2% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.05% sodium bicarbonate). The mixture was incubated at 30°C, 200 rpm, and 30°C for 48 h. After incubation, the supernatant was collected and washed with PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 10-ml of PBS, and the cell density was measured.

YPD was used for cultivation of S. pneumoniae (strain CBS 9464) and S. cerevisiae (strain SC5314) using yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium. The medium contained glucose (0.5%), yeast extract (10%), and ammonium sulfate (2%).

To evaluate the capacity of S. pneumoniae to inhibit S. cerevisiae growth, a 10-ml culture was inoculated into a 2-ml YPD broth and grown at 30°C for 24 h in a growth chamber. After growth, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded.


## Results
The MIC_50 and MIC_90 of the FKCI-stimulated and FKCI-induced samples were 4-16 µg/ml (SI, MIC_50 = .10 µg/ml), 0.5-1.0 µg/ml (SI, MIC_90 = 2.2 µg/ml), 2.5-4 µg/ml (SI, MIC_50 = 8 µg/ml), and 4-6 µg/ml (SI, MIC_90 = 8 µg/ml). A correlation was observed between the FKCI-induced and FKCI-induced concentrations of the tested drugs. However, the FKCI-induced concentrations of the tested drugs were >4 µg/ml (SI, MIC_50 = 4 µg/ml), which is not very high for the antifungal drug tested. The FKCI-induced concentrations of FKCI-stimulated and FKCI-induced concentrations of the tested drugs were >2 µg/ml (SI, MIC_50 = 2 µg/ml), which is not very high for the antifungal drug tested.

Molecular Characterization of FKCI-stimulated and FKCI-induced MECs
We evaluated the antifungal activity of the recombinant FKBP12, FKBP12-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FKCI), and FKCI-stimulated MECs (SI). All FKBP12-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FKCI) and FKCI-stimulated MECs showed good antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and S. aureus, respectively. We evaluated the antifungal activity of the FKBP12, FKBP12-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FKCI), and FKCI-stimulated MECs (SI).


## Discussion
Several of these proteins were found to be highly conserved in different species, and in the same study, the . striiformis mutants showed similar phenotypes to those of the strain NRRL 1799. However, in the previous study, the mutants of A. nidulans and R. oryzae were found to be highly similar to each other, and the mutant for P. ostreatus and R. aculeatus were highly similar to each other. In this study, we have compared the expression of five genes in the serotype D strain NRRL 1799, and discovered that there is a strong correlation between the expression of these genes and the phenotypic variations observed among the strains. This correlation was further confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis of the serotype C strains. It is known that the serotype D strains show higher gene expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, in addition to cell wall synthesis and stress responses. The P. ostreatus mutants differ from the serotype D strains in their gene expression and cell cycle biology. However, the results also suggest that the serotype D strains show different patterns of expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, and that the P. ostreatus mutants differ from the serotype D strains in their gene expression and cell cycle biology.

Phylogenetic relationships of melanin-like proteins
We have previously shown that the orthologs of the subunits of pyrrole synthase were highly conserved in different species of the Aspergilli. In contrast to the P. ostreatus mutants, we found that the orthologs of the pyrrole synthase were highly conserved in P. ostreatus and P. striiformis. In our previous study, the ortholog of the subunit of pyrrole synthase (PSS1) was found to be highly conserved in P. ostreatus and P. striiformis. This protein is involved in cell wall biosynthesis and in cell wall degradation, and is required for the normal cell wall biosynthesis of P. striiformis. In the P. striiformis strain, this protein was found to be highly conserved, and the ortholog of this protein was also found to be highly conserved in the P. ostreatus and P. striiformis strains. These results suggest that the P.
