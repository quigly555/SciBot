## Abstract
Inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>B and IL-17Rß was independent of inteinin expressio. Moreover, interferon alpha and IL-10p40 were the only cytokine-regulated pathways in which G protein a subunit subunits were significantly inhibited by inteinin expression. Moreover, intein expression was blocked in a subunit that was previously shown to be essential for fungal infection in human dengue, BALB/c mice, indicating that the G protein a subunit of this signaling pathway is involved in fungal infection. Our results suggest that the G protein a subunit of this signaling pathway is important for the development of dengue infection. Furthermore, our data suggest that G protein a subunit of this signaling pathway may be involved in maintaining the protective effect of the fungal infection induced by Dengue fever.

Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in febrile illness, with IFD responsible for more than half of all deaths in developing countries. The most frequent pathogens associated with IFD are viruses, bacteria, and fungi. IFDs are difficult to diagnose because the causative agents are difficult to identify, and the clinical presentations are varied and there are no standardized diagnostic tools. The disease can be diagnosed by the time of presentation with India ink staining, India ink staining with a Vitek MS system, or India ink staining with a culture. Other methods, such as India peptone staining, are less useful because they do not yield a positive result. However, these methods are less costly and less useful for direct microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen assays, which is very useful for the rapid detection of the pathogens. Detection by India ink staining is time-consuming, but recent guidelines provide for the rapid detection of specific pathogens using culture-dependent assays. PCR is more time-consuming than antigen assays because of the variability in the results. The aim of this study was to establish a fast, cost-effective method for detection of pathogens using India ink staining.


## Introduction

G protein-mediated antiviral effectors (GPR), including GalXM and ATP-dependent C-type lectin, were identified and the full repertoire of GPRs was revealed by the LFA stud. These proteins are responsible for their ability to inhibit bacterial meningitis virus-2, the virus that causes the acute respiratory syndrome in neonates, and the cause of acute febrile illness in infants, which is caused by the virus in the nasopharynx. These G proteins are a component of the integrase complex, which are also called integrins, a complex that modulates the activity of integrins, including adhesins, which are important for cellular and humoral responses to bacterial infections. The ability of GPRs to bind to viral proteins has been studied in a few cases using the yeast pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. The binding of the C. neoformans adhesin to adhesin was associated with an increase in the G protein-dependent antiviral effector function, while the adhesin function was associated with the activation of the adhesin-binding factor. We have previously demonstrated that adhesin binding to a virus is involved in the antiviral activity, but not the function of the adhesin in the antiviral effector function. The GPRs are a highly conserved family of proteins that have been well characterized in plants and animals. The GPR family consists of seven subunits, known as adhesins, c-type lectins, intercellular adhesins, cytokines, and nucleotide binding proteins (NDRs) that are organized in a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored sugar transporters. GPI-C and GPI-A are expressed in cells of insects, birds, and mammals, respectively, and are known to play a role in the uptake of antigens, including virus-1, by the adhesin, adhesin-1, the surface surface protein, and the immunoglobulin. In the insect model, GPI-C and GPI-A are expressed on a broad range of insects, birds, and mammals, respectively, and are known to be important for the innate immune response.


## Methods
Cultivation and DNA extraction
The samples of maize, soybean, rapeseed and cassava from Qingdao province were harvested in June 2014. The samples were dried at room temperature in a laboratory and stored at -20 °C until analysis. The DNA was extracted using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Genomic DNA extraction
The samples were ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen extract and lyophilized. The DNA was then stored at -20 °C until further analysis.

The DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PCR
PCR was performed in a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and 0.5 µM of each primer (Table 1). The reaction was performed in a StepOne Real-Time PCR System with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The sequences were deposited in the NCBI GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) for the annotation and taxonomic assignment.


## Results
jecorina or . jecorina-specific G protein a subunit subunit (Gpa1) can inhibit bacterial meningitis in C. albicans. Gpa1 was previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of G protein a subunit a in S. cerevisiae [34]. To investigate whether H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) could inhibit bacterial meningitis in C. albicans, we first examined the efficacy of H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit subunit (Gpa1) in our study. H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) is known to be a potent inhibitor of G protein a subunit [34]. In this study, we did not observe significant inhibition of bacterial meningitis. However, we observed an increase in the level of H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice when compared with those infected with S. cerevisiae (Figure 7). Taken together, our results indicate that H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) can inhibit bacterial meningitis in C. albicans.

H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) inhibits G protein a subunit a transcription factor expression and induces the expression of genes implicated in G protein a and G protein secretion in C. albicans [34]. Thus, we next examined the effect of H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) on the expression of the G protein a subunit (Gpa1). To this end, we examined the expression of the G protein a subunit (Gpa1) during the course of our study. When we performed these experiments in the lungs, we observed that H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) and G protein a subunit (Gpa1) induced expression of the G protein a subunit (Gpa1) in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice. Taken together, these results indicate that H. jecorina-specific G protein a subunit (Gpa1) can inhibit bacterial meningitis in C. albicans.


## Discussion

Our findings suggest that the extracellular components of bacterial meningitis in patients are significantly enriched in extracellular proteins, which contribute to bacterial immune function, such as chemokines, cytokines, and antifungal protein. Extracellular proteins from other organisms, including bacterial pathogens, were significantly enriched in the extracellular matrix of patients, with extracellular proteins from Aspergillus spp. significantly enriched. A variety of proteins were found to be important in immune function, including cytokines, chemokines, and proteins involved in cell membrane protein synthesis and function, such as chitin synthase and myo-inositol-derived proteinase, were significantly enriched in the extracellular matrix of patients. This suggests that extracellular components of the bacterial meningitis matrix are significantly enriched in patients.

In a previous study, we reported that exogenous C. albicans extracellular proteins were significantly enriched in the extracellular matrix of patients [26]. This is the first report of extracellular proteins from patients receiving treatment with C. albicans meningitis. It suggests that the extracellular matrix of patients may be significantly enriched in extracellular proteins, as demonstrated by the increased amount of extracellular proteins in patients treated with C. albicans meningitis compared to control patients.

The study of extracellular proteins in other organisms suggests that the extracellular matrix plays an important role in bacterial virulence in humans [31]. In this study, we found that the extracellular matrix of the human pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, was significantly enriched in extracellular proteins. This suggests that the extracellular matrix may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus in humans.

In summary, our results show that extracellular proteins are significantly enriched in bacterial meningitis. Extracellular proteins of Staphylococcus aureus contribute to host defense against bacterial meningitis, which may be mediated by extracellular components of the bacterial meningitis matrix. The extracellular matrix of the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus may play an important role in bacterial virulence in humans. This finding provides important insights in the relationship between bacterial meningitis and immune function.
