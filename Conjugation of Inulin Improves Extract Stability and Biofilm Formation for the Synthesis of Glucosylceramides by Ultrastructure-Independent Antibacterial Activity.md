## Abstract
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a “paradoxical change” to the therapy of long-term, high-intensity therapy with chemotherapy. The goal of this study is to determine the in vitro activity of inositol, lysosomal acid, and inositol+ lysosomal acid, inositol+ lysosomal acid, and lysosomal acid plus inhibitors, in order to be able to begin effective treatment once more.

A total of 100 clinical isolates of four well-characterized IRIS pathogens were subjected to in vitro activity screening for inositol, lysosomal acid, and inositol+ lysosomal acid. The following in vitro results were obtained: (i) after 4 weeks of treatment, (ii) during the time of which the treated individuals were in inositol+ lysosomal acid+ or lysosomal acid+ or inhibitors, (iii) during the time of which the treated individuals were in lysosomal acid+ or lysosomal acid+ and (iv) during the time of the inositol+ lysosomal acid+ or inhibitors: (A) lysosomal acid + (B) lysosomal acid + (C) lysosomal acid+ (C) lysosomal acid+ (D) lysosomal acid+ (E) lysosomal acid+ (F) intervalose or (G) intron 6, while (B) lysosomal acid + (C) lysosomal acid+ (C) lysosomal acid+ (D) lysosomal acid+ (E) lysosomal acid+ (F) intervalose were found to be inactive.

A significant decrease in the incidence of IRIS was observed in the treatment of the treated individuals and in the treatment of the non-treated individuals. These inhibitors, (A) did not cause an increase in the incidence of IRIS, while (B) did not seem to play a role in IRIS.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental yeast found in soil and pigeon droppings (Park et al., 2013). It is a facultative intracellular pathogen and is found ubiquitously in the environment in both pigeon droppings and soil. It is also found in humans and other mammals such as rats, dogs, cats and possums (Jong et al., 2015). When C. neoformans is inhaled into the lungs, it can disseminate and cause meningoencephalitis (Park et al., 2013). In most cases, the organism survives and replicates inside macrophages and other macrophage subsets of the immune system, causing a Th2-like immune response (Jong et al., 2015). In the lungs of a C. neoformans patient, C. neoformans disseminates to the bloodstream and causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis (Park et al., 2013).

The purpose of this study was to determine the immune response to cryptococcal infection in a mouse model of cryptococcal infection.


## Methods
The solution was incubated at room temperature for 24 h, and the optical density of the solution was measured at 540 nm using an optical spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad. The Inulin-Amino acid extract was used as a positive control and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. The assay was performed in duplicate and repeated twice. The results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition compared to the MIC.

The Inulin-Amino acid (IMA) was prepared by mixing the Inulin and Amino extract in 1% (w/v) acetic acid, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 24 h, and the optical density of the solution was measured at 540 nm using an optical spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). The IMA was used as a negative control and the MIC values were determined.

To measure the effect of the Inulin on the biofilm formation, the medium of the isolated isolated Inulin-Amino acid extract was adjusted to pH 6.5. The liquid medium of the isolated Inulin-Amino acid extract was also adjusted to pH 5.5, and the medium of the Amino acid extract to pH 6.5 was also adjusted. The solution of the medium was prepared by dissolving the Inulin and Amino in 1% (w/v) acetic acid, and the Amino acid extract was used as a positive control. The suspension of A. fumigatus was adjusted to pH 6.5, and the liquid medium of the isolated Inulin-Amino acid extract was also adjusted to pH 6.5.

The concentration of the Inulin and Amino acid extract was measured by the pH value of the culture medium at 30 °C. The pH value of the culture medium was also determined by measuring the pH value of the medium by a pH meter (Percival 22, Water, USA). The pH values of the culture medium were also determined by measuring the pH value of the medium by a pH meter (Percival 22, Water, USA).


## Results
To elucidate the mechanism of the reduced Inulin-binding properties, the antibacterial activity of Inulin was investigated by utilizing the inulinase reaction system (ICOS, Incubase-1, The Michaelis-Meyer Effector, and the Hoechst A-acidification system) for inulinase activity and inulinase enzyme activit. The results showed that Inulinase activity was suppressed by Inulinase activity, and the inhibitory activity was dependent on the Inulinase activity of Inulin. However, Inulinase activity was also suppressed by the inhibition of the enzyme of the enzymes of the inulinase reaction system (ICOS, Incubase-1, The Michaelis-Meyer Effector, and the Hoechst A-acidification system) in order to provide the highest inhibitory activity for Inulinase enzyme activity.

2.4. Inulinase Activity of Inulin-Binding Compounds Promoted the Activity of Inulin-Binding Compounds against Glucosylceramides
The inulinase reaction system of Inulinase is the first reaction step in the hydrolysis of Inulin into Glucose by the glyoxylate cycle. The reaction of glyoxylate cycle with Inulin is the first step in the glyoxylate cycle. The enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle is the reaction site of the Inulinase reaction system. Glucose is the main compound in the Inulinase reaction system. Glucose-conjugated Inulinase (Glc1) is a fungal cell membrane protein that is a membrane-enclosed enzyme that is a good membrane for gliding of fungi. Glc1 enzyme is one of the most important enzymes in the gliding of fungi [5]. To understand the mechanism of Inulin-binding of Inulin-binding Compounds, the inulinase reaction system was first established by the inulinase reaction system for the synthesis of glucosylceramide (glc1), which is a glucosylceramide-binding compound [5]. The results showed that Inulinase activity promoted the activity of Glc1 enzyme, and the inhibition was dependent on the Inulinase activity of Glc1 enzyme.


## Discussion
fumigatus ATCC 23472 and . fumigatus ATCC 23472, whose growth was inhibited by the azole class of antifungal agents, and the isolates of A. terreus ATCC 2756 (MIC = 20 mg/mL) and A. fumigatus ATCC 2757 (MIC = 2 mg/mL). In the A. fumigatus strain, the concentration of the antifungal agent was about 1.0 µg/ml. The MIC of Glucosylceramides was 1.0 µg/ml and the growth rate was 50% (3 × 10^-10 cells/h). The MIC of Glucosylceramides against the strains of A. terreus ATCC 2756 and A. fumigatus ATCC 2757 was 1.0 µg/ml. The MIC of Glucosylceramides against the strains of A. terreus ATCC 2756 and A. fumigatus ATCC 2757 was 1.0 µg/ml and the MIC of Glucosylceramides against the strains of A. terreus ATCC 2757 was 0.8 mg/ml. These results suggest that Glucosylceramides are the best-studied class of the antifungal agents.

The results of the antifungal activity assays with the tested Glucosylceramides were analyzed by determining the inhibition zones of the Glucosylceramides. The inhibition zones were determined to be 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2 µm and the biomass was determined to be 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2 g/L. The results showed that the Glucosylceramides were inactive against the strains of A. terreus ATCC 2756 and A. fumigatus ATCC 2757. These results suggested that the Glucosylceramides are the best-studied class of the antifungal agents.

The results of the antifungal activity assays with the tested Glucosylceramides were determined to be inactive.
