## Abstract
The macrophage phagosome receptor (MAPR) is a prototypical receptor found in eukaryotic cells and serves as a pivotal signal for the subsequent activation of phagocytes in the macrophage phagosome. Macrophages have evolved several strategies for mediating phagocytosis from food- and micro-organisms. One of these are chemically, using a cytochrome P450 (CYP) group to produce an asexual morphogenetic protein Cad1, which in turn has a morphological switch behavior to enable their survival in a host-specific environment. This morphogenetic plasticity also enables the crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways, enabling the generation of new effects using multiple signaling pathways at the same time. Here, we discuss the effects of mutations in the Cags1/Hels1 Ca2+Cags1/Hels1 ligand, in yeast, on the phenotypic switch behavior of macrophages. These experiments revealed that the morphological switch behavior is mediated by a combination of factors, including: (i) the calcineurin signal transduction pathway, which is a prominent signaling pathway in the early stage of phagosome-host cell interactions, (ii) the high affinity calcium/calcineurin interaction pathway, which is a prominent signaling pathway in the late stage of macrophage-microbe interactions, (iii) the high nucleotide sugar reductase/phosphorylase/rhamnose tolerance pathway, which is a prominent signaling pathway in the early stage of phagosome-host cell interactions, and (iv) the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is a prominent signaling pathway in the cell wall and Golgi regions of the cell that is also prominent in the early stage of phagosome-microbe interactions. These findings have implications for macrophage therapeutics, in that they support a role for Cags1 in regulating the phagosome-host cell interaction.

A major fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This pathogen harbors many phenotypes, some of which are specifically adapted to survive within the macrophage phagosomes. Many of these phenotypes have been associated with virulence, and some of these phenotypes have been found associated with resistance to the antifungal drugs used to control infections.


## Introduction
neoformans in . neoformans [22,22,23]. The FstA/Dcp1 and the FstA-ZNF pathway proteins also play roles in the response to antifungal agents, which can be antagonized by the FST-1 and FST-2 proteins, respectively [23,24,25,26,27]. The FST-1 and FST-2 proteins are required for virulence in C. neoformans and C. albicans [28,29,30]. In addition, the Fst-1 and Fst-2 proteins are necessary for the formation of biofilm in C. neoformans [31,32].

The FST-1 and Fst-2 proteins are essential for C. neoformans virulence in animal models, including murine models, and it is known that FST-1 and Fst-2 are required for virulence in mice [33,34,35,36,37,38,39]. In addition, C. neoformans FST-1 and Fst-2 are important for virulence in mice [33,34,35,38,39,40,41]. The FST-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to antifungal agents, and C. neoformans FST-1 and Fst-2 are required for virulence in mice [32,32,37,42]. Moreover, Fst-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans [32,33,34,36,37,43].

The FST-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans [32,32,37,44,45]. In addition, FST-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans [32,32,37,44,45]. In addition, Fst-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans [32,32,37,44]. In addition, FST-1 and Fst-2 proteins play roles in the response to oxidative stress in C. neoformans [32,32,37,44,45].


## Methods
We also confirmed that the fungus is present in humans at the second instar stage of life in vitro and at the third instar stage of life in vivo [20. The fungi have a virulence profile comparable to other bacteria [21], [22].

Detection of the major cytokines mediators involved in candidiasis and malignant cell growth
The candidiasis and malignant cell lines were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37°C. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 5 × 10^5 cells/mL. The assays were performed in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% glucose. The wells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% glucose. The number of CFU per mL was determined by plating serial dilutions. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

In order to determine the major cytokines involved in candidiasis and malignant cell growth, the yeasts were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 7 days. The medium was then replaced with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% glucose, and the plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The yeasts were then observed for the colony-forming units (CFU) by plating serial dilutions. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Antimicrobial assays
The antimicrobial activity of the yeasts was determined as previously described [20], [22]. Briefly, yeasts were cultured in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) broth at 37°C. Then, 100 µL of the yeast suspension was added to a well of a 96-well plate, which contained RPMI 1640 medium with 1% glucose. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C. Then, the yeast was scraped with sterile forceps, and the cell wall was removed by washing with PBS. The microtiter wells were again washed with PBS. Then, the wells were again washed with PBS. Finally, the well with the lowest concentration of the yeasts was used as positive control.


## Results
In a first-step analysis, we found that the nprB gene was essential for the virulence of . neoformans in a model of systemic candidiasis and was highly expressed in the lungs of C. neoformans-infected mice. We further confirmed that the nprB gene was essential for FND1 expression in C. neoformans in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis using the qRT-PCR (Fig 7a). In contrast, the fnd1 gene was not essential for FND1 expression in C. neoformans in a model of systemic candidiasis using the qRT-PCR (Fig 7b). However, the fnd1 gene was essential for FND1 expression in C. neoformans in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis using the qRT-PCR (Fig 7c). The qRT-PCR analysis of FND1 expression in the lungs revealed that it was highly upregulated in the fnd1 mutant (Fig 7d). We further investigated the role of FND1 in FND1 expression by determining the expression of FND1-like genes in the fnd1 mutant. In the fnd1 mutant, FND1-like gene expression was significantly upregulated (Fig 7e). In contrast, FND1-like gene expression was not significantly upregulated in the fnd1 mutant (Fig 7e). These results suggested that FND1 and FND1 are important for FND1-like gene expression and FND1 is essential for FND1-like gene expression in C. neoformans.

FND1 Is Essential for Fungal Uptake
Next, we investigated the role of FND1 in the ability of C. neoformans to establish infection in the host. In an effort to test the role of FND1 in infection, we used a novel strain of C. neoformans to mimic the systemic infection model in which C. neoformans can establish infection in the host. We inoculated C. neoformans into the mouse peritoneal cavity (MM) and found that C. neoformans had successfully colonized the mouse peritoneal cavity (Fig 8a). We next tested whether the FND1 deletion strain could establish infection in the host.


## Discussion
neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that is considered an opportunistic pathogen that presents a favorable immune response, but which is also able to cause disease in immunocompetent hosts (21. This is especially true for C. albicans (22). Infection of humans and animals by C. neoformans has been reported previously (23, 24), and may explain the increased risk of cryptococcosis in these patients. In our patient, cryptococcosis was not detected in the plasma and did not affect the blood levels of the cytokines IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17 in the blood of patients with cryptococcosis (Table 1). Therefore, we believe that the observed decreased production of IL-17 and IFN-<U+03B3> in our patient could be the result of the increased exposure of this strain to the immune system.

In the current study, we identified and quantified the levels of IL-17 and IL-17R in plasma and blood of the patients with cryptococcosis (Table 2). We found that the circulating levels of IL-17, IL-17R, and IFN-<U+03B3> were decreased by 48.9% in patients with cryptococcosis, as well as by 40.8%, 61.5%, and 75.8%, respectively (Table 2). This indicates that the level of IL-17 was decreased in these patients.

IL-17R was found to be elevated in plasma of patients with cryptococcosis (Table 2). IL-17R plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response to C. neoformans infection (25), and this is often associated with the development of leukopenia. Studies in other fungi have shown that IL-17 plays a role in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans infection, such as the pathogenic growth of C. gattii (26). In our patient, we did not observe any IL-17R elevation in plasma and blood of patients with cryptococcosis (Table 2).

IL-17R is involved in the regulation of the immune response to C. neoformans infection. IL-17R has been reported to mediate the immune response to cryptococcosis, but not the immune response to C. albicans (27). IL-17 is involved in the regulation of the immune response to C.
