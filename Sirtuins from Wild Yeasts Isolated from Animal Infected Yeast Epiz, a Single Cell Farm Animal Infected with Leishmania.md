## Abstract
Most eukaryotic pathogens cause infective inflammation and destruction of the host cells, predominantly in the host immune reconstitution (IR) phase. The pathogenic mechanisms of fungal pathogens are poorly understood and the pathogenic process of human pathologies remains poorly understood. A critical step in the evolution of multicellular organisms is the transition from a multinuclear system to multinuclear infection, a transition that begins with the activation of signaling cascades downstream of signal transduction, which includes the initiation of multidrug efflux and cell-permeabilizing drugs. In this review, we will provide an overview of the pathogenic mechanisms of the major human fungal pathogens including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and dermatophytes.


## Introduction

Leishmania major is transmitted by the bite of infected mammalian macrophages (M1 and M2, respectively) resulting in human infection and subsequent infection of the liver and the spleen (Jin et a., 2013). In contrast, Leishmania donovani is transmitted by infected phagocytes (i.e., the visceral organs of rats) resulting in the development of infection in the lungs and subsequently infection in the blood (Wang et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2013). These studies show that Leishmania donovani is not a single cell parasite but is an interconnected network of multiple species that co-occur and spread and that are able to cause disease, both in vitro and in vivo (Wong et al., 2012).

Human Leishmaniasis is a subcutaneous disease caused by the bite of leishmaniasis virus (LTV) (Bertrand and Voglmayr, 2011; Jacob and Marzán, 2012; Wong et al., 2012). In the case of L. donovani, it has been shown that the leishmanicidal activity of the parasite is closely linked to the IFN-<U+03B3> receptor (IFN-<U+03B3>RI) (Krigman et al., 2007). IFN-<U+03B3>RI is a member of the serine protease 3 (SEc3) protein which is found in the plasma membrane of all Leishmania species (Klein et al., 2000). These IFN-<U+03B3> receptors are activated by host immune effector receptors on the surface of Leishmania and in response the parasite induces the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-22 and IL-23 (Wong et al., 2012). The IFN-<U+03B3> receptor is activated by the interaction between leukocytes and the extracellular matrix, and its ligand, ASC, is located on the surface of these cells.


## Methods
The macrophages were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% L-dextrose, and 1% sodium pyruvate (PBS) at 37°C with 5% CO_. The yeasts were cultivated in a 5% CO_2-independent medium, and were cultured for 3 days. The yeasts were harvested by centrifugation and the phagocytosed yeasts were counted by counting in a hemocytometer.

RNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative PCR
The RNA was extracted from yeast cells cultured in complete medium using the CTAB method [36]. A total of 5 µg of total RNA from the yeasts were reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers and the first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by the UltraScript^® RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the following parameters: 20 s of step 1, 30 s of step 2, and 15 s of step 3. The PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed with SYBR Green Supermix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the following cycling parameters: 3 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at the annealing temperature, and 45 s at 72°C. The efficiency of the real-time PCR was calculated using the following formula: (1 - (µ_450 - c_450)/(µ_450 - c_450)/(µ_450 - c_450)) × 100. The specificity of the real-time PCR was determined by using the following formula: (1 - (µ_450 - c_450)/(µ_450 - c_450)/(µ_450 - c_450)) × 100.


## Results
We took advantage of the immunofluorescent assay to observe the presence of Sirtuins in the fungal cell surfac. Wild-type and Sirtu1-1 mutant strains were grown in a medium containing yeast extract, sucrose, D-glucose, sucrose-1-phosphate, 3-phosphoric acid, and glycerol, respectively. After 48 h of growth, the fungal cells were harvested and quantified by the immunoassay (Fig 1A). We found that the Sirtu1-1 mutant did not show any increase in the abundance of Sirtuins in the intracellular organs of the infected animal, although it was significantly higher than the wild type (Fig 1B). In contrast, we found that the Sirtu1-1 mutant did exhibit a slight decrease in the abundance of Sirtuins in the intracellular organs of the infected animal, but not in the liver or spleen (Fig 1C).

To further validate the findings, we performed a confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of the intracellular organs of the infected animal (Fig 1D). We found that the Sirtu1-1 mutant exhibited a significant reduction in the intracellular organelles of the infected animal, as compared to the wild type (Fig 1D). This reduction was also accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of Sirtuins in the intracellular organelles of the infected animal (Fig 1D).

Sirtuins are Not Required for C. albicans Heterologous Adherence to the Bacterial Colonies
We next tested whether Sirtuins are required for colonization of the bacterial cell surface by C. albicans. We first measured the growth of the Sirtu1-1 mutant in a murine colonic epithelial cell line, and we found that the Sirtu1-1 mutant exhibited a robust growth rate compared to the wild type (Fig 2). Furthermore, the Sirtu1-1 mutant displayed increased virulence in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis, in a model that includes a mouse-passaging model [16]. We next tested whether Sirtuins are necessary for C.


## Discussion
pombe has evolved two genes encoding a multi-protein protein kinase (MPAK) and a cytosolic protein kinase (CPK) in its genom. However, the organism has not been extensively studied and no mechanistic study was published thus far for S. pombe.

In the present study, we firstly characterized the transcriptome and genome-wide gene expression profiles for wild-type and mutant S. pombe. Compared to S. pombe, the transcriptome of S. pombe was much more composed of genes involved in both pathogenicity and defense. In comparison to S. pombe, the transcriptome of S. pombe was much more diverse and included a greater number of genes involved in cell cycle, energy metabolism, transcription, transcriptional regulation, and RNA metabolism. In contrast, S. pombe had a much lower number of genes involved in transcription, including a greater number of genes involved in DNA and RNA metabolism and a relatively lower number of genes involved in DNA and RNA processing.

Genome-wide transcription profiling revealed that the genome of S. pombe contained a large number of genes involved in stress response, cell cycle, protein synthesis, DNA repair, and protein translation. This result suggests that the S. pombe genome is not only highly functional and not highly affected by the environment but also contains genes involved in cell cycle, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and transcription. However, our genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the gene expression profile of S. pombe is more similar to S. sanguineus. This may be due to the fact that S. sanguineus is a unique S. pombe strain that is genetically and economically different from S. sanguineus.

Among the genes involved in cell cycle, energy metabolism, and transcription, two genes encoding kinases, the HOG and MAPK, were up-regulated during the growth of S. pombe. In contrast to S. sanguineus, the genome of S. sanguineus contains two genes encoding the SOD, MAPK, and HOG pathways. However, the S. sanguineus genome lacks the SOD pathway and it has two genes encoding the HOG pathway. The MAPK genes, which encode components of the MAP kinase pathway, are also up-regulated during the growth of S. pombe.
