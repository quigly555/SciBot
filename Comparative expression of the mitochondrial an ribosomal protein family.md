## Abstract
cinere. Two other genes, P. pastoris-1 and P. tilia-1, were also identified as potential TALP-APNases. We predicted the basic region of the mitochondrial an ribosomal protein of interest by the multi-gene phylogeny model. The TALP-APNases were fused into active protein complexes in a P. cinerea-specific priming protein-dependent manner, and the P. cinerea TALP-APNases formed a single, fully functional core. The protein core consists of a conserved subunit whose unique family of amino acids is the amino-terminal region, and a member whose products share conserved sequences. The TALP-APNases were also found to interact with the P. pastoris-1/<U+2206>-xylans-1 pmt proteins in vitro.

The TALP-APNases possess a conserved, unique TALP-ATPase domain that shares homology with the histone H3-CAT1 and the histone H3-CAT2 subunits of the histone deacetylase enzyme, Pdr2p. The Pdr2pTALP-APNases possess a distinct, four-elimination open reading frame with a predicted, seven-elimination open protein fold and a unique, seven-elimination open protein complex. The Pdr2pTALP-APNases do not undergo an amino acid change at the 7-elimination open reading frame in Pdr2pT2-/xylalanine aminotransferase-/-<U+2206>-deficient mice, and indeed undergo a large, cis-terminal modification that fully complements the histone H3-CAT1-/xylalanine transposon fold and similar to the histone H3-CAT2-/lysine deacetylase fold of the TALP-APNases.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a life-threatening infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, which primarily affects immunocompromised hosts [1]. In fact, the most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is pulmonary infection [2,3]. The most common pathogens are C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. neoformans var. gattii. However, other pathogenic yeasts such as C.


## Methods
graminearum and purified using a TIANquick PCR purification kit (Tiangen, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The PCR product was then purified using an AxyPrep DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Axygen, Dalian, China). The purified PCR product was then sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

Phylogenetic Analysis
The phylogenetic analysis was performed by the Maximum likelihood method using the program MEGA6 [52]. The minimum evolution (ME) method [53] was used to estimate the species-level phylogenetic position of F. graminearum and F. oxysporum, respectively. Two species of F. graminearum, F. oxysporum and F. oxysporum, were selected as outgroups for the analysis. The ITS-LSU region was amplified from the genomic DNA of F. graminearum using the primers ITS1 and ITS4 and the product was purified and sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The ITS-LSU region was then aligned by ClustalX2 [54]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with MEGA 6 software [55]. The bootstrap values were calculated by the program 1,000 replicates [56]. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using WebLogo [57].

Construction of F. graminearum Mutants
F. graminearum strains were constructed by the method of Bemis et al. [58] with modifications. F. graminearum strains were inoculated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, as described earlier, and incubated at 28 °C for 4 days. The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed three times with sterile distilled water, and the suspension was filtered using a Millipore filter (0.45 µm) to remove mycelia. The filtered mycelia were then plated onto potato dextrose broth (PDB) and incubated at 28 °C for 4 days. The mycelia were then harvested by filtration and washed three times with sterile distilled water, and the suspension was filtered using a Millipore filter (0.45 µm) to remove mycelia.


## Results
neoformans mitochondrial protein database using the mitochondrial proteins of the three major mitochondrial subfamilies as querie. The mitochondrial proteins of all three subfamilies were compared in the BLASTX search. In addition, the mitochondrial proteins of the subfamily with the highest similarity to mitochondrial proteins of other fungi were also included in the BLASTX analysis. The BLASTX results showed that the highest similarity of the mitochondrial proteins of all fungi was to the mitochondrial proteins of the a-tubulin subfamily of fungi. The highest similarity to the mitochondrial proteins of fungi was shown by the sequences of the mitochondrial proteins of C. albicans and C. neoformans. The mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans are relatively well conserved among other fungi. However, the phylogenetic analysis showed that the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans are not in conflict with those of other fungi and some of the other fungi, suggesting that mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans may be in conflict with mitochondrial proteins of other fungi.

Homology of the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans
To further investigate the function of the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans, we generated a homology search using the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans and C. albicans. The results showed that all the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans were expressed in a KAR1-like background. The results also showed that all the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans were expressed in the YZY (Fig 4A). The results also showed that all the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans are expressed in a KAR1-like background. The results also showed that all the mitochondrial proteins of C. neoformans were expressed in the KAR1-like background.

Antifungal susceptibility of C. neoformans
The MIC susceptibility of C. neoformans for fluconazole was studied using the CLSI broth microdilution assay. The MIC susceptibility of C. neoformans was significantly higher in the presence of amphotericin B (50 µg/ml) than in the absence of fluconazole (1.5 µg/ml). The MIC susceptibility of C.


## Discussion
Additionally, the mitochondrial genomes of . cerevisiae and C. neoformans could be linked to the presence of the NLSs, as well as to the U2, U3, U4 and U5 genes that are involved in NLS biosynthesis. This association could be further substantiated by the comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of these species.

Identification of a novel NLS family in S. cerevisiae

The expression of the NLS family in S. cerevisiae is induced when the cell wall is exposed to a range of stresses, including oxidative and other stresses, such as osmotic and salt stress, and the cell wall is subjected to a range of different pH and temperature stresses (Moss et al., 2007). The expression of the NLS family in S. cerevisiae is highly dependent on a novel NLS (Chen et al., 2011). To identify this family, the protein kinase A (PKC) kinase (PKC1) was tested in the presence of an extracellular pH and temperature sensor (ATP-3) (Jung et al., 2012). This family is highly expressed in response to osmotic and salt stress and is highly expressed in response to osmotic and osmotic shock (Dang et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2012). The PKC kinase complex was activated to respond to osmotic and salt stress and is activated to respond to oxidative stress (Yang et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2010). The PKC family is a group of proteins that are essential for oxidative and osmotic stress tolerance (Reddy et al., 2003). The PKC family is highly expressed in the response to osmotic and salt stress and is involved in oxidative and osmotic stress tolerance (Reddy et al., 2003). The PKC kinase complex is activated to respond to osmotic and salt stress and is activated to respond to oxidative stress (Kong et al., 2011). The PKC kinase complex has been shown to be involved in the response to osmotic and salt stress (Reddy et al., 2003).
