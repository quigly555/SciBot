## Abstract
In this study, we used quantitative PCR to analyze the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-nrL-positivity of isolates obtained from the rhizosphere soil, which were grown on 4 different media (pH 7.0, pH 3.0 and temperature 45 °C). The results showed that the isolates were highly resistant to all the five tested antibiotics. However, two of the species (P. gramminum and P. tuberculose) were highly susceptible to all the five tested antibiotics. In the culture of P. gramminum revealed by the production of pseudohyphae and differential sensitivity of the P. tuberculose isolate to azoles and eczemafluconazole were 0.95 and 0.06%.


## Introduction
Macropinocytosis is a group of membrane-associated macropides, which are classified into two major groups: macrophage-dependent cell death (MD) and macrophage-independent apoptosis [1], [2]. Macrophage-dependent cell death is associated with a functional cell death receptor (CDR) [3] that activates downstream effectors to kill the apoptotic cell [4], [5]. The CDR is a ß-catenin-rich monomeric protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily [6], [7]. The protein is a member of the large family of nonclassical ß-like receptors (NLRs) that are present in vertebrates and eukaryotes, and are involved in a broad range of cell signaling events, including cytokine and chemokine signaling [8], [9]. The NLRs are classified into seven major subfamilies, including NLR1, NLR4, NLR6, NLR9 and NLR10 [10]. The subfamilies are distinct in their functional domains, and each subfamily has a defined functions [11]. The subfamilies have different structures and functional domains compared to their counterparts in other mammalian and non-mammalian mammalian cells [12]. The subfamilies have been studied in different organisms. NLR10 and NLR10-1 have a more conserved structure and function, whereas NLR4 has a more conserved structure and function [13].

In mice, NLR10 and NLR10-1 are expressed in the lung, hepatocytes, renal epithelial cells, and neurons.


## Methods
graminicola and . cerevisiae were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). These strains were maintained on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) at 35 °C for 7 days. The S. graminicola and S. cerevisiae isolate were subcultured on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) at 35 °C for 48 h and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The S. cerevisiae isolate was subcultured on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) at 35 °C for 48 h and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The S. cerevisiae isolate was subcultured on Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) at 25 °C for 48 h. The yeast extract, peptone and dextrose (YPD) (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) were prepared in sterile distilled water.

The composition of the media was as follows: 1 L of distilled water, 2 L of YPD, 2 L of Malt Extract (1% w/v), 2 L of YPD, 0.5 L of Bacto Malt Extract (1% w/v) and 1 L of agar. The cultivation of the yeast isolate was carried out in a shaker at 37 °C. The cultures were routinely inoculated by streaking on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The growth of S. graminicola and S. cerevisiae was evaluated by visual observation. The growth of S. graminicola was assessed by microscopic observation under a light microscope. The mycelial growth was evaluated by growing in YPD broth (0.5% w/v) for 24 h and then in YPD broth (5% w/v) for another 24 h. The mycelial growth of S. graminicola and S. cerevisiae were evaluated by adding 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline to each well of the plate and observing the optical density at the absorbance of the supernatant at 600 nm. The mycelial growth of S. graminicola and S.


## Results
tuberculosis, . aeruginosa, B. amylolentus, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa in combination with the standard antimicrobial drugs and with the metronidazole-susceptible amphotericin B and the tricyclazole-susceptible fluconazole. The highest activity was observed for P. aeruginosa and P. aeruginosa with the combination of 5 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL, respectively. For M. tuberculosis, 5 µg/mL combination of 5 µg/mL was the best with a zone of inhibition of 3.0 mm and zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm, respectively. The best activity was observed for P. aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm, with a zone of inhibition of 3.0 mm and zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm, respectively. The highest activity was observed for P. aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 5 mm with a zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm.

For P. aeruginosa, the combination of 5 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL combination of 5 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL was the best with a zone of inhibition of 6.0 mm and zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm, respectively. The best activity was observed for P. aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 7.0 mm with a zone of inhibition of 6.0 mm, with a zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm and zone of inhibition of 5 mm, respectively.

The antimicrobial activity of selectedion Grains with respect to the fluconazole-susceptible amphotericin B and the tricyclazole-susceptible fluconazole was also evaluated. The highest activity was observed for P. aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 7.0 mm with a zone of inhibition of 4.0 mm, with a zone of inhibition of 6.0 mm with a zone of inhibition of 5 mm, and with the combination of 5 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL, respectively. The highest activity was observed for P. aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition of 7.


## Discussion

The results indicated that chloroform-treated samples had the lowest antimicrobial activity (P < .05) with MIC values of 0.04 and 1.18 µg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 0.06 µg/mL. The total antimicrobial activity of chloroform-treated samples was 1.35 µg/mL (Table 3). The chloroform-treated samples also showed a positive effect on cell viability, while the chloroform-treated samples showed no effect on viability.

In order to assess the antimicrobial activity of selectedions against P. aeruginosa, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 1.04 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 0.04 µg/mL (Table 3). The chloroform-treated samples also showed a positive effect on cell viability, while the chloroform-treated samples showed no effect on viability.

In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of chloroform- and dichloromethane-treated samples, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 1.20 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 0.10 µg/mL (Table 3). The chloroform-treated samples also showed a positive effect on cell viability, while the chloroform-treated samples showed no effect on viability.

In order to assess the antimicrobial activity of selectedions against P. aeruginosa, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform- and dichloromethane-treated samples was 0.18 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloroform-treated samples was 0.15 µg/mL (Table 3). The chloroform-treated samples also showed a positive effect on cell viability, while the chloroform-treated samples showed no effect on viability.
