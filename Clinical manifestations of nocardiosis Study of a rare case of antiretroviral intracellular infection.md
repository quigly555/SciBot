## Abstract
The Aptima species is a member of the Zygomycota phylum. It is commonly associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ophthalmic diseases. However, the complete genome of the species is not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to sequence the whole genome of the Trichosporon species and determine its transcriptome in order to gain insight into its metabolic traits in a comparative genomics approach. Two different approaches were used to generate a bibliographic profile of the trichosporon genome and analyse the variation among isolates.


## Introduction
The pathogenic fungi in the genus Candida have evolved a complex pattern of biofilm formation and adhesion to host tissues and may be responsible for more than 100,000 life-threatening infections and deaths each year worldwide [1]. Candida albicans is a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal and reproductive tract [2]. The pathogenic ability to transition from one planktonic state to another is regulated by multiple factors, such as adhesion to host cells, the integrity of the cell wall, biofilm formation, cell wall remodeling, and remodeling of the cell wall [3,4].

The biofilm is a complex structure composed of diverse microbial communities [5]. C. albicans biofilms are characteristically polymicrobial communities, which often form in vivo structured communities [6]. In vitro studies using a variety of culture-based methods have shown that C. albicans biofilms are characteristically organized and maintained by different microorganisms [7].

Microorganisms that have the ability to form biofilms are defined by the characteristic of the biofilm. The characteristic is characterized by the existence of microbial cells embedded within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) embedded in the cell wall [8,9]. EPS can be either the primary or secondary form, depending on the experimental setups [10]. The composition of the EPS matrix can vary, and the composition of the biofilm can be determined by many factors, such as the size of the biofilm, the degree of EPS matrix polymeric substance (PSP), and the presence of certain enzymes that are present in the matrix [11].

The type of EPS matrix used in the biofilm is crucial in determining the virulence of C. albicans [12]. The formation of C. albicans biofilms by Candida biofilms has been extensively studied [13-15]. In vitro biofilm formation by C. albicans has been studied using a variety of media, such as Aga-Matic (Matic), Agrobacterium tumefaciens, AgaThermo, AgaYeast, AgaStar, and Acrylamide, as well as solid media containing glucose, calcium, and vitamin D [16-18].


## Methods

In addition to these four etiologic criteria, a total of 17 malignancies, including candidiasis (.5%), sepsis (4.6%), pneumonia (3.7%), septic shock (2.6%), cryptococcosis (2.4%), pulmonary aspergillosis (1.6%), and septic shock (1.3%), were reported in this study. The most common malignancy was pneumonia with positive serum cryptococcal antigen.

In total, 22 cases of thrombocytopenia and 16 cases of nosocomial malignancies were identified in this study.

4.5. Anomalous Cryptococcal Antigen
The antigens detected in the serum samples of these patients were: cryptococcal antigen (CAT; 6 × 10^6 cells/mL); ß-D-glucan (BXG; 1 × 10^7 cells/mL); fluconazole (FLU; 1 × 10^6 cells/mL); amphotericin B (AMB; 1 × 10^6 cells/mL); penicillin and streptomycin (Pen; 1 × 10^5 cells/mL); and voriconazole (VRC; 1 × 10^5 cells/mL). These antigens were analyzed using latex agglutination technique (LACO; IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG_2a, and IgG_2b; IgG_2b and IgG_2c; and IgG_2d and IgG_2e; respectively).

4.6. Viral Culture
Four patients with a known clinical infection of the abdomen, thorax, and thoracic cavity, each with a known infection of the abdomen, thorax, and the trachea (n = 6), were evaluated for their antigens detection by MALDI-TOF/TOF.


## Results
. Identification of A. fumigatus Gene
A total of 8,494,073,337 and 1,929,308 bp of the transformant were generated (Table 1). The transformant was selected based on the sequence of the A. fumigatus FUM1 gene and the original description of the A. fumigatus gene (GenBank ID AY11703) was shown by Wang et al. (2011).


## Discussion
Cryptococcus species are ubiquitous and they are responsible for infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The diagnosis of cryptococcosis is often challenging due to the lack of appropriate clinical and laboratory evidence of infection. In the current study, we compared the clinical and laboratory results of patients with cryptococcosis using the whole-genome sequencing approach. Our data show that patients with cryptococcal infection have a significantly higher CD4 T cell count and significantly lower fungal burden. This finding was not unexpected since the CD4 T cell counts are higher in immunocompetent patients [5]. The CD4 T cell numbers are increased by cryptococcal infection in both immunocompetent and immunocompetent individuals [5, 7]. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of an effect of other immune cells, we did not find any evidence of any immune cells.

Cryptococcal infections are rare and even rarer in the immunocompetent. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common causative agent in the immunocompromised patient population, affecting about 1.6% of the population [8]. In this study, the prevalence of cryptococcal infection was only 1.3% in the patients with CD4 T cell counts =250 cells/µL. This difference in CD4 T cell numbers could be attributed to a lower CD4 T cell count and the better management of cryptococcal infection.

Cryptococcus neoformans infections are a less common cause of immunosuppression in immunocompromised individuals. In fact, in the study conducted by Tenren et al.
