## Abstract
Lepiotapsalion (Ample), a genus of plant endophytic fungi, have been reported as a possible source of a wide range of novel compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antimicrobial and antitumor activities. The aim of the present study was to provide a deeper understanding of the chemical composition of the epiphytic microflora in order to explore the potential of extracts as natural antioxidants and bio-indipendents. In the present study, we analysed the epiphytic microflora extracts in the presence of various extracts and fractions, as well as their physicochemical characteristics and potential as bio-indipendents. A total of 44 extracts, fractions, fractions and fractions were tested against 18 microorganisms. Among them, the extracts showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity was also found to be present in the extracts and fractions. The antitumor activity was found to be present in the extracts and fractions and the antitumor activity was found to be antimutagenic and antimicrobial activities. These results provide a better understanding of the composition of the epiphytic microflora and provide a potential bio-informatics tool for developing novel synthetic antimicrobial compounds.

## Introduction
The first published description of mushroom-forming fungi dates back to about 1950 [1,2]. In the 1970s, Russula species were introduced into Europe and were introduced as endophytes into native forests in the Netherlands [3,4].

Russula species are generally found as ectoparasites or saprobes or symbionts of woody plants in the soil. They are the largest genus of Russula in the Netherlands and form 25-67 genera in the genus. Some Russula species occur in the forest floor [5-7].

Russula species are widely distributed throughout Europe and North America [3]. In the United States, Russula species are mostly found in the Northeast, South, and Western United States [3]. In the southeastern United States, Russula is mostly found in the Upper Midwest and Southwest [3,8-11].


## Methods
As per the culture of aspartic anaerobic bacteria, aspartic anaerobic fungi were inoculated in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus oryzae in the presence of fung. Samples from Aspergillus fumigatus were inoculated in the presence of Aspergillus-Candida-GFP or Aspergillus-Salivarius-GFP in the presence of Aspergillus-Pseudomonas-Fungal, aspergillus-Saccharomyces-Fungal, aspergillus-Bacillisporium-Fungal, aspergillus-Candida-GFP or aspergillus-Candida-Salivarius-Fungal, respectively, in the presence of Aspergillus-Pseudomonas-Fungal, aspergillus-Candida-Salivarius-Fungal, aspergillus-Candida-Salivarius-Fungal, and fungi (Fig 1A) were compared with aspartic anaerobic fungi, aspartic anaerobic fungi, and Aspergillus-Salivarius-Fungal. Samples of Aspergillus-Salivarius-Fungal, aspartic anaerobic fungi, and Aspergillus-Candida-Salivarius-Fungal were considered to be in the presence of Aspergillus-Candida-Salivarius-Fungal and in the absence of Aspergillus-Salivarius-Salivarius-Fungal.

SEM
SEM of Aspergillus fumigatus was examined by SEM with two-dimensional SEM and the samples were prepared and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. The samples were embedded in silica gel with the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by a Philips CM-1000 scanning electron microscope (TEM). Samples were measured in the field of a Perkin Elmer TEM (PerkinElmer, Hocking, UK) and were deposited at the University of Aberdeen, UK.


## Results
atroviride and the . atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents was associated with the fungal host (Fig 3). The antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents was found to be the most significant for the fungal host in all the tests except the antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents.

The antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents was also found to be the most significant for the fungal host in all the tests except the antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents. In all the tests, the fungal host showed the highest antifungal activity (Fig 3).

The T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents were found to be the most significant for the fungal host in all the tests except the antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents. In the fungal host, the antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents was found to be the most significant for the fungal host in all the tests except the antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T. lysosporum antifungal agents.

The antifungal activity of the T. atroviride/T. vincax/T. glabrata/T.


## Discussion
fumigatus showed that the present study had a higher incidence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue (iTBT) than that of Aspergillus s. The present study also showed that the presence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue was more common in patients who had undergone GM therapy (Table 1), which is in line with a study of another Brazilian study [9].

The present study also demonstrated that the risk of GM-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with Aspergillus infection was significantly higher than that of non-GM-infected tissue (Table 2), which is consistent with a study of the Brazilian patients [9]. The present study also demonstrated that GM-associated lymphoid tissue in the present patient had a higher rate than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with Aspergillus infection, which is in line with a study of the Brazilian patients [9].

The present study also demonstrated that the presence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue in A. fumigatus infection was significantly higher than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with Aspergillus infection, which is in line with a study of the Brazilian patients [9].

The present study also demonstrated that the presence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia had a higher rate than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia (Table 3). The present study also showed that GM-associated lymphoid tissue in the present patient had a higher rate than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia (Table 3).

The present study also demonstrated that the presence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia had a higher rate than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia (Table 3).

The present study also demonstrated that the presence of GM-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia had a higher rate than that of non-GM-infected lymphoid tissue in patients with candidemia (Table 3).
