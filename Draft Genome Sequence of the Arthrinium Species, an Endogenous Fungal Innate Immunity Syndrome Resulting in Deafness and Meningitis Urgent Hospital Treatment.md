## Abstract
Phylogenetic studies, especially from diatom-like fungi, represent a valuable source of reliable information for understanding the diversity and ecology of this subphylum. To estimate the diversity and in situ gene expression data, we developed a next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach targeting EST data from the barcodes of ~2,600 orthologous genes in the fungal kingdom. Analysis of the corresponding sequences from the barcodes using RNA-seq revealed that ~30% of the orthologous genes are actively transcribed and transcribed region-specific (TE) content is larger than expected. TE content and content-adjusted to sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy were similar to those obtained by the unsupervised hierarchical search method, suggesting that TE content is an unbiased factor of the total gene expression data, and the comparison with unsupervised hierarchical search is instructive.


## Introduction
The eukaryotic cell wall is a complex organelle that is highly structurally conserved and can be physically modified through various molecular pathways (1). It is present in virtually all eukaryotic cell types including animal, plant, and fungal species. In eukaryotes, the cell wall is composed of many different components that function as physical structures, such as ß-(1,3)-glucan, chitin, ß-(1,6)-glucan, and a-glucan. ß-(1,6)- and chitin are found in all cell types except animals and fungi, whereas ß-(1,3)-glucan is found in all cell types and is essential for cell wall integrity (2). The chitin and chitosan are mainly synthesized in the cell wall by an extracellular pathway that is regulated by chitin synthases and chitin deacetylases. Deletion of the chitin synthase gene leads to chitosan depletion and cell wall damage (3). These cell wall defects are thought to be caused by cell wall stress resulting from the loss of chitin, chitin oligosaccharides, and chitin fragments from the cell wall (4).

Although chitin and chitosan have been extensively studied, the molecular details of the cell wall composition are largely unknown. Several studies on the fungal cell wall have identified chitin, chitosan, and chitosan as the major components of the cell wall (5,6). Chitin is a polymer of ß-(1,3)-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues with a N-acetyl-D-(1,6)-galactofuranosyl linkage at the N-terminus (7). The chitin and chitosan are deposited in the cell wall by different mechanisms than those described for chitin and chitosan. The chitin and chitosan are deposited in the cell wall by the action of three-carbon-5'-hydroxyhexadecyl-N-acetylgalactosaminidic acid (CHHH) and one-carbon-5'-hydroxyhexadecenyl glucosamine (CHHHG) (8).


## Methods

Lectin profiling of the genome of . fumigatus
The genome of A. fumigatus A. fumigatus A2 was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and paired-end reads were generated using the Illumina protocol with default parameters (minimum insert size: 400 bp, maximum insert size: 500 bp, total insert size: 50 bp). Illumina paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome of A. fumigatus (Fumigatus fumigatus strain) using a custom perl script and the Illumina reads were mapped to the genome of A. fumigatus (Ana. fumigatus strain) using a custom perl script. The mapped reads were binned into bin2 file using the python script nucmer and then the mapped reads were binned into bin3 file using the python script nucmer. Then the reads of the same size were binned into bin4 and the reads of the same size were binned into bin5. The paired-end reads were mapped to the genome of A. fumigatus using the python script nucmer2 and the mapped reads were mapped to the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The reads of the same size were binned into bin1 and the mapped reads were binned into bin2. Then the mapped reads of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The reads of the same size were binned into the genome of A. fumigatus using the python script. The read of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The reads of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The reads of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The mapped reads of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script. The mapped reads of the same size were binned into the genome of Ana. fumigatus using the python script.


## Results
Three Arthrinium species were isolated from the Netherlands, and one species was isolated from the US. A genome sequence comparison between the two Arthrinium species revealed that all the three Arthrinium species were highly similar (p = 0.05) (Figure 5). The genomic data from the three Arthrinium species were very similar to each other and, therefore, the gene was not annotated in the genome sequence of the other species. In addition, we found that the genomes of the two Arthrinium species had a very similar PDB-database and contained a large number of pseudogenes. Furthermore, we found that the Arthrinium species were highly similar to each other and, therefore, they were not included in any of the other species. However, the six other species were not included in any of the six species. The genome of the six other Arthrinium species had a more detailed PDB-database and contained a larger number of pseudogenes. Additionally, we found that the genomes of the three Arthrinium species had a different genome sequence (Figure 6). The genomes of the two Arthrinium species had a more detailed PDB-database and contained a large number of pseudogenes. Therefore, these six species were not included in any of the other species.

The Endogenous Fungal Innate Immunity Syndrome Resulting in Infection and Death in Eastern Germany
The endogenous fungal immunity system is known to be involved in host defense against other pathogens. It is also involved in fungal pathogen-host interaction (PHI) and pathogen virulence (PHI-V) in different host species. In the Netherlands, we isolated the genomes of the three Arthrinium species from three different locations: Germany, the Netherlands and the USA. Three Arthrinium species were isolated from the Netherlands, and one species was isolated from the USA. The genome sequence comparison between the two Arthrinium species revealed that all the three Arthrinium species were highly similar (p = 0.05) (Figure 7).

We found that the genomes of the three Arthrinium species contained a large number of pseudogenes. Therefore, these six species were not included in any of the other species.


## Discussion
These patients may have had underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that required extensive medical treatmen. The type and location of the patient's organs may have contributed to the development of the infection. The fungus was isolated from the subcutaneous fluid of one patient, which was also infected with A. pullulans. It is unclear if the patient's organs were infected with the fungus or if the patient had other underlying diseases. A type of antifungal therapy was administered for two patients, who had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The diagnosis of A. pullulans was made by the isolation of the fungus from the subcutaneous fluid of the patient. The fungus was found in the subcutaneous fluid of one patient. The patient's organs may have been infected with the fungus. The fungus was isolated from the subcutaneous fluid of two patients. The patient's organs may have been infected with the fungus. The fungus was isolated from the subcutaneous fluid of the patient.
