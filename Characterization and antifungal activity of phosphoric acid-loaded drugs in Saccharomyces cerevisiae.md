## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a pulmonary mycosis endemic to Latin America. Unlike the mycobacterial pathogens responsible for PCM, P. brasiliensis has not been used as a human food source. Using Aspergillus nidulans as a human food source and P. brasiliensis yeast extract as a human mycotoxin, we investigated the toxicity of yeast extract to human mycobiota.

We isolated and partially purified phenylalanine-6-phosphate (PAP) and palmitate-6-phosphate (PAP6) from the dried P. brasiliensis extract. The PAP extracts were prepared using a dry shake flask and hydrolyzed with protozoic ammonium acetate. The presence of PAP extracts was analyzed by pyrosequencing using broth and try-fermenting broth microplates. The PAP extracts were fractionated with boiling water and characterized by gas chromatography.


## Introduction
The phosphoric acid-loaded . cerevisiae drug phosphorylates the protein phosphatase calcineurin, thereby inhibiting calcineurin activity and thus affecting the growth of yeast cells [20]. The phosphorylation of calcineurin by phosphorylates phosphatase calcineurin is required for fungal growth and the virulence of Candida albicans [20]. The phosphorylation of calcineurin by phosphorylates phosphatase calcineurin has been shown to modulate the yeast cell morphology and growth [20, 21]. The phosphorylation of calcineurin by phosphorylates calcineurin in C. albicans has also been shown to be required for the formation of biofilm [21]. It has been reported that phosphorylation of calcineurin by phosphorylates phosphatase calcineurin is required for the formation of biofilm in C. albicans [21]. The phosphorylation of phosphatase calcineurin by phosphorylates calcineurin has been shown to be required for the formation of biofilm in C. albicans [21]. The phosphorylation of phosphatase calcineurin by phosphorylates calcineurin has been shown to be required for the formation of biofilm in C. albicans [21]. The phosphorylation of phosphatase calcineurin by phosphorylates calcineurin has been reported to be required for the formation of biofilm in C. albicans [21].

Phosphatases are enzymes that are responsible for the hydrolysis of cell membranes and facilitate the transport of molecules across the cell wall. Phosphatases are found in all eukaryotic kingdoms and are conserved among different proteins and are involved in the formation of specific structures and functions. They are divided into three main groups: the basic enzyme, phosphatases, phytase and phosphatases. In fungi, phosphatases are mainly catalytically active enzymes, with the exception of the phytoene transporter, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the lignin polymer [12, 21, 22]. The enzymes are classified into two families: the general and specific phosphatases [23]. The enzymes catalytic domains are highly conserved, and all enzymes contain at least two amino-acid sequences.


## Methods
For the assay of the antifungal activity of phosphoric acid-loaded drugs, yeast cells were grown in liquid YPD broth at 30°C for 24 . The culture supernatant was harvested, diluted to a final concentration of 1×10^7 cells/mL, and then the assay was performed as previously described [9]. For the antifungal activity of the phosphoric acid-loaded drugs, the cell suspension was adjusted to a final concentration of 1×10^7 cells/mL and then the assay was performed as previously described [9].

Preparation of mating type and mating type-selective substances
Yeast cells were grown in liquid YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS. The mating type-selective substance was prepared by mixing the mating type of the mating type-selective substance (Pd_1 and Pd_2) with the mating type-selective substance (Pd_1 and Pd_2) as previously described [7]. The mating type-selective substance (Pd_1 and Pd_2) was dissolved in DMSO. The sterile distilled water was added to the mating type-selective substance (Pd_1 and Pd_2) and incubated for 24 h at 30°C. The mating type-selective substance (Pd_1 and Pd_2) was then diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 1×10^8 cells/mL, and then the assay was performed as previously described [7].

## Results
As shown in Fig 3, phosphoric acid was used to induce Candida growth in a mammalian host (hCMEC. The phosphoric acid-loaded drug was inactive against the Candida species tested. On the other hand, phosphoric acid-loaded drugs (2, 3, and 5 µM) were effective in the treatment of Candida spp. by employing the hypoxemic phase (SOHO_3) medium, which is a well-established medium for the establishment of cell-cell adhesion and the maintenance of viable cells.

As shown in Fig 4, phosphoric acid-loaded drugs were effective in the treatment of Candida spp. by employing a hypoxemic phase (SOHO_3). However, the treatment of Candida spp. with phosphoric acid did not induce a significant antifungal effect. Therefore, it appears that the phosphoric acid-loaded drugs could be used as a novel approach to the treatment of Candida spp. in the treatment of C. albicans.

As shown in Fig 5, the phosphoric acid-loaded drugs showed antifungal activity against Candida spp. using the hypoxemic phase. The antifungal activity of the phosphoric acid-loaded drugs against Candida spp. was evaluated by using a mouse model of invasive candidiasis.

Inhibition of Candida spp. by phosphoric acid-loaded drugs
In order to evaluate the antifungal activity of the phosphoric acid-loaded drugs, the different concentrations of phosphoric acid-loaded drugs were tested against C. albicans. As shown in Fig 6, phosphoric acid-loaded drugs showed antifungal activity against C. albicans.

## Discussion
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to produce phosphoric acid (PSA) as a molecular chaperone and suppress oxidative stress through inhibition of the MAPK cascade (49, 50. In addition, the yeast strain S288c (S288c strain ATCC 10231) is also known to synthesize PSA, which is a small molecule with antimicrobial properties (51). In this study, we investigated the effect of phosphoric acid in S. cerevisiae.

The phosphoric acid (PSA) is a membrane-bound protein that is found in plasma membrane and plasma cell membranes and is mainly present in the plasma membrane. It is an essential lipid and a component of the plasma membrane, which is vital for the normal growth and development of the organism (52). In the present study, we examined the effects of phosphoric acid on the activity of the cell membrane in S. cerevisiae cells grown in serum. The results showed that the phosphoric acid (PSA) was more active in the cell membrane of yeast cells grown in serum than in S288c cells, indicating that this protein has a functional role in the cell membrane.

Protein phosphatases are classified into a class of classes by the amino acid sequence similarity. In mammals, phosphatases are synthesized by different enzymes in response to changes in external environment, such as the environment of the body (53). In yeast, PSA is produced by diverse enzymes, including phosphatases (54). In S. cerevisiae, the phosphatases A and B are involved in cell membrane integrity and cell adhesion, respectively (55). In the present study, the phosphatases A and B were involved in the cell membrane integrity and adhesion in S. cerevisiae. PSA was the most active phosphatase, while the phosphatases A and B were not involved in the cell membrane integrity. We speculated that the phosphatase activity in yeast cells was due to the phosphatidylinositol (PI3K) and isoprenoid (PI3P) kinase activities, respectively, as described in previous studies (56). The increased activity of PI3P was reported in the present study. However, the results showed that the increased activity of PI3P in S.
