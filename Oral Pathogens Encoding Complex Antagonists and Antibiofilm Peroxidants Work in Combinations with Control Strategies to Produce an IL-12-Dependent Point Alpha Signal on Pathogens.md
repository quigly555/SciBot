## Abstract
The genus Neocosmospora is presently treated as a monophyletic group in Adelphi, after which it becomes narrowly circumscribed. However, all filamentous fungi belonging to this group can be studied and considered as a monophyletic group. Many of them can be considered as members of this genus. In this sense, they are regarded as important genera that can be found in addition to their polyculture counterparts. Three genera, not traditionally included in the genus Neocosmospora, are now treated. These include genus-defining fungi that have been hitherto treated as non-monophyletic. The genus Cladosporium is treated as belonging to the latter genus. The genus Mortierella, on the other hand, is treated as belonging to the former genus. The genus Pseudolespora, on the other hand, is treated as belonging to the former genus. The genus Cladosporium, on the other hand, is treated as belonging to the former genus. A monograph on the genus Neocosmospora, based on surveys of specimens deposited in different laboratories and with the specific focus on Cladosporium, provides context for the discussion of the genus within the genus.


## Introduction
The basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of human fungal meningoencephalitis (1). The burden of disease is thought to be as high as 70% in immunocompromised individuals (2). Infection with C. neoformans occurs by inhalation, leading to pulmonary disease and meningoencephalitis in an immunocompromised host. Once in the respiratory tract, C. neoformans can disseminate from there into the central nervous system, resulting in cryptococcoma meningitis (3,4).

Although the pulmonary and meningoencephalitis are considered the two major forms of cryptococcal disease, cryptococcal meningitis in otherwise healthy hosts is less common. However, with increasing immunosuppression, the frequency of immunocompromised hosts has increased, leading to more frequent cases, especially those with diabetes and immunosuppressive medications (5,6). Some cases of cryptococcal meningitis are asymptomatic and can reactivate rapidly. However, in immunocompromised hosts, cryptococcal meningitis can progress to pneumonia and affect the central nervous system (CNS) and be fatal.

Cryptococcal meningitis is estimated to affect more than 235,000 people per year (7). The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system and the lungs. However, in immunocompromised hosts, it can progress to pneumonia and mortality rate is as high as 30%. In addition, the outcome of patients with immunosuppressive medications, especially with long-term treatment, is very poor (8).

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of cryptococcal meningitis has been poor.


## Methods
Each treatment was also tested using three different drugs, which were then added to a single drug: fluconazole (FZ) and caspofungin (CAS), or caspofungin and flucytosine (CAS), and then tested separatel. We calculated the effects of treatment type, frequency, and number of patients on each of the tested drugs.

2.4. Oral Drugs and Antibiofilm Peroxidants
We tested various oral antifungal agents in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the treatment of ICZ and PPD. The combined effects of these drugs were investigated and compared with the control groups. We performed the quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNase Hx) with the SYBR Premix Reagent (Tli RNase Hx) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was extracted using the TriZOL RNA Purification Kit (Zymo Research, Inc., USA). The RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The relative quantification of mRNA was determined using the Quant-iT RNA 6000 Nano Drop instrument (Invitrogen, USA).

2.5. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
The RNA was extracted from the oral antifungal agents as described previously (Saitou and Wang, 2014). The total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The RNA quality and concentration were determined by the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and the RNA concentration and quality was determined by the Bioanalyzer (Bio-Rad, USA). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies, USA).


## Results
oryzae [9], was also shown to be involved in the regulation of pathogenicity in human pathogens [14. The mRNA expression of the HSP70 gene was recently shown to be up-regulated in M. oryzae in response to environmental stress [15]. Thus, the HSP70 gene could be a potential target of antifungal drugs.

Although the gene expression of the HSP70 gene was found to be up-regulated in M. oryzae in response to oxidative stress (Fig 5B) [15], the M. oryzae HSP70 gene also displayed strong differential expression in response to the oxidative stress agent (Fig 5C). In addition, the M. oryzae HSP70 gene was shown to be up-regulated in response to dioxonil (Fig 5D). The M. oryzae HSP70 gene was also shown to be up-regulated in response to SDS (Fig 5E) and amphotericin B (Fig 5F) and was also shown to be up-regulated in response to anionic antibiotics (Fig 5G). The HSP70 gene was also shown to be up-regulated in response to 3-deoxy-butylamine (3-BA) in M. oryzae [16] and to be up-regulated in response to vancomycin in M. oryzae [17].

To explore the potential role of HSP70 in the production of ROS in M. oryzae, the M. oryzae HSP70 gene was transcribed and expressed in the H. uvarum wild type strain during growth on the nitrogen-containing media (S2 Table). The M. oryzae HSP70 gene was expressed in a significantly higher percentage in response to SDS, vancomycin, and anionic antibiotics (Fig 6A). The HSP70 gene also expressed more strongly in response to vancomycin, anionic antibiotics, and anionic antibiotics (Fig 6A). This result indicates that HSP70 might be involved in the oxidative stress-induced oxidative stress response. The expression of the HSP70 gene was also up-regulated in response to the oxidative stress agent (Fig 6B). The expression of the HSP70 gene in the H.


## Discussion
We found that the IL-12-D-producing system is essential for the induction of IL-12p70 and IL-23 production in a . neoformans murine pulmonary infection model. IL-12p70 was found to be required for the secretion of IL-23 and IL-6, and to be critical for the induction of IL-12p70 and IL-23 production. IL-12p70 was also found to be critical for the activation of IL-12p70 and IL-23 production, as previously reported [10], [11]. IL-12p70 expression was also essential for the induction of IL-23 production in C. neoformans. In addition, IL-12p70 was found to be involved in the degradation of IL-10 and IL-3, which is a known IL-12-mediated immune response [25], [26]. The IL-12p70 production was not affected by IL-12p70 inhibition, and its secretion was not dependent on IL-12p70. IL-12p70 was required for the induction of IL-10 production and IL-23 production. In contrast, the IL-12p70 production was not affected by IL-12p70 inhibition. Moreover, IL-12p70 was not required for the generation of IL-23 production, nor was it required for the production of IL-10. IL-12p70 is essential for the cytokine production by C. neoformans in response to other stimuli, such as phagocytosis [27]. In contrast, the IL-12p70 production was not affected by IL-12p70 inhibition, suggesting that the cytokine system is essential for the activation of C. neoformans immune responses.

The ability of IL-12 to induce cytokine production has been reported to be critical for the development of cryptococcosis [28]. In C. neoformans, the IL-12p70-producing cytokine IL-10 was upregulated during infection, and IL-12p70 was required for the secretion of IL-12p70 and IL-23 production, respectively. The production of IL-10 was also significantly increased during C. neoformans infection.
