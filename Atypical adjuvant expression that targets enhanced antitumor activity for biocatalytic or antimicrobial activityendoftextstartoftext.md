## Abstract
In this study, we demonstrate that the short (1 min) and long (3 min) peptidoglycan-based analogues 3a-e inhibit C. albicans growth through a wide range of mechanisms, including the use of proteolytic degradation, antifungal activity, and theinic acid production. Our data suggest that the effects of the peptides 3a-e may be related to their antimicrobial and phagocytic activities. Further, these peptides 3b-e might act as novel, individually novel compounds with potential pharmacological and pharmaceutical applications.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is the most common Candida species present in the oral and vaginal cavities of healthy individuals, but can be a pathogenic opportunistic pathogen and cause systemic infections including invasive candidiasis, candidemia and even life-threatening candidemia in immunocompromised patients [1. Invasive candidiasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries and the mortality due to Candida infections is high, ranging from 30 to 70% in developing countries [2-4]. Globally, Candida infections are the third most common invasive fungal infections and are responsible for over one million life-threatening infections annually, with most cases occurring in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa [5].

C. albicans is an opportunistic yeast that is able to switch between two different morphological forms, yeast and hyphae, during infection. The switch is regulated by the action of two distinct proteins, cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PDK)-1 and CAMP-PKA, and the transcription factor Cai1, which in response to osmotic stress, activates cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA) to produce cAMP, and upon it, the transcription of the genes involved in the osmotic stress response [6]. cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PDK)-1 is the major cAMP-dependent protein kinase that synthesizes cAMP [7]. The cAMP-PKA signaling pathway involves a series of coordinated events including the release of multiple enzymes, which hydrolyze cAMP, and the hydrolytic enzymes Php1 and Php2, which hydrolyse cAMP [8]. The PKA signaling pathway has been well characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is well conserved from most other fungi [9-11]. In C. albicans, the phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PK) is catalyzed by the Pka/PDK-1 protein kinase, which phosphorylates cAMP [12,13].


## Methods
Thirty-five isolates (Table 1) were obtained from the USA (Table 1) and Japan (Table 1. The isolates were collected from 40 individuals (age range 18-74) living in the southern part of the country, with an average age of 49 years (range: 19-74) [18]. The species names were given in the relevant species names in the relevant reference database and the genera were assigned the new genera in order of taxonomy. The specimens were identified by morphological and physiological methods.

Morphological characteristics
Three specimens were selected from the patients with clinical features consistent with the dermatophytosis seen in the patients with clinical features consistent with dermatophytosis [1].

Morphological characteristics
The specimens of dermatophytosis were examined under an Olympus BX51 microscope at ×10 magnification and with a light microscope at ×10 and ×20 magnification. The specimens were cut into small pieces of ~ 5 mm in size and mounted in 3% KOH solution. After the disinfection, the specimens were observed under a light microscope at ×10 magnification and with a light microscope at ×20 magnification. The specimens were examined under a light microscope at ×10 magnification and with a light microscope at ×20 magnification.

## Results
The topology of the LSU rDNA was similar to that of the Sordariales (Fig 1, clade 60; Fig 2, clade 18.

The main characters of the LSU rDNA tree are shown in Fig 2 and 3. The main characters of the LSU rDNA tree are:

The core genes of the ITS, TUB2, and TEF1 regions were common to all species. Only one set of common genes was found in the ITS (clade 63; Fig 2, clade 19). The TEF1 gene family was well represented in the ITS (clade 34; Fig 3, clade 23) and TUB2 (clade 58; Fig 3, clade 35). The ITS region was unique in the TEF1 gene family and was missing from all other species (Fig 3, clade 31). The LSU region was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was therefore considered as the most likely ancestral state for the set of common genes.

The TEF1 gene family was not well represented in the TUB2 gene family. The TEF1 gene family was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was therefore considered as the most likely ancestral state for the set of common genes.

The TEF2 gene family was in very close proximity to the TEF1 gene family in all species. The TEF2 gene family was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was therefore considered as the most likely ancestral state for the set of common genes.

The TEF3 gene family was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was in very close proximity to the TEF1 gene family in all species (Fig 4). The TEF3 gene family was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was in very close proximity to the TEF1 gene family in all species (Fig 4, clade 29). The LSU region was in very close proximity to the ITS region in all species and was in very close proximity to the TUB2 gene family in all species (Fig 4, clade 33).


## Discussion
The mainstay of this report was to examine the detection of Cryptococcus sp. in bronchial aspirates of immunocompetent patients.

C. neoformans was found to be the predominant species in bronchial aspirates of immunocompetent patients [1]. Cryptococcus spp. was detected in bronchial aspirates of immunocompetent patients with cryptococcosis [13]. Cryptococcus spp. has been reported to be a major cause of invasive fungal infections in humans, especially in HIV patients [14]. This fungus was also identified in bronchial aspirates of HIV-infected patients in South Africa [15]. However, this fungus is rare in patients with C. neoformans infection, which is the main cause of invasive fungal infections in humans [16]. The most common finding in our patient was the bronchial aspirate, which was associated with higher mortality [1].

Cryptococcus spp. has been reported to be the main cause of invasive fungal infections in humans and other immunocompetent patients [13]. The majority of the patients who presented with the invasive cryptococcosis were immunocompetent patients with pulmonary disease [17]. Cryptococcus spp. infections are most frequently associated with the immunocompetent patient population [1]. The majority of the patients with Cryptococcus spp. infections had a history of immunosuppression, suggesting that they had acquired the infection by inhalation [18]. The most common source of C. neoformans infection was inhalation of the fungus. However, pulmonary and bloodstream infections were less common sources. The patient who presented with the bronchial aspirate had pulmonary disease, which is the most common source of infection for C. neoformans, but not for C. gattii.

The most common immunocompetent host was HIV-positive individuals [3]. The patient in our patient had a history of HIV and pulmonary tuberculosis. She was diagnosed as having C. gattii infection because she had a history of immunosuppression and inhaled the fungus. The patient who presented with the bronchial aspirate had a history of immunosuppression and inhaled the fungus. In HIV patients, C.
