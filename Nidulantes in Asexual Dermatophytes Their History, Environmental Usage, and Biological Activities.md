## Abstract
In the present study, we evaluated the effects of TDF (tetrazolo-NVP-N-pinoethyl-flavonesheorbic acid) and its congeners, N-ion (2-epo-NVP-flavonesheorbic acid), on the viability of the fungus Alternaria brassicicola in the absence and presence of epiphytic enzymes (8, 16, and 24 h), and on the viability of the fungus Aspergillus niger in the presence of alanine, guaiwanthiene, and eicosanoic acid. The procedures were performed to determine the concentration of t-N-NVP and their respective fractionation and fractionation methods. The relative activities of Alternaria brassicicola and N-ion in the absence and presence of epiphytic enzymes (8, 16, and 24 h) were determined. The viability of Alternaria brassicola was determined by following the CLSI method, and the relative activities of N-flavone and flurosofasicin were determined. The relative activities of TDF and N-et-N-pinoethyl-flavone in the absence and presence of epiphytic enzymes (8, 16, and 24 h) were determined. The methods were performed to determine the fractionation method and determined the efficacy of each t-N-NVP-N-pinoethyl-flavone and TDF-N-pinoethyl-flavone compounds. The relative activities of Alternaria brassicicola and N-et-N-pinoethyl-flavone in the presence and absence of epiphytic enzymes (8, 16, and 24 h) were determined. The methods were performed to determine the fractionation method and determined the efficacy of each t-N-NVP and their respective methods.


## Introduction
There has been a growing interest in the role that calcium ion homeostasis plays in various physiological processes, including regulation of growth and development [1], [2], [3], [4]. In mammals, calcium ion homeostasis has been broadly characterized in the Ca^2+-calmodulin complex (CaCCH) by the calcium ion channel system [5], [6], [7].


## Methods
Thirty-six studies were obtained from the Chinese Infectious Diseases Research Institute (CIDRI) (Table 1. Thirty-three studies were obtained from the Clinical Laboratory of the Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CFM, Sichuan, China). Twenty-nine studies were obtained from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Sichuan (Yantai, China). Five studies were obtained from the Laboratory of the Veterinary Medicine Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Sichuan (Yantai, China).

Five studies were obtained from the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from which the following were selected: (1) C. albicans ATCC 90020, (2) C. albicans ATCC 90028, (3) C. glabrata ATCC 90030, (4) C. glabrata ATCC 90030, and (5) C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019. These samples were collected from three countries: China, Taiwan, and the U.S.

After examination, the sample was weighed and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then, the samples were diluted in PBS and then plated on SDA. The number of CFU was determined by plating the number of CFU on SDA.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Sichuan (CAU) and the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Sichuan (No. CEA-2012-22). The study was conducted according to the regulations of the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Sichuan. The samples were cultured on SDA, and the results were recorded in the micro-dissection microscope (Microscope EZ-Rite-Ran, Qingdao, China).

Analysis of Pathogenicity
The number of fungal colonies was counted. After the growth of C. albicans, the diameter of colony was measured. The number of mycelial spores was measured.

## Discussion
2014.

The genus Porifera contains species with diverse morphologies, as well as as the ability to grow at high temperatures, and in these cases, the genus is highly sought after. All of these species are saprobes of insect symbionts, and in their habitats, they are often found in the soil, in the air, and in the soil. This is in agreement with our findings of oomycetes. Oomycetes are typically found in the soil, in the air, and in the soil, but have also been observed in the marine environment. The genus Porifera is a group of oomycetes that can grow at temperatures ranging from -10 to -40°C, which is within the range of temperatures in which other oomycetes such as the Hypoxylon genus have been observed (Garnica et al. 2013). The species are saprobes of insects and play a dominant role in the soil (Wu et al. 2010). Their ecological significance is unknown, but their saprotrophic lifestyle makes them particularly interesting as biocontrol agents against fungi (Wu et al. 2010).

It is known that many oomycetes are colonized by other oomycetes, such as the genus Cylindrocarpon (Kawalchuk 1998). It is of interest to learn whether this oomycetous genus is also found in the ocean. It was the first oomycetous genus to be found in the marine environment (Oberwinkler and Hawksworth 1994). In this study, we found four species of O. dulcis, O. manum, O. oryzae, O. parvum, and O. alternata, and we also found O. segobiensis and O. rhodozyma, which are oomycetous fungi that live on and in algae and algae-like organisms (Szalar and Zalar 2010). Other oomycetous genera have also been found in the ocean, such as O. castanei, O. lascauxensis, O. tuberculatum, and O. terebinthifolius (Lév.) (Wu et al. 2009). These species are commonly found in the marine environment, and they have been suggested to be oomycetes (Lév.
