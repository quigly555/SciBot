## Abstract
In the present study, we characterized the potential role of a 1,5-Bene2 derivative of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) class Ia in the inhibition of the fungus Candida albicans by 4-hydroxyl-2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (4-HDH). The compound was first determined by the specific inhibitor of CYP activity, ketoconazole. In vitro susceptibility assays of C. albicans isolates were performed, with the standard strain and 4-HDH, and with a non-targeted polysaccharide such as wheat bran-1,2-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (1,5-DHBA). The susceptibility results indicated that the a-(1,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-hydroxyphenyl 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (1,5-DHBA) had a great effect on the C. albicans MIC of 2.5 mg/mL. Our findings suggested that the a-(1,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-HDH derivative of this molecule might be a potent inducer of caspofungin in C. albicans.


## Introduction
Coordinated expression of virulence factors has been widely studied in the yeast Candida albicans (1-3) and the dimorphic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (4-6). However, in C. albicans, the transcriptional activator and inducer of virulence factors, caspofungin, a well-known drug target, has been recently shown to induce pleiotropic phenotypes (7-10). In C. neoformans, caspofungin was shown to induce high expression of virulence-related genes in vitro and in vivo, as well as high levels of expression of virulence-related genes in vivo (11). In C. albicans, the caspofungin-induced induction of biofilm formation (12) and biofilm formation in vitro (13) were also strongly induced by caspofungin, and these effects were dependent on the virulence-related proteins.

In the dimorphic fungi, the caspofungin-regulated caspase-1-mediated caspase-2 activation, and in C. albicans, the caspase-1-mediated caspase-8 activation, caspase-9 activation, and caspase-9 activation have been shown to be crucial for the induction of virulence-related phenotypes (14-17). In C. albicans, the caspase-9 activation has been associated with caspofungin resistance (18).


## Methods
In vitro analysis of chitosanase activity was performed on Cryptococcus neoformans (WT, n = 3, n = 3 and n = 3 in all experiments) using the method of Conoper and Paterson [60] with the following modification. Briefly, Cryptococcus neoformans cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1× PBS. After addition of 25 mM citrate buffer (pH 7.4), the cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was collected and mixed with 25 mM citrate buffer. The concentration of chitosanase was determined using a quaternary assay. Briefly, Cryptococcus neoformans cells were cultured in 96-well microplates at a density of 1 × 10^3 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO_2. The assay was performed using a Microtiter plate reader (Mettler Toledo, Toledo, OH, United States) at 600 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths. The experiment was repeated three times. The mean value of each time point was calculated. The percentage inhibition of chitosanase activity was calculated by subtracting the mean values of the 3 and 5-min experiments.

4-hydroxyanone extraction
C. neoformans cells were cultured in 96-well microplates at a density of 1 × 10^3 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The assay was performed in RPMI-1640 with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The cells were cultured in an orbital shaker at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The culture medium was removed from the wells and the culture supernatant was collected.


## Results
neoformans, a chemical inhibition was performed on the hydroxyanone fermentation performance of the three different microorganisms strain. The maximum of this inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 1 mM of hydroxyanone and at a concentration of 4 mM of hydroxyanone. In addition, the MIC_50 was 4 µg/ml and MIC_50/MIC_50 were 0.5 µg/ml, and 0.3 µg/ml, respectively (Table 4). The MIC_50/MIC_50 was determined by MIC_50/MIC_50 (Table 5). The in vitro hydroxyanone concentration was lower than the concentrations of in vitro hydroxyanone used in the in vitro hydroxyanone fermentation, which was the case in all three tested strains (Table 5). Therefore, the MIC_50/MIC_50 value was 4 µg/ml and the MIC_50/MIC_50 value was 1 µg/ml, and thus, the MIC_50/MIC_50 was 1 µg/ml.

In order to verify the in vitro hydroxyanone fermentation performance of C. neoformans, a concentration of 4 mM hydroxyanone and a concentration of 4 mM of hydroxyanone was used. The in vitro hydroxyanone concentration was 2.1 µg/ml, the in vitro hydroxyanone concentration was 4.9 µg/ml, and the MIC_50 was 0.03 µg/ml. The in vitro hydroxyanone concentration was 5 µg/ml, the in vitro hydroxyanone concentration was 3.8 µg/ml, and the MIC_50 was 0.5 µg/ml. These results indicated that in vitro hydroxyanone fermentation is a promising and efficient means to improve the in vitro hydroxyanone fermentation performance of C. neoformans.
