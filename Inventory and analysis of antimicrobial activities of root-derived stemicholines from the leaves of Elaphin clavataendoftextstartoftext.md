## Abstract
Here, we present a case of a young female with AIDS presenting with a right low-grade thyroid nodular ultrasound and bone marrow aspiratio. Although the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed by cerebral VLF spiking/cytotoxicity, the patient was successfully treated by surgery. However, post-operative complications including percutaneous abscesses, inflammatory lesions, and granulomatous lesions led to the discontinuation of surgery and subsequent onset of pseudotumour illness. The administration of flucytosine and amphotericin B resulted in a significant improvement in the neurological outcome. This case study illustrates the importance of the administration of antifungal prophylaxis during a period of chemotherapy in a young patient with HIV infection and concurrent opportunistic infections.


## Introduction
. Treseder and Mazzola, 2007; Mazzola and Perfect, 2011). Plimipila are usually found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In Europe, they are mostly found in the Northern part of the world (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and the Canary Islands) and in the southern part of the world (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and the Northern Territory of Australia). In North America, they have been mainly recorded in the North-West region of the USA and Northern Mexico (e.g. Lewis, 1909; Lewis, 1916).

A variety of dispersal routes have been proposed for Plimipila species. Some of these are inanimate objects, such as human skin, hair, feathers, or even plants (e.g. Quigley, 1954; Vogel, 1964; Vogel, 1988). Others are long-distance dispersal routes, including wind, rain, salt, air, pressure gradients, and water from lakes (e.g. Vogel, 1980).

Plimipila species are known for their ability to move by alighting, which can be accomplished by short, florid, and ramen-style transportation (Qi and Liao, 1999). Florid transport is used to disperse several species of Plimipila, including Plimipa, which is considered as the most successful transportation system in South Asia (Qin et al., 2006). Ramen-style transportation systems have been proposed for the transportation of various crops, such as tomatoes, wheat, olives, soybeans, cassava, etc. (Himmel, 1981; Himmel, 1993; Lips et al., 2010; Wijayawardene et al., 2016). Ramen-style transportation has been found to be more efficient than ramifying transport systems for the transportation of a variety of crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and rice (Lips et al., 2010).

The most important factor influencing the transportation of Plimipila species is their capacity to grow above 40 °C. Previous studies have suggested that this capacity is important for their survival in the environment (Petrini et al., 2014).


## Methods
In addition, sporulation of the . fumigatus strain Af293 was induced by growing the S. fumigatus strain in MM for 5 days at 37°C in a shaker incubator (70 rpm). The sporulation ability of the S. fumigatus strain Af293 was monitored by inoculating 1 × 10^4 spores of the S. fumigatus strain Af293 and checking the hemolytic activity.

Preparation of p-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) for the generation of P-nitrophenyl transferase
pNPG [39] was prepared from 1 mg of p-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) with 0.05% Tween 80 as described by [40]. In brief, 1 mL of a 0.05% Tween 80 was added to 1.5 mL of MM. The mixture was incubated at 37°C, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 with 1 M HCl. The mixture was then diluted with sterile 0.85% NaCl, and the mixture was then spread onto MM plates. Plates were incubated for 10 days at 37°C in a shaker incubator. Afterward, the growth of the P-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside (P-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside) mutant was evaluated by incubation of the fungus in MM for 5 days at 37°C.

For the generation of the P-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside (P-nitrophenyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside) for the generation of P-nitrophenyl transferase, a 10 mM stock solution was prepared in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.


## Results
The 2,024 proteins were grouped into 7,635 distinct functional categories (Table 1) and were functionally classified into 53 categories according to the . cerevisiae GO classification scheme (Table 2). This approach identified 22 protein-coding genes (Table S2). The GO functional categories were related to metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy, transcription, protein fate, and carbohydrate binding (Table 2). The GO biological process categories were related to metabolism, protein fate, and carbohydrate binding (Table 2). We identified a total of 14 gene models for both the proteomic and transcriptomic datasets. We focused on the metabolic and biochemical processes that were most highly represented in both the proteomic and the transcriptomic datasets.

The pathway analysis of the proteome of W. ichthyophaga (W. ichthyophaga) revealed a total of 434 pathways in both the proteomic and transcriptomic datasets. Most of the pathways were enriched with protein kinases and transporters, and the pathways that were most enriched in proteins involved in the immune response, are presented in Table 3. There were a total of 82 pathways in both the proteomic and the transcriptomic datasets. The pathways enriched with homologs of genes in the human, plant, and animal kingdoms were enriched in the proteomic dataset. The pathways that were enriched in the human, plant, and animal kingdom were enriched in the transcriptomic dataset, and the pathways that were most enriched in the human, plant, and animal kingdom were enriched in the proteomic dataset.

The proteomic and transcriptomic datasets were compared to a list of 8,014 known W. ichthyophaga proteins from the S. cerevisiae proteome [23]. The proteome was divided into 6,534 proteomic and 9,101 transcriptomic datasets. The S. cerevisiae proteome contained 11,724 proteins, of which 7,918 proteins were conserved across the proteome and 8,851 proteins were unique to the proteome. The proteins with the highest homology to W. ichthyophaga were related to metabolic pathways, cellular processes, and molecular functions (Table S3). The biological processes involved in the metabolism of proteins were grouped into 9 pathways in both the proteome and the transcriptome (Table S3).


## Discussion
Both genera are characterized by the production of asexual sporangiophores (teleomorphs, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and by the production of asexual sporangia (sexes. Species of Endotheca are usually associated with plants and plant-associated fungi in temperate regions. Other species of Endotheca have been isolated from plants (e.g., C. cablin and C. cladosporioides), but no such association has been observed in any of the investigated samples. Some species of Endotheca are often found in soil, but they are only known from the soil-exposed grasslands, which do not have Endotheca as a partner. We also observed the occurrence of sexual sporangia in this study.

In the case of C. cladosporioides, we identified three new species, C. crescentus, C. ducae, and C. globosa, and a new species, C. chevalieri, which was not previously identified. Although C. globosa is a known basidiomycete, the sexual morph of this species has not been described in any soil or plant-associated fungi. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and LSU sequences of the ITS and LSU regions of the ITS and LSU regions of the LSU regions of the ITS and LSU regions of the C. globosa sequences identified two new species, C. chevalieri and C. ducae. C. ducae was originally identified in the genus Endotheca, and is morphologically similar to C. globosa, but is distinguished by its simple and asymmetrical sporangiophores (Fig 1).

C. chevalieri was first reported in the genus Endotheca (Gómez-Sánchez et al. 2017). Since then, it has been reported in many other genera. C. chevalieri is known for its fruity fruity character, especially in bean and rice-like plants (Tran et al. 2014), while C. globosa has fruity fruity character, especially in soybean (López et al. 2018). The difference in fruity character between the two genera is because of the morphological differences of the same genus (López et al. 2018).
