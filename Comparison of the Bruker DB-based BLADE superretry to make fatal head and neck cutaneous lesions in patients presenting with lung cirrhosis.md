## Abstract
The functions of the human complement system are to maintain the balance between the body's complement molecules and the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) produced by the natural complement of the host's cells. These molecules are important for the control of infections and diseases.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease caused by two main species: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. C. neoformans is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals, whereas C. gattii is primarily a respiratory pathogen. Infection occurs by inhalation of infectious propagules (desiccated yeast cells) from the environment. The lungs and central nervous system (CNS) are the major sites of infection and are the main sites of invasion. The fungus will generally invade the brain, skin, bones, and joints, if left untreated. If left untreated, the infection can lead to meningoencephalitis (mitral form), meningoencephalitis with or without cerebral involvement, and/or encephalitis (cervical or spinal).

C. neoformans infection is caused by two varieties of the yeast, var. grubii and var. neoformans. The var. grubii variety causes disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, whereas the var. neoformans variety causes disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompromised individuals. The most prevalent serotypes in the two var. grubii species, var. neoformans and var. gattii, are responsible for the majority of infections worldwide. While serotype A and var. b are responsible for most disease, serotype D and/or AD hybrids are increasingly common in the overall outbreak.

The clinical manifestations of cryptococcosis vary according to the geographic region. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, in India, South America, and Australia, cryptococcal meningitis is seen in up to 70% of cases [1]. In Brazil, cryptococcal meningitis is seen in up to 50% of immunocompetent individuals.


## Methods
Chemistry
The compounds were synthesised according to the methods of P. C. Alsayed and N. El-Sheikh. The components were obtained from the following plant species: cabbage (C. albicans), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis sp.


## Results
Cultivation of P. brasiliensis Pb01 strains
Pb01 strains were isolated from various hosts. They were cultivated in wheat straw (Table 1) and, on the basis of their phenotypic characteristics and molecular analysis, the P. brasiliensis Pb01 strains were chosen for the study. All strains of P.


## Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that the in vitro induction of apoptosis was induced in human colon cancer cells after exposure to plant extracts (S. officinalis, S. officinalis or B. subtilis) for 24 h. In vivo, we used cell lines to examine the response of cancer cells to the B. subtilis extracts in vivo. We found that the B. subtilis extracts induced the apoptosis of tumor cells, but not in vitro. The B. subtilis extracts inhibited the growth of tumor cells and significantly inhibited the cell proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Moreover, our results indicated that B. subtilis extracts could be used as a cancer treatment for colon cancer patients.

Although the B. subtilis extracts from different parts of the world were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of plant extracts on tumor cells, their respective antifungal activities have been studied in different studies. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo antifungal activity of the B. subtilis extracts using two different cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BMD-MB-232, as well as MDA-MB-231 and BMD-MB-232. The results of the antifungal activity of B. subtilis extracts on human breast cancer cells were studied in detail. The results of the antifungal activity of the B. subtilis extracts were similar to that reported by Goh and colleagues [4]. However, the antifungal activity of the B. subtilis extracts in the same cell line MDA-MB-231 and BMD-MB-232 was different than the results reported by Goh and colleagues [4]. For example, in MDA-MB-231, the B. subtilis extracts induced the apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vitro, whereas in MDA-MB-232, the B. subtilis extracts induced the apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vivo [4]. The antifungal activity of the B. subtilis extracts in the same cell line MDA-MB-231 and BMD-MB-232 was also different than that reported by Goh and colleagues [4].
