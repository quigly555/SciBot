## Introduction

## Methods
Briefly, 25 g of agar plugs (.5 mm diameter) were impregnated with 10 mM H_2O_2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. After incubation, the agar plug was washed with 50% ethanol to remove non-adherent bacteria. The CAT assay was performed with a UV lamp at 120 mW for 12 h and recorded at 570 nm as the color change in the dark at a rate of 10 nm/h for 20 min. The CAT assay was performed with a column of 10 µm of size (0.25 mm × 0.25 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) on an UltiMate 3000 RSLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) using a 1.0 mL reaction volume of water (95% methanol). The column temperature was held at 80 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the standard curve was calculated using the standard curve method. The CAT assay was performed in triplicate and the results are expressed as µmol.g^-1 dry weight.

Effect of pH on CAT activity
The CAT assay was performed with a pH-adjusted solution of 0.1 M H_2SO_4 at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at a rate of 6.0 mL min^-1 and the absorbance was measured at 660 nm using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the standard curve was calculated using the standard curve method. The CAT assay was performed with a pH-adjusted solution of pH 6.0 at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 562 nm using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the standard curve was calculated using the standard curve method. The CAT assay was performed with a pH-adjusted solution of 7.0 H_2O_2 at room temperature.


## Results
mojavensi. The M. mojavensis, M. heveae, M. oryzae, M. chrysogenum and M. ochraceum species were recently reported to have a high carbon source utilization [16]. In order to identify the carbon source sources of the M. mojavensis and M. chrysogenum species, the carbon source utilization profiles were compared using the model system. In this study, the carbon source utilization profiles of the M. mojavensis and M. chrysogenum species are presented in Fig 3. The carbon source utilization profiles were compared using the diethylamine pathway. The carbon source utilization profiles were also compared using the hexane-pyrazolium pathway. The carbon source utilization profiles are presented in Fig 4. The M. chrysogenum species were compared with the M. oryzae species to predict the carbon source sources of the carbon source utilization profiles of these two species. The results revealed that M. oryzae and M. chrysogenum species are highly carbon source-consuming and therefore, the carbon source utilization profiles of these two species could be described as the hexane-pyrazolium pathway. The M. oryzae species are highly carbon source-consuming and therefore, the carbon source utilization profiles of these two species could be described as the hexane-pyrazolium pathway. The carbon source utilization profiles of M. oryzae and M. chrysogenum are presented in Fig 5. The M. oryzae species were compared with the M. chrysogenum species to predict the carbon source utilization profiles of these two species. The results revealed that the M. oryzae species are highly carbon source-consuming and therefore, the carbon source utilization profiles of these two species could be described as the hexane-pyrazolium pathway.

## Discussion
For example, we used the BIOLOG method to analyze the carbon reduction process, which is the main method for estimating the redox state of aquarists [43. In our study, we found that the dihydrochlorocellulose (DHC) pathway (EC 1.3.1.21) was the main carbon source for carbon dioxide (C2) in aquarists. In contrast, the biomass biosynthesis and the aquaculture (EC 2.4.1.2) were the main carbon sources for carbon dioxide (C2) in aquarists.

In this study, we observed that the heterotrophic microalgae C. terricola and N. caninum have a carbon-reduction process similar to that of the dihydrochlorocellulose (DHC) pathway in aquarists (Table 1). The heterotrophic microalgae C. terricola and N. caninum have a dihydrochlorocellulose (DHC) pathway (EC 1.3.1.21) in aquarists, which is the main carbon source for carbon dioxide (C2) in aquarists. However, the dihydrochlorocellulose (DHC) pathway is not found in the heterotrophic microalgae species. This could be due to the fact that heterotrophic microalgae species are more adapted to the nutrient supply.

The presence of heterotrophic microalgae species in aquarstopper marine aquaria is likely due to the fact that they can be biotrophic. However, the species and their biotrophy has not been reported in aquarstopper aquaria, especially in the last decade. The biotrophic microalgae species are mainly found in the EEC1 (EC 1.3.1.2) and EEC2 (EC 1.3.1.2) pathways in aquarstopper aquaria. In addition, the species of heterotrophic microalgae are mainly found in the DHC1 (EC 1.3.1.2) pathway in aquarstopper aquaria, which is the main carbon source for carbon dioxide (C2) in aquarstopper aquaria.
