## Abstract
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an inflammatory, life-threatening disorder characterized by unregulated hyperactivation of immune system cells and uncontrolled activation of the immune system resulting in paradoxical hypersensitivity, restricted/unusual behavior, and decreased homeostasis. It is characterized by uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including myo-inositol, myo-spcNA, and cyto-inositol, in response to various stimuli. HLH can be managed in the therapeutic and fatal form, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxazol, or hydrocortisone, as well as in the curcumin and cyclophosphamide (CRM) management regimens, which has been shown to be generally less effective. However, HLH can also be managed in the progressive and fatal form, with the use of a combination of highly selective trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and CRM, or with the use of combination therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and CRM, as well as maintenance therapy. HLH is typically treated with immunosuppressant, such as dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide. HLH is uncommon in animals, and animal models have been recently exploited. Our goal was to develop a treatment regimen that mimics human HLH in several clinical aspects and, ultimately, to determine the best modulatory agent for animal models.

## Introduction
The advent of modern medicine and the modern use of medical implants have transformed the way we live and work. As a result, the number of people with various health conditions has increased substantially, including many immunocompromised patients. The most common chronic and severe conditions are inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer. They can also be found in patients with other chronic conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, trauma, and cancer. It is expected that the number of immunocompromised patients will increase. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and its subtypes are responsible for about 70% of all HIV-related infections and, in general, about 30% of all HIV-related infections in developed countries [1]. In addition to these infections, HIV-infected patients have been reported to have a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers, and chronic inflammatory pain, where the HIV-1 subtype causes diarrhea and vomiting and the HIV-4 subtype causes knee joint inflammation, which results in lumbar puncture, abscess, or prostatic abscess [2]. In addition, the infection is more common in patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and certain types of cancer. This has been observed in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, severe burns, and cancer [3].

According to a previous study, HIV infection is a major risk factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with severe gut diseases. The incidence of IBD is not increased by dietary restriction, which causes a decrease in gut bacteria. The lower gut bacteria levels are associated with a decrease in the expression of gut-associated proteins, including gut-associated proteins [4].

There are various factors that can induce the development of IBD, including diet, immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, or stem cell therapies. However, the gut microbiota can also be implicated in the development of IBD, as it is the dominant source of the gut microbiota.


## Methods
Each substrate was prepared by mixing a spore suspension (1 × 10^5 spores/mL) of . albicans and C. neoformans. Inoculum (20 µl) was added to each well of the well and the plates were incubated at 37°C. After 24 h, the biofilm was washed with 10% of ethanol and the absorbance of the biofilm was measured at 570 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The test was performed in triplicate.

Biofilm formation was quantified using a colorimetric assay developed by the Candida biofilm assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Candida biofilm assay kit includes an initial 2-h incubation of the biofilm in a 4% of ethanol solution, followed by a 0.5% of ethanol solution for the first 48 h and a 0.5% of ethanol solution for the second 48 h, followed by a wash in distilled water solution and a final wash in distilled water solution. The colorimetric assay is based on the formation of a black film (a light-yellow film, as previously described [25]) on the biofilm after 2 h of biofilm formation.

2.3. Phytochemical Profile of aqueous and Liquid Planktonic Compounds
The P. brasiliensis crude extract of P. brasiliensis (200 g/liter) was used as a standard for the assay. The P. brasiliensis yeast extract was added to the P. brasiliensis crude extract and the medium was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The P. brasiliensis yeast extract and the P. brasiliensis conidial suspension were inoculated into wells of a 96-well microplate. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the medium was aspirated from the wells, and the P. brasiliensis yeast extract was added to the medium and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 5 h. The P. brasiliensis conidia were then removed by washing the wells with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The P. brasiliensis yeast extract and the P.


## Results
In the natural polyphenol-containing media, the fungal cells are typically dispersed throughout the mediu. After germination, the fungal cells are immersed in the culture medium (7-9) or in a liquid medium (12). We recently demonstrated that the acidification of aqueous solvents by high-affinity acid-phase is an important feature of fungal polyphenol-containing media [6]. We have observed that the formation of colonies by yeast-like yeasts on polyphenol-containing media (7) is similar to the fungal colonies formed on natural polyphenol-containing media (12) (Fig 6A,B). The acidification of polyphenolic compounds by fungal cells in the presence of high-affinity acid-phase is a major fungal colonization process.

The fungal colonies formed on natural polyphenol-containing media (7) were predominantly associated with the hyphae of the ciliate cells (Fig 6C). The ciliate cells were associated with the fungal hyphae of the luminal cells and the yeast-like cells (Fig 6C,D). The colony formation of the ciliate cells (8) was accompanied by the formation of hyphal aggregates, which were associated with the hyphal cell walls (Fig 6E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,Q,R,S,T,U,U,W,X,Y,Y,Y,Y,Z) (Fig 6G,H). The formation of the hyphal aggregates by yeast-like cells was observed as a strong indication for the formation of hyphal aggregates by the fungal cell walls (Fig 6E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,Q,R,S,T,U,W,X,Y,Y,Z). The formation of the hyphal aggregates by yeast-like cells was also observed by confocal microscopy (Fig 6H).


## Discussion
pseudomallei and . subtilis. As shown in Table 2, the biofilm-forming B. pseudomallei strain showed significantly increased biofilm formation compared to the planktonic strain, and this biofilm-forming strain produced significantly less polyphenolic compounds than the biofilm-forming B. pseudomallei strain. The biofilm-forming strain produced significantly more polyphenolic compounds than the biofilm-forming strain, and this polyphenolic compound significantly increased the cell size of B. pseudomallei compared to that of the planktonic strain. Furthermore, the biofilm-forming strain produced significantly more polyphenolic compounds than the biofilm-forming B. pseudomallei strain, which were similar to the results of the same study conducted with A. tumefaciens [22]. These results are in agreement with the results obtained with other Candida species, where the species of the genus Candida exhibited significantly higher polyphenolic compounds than the species of the genus Candida [21].

The antifungal activity of polyphenolic compounds has been reported for several Candida species, with MIC values ranging from 64 to 256 µg/mL for C. albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei [22]. However, the MIC values for C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis were higher than the MIC values of the polyphenolic compounds, which were in agreement with the results obtained with the Candida species. Although the data presented here suggest that the polyphenolic compounds produced by the biofilm-forming B. pseudomallei strain are less potent than the polyphenolic compounds produced by the planktonic B. pseudomallei strain, the biofilm-forming strain produced significantly more polyphenolic compounds than the biofilm-forming B. pseudomallei strain. The biofilm-forming strain produced significantly more polyphenolic compounds than the biofilm-forming strain, which were similar to the results obtained with the A. tumefaciens species.
