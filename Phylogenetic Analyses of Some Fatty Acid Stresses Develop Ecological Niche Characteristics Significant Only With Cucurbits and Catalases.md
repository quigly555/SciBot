## Abstract
Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum is one of the most important diseases of wheat that affects the “Golden Syndrome” of wheat. To control FHB disease, it is necessary to develop new strategies to combat the fungus. The use of biocontrol agents (bioemulsions) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional commercial applications in the last few but still problematic crop diseases (e.g.


## Introduction
 2003; Cavazos et a., 2003; Patel et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2011). In the case of acetic acid, it has been proposed that FA is a structural component of eicosanoids (Patel et al., 2011). FA is a complex complex polypeptide, which is highly abundant in the lipid bilayer and in the lumen of membranes (Cavazos et al., 2007). It is also found in lipid droplets in various organisms and was shown to be present in the extracellular compartment (Patel et al., 2011). It has been reported that acetic acid contains several isoforms, which are different from the fatty acids present in eicosanoids. The FA isoform is present in the extracellular compartment of Gram-negative bacteria, while the acetic acid isoform is present in Gram-positive plants (Garcia et al., 2008). It has been reported that acetic acid contains two isoforms, which are different from the acetic acid isoform of eicosanoids (Patel et al., 2011).

FA contains about 50% of its dry weight in acetic acid. The length of the acetic acid isoform and its distribution in the extracellular compartment of gram-negative bacteria are different from those in eicosanoids (Cavazos et al., 2003). Acetic acid contains two isoforms: the acetic acid and acetic acid. The total amount of acetic acid in the acetic acid isoform is about 10-fold smaller than eicosanoids (Cavazos et al., 2003). This isoform, named acetic acid, is mainly present in Gram-negative bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baylyi, Acinetobacter phenobarb.com, Acinetobacter graminis, Acinetobacterovus esterus and Acinetobacteric acid (Bayley et al., 2001). The latter is a highly virulent Gram-negative bacterium and causes infections in humans (Patel et al., 2011).


## Methods
cerevisiae Cell Cycle via Biochemical Conditions Producing Fatty Acid Metabolites Synthesized by Phospholipase Reaction, which Produces Oxidative Oxidation by Glycerases
A series of chemical reactions that produce polyunsaturated fatty acids as carbon sources (carbon-active enzymes) were studied in a similar wa. In brief, the reactions were carried out by boiling the proteins of S. cerevisiae for 10 min and cooling the mixture to room temperature. The reaction mixture was boiled at 100°C for 5 min to obtain a dry protein mass (H_2O). The dry protein mass was dried, weighed and stored at -20°C for future use.

To prepare the dried protein mass, the sample was mixed with a solution of 1 ml chloroform (CHCl_3) and cooled to room temperature. The solution was then diluted with distilled water to obtain a final protein concentration of 1 × 10^6 per ml. The mixture was mixed with a solution of 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and heated at 100°C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then heated to 95°C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. The samples were then subjected to drying and freeze-drying. The proteins were then dissolved in H_2O, and dried at 100°C. To prepare the precipitate, the sample was mixed with a solution of 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and cooled to room temperature. The solution was then added to a solution of 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was then subjected to drying and freeze-drying. The precipitate was then dissolved in absolute methanol, and stored at -20°C.

The fatty acid mass was quantified according to the method of Réphéry et de Vétérina (1957). The samples were dissolved in methanol and kept at -20°C. The analysis was performed according to the method of Béthard et Ménévlie (2008). The samples were diluted in a mixture of methanol and methanol-saturated solution. The samples were then heated to 95°C for 5 min, and cooled to room temperature.


## Results
We have also observed that some of these polysaccharides are high in energy, which may contribute to the observed phenotypic diversity of . neoformans and C. gattii, respectively. For example, the polysaccharides mannan, and mannan and alcohol are also known to be a good source of energy, but their glycolysis is usually not completed. Many polysaccharides, such as mannan and alcohol, are known to be converted to alcohol by the ß-oxidation pathway (67, 68). However, mannan and alcohol have not been reported to be the primary sources of energy in C. neoformans and C. gattii, respectively.

The proteome analysis of the C. neoformans C. gattii C. neoformans var. grubii C. gattii var. neoformans (Fig 3) showed that the average number of proteins in the cgi, the vast majority of which were found in the mitochondria, was significantly higher than that of the mitochondria of the non-typhoid human pathogen, C. albicans (Fig 4A). In contrast, the average number of proteins in the cgi was significantly lower than that of the mitochondria of the non-typhoid human pathogen, C. albicans (Fig 4A). These results suggested that the difference in mitochondrial metabolic profiles may reflect differences in protein metabolism in the two different pathogenic conditions.

The C. neoformans C. neoformans var. grubii C. neoformans var. neoformans (CNB) genomes differ in a number of respects. First, C. neoformans var. grubii C. neoformans var. neoformans (CNB) genome contains large number of genes involved in metabolism of glycolysis and the synthesis of allantoin (Fig 3) and is also known to be a poor cell wall producer (69). However, the genome of C. neoformans var. grubii (CNB) contains only few genes for glyoxylate metabolism and no genes for glyoxylate-N-acetylglucosamine-dehydrogenase (GT) (Fig 3). The C.


## Discussion
These fatty acids are either fatty acids with a-helices, esters with a-helices, or esters with ß-CA. All fatty acids with a-helices are either short chain (ß-CAs) or esters with a-helices (ß-CAs) with esters. A higher degree of aconitase activity was observed for the fatty acids with SSFAs (p = 0.001) and CAs (p = 0.001) compared to those with a-helices (ß-CAs). Some of these fatty acids were characterized by esterase activity, and the a-helices were esters with ß-CAs.

The preference for SSFAs over ß-CAs was also observed for fatty acids with SSFAs and CAs, with an average activity of 0.12% for a-CAs and 0.16% for a-CAs. Similar activity was observed for long chain fatty acids, with an activity of 0.2% for a-CAs and 0.3% for a-CAs. The esters with SSFAs were active at 0.06% for a-CAs and 0.02% for a-CAs. This preference was observed for C-CAs, whereas the esters with ß-CAs were active at 0.00% for a-CAs and 0.00% for a-CAs. The activity for SSFAs and CAs was also higher for SSFAs and CAs, while the activity for long chain fatty acids was higher for SSFAs and CAs.

There was no preference for the use of CAs and SSFAs for fatty acid selectivity, with an activity of 0.14% for a-CAs and 0.07% for a-CAs. The esters with SSFAs and CAs were active at 0.00% for a-CAs and 0.00% for a-CAs.
