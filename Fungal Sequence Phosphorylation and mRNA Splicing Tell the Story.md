## Introduction
The intron is predicted to be conserved across the fungal genome and shows some variation throughout the genome. This is an important finding. There is no evidence that the fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron. The first sentence of the subsection headed “The fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”.

The second paragraph of the subsection headed “The fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”.

The fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “The fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”.

The final paragraph of the subsection headed “The fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”.

The last paragraph of the subsection headed “The fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”

Minor points:

The title of this article is inappropriate, the bioinformatics should be Acrobatics and not Englishable. The title should read “Acromechtonalia and the fungal genome encodes for a conserved intron”.

The description of the molecular phylogenetic analysis of the rDNA loci should read as “The rDNA region is located in a conserved and non-conserved intron within the fungal genome. The rDNA loci was surveyed for rDNA amplicons from multiple strains of different fungal taxa and found to be more diverse than the published phylogenetic analyses of the rDNA loci. As a consequence, the rDNA region is highly divergent from the rest of the genome, it should be carefully considered for comparisons with the available rDNA sequences from other fungal taxa”.

Minor comments:

The N-terminal region of the rDNA operon should read as the following:

Proper N-terminal amplification and sequencing of the rDNA operon should be performed. The rDNA operon should be amplified and sequenced using a technique that yields the most complete rDNA library. Amplification should be performed in an on-plate sterilized protein reaction. The rDNA operon should be paired with a PCR platform that produces a fluorescent protein. The PCR products should be sent to amplicons processing steps that may include the detection of fungal DNA.


## Methods
oxysporum isolates was extracted from seven . oxysporum isolates (inoculum A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), as previously described [18, 19]. In brief, all samples had been frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fungal samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and the DNA was extracted using a phenol-chloroform method (37:30:4, v/v/v). The concentration of each DNA sample was estimated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The extracted DNA was used for the extraction of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, with the exception of ITS1, which was amplified by PCR with the primers ITS1f and ITS4 (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGAGGAAGTAA-3') [20]. PCR was performed with a 10-µl reaction volume using the following thermocycler conditions: denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplicons were purified using an Illustra GFX PCR DNA purification kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The purified PCR products were treated with NucleoSpin-ET (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and the concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

For the ITS-LSU region, the DNA samples were digested with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting DNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quantity of DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The extracted DNA was analyzed on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).


## Results
rhododendri complex (Table 2. T. rhododendri sequences were used to analyze the phylogenetic relationship of the well-known and emerging species T. reesei, T. gondii, T. reesei-mammalian species, and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi. The proteome of the T. reesei complex was sequenced to determine the signal-protein interactions and determine the overall phylogenetic tree of the proteome of the T. reesei complex. The T. reesei and T. reesei-mammalian species are well-characterized as opportunistic pathogenic fungi with no known pathogenicity. T. reesei, T. reesei-mammalian species, and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi all form well-characterized groups, whereas T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi are characterized by very short and even very long branches. T. reesei-mammalian species are characterized by a very long branch. The T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi are highly diverged and almost identical to each other. The T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi are phylogenetically closely related with T. reesei-mammalian species. The T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi have a very similar phylogenetic tree, whereas the T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi are genetically very distant. The T. reesei-pathogenic fungi are phylogenetically very distant from T. reesei and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi, but they are genetically closely related to each other. The phylogenetic tree of the T. reesei-mammalian species and T. reesei-pathogenic fungi (Fig 2) revealed that the T. reesei-pathogenic fungi formed well-characterized groups (Fig 2). The T. reesei-pathogenic fungi were found to form two well-defined well-characterized groups, one group consisting of T. reesei-pathogenic fungi and the other one containing T. reesei-pathogenic fungi. The T.


## Discussion
fumigatus and . nidulans are associated with RNAi, we used the RNAi-based approach. In the A. fumigatus RNAi analysis, we used the pI2F mutation in the contig (Figure 2) and in the A. nidulans genome (Figure 3). The PIV curve from RNAi-based approaches shows similar patterns to those found in the RNAi-based analysis of fungal genomes (Figure 2), suggesting that the PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi is similar to that found in A. nidulans, A. fischeri, and N. crassa [27].

Our RNAi-based analysis showed that PIV was similar to that of S. cerevisiae, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fumigatus and A. nidulans [27]. The PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi is similar to that of A. nidulans, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fumigatus and A. nidulans [27], and the PIV structures of A. fischeri and A. nidulans are similar to that of A. fischeri [27]. We also found that the PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi was similar to that of A. nidulans, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fischeri and A. nidulans [27].

Our RNAi-based analysis also revealed that the PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi was similar to that of A. nidulans, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fischeri and A. nidulans [27]. The PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi was similar to that of A. nidulans, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fischeri and A. nidulans [27]. The PIV structure of A. fumigatus RNAi was similar to that of A. nidulans, which is in agreement with the RNAi results of A. fischeri and A. nidulans [27], and the PIV structure of A.
