## Abstract

HIV-1 RNA levels, treatment response and outcome were assesse.

Among HIV-infected adults with acute onset of fever, HIV RNA levels were lower in severe malaria infection and had increased proportions. Patients had higher CD4+ T cells, lower peripheral blood monocytities and more frequent spontaneous leukopenia. Multivariate regression analysis revealed higher HIV RNA in the acute stage (CD4+ T cell counts = 350 cells/µL [2.5% (2/3)], = 4.87 cells/µL [1.37 (1.87), = 1.95)]; advanced stage (CD4+ T cell counts = 50 cells/µL [2.5% (2/3), = 4.89 cells/µL [1.17], = 3.01), and late stage (CD4+ T cell counts = 50 cells/µL [2.5% (1/2), = 4.67 cells/µL [1.17], = 3.99), of the remaining 2.3%. In multivariate regression analysis, HIV RNA decreased significantly in the acute stage (CD4+ T cell counts < 350 cells/µL [1.4% (1/2), = 3.05 cells/µL [1.05], = 3.19 cells/µL [1.09), and late stage (CD4+ T cell counts = 50 cells/µL [1.4% (1/2), = 4.97 cells/µL [1.17], = 4.85) with treatment response being significantly better than placebo.

HIV RNA increased significantly in the acute stage and in stage and late stage (CD4+ T cell counts < 350 cells/µL [1.4% (1/2), = 3.05 cells/µL [1.05], = 3.19 cells/µL [1.09), and stage and late stage (CD4+ T cell counts < 50 cells/µL [1.4% (1/2), = 3.05 cells/µL [1.05], = 3.19 cells/µL [1.09), and HIV RNA decreased significantly in the early stage and stage, respectively.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among persons with immune dysfunction [1], [2]. TB is an intracellular bacterium that causes a highly lethal disease, TB meningitis, which is associated with a high morbidity and mortality [3]. In the past two decades, the incidence of TB has increased dramatically, and the number of life-threatening cases has increased significantly [4]. Although there is a lack of data on the virulence factors of TB, genes encoding surface molecules that regulate its pathogenesis have been identified [5-7].

The ability of surface molecules to regulate the pathogenesis of TB is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of TB because the ability to induce the cell to cease apoptosis upon infection is essential for the pathogen to establish a successful infection [8]. In addition, surface molecules can induce apoptosis by interacting with the immune system [9]. Some of the most important virulence factors of TB are the bZIP proteins, and their association with the host cell membrane are crucial for the pathogen to invade and survive the host [10].

The bZIP proteins are small molecules that bind to the cell surface and form a microbicidal membrane. In bacteria, the binding of bZIP proteins is mediated by the Fc farnesyl moiety protein (FcaS) [11], [12]. The binding of FcaS to the plasma membrane in the presence of bZIP proteins results in cell death, and hence the ability of the pathogen to infect the cell is essential for its survival. The fcaS-binding protein to the bZIP proteins is termed as fcaA, and its interaction with the cell surface results in the activation of the FcaS-binding protein and its inhibition. Moreover, the inhibition of the FcaS-binding protein by FcaA prevents the spread of the pathogen from the cell [12]. Thus, the fcaA-binding protein may be important for the pathogen to successfully invade and survive the host.

A number of bZIP proteins have been identified in bacteria and some of them are important for the pathogen to successfully infect the host [13], [14].


## Methods
Study area and sampling
The study area is located in a region of the central region of Brazil. It is part of the National University of Tucuman (UNU) Campus, which is located in the municipality of Tucuman. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Tucuman.

Morphological and morphological studies
The study was carried out on specimens of sputum of two groups: adults and larvae. Sputum specimens were washed with tap water and immediately frozen in liquid N_2. Sputum specimens were dried with a speed-sterling, placed in a vial with PDA, and stored at -20°C. Sputum samples were placed in a jar and immediately transferred to sterile plastic vials with 20% glycerol. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 weeks.

The morphological features of the specimens were examined with a dissecting microscope.


## Results
%) were male. The most common underlying disease was sepsis and 4 patients (4%) had been on ART for at least 6 months. The median duration of follow-up was 12.9 months (range: 0.6-13.3 months).

Outcome after ART initiation was defined as death by weight loss. Twenty-two (31%) of the 185 HIV-infected patients developed death by weight loss and were classified as having significant sepsis or bloodstream pleocytosis. The most common underlying disease in patients with HIV infection was sepsis or bloodstream pleocytosis (89/185 [39.5%] vs. 6/18 [2.2%], P < 0.001).

The median duration of follow-up was 9.2 months (range: 0.4-11.6 months). The most common underlying disease in patients with HIV infection was sepsis (46/185 [30.9%] vs. 4/8 [2.2%], P < 0.001).

In the first four weeks of follow-up, the median duration of follow-up was 8.9 months (range: 0.6-9.6 months). The most common underlying disease in patients with HIV infection was sepsis (39/185 [20.6%] vs. 25/18 [5.8%], P < 0.001).

In the last four weeks of follow-up, the median duration of follow-up was 9.5 months (range: 0.3-11.5 months). The most common underlying disease in patients with HIV infection was sepsis (32/185 [14.3%] vs. 5/18 [3.7%], P < 0.001).

In the last five weeks of follow-up, the median duration of follow-up was 9.5 months (range: 0.3-11.5 months). The most common underlying disease in patients with HIV infection was sepsis (28/185 [14.3%] vs. 4/18 [3.7%], P < 0.001).

In the last four weeks of follow-up, the median duration of follow-up was 9.5 months (range: 0.3-11.5 months).


## Discussion
In HIV-infected patients, severe respiratory failure was more common in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts, but only rarely in HIV-infected patients with high CD4 counts [21.

Immunodeficiency can cause severe and severe lung disease, and it is also associated with the progression of diseases, including multiple opportunistic infections, neoplastic diseases, and cancer [21]. The development of lung diseases, including invasive pneumonitis and disseminated tuberculosis, may be associated with the development of pulmonary diseases. In our patients, the development of lung diseases was not associated with their CD4 counts. Lung disease was not related to the development of invasive pneumonitis and was not related to the development of neoplastic disease or cancer [21].

Our patients had severe and severe pulmonary diseases. They had other complicated conditions such as cancer, HIV infection, lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and other immunological disorders. Lung disease was not related to the development of neoplastic diseases. Lung disease was not related to the development of cancer and was not related to the development of neoplastic diseases [21].

Tuberculosis is a well-known cause of infection in many different organs including the brain, lungs, intestine, and eye. Tuberculosis is a common cause of chronic lung disease and in most cases, it is associated with AIDS-related diseases. In our patients, there were other factors that were not associated with the development of TB, such as immunological disorders, the use of a broad spectrum antibiotic, or the use of antiretroviral drugs. Our patients did not have any underlying immunological disorders, and their immune system function was normal.

In this study, the patient had no clinical presentation of HIV infection. He had a mild respiratory complaint, cough, and shortness of breath, which may be related to the development of TB, but the diagnosis was not confirmed. The patient did not have any other clinical presentation of TB, and he did not have any other other underlying conditions such as HIV infection, lung disease, diabetes mellitus, or other immunological disorders.

A recent study showed that the severity of tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher in the presence of high CD4 counts and the presence of malignant tumor [22].
