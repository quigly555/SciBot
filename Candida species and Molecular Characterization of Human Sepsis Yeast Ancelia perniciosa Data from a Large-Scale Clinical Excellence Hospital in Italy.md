## Abstract
Infectious meningitis (Infective permanent Mo) is a serious complication in hospitalized patients. In our previous study, Mo were found to be an important prognostic factor in predicting mortality in West Nile virus (WNV) infected patients.

## Methods
. perniciosa was isolated from an adult patient with septic meningitis. The patient was a single-pulmonary adult with acute respiratory failure. The patient had been diagnosed with septic meningitis and had no history of immunosuppression. The patient was a single-pulmonary adult with septic meningitis and had no history of immunosuppressive therapy. The patient was a single-pulmonary adult with acute respiratory failure. The diagnosis was based on criteria described in our previous study [17]. P. perniciosa was cultured from blood samples and stored at -80°C in glycerol glycerol glycerol and stored at -80°C. P. perniciosa was isolated from yeast suspensions and stored at -80°C.

The identification of P. perniciosa was based on culture of serotypes B, C and D of the isolate, and on serotypes A, D and E of the reference strain. The species identification of P. perniciosa was based on isolates of P. abies, P. marneffei, P. nivariensis, P. recumbensi, and P. acutatum, using a standard colorimetric assay (Table S1). The reference strains of P. abies, P. marneffei, P. recumbensi, and P. acutatum were isolated from patients with septic meningitis in our previous study [15]. The strains and isolates used in this study were: C. albicans ATCC 90112 (formerly CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands), C. glabrata ATCC 17803 (formerly CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands), and C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (formerly CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands).

PCR and Illumina sequencing was performed by the University of Technology, Copenhagen using the same primers as in the previous study [15].

Genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification
Genomic DNA was isolated from the culture of P. abies and P.


## Results
Both strains were found to have the typical number of yeast cells, pharyngeal plugs, and round ascospores with typical morphology (data not shown.

The ability of the three strains to colonize the brain was further assessed by an intravenous infection with M. perniciosa in the brain (Fig 2). The four strains were unable to cause any significant brain pathology and the three strains were considered to be stable. The results showed that only one of the four strains was able to cause any clinical pathology in the brain. The two remaining strains were susceptible to the infection in the brain. The brain was found to be healthy and the brain was devoid of inflammatory and inflammatory spots.

To determine the results of the individual strains, we analyzed the brain extracts. Both strains were found to be the same in the brain and the CNS (Fig 3). Both strains had a similar number of yeast cells in the brain and the brain was found to be healthy (Fig 3). The brain samples were prepared from brain cultures and infected with M. perniciosa. The brain samples were inoculated into BALB/c mice at 7 days post-infection (hpi). After 72 hpi, the brain samples were harvested, and the brain samples were processed. A culture of M. perniciosa was used as the positive control. Both strains were found to be the same in the brain, but the brain was found to be healthy and the brain was devoid of inflammatory and inflammatory spots. The brain was found to be healthy and the brain was devoid of inflammatory and inflammatory spots. The brain samples were prepared from BALB/c mice at 7 days post-infection (hpi) and were infected with M. perniciosa. Both strains were found to be the same in the brain and the brain was found to be healthy (Fig 3).

Preliminary Biocontrol and Antifungal Activity
After 12 h of incubation, the three isolates were screened against the antifungal drug fluconazole. The three isolates were found to be active against all isolates tested and were found to be safe and effective against all strains tested. All isolates were also tested for their ability to produce viable colonies.


## Discussion

As shown in Table 3, Sepsis yeast isolates had a higher molecular load than the other three Candida specie. The higher molecular load in Sepsis yeasts is likely related to their ability to survive in the human host. In our previous studies, we used different concentrations of CA and PA to study the potential of Sepsis yeast strain to survive in a human host. However, the results of our study showed that the overall molecular load of Sepsis yeast strain was not significantly different than those of other Candida species. This result indicates that the number of Sepsis yeast species in the present study is not sufficient to analyze the effect of PA on Sepsis yeast.

In our previous studies, we used different concentrations of CA and PA to study the effect of PA on Sepsis yeast strains, but we found no significant differences between the concentrations of CA and PA for Sepsis yeast strains (Table 2). Therefore, we could not classify our results into the same category as the previous studies, but it is worth noting that our results are from a large-scale clinical investigation.

Sepsis yeast strains have been studied intensively in the past for their metabolic and physiological functions. For instance, it was reported that in vitro fermentation of Sepsis yeasts occurred only during the first days of fermentation of wine [23]. We found that fermenting Sepsis yeasts at high temperatures resulted in decreased microbial biomass. However, the amount of microbial biomass decreased gradually in the fermentation of Sepsis yeast. The amount of biomass decreased as fermentation progressed. The fermentation time was determined to be the last day of fermentation of Sepsis yeast. This observation suggests that the fermentation time was a short one, and the biomass and dissolved bacterial content were insufficient to keep the fermentation going. The results of the fermentation time were analyzed by CLSM and Vitek 2 spectroscopy. As shown in Table 4, the fermentation time was the last day of fermentation of Sepsis yeast strain. The fermentation time of Sepsis yeast strain was significantly shorter than that of other three Candida species. This result indicates that the fermentation time of Sepsis yeast strain is not significantly longer than other three Candida species.
