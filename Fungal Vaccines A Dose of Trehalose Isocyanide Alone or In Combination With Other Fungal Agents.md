## Introduction
Sugarcane is a poor sugar crop grown in most countries in the world. The soil is very hard, is poor in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, and so on, that makes it very difficult to obtain valuable crops. Moreover, the soil is very acidic and very poor in oxygen, which makes it very difficult to obtain good quality crops (i.e., cultivars). Hence, there is a great need to cultivate sugar crops in India to improve the productivity of sugar crops. The process of cultivation of sugar crops in India has been done for over a century. It has been done to improve the soil quality in dry conditions, and also for the productivity of sugar crops in dry conditions [1,2,3]. It is a science-based method to improve the productivity of sugar crops, and it is an important aspect of the improvement of the quality of the crops. However, the soil quality of sugar crops in India is severely affected by the cultivation of non-nutrient crops. Moreover, the soil quality of non-nutrient crops in India is very poor, so that cultivation of non-nutrient crops is not possible. Therefore, the implementation of cultivation of non-nutrient crops in India is not possible.


## Methods
. Materials and Methods
Rhodospores were obtained from a clinical isolate of wheat, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (also known as Ch. reinhardtii) (Mueller, W., 1991; W.K. Fuchs, G.C., 2012). The wheat seed culture was obtained from the Agricultural Research Service of China (Beijing) and the cultivar was L. shikai (Shenzhen). The microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 1395. The yeast was purchased from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) and stored at -20 °C. The crude extract was subjected to autoclaving at 80 °C for 30 min, and the extract was used for the analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the obtained compounds were stored at 4 °C.

## Results
neoformans, . graminearum, F. oxysporum, Cryptococcus neoformans, and many other pathogenic fungi. In addition, some pathogens are able to cause aflatoxin infections [25]. The susceptibility of C. neoformans to thiabendazole is known to be severely compromised [26]. The fungicide-resistant C. neoformans strain was used to determine the susceptibility of the remaining four strains of C. neoformans to thiabendazole. The susceptibilities of the four tested strains to thiabendazole were as follows: C. neoformans ATCC 12646, C. neoformans ATCC 13043, C. neoformans ATCC 13509, and C. neoformans ATCC 13509. The susceptibility of C. neoformans to thiabendazole was relatively stable (data not shown).

Pharmacokinetics of aflatoxin
The pharmacokinetics of aflatoxin (aflatoxylate) were measured by ELISA and ELISA. It was first determined in serum by measuring the concentration of aflatoxin in the serum as the sole measure of the concentration of aflatoxin in the serum. The concentrations of aflatoxin in the serum in both groups were significantly different (p<0.05). The aflatoxin concentrations in the group with a strong serum aflatoxin exposure were significantly higher than those in the group with a weak serum aflatoxin exposure (Table 1).

Comparative Analysis of Molar Lipid Content
The lipid content of plasma from the treated and control groups was analyzed by ELISA, and the lipids obtained from the treated and control groups were higher than those of the other groups. The results indicated that the aflatoxin dose was greater than the other dose used for the treatment of fungal infection.

Comparative Analysis of Molar Lipid Content
The Molar lipid content was calculated from the serum and serum aflatoxylate concentrations. The results indicated that the aflatoxylate concentration was higher than the aflatoxylate concentration used in the treatment of fungal infection. The results indicated that the aflatoxylate concentration was higher than the aflatoxylate concentration used in the treatment of fungal infection.


## Discussion
In one large trial, a combination of fungicidal drugs and fungistatic agents reduced the fungal burden in rabbits, and a combination of fungicidal drugs and fungistatic agents reduced the fungal burden in mice [23. In a recent study, a combined treatment with fluconazole alone or in combination with fluconazole in combination with fluconazole in mice showed a significant reduction in the fungal burden in lung and brain [24]. The authors also reported that combination treatment with fluconazole alone or in combination with fluconazole in combination with fluconazole in mice failed to reduce the fungal burden in the lungs of mice [24]. The authors also found that combination treatment with fluconazole alone or in combination with fluconazole in combination with fluconazole in mice failed to reduce the fungal burden in the lungs of mice [24]. The authors also reported that combination treatment with fluconazole alone or in combination with fluconazole in combination with fluconazole in mice failed to reduce the fungal burden in the lungs of mice [24].

In the current study, a triazole vaccine was developed by performing the anti-dsDNA antibody test against the clinically isolated Candida species Candida albicans, and anti-dsDNA antibody test against the serotype C. neoformans strain CD138. This combination resulted in a significant reduction in fungal burden in mice [24]. In a recent study, the authors demonstrated that the combination of antifungal drugs and antifungal agents resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden in mice [24]. In the current study, a combination of antifungal drugs and antifungal agents resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden in mice [24].

The results of the anti-dsDNA antibody test showed that the combination of fluconazole and azole alone resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden in mice. The authors further reported that the combination of fluconazole and azole alone resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden in mice.

The results of the triazole antibody test showed that the combination of azole and fluconazole resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden in mice.
