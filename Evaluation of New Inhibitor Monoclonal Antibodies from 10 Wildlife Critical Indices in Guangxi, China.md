## Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been considered as a socio-economic and medical problem to be borne by indigenous people in the Amazon region of Brazil. However, the biological, psychological, and immunological factors related to ZIKV infection are still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to characterize the association between ZIKV infection and health-related factors, including the immune system, skin lesions, and immune responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms related to virulence and pathogenesis of ZIKV infection. A total of 124 serum samples from 14 patients with ZIKV infection were studied. The samples were subjected to a lateral flow technique in which each sample was incubated with recombinant ZIKV® and named ZIKV® oryzae spp. for 3-5 weeks. High-throughput sequencing was used to detect the genes, protein, and host responseors associated with ZIKV® oryzae infection. Finally, 6 immune-modulatory and immunity-regulatory molecules and 1 conserved protein were identified. Results showed that ZIKV® oryzae spp. have a broad host spectrum and are characterized by immune functions, including inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative responses, and the production of protein-degrading metabolites. This study demonstrates the extent to which ZIKV infection has a putative molecular mechanism related to virulence and pathogenesis, as well as the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in ZIKV pathogenesis. These results open perspectives for future investigations into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in the host of ZIKV pathogenesis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies and neutropenia. The incidence of IFIs is increasing because of the rising number of immunocompromised patients, especially patients with AIDS.1-3 These patients are especially at risk of fungal infections and include invasive aspergillosis, chronic mucormycosis, invasive aspergillosis (IA) and mucormycosis, as well as invasive aspergillosis (IA) and cryptococcal pneumonia.1-3

The most common species causing IFI are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The Candida genus is responsible for over 90% of invasive candidiasis cases in the United States.4,5 The most common invasive Candida species isolated in hospitalized patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis.4,6,7

Inhalation of C. albicans into the ICU is the most common method of infection. C. albicans is most frequently isolated from the oral cavity and from various warm-blooded animals. However, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei and C. dubliniensis can also cause infections in humans.6

The fungus can also cause chronic mucormycosis.7,8 The most serious complication in the lungs is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a syndrome of alveolar hypoperute nephrotoxicity.8,9 The syndrome can be as late as 30 days.


## Methods
Two groups of animals were injected with 20 µL of a saline solution (.05% Tween 80 in saline, pH 7.0) into the footpad of each wild-type and the control, respectively. The mice were sacrificed at the last third after the administration of a 1:1 ratio of saline and a saline solution. The infected footpad was then excised and homogenized in 1 ml of sterile 0.9% saline solution. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000× g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a new vial and then stored at -20°C. The killing activity of the antifungal monoclonal antibodies was measured by the assay of the viability of each fungal strain according to the standard protocol of the Bioteke® Foundation for the Protection of Animals and Plant of Guangxi, and its antifungal activity was evaluated by the method of Fujita et al. [54].

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the Antifungal Monoclonal Antibodies from 10 Wild-Type and Control Animals
All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Guangxi Medical University (No.1, 2010-2012). After blood collection, animals were subjected to sterile and continuous weekly monitoring of body weight, height, and weight loss. The following antifungal drugs were used in the blood collection experiments: fluconazole (FLC), caspofungin (CAS), itraconazole (ITZ), and itraconazole (ITZ).

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the Antifungal Monoclonal Antibodies from 10 Wild-Type and Control Animals
In order to evaluate the antifungal activity of the monoclonal antifungal antifungal antifungal, the following antifungal drugs were used in the blood collection experiments: fluconazole (FLC), caspofungin (CAS), itraconazole (ITZ), and itraconazole (ITZ).

## Results
melanogaster (DMI) assa. Eight of the new antifungal compounds (3-14) failed to inhibit the growth of the laboratory strain of D. melanogaster, resulting in increased mortality (Table 2). The remaining three antifungal compounds were inactive in the laboratory strain (Table 2).

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values for these compounds were determined using the D. melanogaster assay. For compounds 1-4, the MIC_50 value was 0.7 µg/ml and the MIC_90 value was 1 µg/ml for compound 1 and compound 2, respectively (Table 2). For compound 5, the MIC_50 value was 0.5 µg/ml and the MIC_90 value was 0.8 µg/ml for compound 5, respectively (Table 2).

Antifungal Activity of D. melanogaster Antifungal Compounds
The antifungal activity of these antifungal compounds was evaluated using the D. melanogaster assay. The MIC_90 and MIC_50 values for these antifungal compounds were determined using the D. melanogaster assay, as well as the MIC_90 and MIC_90 values for compound 2. As shown in Fig 3, D. melanogaster is a successful fungus, which has been shown to be resistant to fluconazole, caspofungin, itraconazole, and fluconazole-susceptible agents (Chudnitshukov et al., 2017; Klis et al., 2017). The MIC_90 and MIC_50 values for D. melanogaster antifungal compound 1-4 were 0.3 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively (Table 2).

Effect of D. melanogaster Antifungal Compounds on the Internalization of C. albicans

The effect of D. melanogaster antifungal compounds on the internalization of C. albicans was evaluated in the presence of the heparinizing agents caspofungin, itraconazole, and fluconazole. The MIC_90 and MIC_50 values for D.


## Discussion
Our results suggest that the recently developed monoclonal antibody-based therapy of AD is safe, but there remains the possibility of false-positive results, which could affect the efficacy of therap. In this context, the use of polymyxin B may be a suitable option to improve the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.

Finally, we tested two strategies for the development of novel anti-viral therapy for the disease: 1) lipophospholipid drugs and 2) an anti-viral drug target, which has been previously approved for the treatment of C. elegans. Both approaches, however, fail to achieve synergistic effects.

3.2. Antibody Susceptibility Testing
A total of 76 potential anti-viral drugs were tested in the present study, including five monoclonal antibodies, six anti-viral drugs, and seven anti-viral drugs. The results of drug resistance testing for each drug were compared with the drug resistance results for the four monoclonal antibodies. The drug resistance of the monoclonal antibodies was observed in two cases of C. elegans infection (Table). The results indicated that the monoclonal antibodies were resistant to two of the tested anti-viral drugs, with MIC values of 0.4 µg/mL and 0.25 µg/mL, respectively. The results of susceptibility testing for the anti-viral drugs was performed in the present study and showed the resistance of the monoclonal antibodies was not significantly different from the drug resistance.

The MIC values of the anti-viral drugs for C. elegans were in agreement with the results of the susceptibility test for the anti-viral drugs. The results indicated that the anti-viral drugs were highly resistant to the monoclonal antibodies.
