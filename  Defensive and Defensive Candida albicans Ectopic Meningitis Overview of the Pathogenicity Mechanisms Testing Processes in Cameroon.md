The current Amish Surveillance system does not provide for disaggregated data and therefore cannot provide for all data. We propose making the system more equivocal amongst other forms of data, where data is available. Data could be made available and used only for the purpose of providing aggregate data, where data is unavailable. The current system does not provide for the disaggregated nature of the data and therefore cannot provide for all types of data. Data could be made available only for the purpose of providing analysis only.

We investigated factors influencing the persistence of Candida albicans in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and clinical specimens collected during a prospective, observational, cohort study in a large hospital in rural South-East Thailand.

Our study population consisted of 55,041 females and females aged 18 to 60 years, with a median inoculation of 10 colony-forming units/mL. Candida species were isolated from urine specimens collected at 17.9% of ART initiation in this study. The most common isolates were C. albicans (n = 11), C. tropicalis (n = 3) and C. glabrata (n = 2). Candida auris was the most common isolates (n = 30) reported in all CSF specimens collected during the study. The incidence of Candida species persistence was higher for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) candidemia (7.9%) than for urine (13.9%). Other Candida species that were reported in urine specimens were C. tropicalis (n = 23) and C. albicans (n = 15).


## Introduction
Protein-protein interactions are fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells. In this context, fungal protein-protein interactions have long been recognized as important players in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation and cell motility [1]. The important role of fungal proteins in such processes is well known. The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes cryptococcosis, a life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans. Although cryptococcosis is an extremely common disease, fatal cryptococcal meningitis is often reported in patients with immune defects. Furthermore, Cryptococcus neoformans also infects immunocompromised individuals and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients [2]. Cryptococcosis is an AIDS-defining opportunistic fungal infection, which is commonly acquired by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells. In immunocompromised patients, the yeast form of Cryptococcus neoformans can survive inside macrophages and survive in phagolysosomes, resulting in the release of antigens and cytokines that induce cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In vitro studies have demonstrated that C. neoformans can elicit a variety of immune responses [3,4,5,6,7]. However, many aspects of the host-pathogen interaction are still poorly understood, and data regarding the underlying mechanisms are limited. Recent studies have provided new insights into the importance of host-pathogen interactions and shed new light on the life-cycle of the fungus. For example, the in vitro activity of the CMI has been shown to be vital for survival of the yeast form in the host environment [8], as it allows cells to evade macrophage killing and thereby avoid phagocytosis [9]. Moreover, macrophages have mechanisms to recognize fungal pathogens and mediate antifungal defense [10].


## Methods
in the Cluj-e-Bouy District, Cameroon, 2015) was performed as previously described [37. A total of 14 patients with suspected Candida spp. were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of Candida spp. was confirmed by microdilution technique (MIC), as previously reported [38]. The initial screening was performed with Candida spp. in the following combinations: Candida albicans (SAB-14), Candida tropicalis (SAB-11), Candida krusei (SAB-17), Candida glabrata (SAB-17), Candida dubliniensis (SAB-16), Candida krusei (SAB-16), Candida glabrata (SAB-17), Candida tropicalis (SAB-17), Candida glabrata (SAB-17), Candida krusei (SAB-18), Candida albicans (SAB-23), Candida tropicalis (SAB-24), Candida glabrata (SAB-26) and Candida krusei (SAB-26). The Candida spp. infections were classified into four main stages: 0, 1, 2, and 3.

The first stage consisted of Candida spp. in blood, and was characterized by the presence of fungal growth, and the absence of Candida spp. in urine, as well as the presence of Candida spp. in tissues. The second stage consisted of Candida spp. in serum, and was characterized by the presence of fungal growth and the absence of Candida spp. in urine. The third stage consisted of Candida spp. in serum, and was characterized by the presence of fungal growth and the absence of Candida spp. in serum. The fourth stage consisted of Candida spp. in serum, and was characterized by the presence of fungal growth and the absence of Candida spp. in serum.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital of Cameroon Medical University (CEI-CEI-CEI). The patient was identified as P. Charles (CEI-CEI-CEI) and the patient was identified as P. J. (CEI-CEI-CEI).


## Results
In order to evaluate the potential for these factors to contribute to the virulence of . tuberculosis, the inflammatory response system in the airway epithelial cells was examined. In order to confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis in the airways, a thin layer of human epithelial cells was used. The epithelial cells were grown in the presence of both the primary and secondary immune response factors. The cellular infiltration of human epithelial cells was monitored by analyzing the intensity of inflammatory cells. The infiltration pattern of human epithelial cells was different than that of M. tuberculosis. The infiltration pattern of M. tuberculosis was increased in the presence of secondary immune response factors.

2.2. Antibiotics Treatment of C. albicans Infected C. albicans Exposed to Meningitis
Meningitis induced immune activation is a well established model for early stage human disease [11], [12]. In order to evaluate the importance of Meningitis in C. albicans-induced human disease, C. albicans was treated with antibiotics for at least 24 h and then were re-cultured to normoxic controls. As shown in Figure 4, C. albicans treated with AMB and LPS significantly induced the production of cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a, whereas the treatment with AMB and LPS significantly suppressed the production of IL-6 and IL-1ß. Additionally, AMB treatment significantly inhibited the production of TNF-a in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice.

2.3. Antibiotics Treatment of C. albicans Infected C. albicans Exposed to Meningitis
The ability of AMB and LPS to induce IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a was investigated. As shown in Figure 5, LPS significantly reduced the production of TNF-a and TNF-ß in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice. Furthermore, LPS significantly suppressed the production of IL-1ß and IL-6 in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice.

## Discussion
We have previously reported that in vivo, acute bacterial infection induces a strong proinflammatory response to C. albicans (7). This response was accompanied by enhanced phagocytosis and invasion by neutrophils. The host-derived IFN-<U+03B3> is recognized by the innate immune system as a potent innate inflammatory cytokine and by the interplay between T cell and macrophages (21). The optimal and most accurate assessment of the T cell response is based on the definition of a Th1-type subset, including the participation of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-2 (22). Th2 cytokine production is important for Th1- and Th17-dependent T cell responses, as well as the differentiation of Th1- and Th17-differentiated DCs (23). In this study, we observed that the response of C.
