## Abstract
A 44-year-old male with a history of intoxications, repeated drug intoxication, and severe hypertension presented to the emergency room (E.D.A.) at 6:30 p.m. with a five-day history of headache, vomiting, and persistent low-grade fever. He had a history of an Epstienst symbialis infection and was not a licensed producer of Epstienst®. He was under antiepileptic therapy for sepsis. He was found to have acute myeloid leukemia secondary to neutropenia and sepsis. He was treated successfully with intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine. He also had a favorable outcome after an in-hospital course and will encounter similar clinical and radiographic manifestations in future workup.

This case highlights the clinical, etiology, and outcome features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a transplanted kidney. Adrenal nephritis followed by sepsis is a common outcome of an ARDS history.


## Introduction

The first description of a live Vibrio cholerae isolate from a sugarcane brineyard stream (Fig 2) was by Hjortstam (1925. The 16S rRNA gene was first isolated from a vinifera plant (Eucalyptus sp.) and was subsequently isolated from a saline brineyard stream (Gnomeniej et al. 1995).


## Methods

.2. Biochemical Parameters and Biomass
The chemical parameters of the Biomass of the R. venezuelae tree were characterized by the procedures described by Park et al. [26]. The fungal biomass was quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC-1030, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector. GC column (Shimadzu GC-1030, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for mobile phase A (m/z 500-600°C), column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and mobile phase B (m/z 500-600°C) in the flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The mobile phase A and column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were as follows: column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase A held at 60°C for 3 min, column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase B held at 60°C for 5 min, column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase C held at 60°C for 5 min and the column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase D held at 60°C for 5 min. The column temperature was set at 40°C for 5 min and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The chromatographic parameters were as follows: column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase A held at 60°C for 3 min, column (Shimadzu GC-B-2.5, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with the mobile phase B held at 60°C for 3 min and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min.

4.3. Biological Parameters and Biomass Analysis
Cultivation and treatment of P. cholerae was conducted as described by Park et al. [27].


## Results
cholerae and . oleoformans. The ITS sequence of these isolates, designated here as V. cholerae, matched the rpb2 sequences of the isolates of V. parisensis and V. oleoformans and had high similarity to the DNA sequences of the Ascomycota fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of these isolates were identical to the DNA sequences of the Ascomycota fungi C. neoformans (99 %), C. neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of the V. parisensis and V. oleoformans isolates were identical to the DNA sequences of the Ascomycota fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (99 %), C. neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of the V. parisensis and V. oleoformans isolates were identical to the DNA sequences of the Ascomycota fungi C. neoformans (99 %), C. neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of the V. parisensis and V. oleoformans isolates were identical to the DNA sequences of the Ascomycota fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %).

The ITS sequence of the V. parisensis and V. oleoformans isolates matched the rpb2 sequences of the strains of the Ascomycota fungi C. neoformans (99 %), C. neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of the V. parisensis and V. oleoformans isolates matched the rpb2 sequences of the strains of the Ascomycota fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (99 %), C. neoformans (99 %) and Botrytis cinerea (99 %). The ITS sequences of the V.


## Discussion
This fungus is highly abundant in the brines, the same habitat where the current outbreak occurre.

Vibrio cholerae is found in the brines of sugarcane and beetroot, and the fungus is able to grow on the surface of these brines. It is also able to grow in the cell walls of these structures. In contrast to the usual brines, the current outbreak occurred in the brine of beetroot and sugarcane, and Vibrio cholerae was isolated from this brine. These results are consistent with previous reports on V. cholerae and the disease caused by this species [17,18,19,40].

The isolation of Vibrio cholerae from the surface of beetroot and sugarcane brines showed the presence of this species in the same habitat. This fungus is also found in the brines of beetroot and sugarcane, but has not been isolated from the surface of these brines yet. However, in this study, the fungus was found on the surface of beetroot and sugarcane, and the fungus was able to grow in the brine walls of these structures. This suggests that this fungus may have a specific role in the beetroot and sugarcane brines.

The occurrence of Vibrio cholerae in waterborne diseases is a phenomenon which has been observed in many other fungi. For example, this fungus has been isolated from waterborne diseases, such as Plasmodium cholerae [41,42], and from the blood of a cat [43]. There are many other species of this fungus that are able to grow in the brines of waterborne diseases, such as P. graminis [44] and C. albicans [45], and are also able to grow on water. Therefore, we speculate that this fungus is able to grow in the brines of waterborne diseases, as a result of the ability of this fungus to grow in water.

The isolation of Vibrio cholerae from the surface of beetroot and sugarcane brines indicated the presence of this species in the same habitat. This fungus has been isolated from waterborne diseases, such as Plasmodium cholerae, and was able to grow in the brines of beetroot and sugarcane. This suggests that this fungus may have a specific role in the beetroot and sugarcane brines.
