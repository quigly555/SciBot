## Abstract
The fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are known to be highly resistant to various azole drugs and have been shown to develop resistance to common antifungal drugs such as echinocandin and amphotericin. The involvement of the host immune response in the development of azole resistance in these pathogenic fungi warrants further investigation. This study reports on the production of recombinant proteins (RSPs) for the production of TDF and echinocandin antibodies in C. neoformans and C. gattii. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify known proteins and their roles in the development of azole resistance in these pathogenic fungi. RSPs were also used to evaluate the production of TDF and echinocandin antibodies in C. neoformans and C. gattii. Results showed that both TDF and echinocandin antibodies were produced by the RSPs. TDF and echinocandin antibodies were detected in the culture supernatant of C. neoformans. TDF and echinocandin antibodies were produced in the culture supernatant of C. gattii. TDF and echinocandin antibodies were detected in the yeast phase extracts of C. neoformans. TDF and echinocandin antibodies were significantly more active in the C. neoformans phylum than in the yeast phase fractions. These results suggest that RSPs are promising molecules for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in C. neoformans and C. gattii.


## Introduction
The effect of vaccination against Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is synergistic, yet its exact contribution is not know. Previous studies using fluoroquinolone, echinocandin, and megablast showed the vaccination efficacy of aero- and ocular strains against Rhodotorula mucilaginosa [9,10]. The effect of the combination of antiviral drugs is difficult to explain, given that the entire mechanism of action of the antiviral drugs is complex and that the combination of drugs can cause severe side effects, and the deleterious effects are not necessarily due to the single drug combination. Hence, the therapeutic efficacy of the antiviral drugs is not always clear.

Based on the previous studies, we propose the concept of antiviral therapy based on the concept of a synergistic combination of two or more antiviral drugs against a common target: the tumor microorganism. The combination of drugs results in either complete or partial inhibition of the microorganism growth [11]. Thus, the combination of two or more antiviral drugs can be considered a strategy that can either block the tumor microorganism’s growth or direct its growth to another organ or tissue.

The combination of drugs is often divided into two categories, those that act synergistically and those that synergistically block tumor growth [12]. The combination of antiviral drugs in one organ or tissue can result in a tumor microorganism’s activation or activation in another organ or tissue. The tumor microorganism’s growth can be blocked or inhibited depending on the type of the tumor. In this regard, some studies have reported that antiviral combinations can have a synergistic effect against bacterial and fungal infections [13,14]. Although the combination of antiviral drugs has been described in different ways, most of them are based on their interactions. However, some of them have been shown to have a synergistic effect against other pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leishmania major, and Cryptococcus neoformans [15,16]. Moreover, some studies have reported the effectiveness of some antiviral drugs against some bacterial and fungal infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [17,18].


## Methods
flavus strain A1158 (. flavus), which is present in F. graminearum, was isolated from infected insect guts. This strain was then used to induce the cytokine response, i.e., anti-CD45^-/- (clone 5D7; BioLegend) and anti-CD45^-/- (clone 3D5; BioLegend). In the first part of the study, we used this strain to induce the cytokine response. The culture of A. flavus was conducted as previously described. In the second part, the mice were subjected to the same procedures as in the first part of the study. The mice were divided into four groups and received two experimental groups. The mice were treated with 1 µg of each of the tested drugs. The experimental group received 1 µg of H_2O_2 and 1 µg of proteinase K and the control group received the vehicle and 3 mM of DMSO. The experiments were performed with three animals and the results were shown in graphs. The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. In the third and fourth experiments, the mice were treated with 1 µg of each of the tested drugs. The experiment was performed with four animals and the results were shown in graphs. The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment.

2.4. Human Dermatophytes (HDCs)
A. flavus isolate HDC5.1 (A. flavus) was isolated from a mouse lung. A. flavus was cultivated in liquid potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium for 7 days at 37°C. Then, the mycelium was harvested from the culture and inoculated into 200 ml of fresh PDB medium. Then, the mycelium was cultured at 37°C for 6 days. Then, the mycelium was harvested and inoculated into 200 ml of fresh PDB medium. Then, the mycelium was cultured at 37°C for 12 days. Then, the mycelium was harvested and inoculated into 200 ml of fresh PDB medium. The fungal mycelium was harvested and used for the experiments.

2.5. Infection with F. graminearum
One hundred and fifty milliliters of sterile PDB liquid medium was inoculated with A. flavus strain.


## Results
The results showed that TrxD and TrxE were very effective in regulating immune responses in the lungs of HUVEC mice (Fig 3A. Additionally, TrxE and TrxD were shown to inhibit the production of IFN-<U+03B3> by neutrophils in the lungs of HUVEC mice, but not by neutrophils from healthy mice (Fig 3B). These data suggest that T. mucilaginosa-mediated immune responses may be involved in host immunity.

T. mucilaginosa prevents the release of proinflammatory mediators in the lung of HUVEC mice
We next used the monoclonal anti-Ribb/Caspase-1 antibody to examine the effect of the TrxD and TrxE proteins on the release of proinflammatory mediators. The results showed that TrxD and TrxE significantly decreased the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as the LPL, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-10, IL-1ß, and IL-4, in HUVEC mice (Fig 4). The release of IFN-<U+03B3> was also significantly reduced in the lungs of HUVEC mice, with a reduction of approximately 43% in IL-4 release (Fig 4A). However, the release of IL-1ß was significantly decreased in the lungs of HUVEC mice (Fig 4B), suggesting that the T. mucilaginosa proteins may regulate the release of proinflammatory mediators.

T. mucilaginosa facilitates the dissemination of HUVEC by host cells
To further explore the role of TrxD and TrxE in host immune responses, we performed immunofluorescence experiments in HUVEC mice to investigate the effect of the T. mucilaginosa proteins on the spread of HUVEC in the lungs and the dissemination of HUVEC to the central nervous system. The results showed that T. mucilaginosa inhibited the spread of HUVEC in HUVEC mice (Fig 5). In addition, T. mucilaginosa significantly inhibited the dissemination of HUVEC in the lungs of HUVEC mice (Fig 5).


## Discussion
This is the first study to report the incidence and prevalence of CNS fungal infection in adults, in comparison with healthy controls. The incidence of CNS fungal infection in adults was 1.3% and that of Cryptococcus neoformans was 0.8%.

A total of 1,254 (27.6%) cases of CNS fungal infection were reported among adults in Italy. The incidence of CNS fungal infection in adults is considerably higher than the reported incidence in healthy adults (1.3% to 2.8%) [19], which is likely related to the relatively higher incidence of CNS fungal infection in adults. Our patients are likely to have an increased risk of fungal infection.

A total of 806 (19.1%) cases of fungal infection were reported among adult patients with cryptococcosis, which was a relatively high incidence compared with the incidence of cryptococcosis (1.7%) [20].
