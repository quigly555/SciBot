## Abstract
Autophagy is an innate immune response initiated in response to pathogens, mainly Salmonella, Salmonella Typhi, and Salmonella Enteritidis, and also forms the defense against viral infections. It has been proposed that Toll like receptor (TLR) mediated degradation of autophagic proteins, particularly the autophagic granule component, is important for pathogen survival. However, the role of autophagy itself in viral pathogenesis has not been determined. In this study, we found that the expression of TLR7, TLR9, and TLR9A in Cryptococcus neoformans was upregulated upon co-cultivation with diploid and wild-type strain, respectively. In addition, we found that these genes are important for autophagic responses in this fungus. In conclusion, we found that the filamentous form of C. neoformans can survive heat and exfoliation, and degrade diploid and wild-type autophagy proteins during co-cultivation with diploids and wild-type cells.


## Introduction
Antibacterial secondary metabolites have been isolated from various plants, including many red algae, bacteria and fungi, but not fungi from algae. Echinocandins, which inhibit the synthesis of ß-lactams and ß-lactamases, are known as “antibiotic” agents, which have been used in the treatment of infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus gattii [1]. Antibiotics can inhibit the synthesis of ß-lactamases by bacteria, fungi, protozoa and, occasionally, by echinocandins. ß-lactams inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, which is an important component of the fungal cell wall [2]. The production of ergosterol may result in a health issue as the sterol side chain is converted to ergosterol and, consequently, causes the accumulation of toxic compounds in the cell membrane and eventually cellular death [3]. In addition, ß-lactams bind to ergosterol and may inhibit its synthesis [4]. ß-lactamases are also involved in the synthesis of other virulence factors, such as the production of antimicrobial peptides [5], antimicrobials [6], antifungal agents [7], and antiviral agents [8].

A. niger, a saprophytic red-finch mushroom, can be found in tropical regions in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, and was first isolated from the bark of Dactylis gallica (Pseudoviridae, family Dactylis) in 1902 [9]. It was also reported that it has been used for centuries as an ingredient in traditional Chinese food products, such as yuzu, jiangi and jing shui [10]. D.


## Methods
These drugs are often used in the evaluation of antibacterial drugs, as well as to evaluate the effects of different compounds or compounds of interes. The antimicrobial drug stock was obtained from the pharmacy at the Federal University of Maringá, Maringá, Brazil.

Antimicrobial stock was used as a negative control of the test. The test was performed by comparing the amount of the antimicrobial stock in sterile PBS and the same volume of RPMI-1640 broth. The bacteria were cultivated in BHI broth at 37 °C for 24 h. The MICs were determined using the same method as the negative control (without antibiotics).

The determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed as the method of Lopes et al. [16]. The test was performed in 96-well plates in a total volume of 200 µL. The wells were coated with 0.1% crystal violet and the absorbance was read at a wavelength of 490 nm. The fluconazole (FLZ) and amphotericin B (AMB) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The MICs were determined using the same method as the negative control.

In addition, the inhibition by the combination of these antimicrobials was performed on the growth of C. albicans ATCC 10231 in RPMI-1640 medium at 37 °C.

Screening of Candida-Associated Drugs
C. albicans ATCC 10231 was cultured in BHI broth at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the bacterial culture was diluted with RPMI-1640 medium and spotted on the solid medium, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The color of the microorganisms was determined by the color of the medium. Then, the checkerboard method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the tested drugs.

The checkerboard method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the tested drugs on the control of Candida by the antimicrobial agents. In this method, the experiment was conducted in duplicate and repeated with the same result. The antifungal activity of the tested drugs was determined by the checkerboard method. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated with the same result. The activity of the tested drugs against C. albicans was determined by the checkerboard method.


## Results
It is thus important to consider the possibility that a single, essential redox-potent peptide is the target of the antifungal drug targe. Alternatively, it is also important to consider the possibility that the antifungal drug target may be misapplied or that the peptide may have other toxicities.

In addition to the redox-potent peptide, a second peptide, glycoside A, has been identified as an antifungal peptide. This peptide contains 2 ß-amino-1-dehydrogenase residues. Glycoside A is a second messenger of the glycosyl-protein complex, which has been reported to be involved in cellular processes such as cell growth and cell adhesion [52]. Glycoside A is also a redox-potent peptide. Glycoside A is synthesized by the enzyme GlycA-GlycA [53]. The enzyme GlycA-GlycA is a common redox-potent peptide in many fungi [54,55]. The enzyme GlycA-GlycA is also a common redox-potent peptide in some bacteria [56].

In order to identify which antifungal peptides are more toxic to fungi, the antifungal peptides of this study were compared with the antifungal peptide of the common redox-potent peptide of the common redox-potent peptide from the S. cerevisiae strain W303 (Table 2). We found that the common redox-potent peptide of the S. cerevisiae strain W303 (Table 2) was highly toxic to the fungus (Table 2).

The findings in Table 2 are in agreement with the results of a previous study which showed that the antifungal peptides of S. cerevisiae W303 are more toxic to the fungus than the common redox-potent peptide from S. bayanus [25]. The results in Table 2 were also supported by the results from a previous study which showed that the antifungal peptides of S. bayanus are more toxic to the fungus than the common redox-potent peptide from S. cerevisiae [25].


## Discussion
Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare but serious infection that can present with cryptococcal meningitis. There have been a few case reports in which Cryptococcus meningitis was described in HIV-positive patients.

The diagnostic criteria for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients are not well defined. Cryptococcus neoformans has a wide variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms. In HIV-positive patients, the disease can be caused by strains of Cryptococcus neoformans, but also by other species. Cryptococcus gattii, C. neoformans, and C. gattii are also the main types of Cryptococcus that cause cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients. Cryptococcus gattii infection is the most common cryptococcal infection in HIV-positive patients.

Although rare, Cryptococcus neoformans is a common and highly virulent form of the disease. It is very difficult to diagnose the disease in HIV-positive patients, but in the present study, cryptococcal meningitis was identified in 75% of HIV-positive patients.
