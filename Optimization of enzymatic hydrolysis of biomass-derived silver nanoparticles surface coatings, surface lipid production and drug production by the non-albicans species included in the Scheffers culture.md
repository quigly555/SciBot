## Introduction
The genus Trichosporon was recently revised and this revision focuses on the species Trichosporon oleaginosus and its relatives (Oleaginosporidium), which is closely related to Trichosporon oleaginosus (S. oleaginosus) and to the taxa Trichosporon dermatis and Trichosporon vinosa, which is closely related to T. vinosa [1]. The species is known for its capacity to produce different kinds of toxins, such as cholestatic and the most toxic cholestatic toxin, and to produce bioactive metabolites such as phytoalexins and phytoanticipins [2,3,4,5,6]. Cholestatic toxins are formed by the inhibition of the enzyme cholestatic ß-glucosidase, which catalyzes the transfer of a-1,4-glucan to the cell membrane and cell wall, followed by the accumulation of cholestatic ß-1,4-glucans in the cell wall [7]. Phytoanticipins are structural proteins expressed by the phytoalexin B (B3) and the phytoanticipin C (C1) proteins and are involved in the interaction of cholestatic toxins with the cell wall [8]. Phytoanticipins have been characterized in different species, with the most representative being found in Trichosporon oleaginosus, Trichosporon vinosa, and Trichosporon anomala [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Phytoanticipins are associated with cholestatic toxins by binding to the C-terminal domain of the C-terminal domain of the phytoanticipin C, and the C-terminal domain of the phytoanticipin A, which are present in most species.


## Methods
The susceptibility of the non-albicans species to the silver nanoparticles was also determined using the method described in a previous study [20.

Isolation of nanoparticles
The antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by the method described in a previous study [21].

MIC
The MIC was evaluated by the measurement of the inhibition of microbial growth of the crude gold nanoparticles as determined by the broth dilution method [22].

The antimicrobial activity of the crude gold nanoparticles was evaluated by the method described in a previous study [23].

The inoculum preparation was performed using a sterile insect netting slant. The inoculum was prepared by dissolving the crude gold nanoparticles in the insect netting slant of the plant Agaricus digitata (SIL) and the compound as described in a previous study [33]. The number of spores was measured by counting with a BMG-6310 spectrophotometer (BMG, USA) and the inoculum was prepared in sterile saline.

## Discussion
., Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) [28]. According to a study by Anderson et al. [29], the non-albicans species of Scheffers inoculated with these nanoparticles were found to produce high levels of silver nanoparticles (p < 0.05) at the same concentration of the silver (1 µg/ml) of the non-albicans species. Although the antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans was higher than that of silver nanoparticles, the PAP of the non-albicans species was still not significantly higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. In addition, the antifungal activity of the non-albicans species was higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. According to a study by Achrombe and Núñez [30], the activity of silver nanoparticles against S. pneumoniae was higher than that of silver nanoparticles. In addition, the antifungal activity of the non-albicans species was higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. These results demonstrated that the activity of silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans is higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. This is in line with our findings showing that PAP of the non-albicans species was higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. The activity of silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans was higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. The PAP of the non-albicans species was also higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species.

3.4. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles against the microorganisms was evaluated. MIC values of silver nanoparticles were lower than those of eukaryotic antifungal drugs. The MIC values of the PAP of the non-albicans species were higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species. These results demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of the PAP of the non-albicans species was higher than that of the PAP of the non-albicans species.
