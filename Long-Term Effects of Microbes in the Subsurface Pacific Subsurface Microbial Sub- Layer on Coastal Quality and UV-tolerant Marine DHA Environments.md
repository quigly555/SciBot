## Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts and compounds from the leaves of Thymoloma indica against the yeasts and the gram-positive and negative bacteria of the common opportunistic pathogen, human nasopharyngeal pathogens, and Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity was measured by the microdilution method (100 µg/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) were determined, showing an inhibition of the opportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cryptococcus gattii. The synergistic activity of the essential oils was assessed by the checkerboard technique (coupled with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 µg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the essential oils was assessed by the checkerboard technique. The minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined using the broth dilution method. The antifungal activity of the essential oils was evaluated using the broth microdilution method. The inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and the microdilution methods were respectively detected at concentrations of 0.032 and 0.031 µg/mL. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were calculated using the M38 method. The synergistic effects of the essential oils were evaluated using the checkerboard technique. The MIC and the minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) were calculated. The study determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the microdilution method. The study also determined the antifungal activity of the essential oils in combination.


## Introduction
In some cases, marine microorganisms can grow on surface microstarch, on seawater, and in the sea for decades (.g., on two- and four-year seawater cycles) (Vermáková et al. 2016). Such deep-sea microorganisms are also highly adaptable to the environmental conditions, and they can form biofilms on both organic and inorganic substrates (Schirawski et al. 2016). The ability of marine microorganisms to form biofilms is due to the ability of the microorganisms to produce several metabolic reactions during their growth on organic substrates, including glycosylation, esterase, and fatty acids production, and on the sea floor (van der Vaer et al. 2016).

The marine environment is characterized by a diversity of nutrient-rich waters, rich in organic matter, extreme temperature, and high salinity (Hirsch et al. 2012). The conditions on the surface of the ocean floor are different for marine microorganisms than on the surface. On the surface, marine microorganisms are found in low-to-medium temperature, and they can survive in high salinity (18-25 °C), whereas at the same temperature, they can grow in the most nutrient-poor water environment, low-to-medium temperature, where they can grow very slowly (Vermáková et al. 2016). In low-to-medium temperature, microorganisms can colonize the deep-sea, but at the same time, they can grow very slowly on organic substrates, which are a mainstay in the formation of biofilms (Hirsch et al. 2012). Biofilm formation by the marine microorganisms is mainly influenced by the microorganism’s habitat (Hirsch et al. 2012). However, marine microorganisms are able to form biofilm on organic substrates, and they are particularly sensitive to organic substrates, such as seawater, seawater, and oceanic bacteria, which are influenced by the microorganism’s habitat (Hirsch et al. 2012).


## Methods
The microorganisms used in this study were from the collection of the Marine Life Sciences Laboratory of the University of São Paulo and the collection of the University of São Paul. The experiment was conducted in the microorganisms collection on the surface of the coastal or the submersical environments of the University of São Paulo, which includes the coastal or the submersical environments of the University of São Paulo. These studies were approved by the local ethics committee (CERPA/N/4/2011) and carried out in strict accordance with the regulations and regulations of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (CEUA/2012/14).

The experimental design was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (CEUA/2012/14) and was approved by the local ethics committee (CERPA/N/4/2011). For this study, three environmental conditions were selected: (i) coastal (N° 50 °N; N° 20 °N; N° 50 °N); (ii) submersical (N° 20 °N; N° 20 °N; N° 20 °N); and (iii) submersical environments (N° 40 °N; N° 40 °N). All the microbial submersical environments were identical, with the exception of the submersical conditions, where the pH was adjusted to pH 6.5 using KOH. The concentrations of each of the three submersical environments in comparison were the same, except that the concentrations of KOH were set at 10% (w/w). The following information was collected from the reports of the study participants: (i) the water temperature was set at 50 °C, (ii) the pH was adjusted to 5.5 using KOH, (iii) the pH was adjusted to 4.5 using KOH, and (iv) the pH of the submersical environments was adjusted to 6.5.

The studies were performed in accordance with the regulations and regulations of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (CEUA/2012/14).


## Results
 2009; Ishii et a., 2010; Leão et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2013; Larda et al., 2015).

As shown in Figure 1, the presence of fungi in the subsurface marine environment (i.e., asci, cellulose, starch, and mannose in seawater) was correlated with the chemical composition of the microorganisms. It also revealed that the most dominant species was the yeast genus Candida, which was also detected in the subsurface of the subsurface (Figure 2A). A comparison of the chemical composition of the fungal communities in the subsurface of the non-sampled areas of the United States (Figure 1) revealed that the fungi contained a higher percentage of glucose, lactose, fructose, and xylose. As a result, the fungal communities in the subsurface of the United States were significantly different from those in the subsurface of the saline (data not shown), while the communities in the saline subsurface were similar to those in the saline subsurface (Figure 2B).

The fungal community composition in the surface and subsurface of the United States was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of fungi (Table 1). The average proportion of fungal community in the subsurface of the sea urchin sea urchin was 0.02% and 0.02% of the total fungal community in the subsurface, respectively (Table 1). The ratio of fungal community in the subsurface of the non-sampled area to the total fungal community was 0.08% and 0.08% of the total fungal community in the saline subsurface, respectively.

The relative abundances of the dominant fungal genera were not significantly correlated with the relative abundance of the other dominant fungal genera (Figure 2). In the non-sampled area, the dominant fungal genera in the subsurface were Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Tenera.


## Discussion
., 1,100-2,000 UV-a and 1,000-2,000 UV-b radiation) and were exposed to high concentrations of low UV-a and UV-b radiation for the entire period. Additionally, we found that exposure to higher concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation is associated with a stronger increase in the rates of bacterial growth, ribosomal biogenesis, DNA synthesis, and DNA repair. A major reason for the increase in the growth of bacteria in high concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation was the increase in cell surface hydrophobicity, which is related to the increase in the metabolic activity of bacteria [25]. The highest cellular hydrophobicity was observed for bacteria exposed to UV-a and UV-b radiation, which is in line with our results.

The bacteria that were exposed to higher concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation were more sensitive to the UV-light. This suggests that bacteria exposed to UV-a and UV-b radiation also had an increased ability to assimilate UV-a and UV-b (Table 2).

We found that exposure to higher concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation was associated with higher cell growth, ribosomal biogenesis, DNA synthesis, and DNA repair (Table 2). The cell wall is one of the most important structural components for maintaining cell wall integrity and cell membrane integrity, and this is a major driver of DNA synthesis [26]. We found that the cell wall of the bacteria that were exposed to UV-a and UV-b radiation was reduced in thickness. This result is consistent with our previous study on the cell wall integrity of R. mucilaginosa and S. aureus.

The cell wall of the bacteria that were exposed to higher concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation was thicker than that of the bacteria that were exposed to high concentrations of UV-a and UV-b radiation (Table 2). This suggests that the higher UV-b concentration, which is associated with a higher rate of ribosomal biogenesis, is related to a lower rate of ribosomal gene conversion in the cell. The increase in the ribosomal gene conversion in the cell indicates that the cell has developed a more complex and specialized defense system in response to the changing conditions.
