## Abstract
The effects of different carbon sources on the amino acid composition of the active site of a key regulator protein are described in detail. The C3 residue on the active site of Bmck1 is an essential amino acid. Amino acids at the C3 position are not considered in the literature.

Here we show that carbon sources (glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, glucose, xylose, and trehalose) affect the active site of Bmck1, which lies between the reversible amino acid change and irreversible aromatic amino acid change. The C3 protein of Bmck1 contains two reversible domains, and the irreversible amino acid change has an effect on the C3 residue. The irreversible amino acid change has the opposite effect on the binding affinity and the substrate affinity of Bmck1. The binding affinity of the C3 residue to the N-terminal domain of Bmck1 was studied. The binding affinity of the C3 residue to the aromatic amino acid at the C3 position was studied. The binding affinity of the C3 residue to the N-terminal domain of Bmck1 was higher than that of the NAD+-NAD-signal peptide domain of Bmck1. The binding affinity of the C3 residue to the aromatic amino acid at the C3 position was determined by a two-dimensional interaction between the C3 and N-terminal domain assay.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are two separate species that cause cryptococcosis, a disease that is, in part, due to the ability of C. neoformans to grow at temperatures up to 37°C (1). Although the cause of the observed disease is generally believed to be acquired, the pathogenesis of this species seems to involve a wide range of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. For example, C. neoformans is found worldwide in the soil, and is found at a depth of 1 m^3 (2). C. neoformans is found primarily in bird droppings, decaying wood, and pigeon droppings. Cryptococcosis can occur in both immunocompromised and healthy hosts (3). The majority of cases are caused by C. neoformans, although it can also occur in apparently immunocompetent individuals.


## Methods
The Bipolarin-Receptor-inducible and Bipolarin-Lunar Receptors subtypes were selected based on the production of a unique band from the baxA promoter regio. The Bipolarin-Receptor-inducible subtype was purified by Sephadex^® G-50. The Bipolarin-Lunar Receptors subtype was purified by Sephadex^® G-50. The Bipolarin-Lunar Receptor-Lunar Receptors subtype was characterized by PCR, western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR using mouse baxA and baxB as the primers.

In order to determine the Bipolarin-receptors subtype, the Bipolarin-receptor-inducible and Bipolarin-Lunar Receptors subtypes were characterized by PCR, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR using mouse baxA and baxB as the primers. The Bipolarin-receptors subtype was characterized by PCR, western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR using mouse baxA and baxB as the primers.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.


## Results
dermatitidis genome database that were up-regulated in larvae after injecting larvae with the . dermatitidis vector (Table S2). BmrB and BmrR are required for the maintenance of the normal larval behavior and bimodal spore germination and development [7, 14]. We therefore hypothesized that BmrB and BmrR are responsible for the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in B. dermatitidis. To test this hypothesis, we injected B. dermatitidis larvae with a vector of the B. dermatitidis Bm1 vector and observed the larvae’s responsiveness to the vector. We confirmed the role of BmrB in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by using the Bm1-phospho-ß-d-glucan injection system (Fig 1A). The Bm1-phospho-ß-d-glucan injection system was also used for NLRP3 inflammasome activation by injecting larvae with the Bm2 vector [7, 15]. B. dermatitidis larvae injected with Bm1-phospho-ß-d-glucan showed a similar response to Bm1-phospho-ß-d-glucan injected larvae. Furthermore, we also injected B. dermatitidis larvae with a vector of Bm2-phospho-ß-d-glucan and found that Bm2-phospho-ß-d-glucan injection was more effective in inducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in B. dermatitidis larvae than in the vector-injected larvae (Fig 1B). These results indicate that BmrB, BmrR and BmrC are responsible for the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in B. dermatitidis.

The role of BmrB and BmrR in NLRP3 inflammasome activation
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a highly expressed and dynamic pathway that has been shown to regulate the spore germination and development in B. dermatitidis [7, 16-18]. We therefore hypothesized that the role of BmrB and BmrR in NLRP3 inflammasome activation is different in B. dermatitidis.


## Discussion
In addition to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, several receptors have also been shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and other mechanisms such as the LRP1 inflammasome activation and the Drosophila NLRP3 inflammasome activation [49. For example, in Aspergillus fumigatus, the A. fumigatus NLRP3 inflammasome activation is activated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation [50]. In addition, in A. nidulans, the A. fumigatus NLRP3 inflammasome activation is activated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation [51]. In addition, the A. nidulans NLRP3 inflammasome activation is activated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation [52]. The NLRP3 inflammasome activation is activated by the NLRP3 inflammasome activation of the C. elegans NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated by the NLRP3 inflammasome activation of the A. fumigatus NLRP3 inflammasome [52]. These results suggest that the Bipolarin Receptors may have two types of inflammasome activation: activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and NLRP3 inflammasome activation via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation of the A. fumigatus NLRP3 inflammasome.

The two types of NLRP3 inflammasome activation may have different functions in different pathogens. For example, in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, NLRP3 inflammasome activation by LRP1 inflammasome activates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the LRP1 inflammasome activates the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in B. dermatitidis, while the LRP1 inflammasome activation activates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in B. dermatitidis [53]. In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by B.
