## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is responsible for a large proportion of cryptococcosis in remote Indigenous communities in British Columbia, Canada. Little is known about the epidemiology and life-style of C. gattii in relation to climate. Here, we studied the association between temperature and the persistence of C. gattii in the B.C. (MI) region, B.C. (NIM Canada) and Vancouver Island (Vancouver) populations. Low temperature was associated with a decreased bacterial density and a greater proportion of cryptococcal strains were recovered from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with cryptococcosis. In addition, a greater proportion of C. gattii was recovered from skin lesions in patients with cryptococcosis, whereas a greater proportion from lung infections. Physician’s perception of non-therapeutic CSF retention was a strong predictor of clinical outcome in these patients. Reduced fungal density was associated with reduced fungal association with the CSF, while increased fungal association with the lungs contributed to the increased disease recurrence frequency. Physician’s perception of reduced fungal association with the CSF could explain the increased disease recurrence in B.C. (MI) patients.

Cryptococcus gattii was identified as an independent factor that was associated with disease recurrence in B.C. (MI) patients.

Physician’s perception of reduced fungal association with the CSF was a strong predictor of clinical outcome in these patients.


## Introduction
Most of the time, the microbes in a microbial community are highly conserved, and their functional properties make them more adaptable and capable of undergoing different responses to environmental conditions [1,2,3]. In eukaryotic microbes, regulation of this process is mediated by a diversity of proteins, which are active in a variety of different cellular compartments [4]. The ability of microorganisms to sense and respond to diverse environmental signals is evolutionarily conserved, and the effect of the different proteins is therefore mediated by proteins that are inducible and regulated differently [5,6,7,8,9,10,11].

Among the components that respond to environmental stimuli, the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) plays a central role in the response to extracellular stimuli. PKA is the major ß subunit of the Ca^2+-signaling cascade, which is activated by a variety of signals including hormones, cytokines, growth factors, oxygen, and the cell wall integrity-signaling cascade [12]. The Klf1/Klf4 protein-encoding gene is required for the synthesis of the extracellular cAMP, but not the biochemistry, in fungi, plants, and mammals [13,14]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PKA is involved in the response to nutrient-rich medium (pH < 3.5), which is similar to that seen in mammalian cells [15]. In C. albicans, PKA is involved in the response to low nutrient (pH < 5) and high nutrient (pH = 8) stress [16]. In S. cerevisiae, PKA is the target of the fungicidal drug echinocandins and the stress response drugs, which inhibit PKA activity [17]. In the basidiomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, PKA is involved in the response to oxidative stress [18]. In F.


## Methods
No specific ethical approval was needed for the study because all the patients were also enrolled in this stud.

Methods
All the patients were identified from the medical records of the hospital where they were enrolled in the study, with their first name only. The data were collected in the hospital-based data collection system (SARS) and included their age, gender, date of birth, occupation, hospitalization, underlying diseases, medication use, number of hospitalizations and the most recent application of these medications. All patients received an induction treatment for the diagnosis of hydrocephalus with a maximum of 1 year.

The treatment consisted of a combination of tricyclazole (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and corticosteroids (0.5-1.0 mg/kg). The treatment was done in the following order: i. at day 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 18, and b. at day 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 21. Patients with lower numbers of fluid and/or pus were excluded. The results were recorded daily. All the patients received lumbar punctures (LP) after the LP. The LP was performed on the seventh day of the study.

The patients were classified into four groups: normal, intermediate, and severe. The patients with lower number of fluid and/or pus were excluded. The patients with higher number of fluid and/or pus were excluded. The results were recorded with the aid of a digital camera and were analyzed in the electronic medical records. All the patients were treated with a sterile surgical procedure. The patients who received an induction treatment for the diagnosis of hydrocephalus in the hospital-based data collection system were treated with a combination of tricyclazole (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and corticosteroids (0.5-1.0 mg/kg). The treatment was done in the following order: i. at day 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 18, and ii. at day 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 18, and iii. at day 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 15, and 21.

Methods
All the patients were categorized into four groups: normal, intermediate, and severe.


## Results
Genome sequence analysis
A total of 4166 bp of the 4166 coding sequence (including two exons) of 5'UTR and 4233 coding sequence of 5'UTR of the first 5'UTR of the coding sequence were analyzed. The amino acid sequences of these genes were compared to those of the genes of the genome of H. werneckii A7 and to the genomes of S. cerevisiae and H. werneckii A3. Genomic analyses revealed that the 4166 coding sequence is transcribed at high levels by H. werneckii A7 and H. werneckii A3 in both the H. werneckii A7 and H. werneckii A3 genomes. The H. werneckii A7 genome has 3.57 Gbp and 2.85 Gbp of coding sequences in the H. werneckii A3 genome, respectively.

We also performed a phylogenetic analysis using a maximum likelihood approach and a Bayesian approach, using the genome of H. werneckii A7 (CBS114450) as an outgroup. The H. werneckii A7 genome encodes the largest protein in all analyzed H. werneckii genomes (64.44% of all predicted genes in the H.


## Discussion
In contrast, there was no correlation between allogeneic T-cell lymphadenopathy and rheumatoid arthriti. However, these data indicate that T-cell dysfunction may be an additional risk factor for the development of T. marneffei-associated disease.

The association of T-cell dysfunction and T. marneffei infection is not known. However, in a study with patients with chronic t-cell lymphadenopathy, T. marneffei infection was associated with decreased T-cell proliferation and increased T cell-mediated apoptosis. The decrease in T-cell proliferation and the increased T-cell apoptosis could have been related to T. marneffei infection. In a study with patients with chronic t-cell lymphadenopathy, T. marneffei infection was associated with a decrease in T cell proliferation, T cell-mediated apoptosis, and cell-mediated immunity in a large number of patients. The increased T cell-mediated apoptosis and cell-mediated immunity could also be due to the increased T-cell proliferation and apoptosis seen in patients with chronic t-cell lymphadenopathy. In addition, increased T cell proliferation and apoptosis could have been due to the increased T cell-mediated apoptosis seen in chronic t-cell lymphadenopathy. However, there was no correlation between lymphadenopathy and T-cell function in the patients with chronic t-cell lymphadenopathy.

The association between T-cell dysfunction and hydrocephalus was not consistent with the association between T-cell dysfunction and tuberculosis. In a study with patients with tuberculosis, T-cell dysfunction was associated with a decreased T-cell proliferation and decreased T-cell-mediated apoptosis. However, there was no correlation between T-cell function and T-cell proliferation in the patients with tuberculosis.

The association between T-cell dysfunction and T-cell apoptosis was not consistent with the association between T-cell function and T-cell apoptosis. In a study with patients with tuberculosis, T-cell apoptosis was associated with a decreased T-cell proliferation and decreased T-cell-mediated apoptosis. However, there was no correlation between T-cell function and T-cell apoptosis in the patients with tuberculosis.

There were several limitations in our study. We did not know whether T-cell dysfunction was the cause of hydrocephalus or T-cell apoptosis.
