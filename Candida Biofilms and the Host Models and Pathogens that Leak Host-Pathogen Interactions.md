## Abstract
In fungi, transcription factors (TFs) are responsible for fine-tuning gene expression in response to specific environmental cues, yet most studies focus on individual TFs or consider them a whole genome organization, even though the underlying regulation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Aspergillus fumigatus is a prevalent human fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. We previously discovered that the non-integrin PBD (Peatoneeromycotina B) transcription factor gene transcriptional state is controlled by a complex set of regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we addressed the role of PBD in regulating the development, maintenance, and virulence of this fungal pathogen. In the absence of PBD, A. fumigatus produced only a small amount of melanin, the precursor of hyphae and spores. Although this growth form was virulent to the A. fumigatus mutant lacking the genes for melanin synthesis and for other virulence factors, it produced conidia and spores. Although the production of conidia and spores was entirely through indirect expression of the PBD-containing promoter, such expression was dependent on the TFs, since conidia and spores are necessary for virulence.


## Introduction
The genus Acanthamoeba is an amoeba that can cause pulmonary and central nervous system infection [1-3]. It is a freshwater amoeba, and it can infect over 200 species of animals, including humans [4,5]. The genus Acanthamoeba has been classified into four species, A. baylyi, A. venezuelae, A. amebicola, and A. venezuelansi [6]. The fourth species, Ac. venezuelansi, is a pathogen of immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and it is the causative agent of the rare life-threatening infection, amoebiculistosis, in which amoeba and macrophages engulf and kill macrophages, thereby causing amoebiculistosis [7,8].


## Methods
The details of this process are described in [14. In brief, the host-pathogen interaction protocol assumes a stress-induced host cell death due to non-pathogen cells, i.e. cells with cell-killing signals. The host-pathogen interaction is performed by adding a cell-killing effect of the host strain (in the range 0-100%), and by adding a host-pathogen-free (PFC) control. The PFC control is used when PFC does not affect the cells at all, but rather only the host cells. Cells with PFC control are known to be able to damage cells, i.e. by killing their host cells. The PFC control is used when PFC does not affect the cells at all, but rather only the host cells.

The PFC-free control is used when PFC does not affect the cells at all, but rather only the host cells. The PFC-free control consists of the following steps: (i) the PFC-free control is used when the PFC is completely free of PFC. (ii) the PFC-free control is used when the PFC is completely free of PFC. (iii) the PFC-free control is used when the PFC is completely free of PFC.

Host-pathogen interaction at the methanol/ethanol (Meth-K/Ethyl) level
The host-pathogen interaction in the PFC-free control is performed by adding a methanol-free control (in the range 0-100%) and a ethyl-free control (range 100-200%). The presence of a positive control can be easily detected in the PFC-free control. To assess the effect of different stress conditions on the cell-killing effect, the PFC-free control is also used. In the PFC-free control, the cell-killing effect is measured by adding a cell-killing effect of the host strain (in the range 0-100%). The cell-killing effect is measured by adding a cell-killing effect of the host strain (in the range 0-100%). In the PFC-free control, the cell-killing effect is measured by adding a cell-killing effect of the host strain (in the range 0-100%).


## Results
albicans and . dubliniensis are hemibiotrophic, with hemibiotrophic yeast strains growing as yeast cells. We have observed that hemibiotrophic hemibiotrophic strains are more closely related to each other than to C. albicans. They are also more similar to each other than to C. dubliniensis, and they are the most similar to S. cerevisiae (Table 1).

We found that the hemibiotrophic yeasts, while more closely related to C. albicans, are more closely related to each other than to S. cerevisiae. The most closely related species to C. albicans are S. cerevisiae and C. dubliniensis, and their close relationship to C. albicans is also more closely related to C. albicans than to S. cerevisiae.

## Discussion
oryza. We found that both the host and pathogen actively participate in cell-cell interaction, and that they both use a variety of factors to ensure that their cell-cell interactions are similar. As a result, the host immune responses to the pathogen are different from that of the pathogen, which is consistent with previous studies that have shown that the cell-cell interactions are mainly driven by the immune responses [48]. Our findings show that the pathogen actively participates in the host-pathogen interactions.

We first demonstrated that M. oryzae actively participates in the host-pathogen interactions. It is important to consider that in the early stages of infection, M. oryzae cells are being phagocytosed by several phagocytes (MGG-1, MGG-2, and MGG-3) which are able to kill the fungus. However, after the phagocytosis, the MGG-1, MGG-2, and MGG-3 cells are not able to kill the fungus. Thus, we observed that M. oryzae cells are able to kill the fungus and that it was able to grow on the phagocytosed fungus. This result supports the idea that M. oryzae cells can form a cell-to-cell adhesion network. The phagocytosis of M. oryzae by several phagocytes is also known to generate a strong adhesion molecule, IL-6, which, in turn, induces cell-to-cell adhesion [49]. It has been reported that the interaction between phagocytes and pathogenic fungi is mediated by extracellular factors such as complement factors, cytokines, and prostaglandins [50]. Therefore, M. oryzae, by producing extracellular factors, is able to induce cell-cell interactions to facilitate the pathogen growth and survival. However, the pathogen is not able to make the extracellular factor available for the pathogen to activate the immune response. This results in the inhibition of the host response, and the phagocyte immune response is reduced. This reduces the ability of the host to initiate the immune response, and the phagocyte immune response is inhibited.
