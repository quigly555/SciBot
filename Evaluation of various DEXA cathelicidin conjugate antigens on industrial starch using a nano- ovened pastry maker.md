## Abstract
The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a causative agent of the blast disease of barley that results in destructive head blight in the rice industry. The ability of M. oryzae to sense the molecular patterns surrounding its host plant is critical for pathogenesis and plays an important role in the evolution of disease resistance. We previously reported that the GATA factor of M. oryzae, MOM/2C/YNL, plays a role in regulating the response of this pathogen to different environmental stimuli. In this study, we examined the role of the third member of this family of related M. oryzae GATA factors in regulating the rice blast phenotype. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we previously identified a MOM/2C/YNL protein, named MoMOM2C, in M. oryzae. In our previous report, we also found that the MOM/2C/YNL protein was expressed in M. oryzae and that MoMOM2C was required for normal growth, sexual development, stress responses, and mycelial contractions. To gain further insight into the role of MoMOM2C, a genome-wide scan of MoMOM2C revealed an additional member of this family of related M. oryzae GATA factors, named MoPLA, in M.


## Introduction
Iron is an essential cofactor of many enzymes in the cell and is essential for virtually all organisms. However, in some organisms, iron acquisition can be restricted to the acquisition of iron from water. In bacteria, iron acquisition can be controlled by the availability of iron from the environment, but in higher organisms, iron acquisition can be regulated by the action of iron permeases. The hemicellulose and hemicellulosic fungi, for example, can acquire iron from the environment but can also acquire iron from the atmosphere, water, or food [1,2,3].

In contrast to bacteria, fungi have evolved sophisticated strategies to overcome iron limitation. These include the use of siderophores as iron uptake molecules, or the secretion of iron-binding proteins and siderophores [4,5]. In addition to iron uptake, fungi also use extracellular siderophores, or siderophores, which are secreted by microbes to degrade iron from surrounding environmental molecules [6]. Siderophores are a class of siderophores with diverse structures and biochemical reactions that are necessary for iron acquisition in microbes.

In the siderophore-based iron acquisition system, the siderophore proteins are secreted by the fungi to the extracellular environment [7]. siderophores are recognized by their cognate s, which are associated with iron-binding proteins, or siderophores [8]. siderophores are known to be released during fungal growth and development, and siderophores are known to be expressed during growth and development of fungi [9,10]. In addition to siderophore proteins, some of the best-studied siderophores, namely the siderophore-binding protein (SBS), the ficolin-binding protein (Fbp), and the ferric-binding protein (FbpF) are expressed during growth and differentiation of filamentous fungi [11].


## Methods
B-03-2004) (n = 30) in Durban, South Africa in 200. The cathelicidin antigens were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10 mg/mL) and diluted to 1.25 mg/mL. The DMSO dilutions were prepared in 96-well plates and then 10 µL of DMSO were added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The OD_540nm of the DMSO-diluted samples was measured with an Enspire plate reader (Tecan, Inc.) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The DMSO-diluted samples were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and an isocratic absorbance of 595 nm.

2.5. Determination of Total Antioxidant Capacity
The antioxidant activity of DEXA was determined by a protocol previously described by Doebi et al. [14] using a standard assay of the enzyme. The assay mixture contained 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.5 mM thiamine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM thioglycollate, 5 µM of each of the antioxidant enzymes, and 0.5 mM of free radical scavenger. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 30 min and then at 100°C for 5 min. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The antioxidant activity of DEXA was calculated according to the following equation:

2.6. Determination of Antioxidant Activity of Superoxide Dismutase
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined by using a modified method of Almeida et al. [15] using the method of Eloffa-Gonzalez and reports on the activities of DEXA on reducing sugars, reducing-oxidation, and oxidation of free radical in their respective studies [17]. The method of Almeida et al. [15] was followed. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.


## Results
It was observed that peptides that have been reported in the literature as antifungal peptides were not active against the tested strains of . verticillioides, whereas the peptides that have been reported as anti-fungal peptides were active against the tested strains of F. oxysporum (Figure 2).

A total of 1033 peptides were identified, with a mean score of 0.38. The peptides that showed an MIC of 0.5 µg/ml against F. verticillioides were identified as serine peptides, leucine-aminidase, and proline-Protein P-type peptides, whereas the peptides that had MICs of 0.5 µg/ml against F. oxysporum were serine peptides (Table 1). The peptides that were active against F. oxysporum were leucine-aminidase and proline-Protein P-type peptides, whereas the peptides that had MICs of 0.5 µg/ml against F. verticillioides were leucine-aminidase and proline-Protein P-type peptides (Table 1). The peptides that were inactive against F. oxysporum were leucine-aminidase and leucine-aminidase-P-type peptides, whereas the peptides that had MICs of 0.5 µg/ml against F. verticillioides were leucine-aminidase-P-type peptides (Table 1).

We next analyzed the antifungal activity of peptides that had previously been reported in the human intestinal tract. It was observed that peptides that had previously been reported as antifungal peptides were not active against F. verticillioides, whereas the peptides that have been reported as anti-fungal peptides were active against F. oxysporum (Figure 2). We also analyzed the antifungal activity of peptides that have been described as anti-fungal peptides against F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum, respectively. It was observed that peptides that had previously been reported as anti-fungal peptides were inactive against F.


## Discussion
They evaluated the use of the nano- ovened pastry maker for the application of specific cathelicidin conjugate antigens on industrial starc. However, the application of cathelicidin conjugate antigens on industrial starch was limited by the fact that they did not show any advantage to the producer, thus they decided to test their application on industrial yeast. The application of cathelicidin conjugate antigens on industrial yeast was performed by means of screening the yeast cell line from a set of strains. The results showed that the cathelicidin conjugate antigens were effective against a large number of strains. In particular, the cathelicidin conjugate antigens were effective against four strains of yeast, three of which were susceptible to cathelicidin. These results are in agreement with earlier studies that showed cathelicidin as a promising compound to be used in the production of cathelicidin [43].

PEG-Catheter-based catheter replacement was performed on industrial yeast using a nano- ovened pastry maker. The nano- ovened pastry maker was used to replace the catheter in industrial yeast, and the resulting cathelicidin conjugate antigens were effective against the four strains of yeast, but not against the strains of industrial yeast. The nano- ovened pastry maker showed good cathelicidin conjugate antigens to all strains of yeast, and the cathelicidin conjugate antigens were efficient against all strains of yeast, including strains susceptible to cathelicidin. The results presented in Figure 7 showed that cathelicidin conjugate antigens were effective against a large number of strains of yeast, but not against all strains of industrial yeast. This is consistent with the previous study that showed that cathelicidin conjugate antigens were effective against a large number of strains [44].

As a result of catheter replacement, the cathelicidin conjugate antigens were not effective against the strain of industrial yeast.
