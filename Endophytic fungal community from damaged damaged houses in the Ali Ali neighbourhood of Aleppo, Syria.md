## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are life-threatening complications that must be recognized early to avoid unnecessary procedures and therapy errors. Identification of the etiology of IFIs is crucial to minimize unnecessary procedures and therapy errors, which have a significant impact on the management of patients with life-threatening IFI. The identification of the IFI can help in various ways in our hospitals. In this review, we provide an overview of the available therapy and detection methods, discuss the potential of these new detection methods in the future, and consider the potential for using these methods in the future with current diagnostic and therapeutic limitations. In the near future, diagnostics and therapeutic strategies are periodically refined to include targeting specific pathogens.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease affecting both the lungs and central nervous system. It is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The organism can cause life threatening meningoencephalitis and pneumonia.

C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that has a unique, capsulated and yeast-like cell morphology. The cells are found in the environment and can survive in a variety of temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C. The temperature range of the yeast cell is found in the ambient environment, ranging from 30 to 100 °C.

The cells are highly adapted to their new environment and are capable of proliferation within the host. In humans, the most common and prevalent environmental form of cryptococcosis is infection by C.


## Methods
The communities were sampled at random for each house and were cultivated at least twice, in triplicate, on 15 different day. Fungal samples were collected from the same neighborhood of the city where the samples were taken. In addition, one from the same neighborhood was also used for DNA extraction, in order to compare the species diversity in the samples. The fungal samples were transported to the laboratory in a 50 mL screw-cap tube and kept in the dark at -20°C until use.

DNA extraction and PCR amplification
Fungal DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was used for the amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions using the PCR protocol described in [22]. The internal transcribed spacer regions were amplified using the primers ITS5 and ITS4 (Vilgalys and Hester 1990). Amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55-56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. PCR products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels. The DNA sequences obtained were checked for correct amplification by using the program SeqMan v6.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The amplified products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified PCR products were sent to Shanghai Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) for sequencing and sub-cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmids were sequenced by using the Big Dye™ Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The amplified DNA sequences were deposited in the GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequences were aligned using the online software Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA v. 5.0) (http://www.megasoftware.net/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining method (NJ) and bootstrap values were calculated using the program Mrbayes v. 3.2.


## Results
Amongst the representative samples from damaged buildings in the Ali Ali neighbourhood in the city of Aleppo, we identified . albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis.

3.4. Efficacy of Fungal Community from Disrupted Sites
We selected 9 samples from 6 different sites in the Ali Ali street district of the city of Aleppo. These 9 samples were selected because they were from locations that were predominantly destroyed by the conflict in the area. Samples were harvested at various time points (from 8 to 30 d) after each sampling. We selected the samples at 8 dpi for their ability to grow in the presence of Fungicide and were able to sample at 30 dpi for their ability to colonize the entire house.

3.5. Fungicide Concentrations in the Site-Sample Samples
The concentrations of Fungicide in the site-sample samples were shown in Table 2. The maximum concentrations of Fungicide in the site-sample samples were found in the first 24 h of Fungicide exposure, and the lowest concentrations were found at 24 h after Fungicide exposure. The highest concentrations of Fungicide were found in the first 72 h of Fungicide exposure, and the lowest concentrations were found in the first 72 h after Fungicide exposure. The highest Fungicide concentrations were found at the first 48 h of Fungicide exposure (0.31-0.48 µg/ml). The highest concentrations of Fungicide were found at the first 48 h of Fungicide exposure (0.01-0.12 µg/ml). The lowest concentrations of Fungicide were found at 24 h after Fungicide exposure.

3.6. Fungicide Concentrations in the Site-Sample Samples
The Fungicide Concentrations in the Site-sample samples were shown in Table 2. The maximum concentrations of Fungicide in the Site-sample samples were found in the first 24 h of Fungicide exposure and the lowest concentrations were found at 24 h after Fungicide exposure. The highest Fungicide concentrations were found at the first 72 h of Fungicide exposure (0.07-0.13 µg/ml). The lowest concentrations of Fungicide were found at the first 48 h of Fungicide exposure (0.12-0.16 µg/ml).


## Discussion
More than half of the total plant community found in the present study was able to tolerate the large number of pathogens of the . dendrobatidis-like pathogens including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Alternaria. The largest proportion of the B. dendrobatidis-like pathogen community is found in a damaged house in the Ali Ali neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syrian, on June 24, 2017. The damage caused by the P. infestans-like pathogens in the present study was mainly caused by the fungus.

The moderate to severe severity of the severeness of the present study and most of the building damage and the decay of damaged buildings indicates that the damage caused by these pathogens is more severe than the damage caused by the other pathogenic fungi. The structural integrity of the buildings is considered to be less than 20% of the normal range. The extent of the damage in the present study is almost 50% of the normal range. However, the level of damage in the damaged building was much higher than that of the other fungi. The overall community of the damaged buildings was significantly more than that of the other fungi. These findings are in line with previous studies. In a study by Leonhardi et al. (2015), the growth of the fungal species in the soil and plant communities of damaged buildings were significantly higher than those in healthy buildings. The average level of growth of these fungi was only 0.7% of the other fungi. A study by Leonhardi et al. (2015) showed that the pathogenic fungi were not able to grow in soil but could grow in plants. This finding indicated that the pathogenic fungi are able to grow in soil. This finding has also been found in the present study.

The average height of the damaged buildings was significantly higher than that of the other fungi. This finding is in line with previous studies (Leonhardi et al., 2015). The height of the damaged buildings was much higher than that of the other fungi. The average height of the damaged buildings in this study was significantly higher than that in the present study. This finding indicates that the damaged buildings are much more than the other damaged buildings.

The maximum value of the maximum growth rate in the present study was only 0.3 g/m^2, which was similar to the value of the maximum growth rate of the other fungi.
