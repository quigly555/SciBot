## Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the commonest cause of opportunistic meningitis worldwide. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is typically fatal on immunocompromised hosts, with lung, cardiac, and central nervous system involvement in the majority. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known complication of tuberculosis infection. However, the involvement of mycobacteria in this scenario is rarely reported. This study aimed to report a case of tuberculosis IRIS in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to characterize its clinical features and outcomes.

A. nidulans, A. pneumoniae, and A. aeruginosa were isolated from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 50 patients with suspected tuberculosis coinfection and HIV and were cultured from CSF of 49 CSF patients with suspected meningitis. A. nidulans was cultured from both CSF and culture media of CSF of the remaining 50 patients. Their initial cultures were negative for circulating mycobacteria.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitalized patients. In the United States, approximately 1.5 million ICU admissions occur annually, and approximately 400,000 deaths occur in the first 4 weeks of ICU admission (1).

The most common fungal pathogens are Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis spp. Although the early diagnosis is very difficult, the appropriate antifungal therapy is essential for optimal patient outcome (2). The existing antifungal agents are limited in spectrum and cost, have poor solubility, and are generally ineffective against Cryptococcus, which is a commensal yeast and an opportunistic pathogen in the human host. In the past, the emergence of azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins has greatly expanded the number of antifungal agents available for the treatment of fungal infections. However, these antifungal agents are not specific to the species they are used in, and the emergence of drug resistant strains is a major threat to the development of antifungal drugs (3).

The emergence of new antifungal agents, including echinocandins, is occurring faster than any other class of antifungals, and this includes fluconazole, the second most commonly used echinocandin, which is effective against Candida spp. and C.


## Methods
In this observational study, we established that mouthwash with .5% of mouthwashes per day was a superior oral treatment for pathogen-free control of Salmonella spp. and Salmonella typhimurium S1. We also evaluated the efficacy of mouthwash with 1% of mouthwashes per day to reduce bacterial and fungal colonization in patients with systemic infection. In this study, we also determined the feasibility of mouthwash with 0.5% of mouthwashes per day as a potential preventive therapy against Salmonella spp. and Salmonella typhimurium S1. In addition, we assessed the potential oral therapy potential of oral hygiene in the prevention of Salmonella spp. and Salmonella typhimurium S1.

The effects of mouthwash with 0.5% of mouthwash Per Day on Salmonella spp. and Salmonella typhimurium S1. The criteria for the evaluation of the efficacy of mouthwash with 0.5% of mouthwash Per Day as a preventive treatment of systemic infection were adopted from the European Community Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ECG-WG-2006), which are based on the recommendations of the European Veterinary Federation (EMF) [22].

## Results
hiratsubramanian, .J. Bauer, & R.G. Shiratsubramanian) [36]. The efficacy of the mouthwash microbiome restoration strategy was assessed in the presence of oral candidiasis (1.5 × 10^3 bacteria/ml) and in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection (0.5 × 10^4 bacteria/ml).

The feasibility of the mouthwash microbiome restoration strategy was assessed in the presence of systemic Salmonella infection and in the presence of the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection. In the presence of the bacterial presence, it was not possible to restore the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome. The efficacy of the mouthwash microbiome restoration strategy in the presence of systemic Salmonella infection was assessed in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection.

A. fumigatus infection is a major cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection [37], and the results of a trial assessing the efficacy of the oral microbiome restoration strategy in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection suggested that the procedure should be followed in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection. It was also noted that the vaginal barrier of A. fumigatus infected by A. fumigatus was not capable of restoring the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome. In the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection, the vaginal barrier of A. fumigatus infection was not able to restore the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome, but the vaginal barrier of A. fumigatus infection was capable of restoring the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome.

In the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection, the efficacy of the mouthwash microbiome restoration strategy was assessed in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection. In the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection, it was not possible to restore the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome. In the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection, it was not possible to restore the bacterial load in the mouthwash microbiome.

B. dermatitidis infections are frequently associated with recurrent bloodstream infections [38], and the results of a trial assessing the efficacy of the oral microbiome restoration strategy in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection indicated that the procedure should be followed in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection.

The efficacy of the oral microbiome restoration strategy was assessed in the presence of a systemic Salmonella infection.


## Discussion
In contrast, after oral rinse, the bacterial population was much higher than in the bacterial population after oral rins. The results suggest that the bacterial population after oral rinse is likely to be significantly lower than that after oral rinse, and the bacterial population after oral rinse might be significantly higher than that after oral rinse.

The bacterial populations after oral rinse were differentially affected by the different bottle-neck preparation method. For a bottle-neck method, the bacteria were predominantly recovered from the bottle-neck condition, whereas for the other bottle-neck method, the bacteria were primarily recovered from the bottle-neck condition. However, the bacterial populations after bottle-neck and bottle-neck were significantly different in terms of their number of novel bacteria in the oral rinse and bacterial population after bottle-neck and bottle-neck conditions, respectively. The results of the bacterial communities after bottle-neck and bottle-neck condition showed that the bacterial population after oral rinse and bottle-neck condition were significantly higher than those after oral rinse. These results suggest that the bacterial populations after oral rinse and bottle-neck condition are significantly higher than those after oral rinse, but that the bacterial populations after oral rinse and bottle-neck condition are significantly lower than those after oral rinse.

The majority of the bacterial population after bottle-neck and bottle-neck conditions recovered from the microbiome and from the oral rinse. However, the bacterial population after oral rinse recovered significantly higher than those recovered from the microbiome after oral rinse. In addition, the bacterial population after oral rinse recovered significantly lower than those recovered from the microbiome after oral rinse. The results suggested that the bacterial populations after oral rinse are likely to be significantly lower than those after oral rinse.

The bacterial population after oral rinse was significantly different in terms of their number of novel bacterial populations in the oral rinse and bacterial population after bottle-neck and bottle-neck conditions. The results indicated that the bacterial populations after oral rinse were significantly higher than those after bottle-neck and bottle-neck conditions, but that the bacterial populations after oral rinse recovered significantly lower than those after bottle-neck and bottle-neck conditions. These results suggest that the bacterial populations after oral rinse and bottle-neck condition are significantly higher than those after oral rinse.
