## Abstract
We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis with central nervous system involvement in a patient with AIDS, which is unusual and undiagnosed. An immunocompetent patient with AIDS presented with an acute onset of meningitis after a night of drinking and a week of physical therapy. A lumbar puncture was performed on the patient for meningitis and he was subsequently diagnosed to have meningitis parvulitis. Following serial intravenous immunoglobulin and antifungal therapy, the patient was treated aggressively with fluconazole and was well on immunosuppressive therapy. Although the patient was well, the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis should be considered in the setting of advanced AIDS, in which the diagnosis should be seen in patients with suspected central nervous system involvement, in order to ensure prompt initiation of appropriate treatment.


## Introduction
Eukaryotic DNA sequences are usually organized in 3- to 5-ß-dex-1 regions, with the first 5-ß-ex-1 being transcribed and the rest ex-transcribed (Koopman and Kalra, 2000; Dijkshoven and Olsson, 2007; van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2007). The overall sequence of eukaryotes is organized in short tandemly repeated regions (Swiý et al., 2012). The arrangement of these sequenced genomes is very complex, and their architecture is highly plastic, reflecting the complexity of their biological systems (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2007).

In contrast to the well-known proteins, many proteins in eukaryotes are not involved in metabolic processes. Most metabolic enzymes are present in non-protein-coding (NPS) genomes, e.g., in eukaryotic metazoans, e.g., in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Nemergut et al., 2005), in animal embryonic kidney cells (E.C. 400) and human liver cells (Simmi et al., 2006; Navarro et al., 2011; Siegemund and Fink, 2012). NPSs are organized as homopolymer classes, and these class-like proteins are involved in many metabolic functions, including glucose- and lipid-mediated metabolism, lipid signaling, and cell differentiation (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2007; Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2007). Many of the non-protein NPSs are involved in signaling pathways that can also promote metabolic processes (Pereira et al., 2003; Pires et al., 2004).

In eukaryotes, several different types of NPSs are present, and these NPSs serve different functions. For example, the NPSs, which are present in budding yeast and human embryonic fibroblasts, are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication (Simmi et al., 2006; Pires et al., 2004). Some NPSs are involved in diverse physiological processes, including gene expression, morphogenesis, cell cycle control, and cell polarity control (Woudenberg et al., 2001). In addition, some NPSs are involved in fungal virulence, e.g.


## Methods

The effects of horizontal and radiographic depth on ultrastructure, immune expression and the DoF Ultrastructure was determined using the UV-visible spectra at a wavelength of 570 nm.

4.3. Effect of Vertical and Radiographic Depth on the Internal Structure of the Fungal Bacteria
The effect of vertical and radiographic depth on the internal structure of the fungi was measured by the internal hydrophobicity.


## Results
We constructed a high-resolution version of the Candida albicans virulence assay for these measurements using a single measure of endomembrane permeability as described previously [33. The results are presented in Fig 1. For the simulation, the effect of vertical or radial precision on the virulence of C. albicans was investigated in parallel, and the results are presented in the figure-2. For both strains, no significant difference was observed (p > 0.05). For the tests of the radial growth effect, the effect of vertical and radial precision on the virulence of C. albicans was investigated in parallel, and the results are presented in the figure-3. The results are presented in Fig 3.

## Discussion
The results of the biophysical parameters of the lungs were compared with the MMF-treated mice, where the same concentration of the drug was used to induce the pneumocystis spleen (Figure 3. The results showed that the concentration of drug was significantly higher in the lungs of the infected mice compared to the control group. The ability to induce pneumocystis spleen activity was also significantly higher in the lungs of mice infected with FLC-treated mice than that of mice infected with MMF (Figure 3). Furthermore, the lungs of mice infected with MMF had higher levels of phalloidin B3 (Figure 3B), a marker for the phalloidin synthesis in C. albicans (Prenafeta et al. 2013).

In the lungs of mice infected with FLC-treated mice, the presence of phalloidin B3 was significantly higher in the lungs of mice infected with MMF. In contrast, the lungs of mice infected with FLC-treated mice showed lower phalloidin B3 (Figure 3A) than that of mice infected with MMF. This result indicated that phalloidin B3 was not required for the pneumocystis spleen to be recruited to the infected lungs.

The ability to induce pneumocystis spleen activity was significantly higher in the lungs of mice infected with MMF compared to that of mice infected with FLC. This result indicated that phalloidin B3 was not required for the lungs to be recruited to the infected lungs. Additionally, the lungs of mice infected with FLC-treated mice had higher levels of phalloidin B3 (Figure 3A). These results indicated that phalloidin B3 was not required for the lungs to be recruited to the infected lungs.

In conclusion, we have identified FLC-induced pneumocystis spleen in C. albicans, and reported that it is important for pneumocystis spleen to be recruited to the lungs of the infected mice. The presence of phalloidin B3, which is important for phalloidin B3 synthesis in C. albicans, is not required for the pneumocystis spleen to be recruited to the lungs of the infected mice.
