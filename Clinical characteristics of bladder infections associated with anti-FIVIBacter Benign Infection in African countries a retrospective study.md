## Abstract

In the case of HIV, the most common cause of UTI and leukemias was Kaposi’s sarcom.

In the case of TB, tuberculous meningitis (TBM) was the commonest cause of UTIs and the most common cause of UTIs in HIV positive patients.

In this study, we investigated the risk factors and sequelae of sequelae following TBM or TB using data from 51 patients, aged 18 years and older, from the National Health Insurance Study, which includes all TB cases reported in Africa. The primary risk factors were: =1 case of TBM or TBM-TB (incidence ratio [incidence/fold increase], 2.2; P = .03) and = 4 cases of TBM-TB (incidence/fold increase, 2.9; P = .02). The secondary risk factors were: = 1 case of TB and = 4 cases of TBM-TB (incidence/fold increase, 2.9; P = .02).

Patients with TBM or TBM-TB (incidence/fold increase, 2.9; P = .03) were more likely to have a headache and were more likely to have a colon-related disease, and were more likely to have a fever and sepsis.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with compromised immunity. The prevalence of infection is highest in immunocompromised patients and the median time to diagnosis is approximately three months. The most common agents, including C. neoformans, are responsible for the vast majority of infections, with approximately 1.5 million new cases occurring each year worldwide [1].

The main causative agent of cryptococcosis is Cryptococcus neoformans. C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast, which can survive and proliferate in the environment for a long time. It has been reported that C. neoformans mainly causes pulmonary infections in patients with severely impaired immunity and in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV patients, individuals infected with tuberculosis, patients on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and patients receiving rituximab, which acts in part by blocking T lymphocyte activation [2].

The most common manifestation of cryptococcosis is pulmonary infection, with up to 95% of cases involving the lung, the lymph nodes, and skin. In most cases, the cryptococcal virulence factors are unknown. In the past two decades, several genes associated with capsule biosynthesis, including the Hog1 protein, Csa1p, Csa2p, and Csa3p, have been identified in the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, including the Hog1 and Csa1-3p isoforms [3].

The Hog1 protein is a cysteine protease that has a C-terminal, serine/threonine domain and is thought to be important for the degradation of the capsule. In the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, the Csa1-3 protein is important for capsule formation [4]. Csa1 and Csa3 share a common substrate that appears to be important for capsule formation. Csa1 and Csa3 are required for capsule production in the absence of Csa1 and Csa3 [5]. Csa1 and Csa3 are also required for capsule formation in the absence of Csa1 and Csa3 [4].


## Methods

Cytotoxicity assessment of antifungal drugs
A tissue culture of . albicans was performed using 0.5 mL of RPMI-1640 broth (Sigma) in a glass vial and centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 min at 4°C. Then, 1 mL of RPMI-1640 containing 10% glycerol (Sigma) was added. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The following compounds were tested: 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) for cell wall stress, acetonitrile for cell wall cytotoxicity evaluation, and amphotericin B for cell wall damage measurement [19].

Antifungal drug susceptibility test
MICs of caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 broth microdilution method [20]. The final concentrations of caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole ranged from 0.125 to 64 µg/mL. The final drug concentrations that resulted in =99.9% of fungal CFU were used in the susceptibility testing. The susceptibility of fungal isolates of C. albicans was checked by growth on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates for 48 h at 37°C and colonies were counted. The plates were then incubated at 35°C for 48 h and the MICs of the tested compounds were compared. The result was considered to be confirmed if there was no growth defect in the susceptible colonies.

Determination of antifungal activity of caspofungin and fluconazole
The MICs of caspofungin and fluconazole were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 MIC method [21]. The final concentrations of caspofungin and fluconazole ranged from 0.125 to 64 µg/mL. The final drug concentrations that resulted in >99.9% of fungal CFU were used in the antifungal susceptibility testing.


## Results
Five patients with proven FIVI infection had positive FIVI blood cultures, and five patients with proven FIVI-associated chorioretinitis had positive blood culture. One patient had clinical suspicion of having proven FIVI and was not tested for TB.

All patients had a healthy weight of 25.2 ± 2.1 and a CD4+ T-cell count of 94.6 ± 12.6 cells/µL. All patients had a normal CD4+ T-cell count of 64.5 ± 11.4 cells/µL and normal CD4+ T-cell counts of 57.6 ± 9.6 cells/µL. All patients were tested for anti-TB antibodies at the time of FIVI-acquired chorioretinitis.

The diagnostic activities of the anti-TB antibodies and the anti-FIVIBacter Benign Infection
At a minimum, all patients with proven or proven FIVI infection had a positive blood culture result. Five patients had a positive blood culture result; and two had a negative blood culture result. Five patients had a negative blood culture result. The clinical suspicion of FIVI infection in the HIV/AIDS population was established by a positive blood culture result at the time of FIVI-acquired chorioretinitis. Seven patients had a positive blood culture result; and six had a negative blood culture result. The diagnosis of FIVI infection was confirmed by a positive blood culture result at the time of FIVI-acquired chorioretinitis.

All patients had a positive blood culture result at the time of FIVI-acquired chorioretinitis. Two patients had a positive blood culture result at the time of FIVI-acquired chorioretinitis.

Patient characteristics of anti-FIVibacter Benign Infection in African countries: a retrospective study
We identified 21 patients with proven or proven FIVI infection in the HIV/AIDS population, with one patient showing a positive FIVI blood culture result (CD4+ T-cell count of 95 cells/µL). One patient had a negative blood culture result and was not tested for TB.


## Discussion

The frequency of urinary tract infection was highest among individuals who had a history of HIV or the use of antiretroviral therap. This finding is in contrast to the high prevalence of urinary tract infection in individuals with HIV infection [27] and was not significant in a retrospective study from the same population. In contrast to HIV-infected individuals, the frequency of non-FIVibacter bacteremia in African patients with low CD4+ cell counts was higher among individuals who had HIV infection and higher HIV-TBIV co-infection. This difference could be explained by the fact that individuals who have a low CD4+ cell counts may also have co-infection with higher doses of HIV [28], or alternatively, the patients with HIV infection may have had more cycles of HIV infection.

Another variable that may have influenced the frequency of urinary tract infection was the timing of TB. In HIV-TBIV co-infection, co-infection occurs in the early stages of HIV infection, followed by a concurrent TB infection. The frequency of co-infection in African patients with HIV infection is highest in patients with an HIV infection earlier than two years after diagnosis. This finding is in contrast to non-African populations that have a median TB infection of 2-8 months after diagnosis [29]. Co-infection in HIV-TBIV co-infected individuals has been previously reported in African patients with low CD4+ cell counts who had HIV infection [30]. In our study, the frequency of co-infection occurred earlier in HIV-TBIV co-infected individuals compared to those with a CD4+ cell count of less than 100 cells/µL. However, this frequency was not significantly different between co-infected individuals and HIV-TBIV co-infected individuals. These results are in contrast to studies from South Africa where HIV-TBIV co-infected individuals are more likely to have co-infection with higher doses of HIV, and this difference could be explained by the fact that HIV infection and co-infection in African populations are likely to be similar.

This study demonstrates that an increased prevalence of FIVIBacter bacteremia is associated with bladder infection in African populations.
