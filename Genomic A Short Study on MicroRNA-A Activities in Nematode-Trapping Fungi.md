## Abstract
The presence of Candida glabrata in urine is associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms, including increased conidia, pyogenic and infectious disease, and increased incontinence. Conidia are a group of microorganisms found in all areas of a human body and are commonly found in association with HIV/AIDS, cancer, autoimmunity, and trauma. Conidia are a group of bacteria found in the lining of the gut that produce toxins and pathogens. Conidia may also enter the colon and other places where they can cause disease. Conidia may also be present in the bloodstream, where they can cause a variety of symptoms. Conidia may also present as small ulcers or bursers, which may show different skinologies. Conidia may also spread from the skin to other parts of the body, where they can cause skin cancer and other diseases. The most common manifestation of an infectious disease, particularly cancer, involves a skin nodule or massular appearance. We present a case of a 52-year-old woman that was diagnosed with lymph node metastatic malignancy four months prior to admission, with a massular lesion that had a topsy-turvey-disease component. A biopsy was performed and diagnosed with multiple cancerous cancers.

Phylogenetic tree obtained from GenBank under Obligated Reputation. AUC2797.2 and AUC2798.2 sequences GenBank MK049904.1 and MK0499052.1; AUC2797.2 and AUC2798.2 sequences GenBank MK049906.1 and MK049907.1; Phylogenetic trees obtained from GenBank under Obligated Reputation. Maximum likelihood bootstrap calculation was performed on the largest dataset of the 31 Nematode-Trapping Fungi available at the time of writing, of which the majority (65%) were sequenced from GenBank (Additional file 2).

## Methods
brassicicola in the . fumigatus strain ATCC46645. The transcriptomic analysis was performed as described elsewhere [31]. The abundance of microRNAs was determined by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers for the qRT-PCR were designed based on the data obtained by sequencing the M. brassicicola genomic DNA using the First BASE 31 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as template. The sequences of the primers were deposited in the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

The RNA-binding proteins (RT-BP) of the nematode-feeding nematode M. brassicicola were identified by BCA method [32]. These RNA-binding proteins were identified based on the detection of P-type mRNA in M. brassicicola as previously described [33]. Briefly, M. brassicicola was cultivated in the dark at 25°C and then transferred to an artificial light-dark cycle at 25°C for 16 h. The complete culture was then transferred to an artificial light-dark cycle of 3 h and the RNA was extracted from the mycelium. The RNA-binding proteins were identified using BCA method. The RNA-binding proteins were also identified by qRT-PCR method.

Analysis of the mRNA levels of RNA-binding proteins in M. brassicicola
The RNA-binding proteins were identified as follows: RNA-binding proteins in M. brassicicola were detected by qRT-PCR method as described above. The transcriptomic analysis was performed as described above.

RNA-binding proteins in M. brassicicola were detected using the Quanti-iT™ SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as template.


## Results
However, the fact that we have shown that the N-terminal terminal of some genes is highly expressed in nematodes (fig 1A) might suggest a potential role for these genes in nematode developmen. To test this possibility, we generated strains of A. niger (named as <U+0394>niger:A) [39] using the same strategy as in the previous study (fig 1B). We named <U+0394>niger <U+0394>niger<U+0394>niger (named as <U+0394>niger:niger) for the gene <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger. Consistent with the current study, the <U+0394>niger strain exhibited a high expression of the human microRNAs (fig 1C) and the N-terminal terminal of the coding sequences (fig 1D). To test the possibility that the <U+0394>niger strain could be a pathogen, we made the strains <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger and <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger + 2 and <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger + 3 (named <U+0394>niger:niger:niger<U+0394>niger), and studied their expression using real-time PCR (Fig 1E). For both <U+0394>niger and <U+0394>niger + 2, the expression levels of the human microRNAs were higher than in <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger or <U+0394>niger:niger<U+0394>niger + 3 strains, which indicates that these two strains are more virulent than the <U+0394>niger strain. These data suggest that the N-terminal terminal of microRNAs is highly expressed in the nematode-trapping fungus A. niger.


## Discussion

For the most part, Nematodes and other insect species have very small genomes with low GC content and a relatively low GC content of the N-terminal domain [53]. It is believed that these species are able to use a large number of enzymes to obtain a higher GC content [54], but the GC content is generally very low in most eukaryotic organisms [55]. Furthermore, these enzymes are usually expressed at very high levels, and thus the GC content is low. Nevertheless, in some species, the GC content is much higher than the GC content of the N-terminal domain, and the enzymes are often expressed at very high GC contents. As a result, the GC content of the enzymes has been reported to be about 10-fold higher than that of the N-terminal domain [56].

The most frequent mammalian kinases, including the kinase activating protein kinase A (Kap1 and Ust1), phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signaling proteins, were present in the genome of S. mansoni. As shown in Fig 3a, the highest number of kinases were found in the genomes of S. mansoni and S. japonicus (Fig 3b), and it was the same group that was most abundant in the nematodes (Fig 3c).

In the genome of S. mansoni, the karA, karB and karC subfamilies were present, which had the highest number of genes (Table 3).

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamily, which includes the kinases of the MAP kinase pathway, is present in S. mansoni, and it was the most abundant family in the nematodes (Fig 3d). The karA, karB and karC subfamilies were present in S. mansoni, and it was the most abundant family in the nematodes (Fig 3e).

The most abundant families in the nematodes were the kinases of the MAP kinase pathway, which were present in S.
