## Abstract
The recently recognised protein tyrosine kinase (PKS) signalling pathway regulates the expression of a large variety of proteins in a wide range of eukaryotes, and is critical for the virulence of pathogenic fungi. We previously reported that the human PKS1 gene encodes a highly conserved PKS-like protein with a large family of kinases, and the human PKS2 gene encodes a secreted protein, which is significantly up regulated by PKS1 and/or PKS2, respectively. We also identified a protein-protein interaction (PPK1/PPK2) between the PKS1 and PKS2 genes in the PKS-like protein complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also show that the PKS proteins are essential for virulence of Streptomyces sp. in a mouse model of infection. We present here evidence for the first time the occurrence of a unique PPK1/PPK2 protein in a fungal species, and in particular the first description of the phylogenetic distribution and gene family of this family. The family of PKS proteins in S. cerevisiae PKS1 has been thoroughly studied in fungi, and the three human genes from which we identified a previously unknown protein are highly conserved in S. cerevisiae.

## Methods

.2. Fungal Strains, Culture Media and Growth Conditions
S. cerevisiae strain SM5 (serotype A, mating type A) was used for inoculation of the fermentation media used for the inoculation of MRSA. The fungi were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 25°C in an orbital shaker (150 rpm) and the spores were harvested by filtration on sterile cheesecloth. The fungal isolates were cultivated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 25°C for 3 days and used for further use.

4.2. Fungal Strains, Culture Media and Growth Conditions
Morphological characteristics of S. cerevisiae were recorded according to [21]. The yeast form of S. cerevisiae was characterized by the appearance of conidiophores in the colonies, using a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting microscope (Nikon, Japan). For morphological study, each isolate was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (20 g/L potato, 15 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L glucose, pH 7.0) for 3 days at 25°C. For antifungal susceptibility testing, S. cerevisiae isolates were cultured on PDA medium at 25°C for 3 days. For histopathological analysis, each isolate was cultured on potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium at 25°C for 3 days.

4.2. Fungal Strains, Culture Media and Growth Conditions
The virulent strains S. pombe were cultured on PDA medium at 25°C for 3 days.

4.2. Fungal Strains, Culture Media and Growth Conditions
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. They are used in all the assays, as well as in a laboratory environment, as their susceptibility tests were carried out in the field, where it is possible to evaluate the control of the field conditions and the species of the pathogenic fungi.

4.2. Fungal Strains, Culture Media and Growth Conditions
The F. graminearum strain was cultivated on PDA medium at 25°C for 3 days. The fungus was subcultured on PDA medium at 25°C for 7 days.


## Results

Frequent presence of red algal community in meat tenderloin
In general, the presence of several distinct red algal communities was found in all three types of meat tenderloi. Among them, the dominant red algal community was found in the dry matter of meat tenderloin (Figure 2A). In particular, there was a dominant red algal community in the dry matter of dry grain of meat tenderloin (Figure 2B). In particular, the dominant red algal community was found in the dry matter of dry grain of meat tenderloin (Figure 2C). There were also some species of red algal community present in the air of various buildings, including air from air filter, air filter air, and air-air mix, which could be used as a source of anaerobic and respirable metabolites such as ammonia and ethylene (Figure 2D).

Different species of red algal community were also detected in various types of meat tenderloin (Figure 2E). Species of red algal community were abundant in the air of various buildings, including air-air mix, air filter air, and air-air mix (Figure 2F). Different species of red algal community were detected in different types of meat tenderloin (Figure 2G). In particular, the dominant species were the species of the genus Pseudogymnoascus in all types of meat tenderloin except meat tenderloin with high sulfur content in the dry matter of dry grain (Figure 2H). Species of species of Pseudogymnoascus in various types of meat tenderloin, different numbers of neutrophils in different types of meat tenderloin, different mating types in various types of meat tenderloin, different numbers of dendritic cells and other cells in different types of meat tenderloin were also detected in different types of meat tenderloin (Figure 2I).

Different species of red algal community in different types of meat tenderloin
The presence of different species of red algal community was also detected in various types of meat tenderloin (Figure 2J). The dominant species were the species of Pseudogymnoascus (Pseudogymnoascus f. al. s. s. (P. f. al. s.)), P. penicillilys, P. oxycoccus, P. penicillilys (P.


## Discussion

The breed-specific and breed-specific correlations have been reported for the different diseases of tenderloin, including salmonella, Salmonella-associated urinary tract infections and animal parasites (for review see [9]. However, there is no definitive evidence that a single disease is the primary reason for the absence of tenderloin in each of the breed-specific variants.

The breed-specific correlations of the mycelium and the proliferation of the mycelium in different breeds of meat have been reported (for review see [9]). In this study, there was no correlation between the proportion of neutrophils and the proliferation of the mycelium in a single strain of C. amylolentus, whereas the correlation was reported for a strain of C. albidus (with neutrophils) [11]. Thus, the results of this study suggest that the neutrophil population is a primary factor in the proliferation of the mycelium in C. amylolentus.

The breed-specific correlations of the mycelium and the proliferation of the mycelium have been reported in other studies [11]. In the present study, there was no correlation between the mycelium and the proliferation of the mycelium in C. amylolentus (with neutrophils). In a study of C. amylolentus, the absence of neutrophils resulted in a robust proliferation of the mycelium [8]. In another study, a neutrophil was found to be the predominant factor for the absence of neutrophil proliferation in C. amylolentus, and the proliferation of the mycelium was associated with the presence of neutrophils [12]. In the present study, the absence of neutrophils was associated with the proliferation of the mycelium. This observation suggests that neutrophils play a role in the pathogenesis of C. amylolentus.

The breed-specific correlations of the mycelium and the proliferation of the mycelium have been reported for other species of meat, including C. amylolentus [9], P. jiroveci [13] and A. castellanii [14].
