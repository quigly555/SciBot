## Abstract
The use of antifungal drugs to treat fungal infections has increased significantly during the last decades. The aim of this review is to collect recent advances in therapeutic alternatives and explore their mechanisms of action so as to choose the most effective ones. We have discussed the mechanisms of action of some of the most used antifungal drugs, as well as the research that is currently in its infancy, and discussed their future perspectives and application in the treatment of patients with fungal infections. Our aim in this review is to collect recent advances in therapeutic alternatives and explore their mechanisms of action so as to choose the most effective ones.


## Introduction
It is a component of the Proteases secretory pathway, which is important for the enzymes [1. The secretion of free protocatechuic acid by Proteases is catalyzed by the Tcn1 protein, which contains the enzyme that catalyzes the Tcn1 reaction [2]. Tcn1 contains a characteristic domain, which is involved in the catalytic reaction of protocatechuic acid, and the domains are known to be responsible for the formation of the ferric ion, ferric chloride, in S. cerevisiae [3,4]. Ferric ion formation by Proteases occurs in a reaction between ferrous ion and ferric ion, which is catalyzed by the Tcn1 protein, which contains a characteristic domain, which is involved in the formation of the ferric ion, ferric chloride, in S. cerevisiae [2,5]. Ferric ion formation by Proteases is catalyzed by the Ctr1 protein, which contains a characteristic domain, which is involved in the formation of the ferric ion, ferric chloride, in S. cerevisiae [2,5]. Ctr1 has been reported to form a complex with the ferric ion, which is generated by the catalytic reaction of Ctr1 and Ctr2 in the presence of CTA and CBL [6]. In addition, Ctr2 is essential for the formation of the ferric ion, which is catalyzed by Ctr1 and Ctr2 in the presence of CTA and CBL [6,7]. Ferric ion formation by Proteases can be catalyzed by the Bdr1 protein, which contains a characteristic domain, which is involved in the formation of the ferric ion, which is catalyzed by the catalytic reaction of Bdr1 and BDR2 in the presence of CTA and CBL [6,7]. Ctr1 has been reported to form a complex with the ferric ion, which is generated by the catalytic reaction of Ctr1 and Ctr2 in the presence of CTA and CBL [6,7].


## Methods
After that, samples were kept in a desiccator at 4 °. Samples were processed according to the methodology described by Bockes (2003). The protein levels were quantified by the Bradford method [41].

Growth kinetics of different strains
All fungal strains were grown in a minimal medium (MM: 0.5% glucose, 1.0 mM MgSO_4, 1.0 mM KH_2PO_4, 0.5% glycerol, 0.2% (NH_4)_2SO_4, 0.2% (NH_3)_2SO_4, 0.01% (NH_4)_2SO_4, 0.01% (NH_3)_2Mo_4) at 30 °C. The media was changed every six days, and then, the cultures were kept at 30 °C.

A. fumigatus Af293 and D-Galactose
A. fumigatus Af293 and D-Galactose were grown on MM containing 1% (w/v) of both G418 and galactose. Growth curves were performed on a BioRad CFX96 real-time PCR instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR program used was as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The internal standard was used as the control for the fluorescence signal, and the PCR program of M-MS-MS was used as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The A. fumigatus D-Galactose was grown on MM containing 0.2% (w/v) of G418 and 0.5% (w/v) of galactose. Growth curves were performed on a BioRad CFX96 real-time PCR instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).


## Results
The RNA-Seq data were normalized against the normalized expression levels of the enzyme for all enzymes identified by the MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysi. The relative expression of the putative cold-adaptive enzymes is presented in Table 4. As shown in Figure 1, MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis revealed that the relative expression of the putative cold-adaptive enzymes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cold-adaptive than in cold-active samples. The MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis also revealed that the relative expression of the putative cold-adaptive enzymes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cold-adaptive than in cold-active samples. In addition, the relative expression of the putative cold-adaptive enzymes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cold-active samples.

Phylogenetic Analysis of the Cold-Active Proteases
In order to test the phylogenetic analysis, we identified the genes that were differentially expressed in cold-adaptive versus cold-active samples (Table 1) using a phylogenetic tree construction (Fig 2). The tree constructed from the amino acid sequences of the cold-adaptive versus cold-active enzymes is shown in Fig 3 and also in Fig 4. The heat map (Fig 4) shows that the cold-adaptive and cold-active enzymes share a common evolutionary history and show similar distributions of gene expression patterns. The phylogenetic tree shows that the cold-adaptive and cold-active enzymes have a common evolutionary history and contain the same set of common gene expression patterns. The phylogenetic tree also shows that the cold-adaptive and cold-active enzymes are phylogenetically distinct. The tree is supported by the bootstraps values of the phylogenetic analysis of the heat map (Fig 2), which indicates that the cold-adaptive and cold-active enzymes are phylogenetically distinct. The phylogenetic analysis also indicates that the cold-adaptive and cold-active enzymes are phylogenetically distinct.


## Discussion
This approach allowed the identification of a number of novel cold-active proteins that could be produced by plants and eukaryote. These cold-active proteins may be used as biological or biotechnological bioproducts.

Among the cold-active proteins identified in this study, it was observed that the Csa1 and Csa3 proteins were the most abundant proteins in this study (Table 3). Their structural similarity to proteins in other cold-active species could be a result of their different molecular mechanism of action. For example, Csa1 and Csa3 were produced in a cold-active strain and were not required for growth in the presence of various solutes. Csa1 and Csa3 were produced only in the presence of the solute, at the end of the heat-inducible period, which is not needed for the growth of the fungus. This suggests that the Csa proteins may be produced in the presence of different solutes. Another cold-active protein (Csa5) was also found in this study (Table 3). It is a small protein that has been reported to be produced by plants and plants-to-plant-to-plant-to-host and to be produced in the presence of solutes. It is predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, linolenic acid and stearic acid. The Csa5 protein was also found to be produced only in the presence of the solutes, and its expression level was not higher than in the presence of the solutes (Table 3). This suggests that the Csa proteins could be produced in the presence of different solutes.

The low molecular weight of Csa proteins could be a result of their hydrophobic properties, which is a property of some cold-active proteins. For example, Csa5 was reported to be less hydrophobic than other cold-active proteins in the context of the cold-activated enzymes that possess their own hydrophobic sites [43]. It has been reported that some cold-active proteins are less hydrophobic than other proteins and, consequently, a lower molecular weight is produced [44].
