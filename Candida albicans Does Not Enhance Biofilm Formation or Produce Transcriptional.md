## Abstract
We report the case of a severely immunocompromised patient with cryptococcal meningitis, acute leukaemia, and onco-hematological lesions who had a history of multiple organ failures and autoimmune diseases, who developed multiple organ abscesses. The patient had a history of multiple organ failures and autoimmune diseases, as well as a prior who had multiple organ failures. The diagnosis of Cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed by PCR and culture. The patient had a favorable prognosis with treatment and recovered.


## Introduction

Biofilm formation, and thus virulence, is a complex process in which several factors regulate cell differentiation, differentiation of organs, differentiation of organs’ morphology, and the outcome of the microbial response to the host [1,2.


## Methods
When required, yeast cells were removed from the medium by washing with PB. For biofilm assay, 100 µl of yeast cell suspension (10^5 cells ml^-1) was added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (TPP Biofilm Technology, Taiwan) and allowed to stand at 37°C for 2 h. After the addition of the solution, the plate was gently shaken for 30 s. The plate was then inverted and washed three times with PBS and the wells were again inverted. The plate was again inverted and washed three times with PBS. The plate was then inverted again and stained with trypan blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and examined under the light microscope. A 100-µl aliquot of the suspension (10^6 cells ml^-1) was added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (TPP Biofilm Technology, Taiwan) and allowed to stand at 37°C for 2 h. After the addition of the solution, the plate was gently shaken for 30 s. The plate was then inverted again and washed with PBS. The plate was then inverted again and stained with trypan blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and examined under the light microscope.

2.3. Cell Culture and Growth Assay
For the in vitro cell culture of Candida albicans, cells from fresh (no. 1) and/or washed (no. 1) from P. pastoris cultures were plated in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (TPP Biofilm Technology, Taiwan) at a density of 1 × 10^6 cells ml^-1. In addition, cells were cultured in complete medium at 37°C for 5 days. For the in vivo cell culture, Candida albicans cells were cultured in complete medium at 37°C for 5 days. For the in vitro cell culture of yeast cells, cells from a 1:1 ratio (yeast cell:spores) were cultured in a 96-well microtiter plate (TPP Biofilm Technology, Taiwan) at a density of 1 × 10^6 cells ml^-1. The cells were then treated with YP or YP + YP (2, 4, 8, 10, or 12 µg/ml) for 3 h.


## Results
We compared the biofilm formation and cell viability of Candida albicans grown in the presence and absence of various concentrations of L-gluca. As shown in Fig 4, when Candida albicans was grown in the presence of L-glucan, the number of viable cells was significantly higher than that of the negative control, which was not significantly different (p = 0.19). However, when Candida albicans was grown in the presence of L-glucan, the number of viable cells was significantly lower than that of the control (p = 0.073). When Candida albicans was grown in the presence of L-glucan, the number of viable cells was significantly higher than that of the control (p = 0.0063). These data suggest that L-glucan enhances the biofilm formation and cell viability of Candida albicans in the presence of L-glucan.

L-glucan enhances the growth of Candida albicans and increases biofilm formation
Since L-glucan can be used as a growth-promoting agent for biofilm formation [20], we wanted to evaluate the effect of L-glucan on the growth and biofilm formation of Candida albicans. We used a standard biofilm growth medium that is suitable for the biofilm growth and that is suitable for biofilm formation [21]. The biofilm growth was assessed by measuring the total biomass. As shown in Fig 5A, when Candida albicans was grown in the presence of L-glucan, the total biomass of the yeast cells was significantly lower than that of the control (p < 0.0001). As shown in Fig 5B, L-glucan also increased the total biomass of Candida albicans in the presence of L-glucan, while the total biomass of Candida albicans in the presence of L-glucan was significantly higher than that of the control. The results indicated that L-glucan enhanced the growth and the biofilm formation of Candida albicans.


## Discussion
albicans
Biofilm formation is the initial step in the formation of biofilm, which is followed by the formation of biofilm. Biofilms are the first step in the biofilm formation process, followed by biofilm formation and finally biofilm formation, as seen in Figure 1. In the initial biofilm formation process, all the cells in the biofilm are exposed to a large amount of stressors, such as carbon, osmotic, light, temperature, temperature, and water, and a high amount of nutrients. The initial biofilm formation process is further followed by the biofilm formation and finally biofilm formation, as seen in Figure 1.

The initial biofilm formation process was followed by the formation of biofilms. The biofilm formation is initially completed by the formation of biofilms. The biocompatible cell wall is formed between the cells and the cell wall and the biofilm formation is completed by the formation of biofilms. The final biofilm formation is completed by the formation of biofilms. The results of the biofilm formation process are shown in Figure 2.
