## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a causative agent of cryptococcosis, a significant life-threatening fungal disease worldwide. Developing new drugs to treat this disease requires an alternative strategy to combat the yeast. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of a genetically tractable target for genetic vaccine candidate disease pathogenesis. We provide a description of the genome sequence and compare it with the sequences of species-specific fungal genomes and fungal host genomes. Our analysis revealed that the C. gattii genome lacks the transcriptional regulator SecA, which is absent in the human host.


## Introduction
Natural antimicrobial compounds are derived from natural flora or plant. Natural antimicrobial compounds are derived from natural flora and plants. Their secondary metabolites, namely phytochemicals, have been described as key to human health. Several phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and glycosides have been described as medicinal agents.

Natural compounds such as phenolic acids, tannins, triterpenoids, and quercetin have been reported to exert antifungal activity against Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and dermatophytes. However, the biological activities of these compounds have not been thoroughly investigated.

Zinc is essential trace element in all living organisms. The biological activities of zinc are dependent on the concentration of zinc present in the medium. Zinc is a heterogeneous metal that has various biological activities. For example, it has antioxidant, antiulcer, and antimicrobial activities [1]. Zinc can be chelated by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Zinc can also be degraded by the action of enzymes like cytochrome P450 oxidase, proteinases, lipases, and lipase. Zinc digestase is a well-known bacterium that has been reported to degrade several kinds of bacteria, such as Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Staphylococcus epidermidis [2]. It is necessary to identify and inhibit these microorganisms.

Among the compounds known for their antimicrobial activity, the essential oils of lavender, clove, cinnamon, and geraniol showed antimicrobial activity. In addition, the essential oils of lavender, clove, and geraniol inhibited the growth of Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and dermatophytes. The essential oils of clove, cinnamon, and geraniol exhibited bactericidal and fungicidal activity against the tested strains.

The antimicrobial activity of essential oils of lavender, clove, and geraniol was demonstrated by the inhibition of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and bacteria.


## Methods
Two types of natural plant sterols (Phenols and Puns) and a proteolipid (Protein Puns) were included in the study, namely, Puns (L-Canavanine-L-Hind) and Puns (L-Canavanine-L-Hind. The corresponding natural plant sterols were used in the present study for their effective dose in preventing the pathogen-induced toxicity of Carotenoids. The four natural plant sterols were purified by p-nitrophenyl-ß-D-xylopyranoside (pNPP) according to the method of Haidt et al. [20]. For the determination of the antimalarial effect of the compounds, the two types of compounds were prepared according to the method of Yau et al. [21]. A total of 20 µg/mL of the compounds were tested in 0.2 M NaOH solution, pH 6.0, at 25 °C for 24 h. The results were read after 24 h.

3.4. Antifungal Activity Assays
The antimalarial activity of the compounds against the pathogen was determined by the method of Inoue et al. [22]. The antimalarial effect was defined as the reduction of 1.0-fold of the bacterial growth by the fungal growth. The antifungal activity of the compounds against P. expansum, P. luchuensis, and P. brasiliensis was determined by the method of Dong et al. [23]. The antimalarial activity was defined as the reduction of 1.0-fold of the fungal growth by the bacterial growth. The antimalarial effect was defined as the reduction of 0.5-fold of the fungal growth by the fungal growth. The antimalarial effect of the compounds was defined as the reduction of 0.067-fold of the fungal growth by the fungal growth. The antimalarial effect of the compounds was defined as the reduction of 0.05-fold of the fungal growth by the fungal growth.

3.5. Determination of the Antimalarial Activity of the Folic acid
Folic acid (PAS) was determined according to the method of Tambong et al. [24]. The antimalarial activity was defined as the reduction of 0.


## Results
In addition, the survey of the whole plant components, and in particular, the monocotyledonate compound, was carried ou. For the survey, the total monocotyledonate, monocotyledonate and gallic acid were detected in three extracts, the monocotyledonate compound in three extracts from plant material, and the gallic acid in three extracts from plant material.

The total monocotyledonate, monocotyledonate and gallic acid was detected in three extracts from plant material. These extracts were prepared from different plant materials, and the monocotyledonate compound was found in three extracts from plant material. The total gallic acid was detected in three extracts from plant material. These extracts were prepared from different plant materials, and the gallic acid was found in three extracts from plant material.

3.4. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activities of the three extracts from plant materials are presented in Table 4. Antifungal activity was tested against nine fungi, with the antifungal activities of the three extracts from plant materials. As shown in Table 5, the antifungal activity was 100%, with the lowest MIC values being 0.06%, 0.25%, 0.06%, 0.25%, and 0.25%, respectively.

3.5. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the three extracts from plant materials against the tested fungi is presented in Table 6. The antifungal activity was 100%, with the lowest MIC values being 0.06%, 0.25%, 0.06%, 0.25%, and 0.25%, respectively.

## Discussion
The results of the study showed that commercial blood borne pathogens have an increased incidence of opportunistic infection. In addition, the incidence of opportunistic infections in patients with autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer was higher than in healthy subjects.

In the case of opportunistic infection, the incidence of opportunistic infections was lower in patients with autoimmune diseases, in whom the risk factors for opportunistic infections were acquired earlier, and in whom the risk factors for opportunistic infections are not well known. In the case of opportunistic infection, the incidence of opportunistic infections was higher in patients with low levels of CD4^+ T cell, in whom the risk factors for opportunistic infections are not well known, and in whom the risk factors for opportunistic infections are not well known. In the case of cardiovascular diseases, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases was higher in patients with high CD4^+ T cell, in whom the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are not well known, and in whom the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are not well known. In the case of cancers, the incidence of cancers was higher in patients with high levels of CD4^+ T cell, in whom the risk factors for cancer are not well known, and in whom the risk factors for cancer are not well known. In the case of autoimmune diseases, the incidence of autoimmune diseases was higher in patients with low levels of CD4^+ T cell, in whom the risk factors for autoimmune diseases are not well known, and in whom the risk factors for autoimmune diseases are well known. In the case of autoimmune diseases, the incidence of autoimmune diseases was higher in patients with low CD4^+ T cell, in whom the risk factors for autoimmune diseases are not well known, and in whom the risk factors for autoimmune diseases are well known.

The prevalence of opportunistic infections in patients with cardiovascular diseases is generally lower than in patients with autoimmune diseases. However, there are several important limitations. The prevalence of opportunistic infections in patients with cardiovascular diseases is much lower than in patients with autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of opportunistic infections is lower than in patients with other diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of opportunistic infections in patients with autoimmune diseases is also lower than in patients with other diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of opportunistic infections in patients with cancer is higher than in patients with other diseases, such as cancer.
