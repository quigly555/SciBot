Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Microorganisms of the genus Maytenus are the etiological agents of a plethora of symptoms commonly encountered in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the diagnosis of the disease in SLE is often challenging because of the lack of direct laboratory testing and the possibility of infection. We report the identification of an N. tritici N. tritici strain, obtained through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, which was susceptible to biotransformation inhibitors (stocks of ~300 cfu/mL) in clinical samples of SLE. Infectious disease was caused by N. tritici when it was first described in 2007. We then determined the susceptibility of the N. tritici strain and its potential direct pathogenicity gene N. tritici, and determined the potential mechanisms underlying the development of resistance. Our results provide the first evidence for direct pathogenicity in the N. tritici strain, and the first direct evidence for possible infection in a strain that is resistant to biotransformation inhibitors.


## Introduction
The genus of aspergilli includes many important fungal pathogens that can cause serious invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Among these, A. fumigatus is the most common fungal pathogen, responsible for about 1.5 million infections per year [1]. Aspergillosis can be categorized into three major categories-proven or non-proven. In the proven category, the pathogen is defined as a fungal infection that presents clinically, radiographically, and microbiologically, with localized or disseminated dissemination to the lung, the brain, and/or the central nervous system. In the non-proven category, the pathogen is defined as a fungal infection that presents clinically, radiographically, and microbiologically, but does not typically be reported in the literature. The clinically important class A fungi are the primary pathogens of humans. However, other fungi, including A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. oryzae, can also cause invasive aspergillosis and other pulmonary aspergilloses in susceptible hosts. Aspergillosis is the most common fungal disease in humans and is responsible for approximately 1.5 million infections annually [2].


## Methods
The diagnosis of invasive lupus infection was performed according to the consensus of the relevant pathologist.

All cases were confirmed by histopathologic examination of the affected gland tissues and/or the sputum specimens. The diagnosis of invasive lupus infection was confirmed by a culture of the sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using standard techniques, as previously described [10]. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive India ink staining of the affected gland tissues and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain. The diagnosis of invasive lupus was confirmed by a positive culture of the sputum and/or a positive India ink stain.


## Results
Isolation of the fungus
The isolation of four different strains of C. neoformans was performed using a nested PCR technique (Table 1). The PCR products were obtained from a total of six samples, and the total number of PCR products was 1,544,000 (Table 1). The three isolates from South Korea and South Africa each contained one or two isolates of C. neoformans, whereas the one isolated from South Africa contained two isolates.

The CBS 7064 isolate was successfully isolated from a patient with hematologic malignancy. Three of the isolates from South Korea contained a clinical isolate from which a diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans was made based on the culture of the isolate (Figure 1). The isolate CBS 7064 was found to be C. neoformans var. grubii in culture (Figure 1). The isolate CBS 7064 was isolated from a patient with a chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. The isolate CBS 7064 was initially identified as C. neoformans var. grubii, but it was not cultured in the clinical setting. The isolate CBS 7064 was further identified as C. neoformans var. grubii by PCR using the primers CBS 731.90 and CBS 812.90, and by the culture of the isolate CBS 7064. The culture of the isolate CBS 7064 was found to be C. neoformans var. neoformans in culture.

Biomass and lipid contents
The culture and molecular methods were successfully used to extract the C. neoformans strain CBS 7064. All the isolates were able to grow and produce substantial quantities of biomass, which was consistent with the growth and lipid content data. The only exception was the CBS 7064 isolate, which was not able to grow at the medium level, and was not able to utilize the sorbic acid source (Figure 1). The culture was also able to grow at the low pH of 4.5, but was not able to utilize the sorbic acid source (Figure 1).

The culture and the molecular methods were also able to extract the C. neoformans strain CBS 731.90 and to produce lipid (Figure 2). The culture was able to grow at the pH of 4.5, but was unable to utilize the sorbic acid source (Figure 2).


## Discussion
The most common causes of bacterial meningitis in HIV-positive patients are bacterial meningitis of the stomach, erythematous abscess, abscesses, granuloma, and tuberculoma, [5. Tuberculous meningitis is rare and multidrug-resistant infections are uncommon, [6]. As a consequence, HIV-infected patients often have limited access to medical care and may be excluded from the community.

The most common etiology of bacterial meningitis in HIV-positive patients is infection with Pneumocystis, a yeast-like pathogen that causes pneumonia in the body fluids of HIV-infected patients. [7] Although the exact cause of bacterial meningitis in HIV-positive patients remains to be determined, it is associated with immunosuppression, including the use of immunosuppressive therapy. [8] Prior to the availability of this information, there were no reports of bacterial meningitis in HIV-positive patients. However, an additional report of a patient with recurrent urinary tract infections in an HIV-positive patient suggested the possibility of bacterial meningitis. This patient had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, which might have contributed to the occurrence of bacterial meningitis in the absence of any history of other infections. In addition, the patient had a history of febrile illness, which was a common finding in this patient. However, in our patient, the patient had a history of febrile illness and febrile urinary tract infections. Additionally, the patient had a history of exposure to contaminated water. We believe that our patient had a history of exposure to water and was not involved in this case.

There are several possible etiologies of bacterial meningitis in HIV-positive patients. Other causes of bacterial meningitis, such as prostatitis, are less common and include bacteremia, an infection caused by Escherichia coli, and cytotoxic bacteria. [9] Bacteremia is a rare disorder of the urinary tract that presents as an abdominal distal or subcutaneous bacteremia. It is characterized by a dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pain in the bladder, abdomen, and bladder walls. [10] The cause of bacteremia is currently not clear.
