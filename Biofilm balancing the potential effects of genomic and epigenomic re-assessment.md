## Abstract
The mucosa is a major structure in fungal pathogens, which can serve as hosts, vectors, pathogens and vehicles for spreading a virulence factor. Here we demonstrate that a number of pathogenic fungi utilize the mucosa for both life-threatening and also potentially useful behaviors, such as invasion and dispersal.


## Introduction
The basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes opportunistic meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and death in mice and humans in many parts of the world (1). The majority of infections occur in immunocompromised patients, while the remainder is caused by immunocompromised individuals such as HIV/AIDS patients, organ transplant patients, and cancer patients (2). In this context, C. neoformans is considered to be a significant pathogen that causes AIDS-related opportunistic infections (3,4). The incidence of cryptococcosis has increased significantly in the past three decades, particularly among HIV/AIDS patients (5,6). The highest incidence of cryptococcosis is found in tropical regions, especially in the Americas, and the highest prevalence is found in sub-Saharan Africa (7). The epidemiology of cryptococcosis in HIV/AIDS patients is particularly challenging because of the high levels of immunosuppression in these patients and the high levels of cryptococcal disease in the lung (8).

Cryptococcus neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis, with an estimated incidence of 1 million cases per year (9). In HIV-positive patients, C. neoformans is the fourth most common cause of death (10) and the third most common cause of non-life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) disease (11). Therefore, the most effective treatment strategies to control C. neoformans infection have been the current anti-cryptococcal drug therapies (12,13).

In HIV/AIDS, C. neoformans infection is the most common clinical manifestation, with approximately one million cases occurring annually (14). The clinical outcomes of C. neoformans infections are poor, with approximately one million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (15). Thus, the current treatment options for the treatment of cryptococcosis are limited and require the development of new therapies (14).

At present, a combination of amphotericin-B (AMB) and flucytosine (5FC) is the standard therapy for cryptococcal infections.


## Methods
albicans, . albicans SC5314, and C. albicans JEC21 (NucleoSpin^®) as described previously (11). The A549 cell lines were grown in LB-agar (Gibco) at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 48 h. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were lysed with 0.9% BSA in 0.1 M citrate buffer for 10 min at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 50 µl of 3 M citrate buffer and stored at -20°C until use. The lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of 3 M citrate buffer, and the supernatant was removed. The lysate was then passed through a 0.22 µm pore size filter (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and loaded on a NuPAGE^® purification column (GE Healthcare) in NuPAGE^® NP-40 (GE Healthcare). The flow-through was collected by a NuPAGE^® column purification buffer (GE Healthcare) containing 1% p-formic acid and 0.02% acetic acid. The flow-through was equilibrated with 100 µl of NuPAGE^® NP-40 (GE Healthcare) in 200 µl of NuPAGE^® NP-40 buffer (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed with 200 µl of NuPAGE^® NP-40 buffer (GE Healthcare) to remove the column and the elution was performed with 100 µl of elution buffer (GE Healthcare). The elution was stopped by adding 10 µl of 0.2% w/v formic acid. The elution was then equilibrated with 200 µl of elution buffer (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed with 200 µl of elution buffer (GE Healthcare).


## Results
We first tested the sensitivity of the new epigenomic re-assessment model to the stressors associated with the AIDS mode.

Aneuploidy of HEK293 cells induced the same level of sensitivity as the parental HEK293 strain, indicating that the epigenomic re-assessment model is not unsuitable for evaluating the effects of individual epigenome-driven changes on the adaptive response of HIV-infected patients. We then compared the sensitivity of the parental strain and the new epigenomic re-assessment model for the development of cell-associated phenotypes.

To test if the new model is capable of evaluating the impact of single epigenome-driven phenotypes on the adaptive response, we used a single-step analysis to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute cell-associated phenotypes of HIV-infected patients.

The original original experiment was carried out to assess the sensitivity of the new model to acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. The new model was then tested to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. The original experiment was carried out to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. The original experiment was carried out to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. The original experiment was repeated in this test to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. In the new model, the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain was assessed by the addition of high-affinity S100A (the threshold concentration for S100A) to a medium supplemented with 0.5 M Mg^2+ (Figure 1). The original experiment was repeated in this test to assess the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain. In the new model, the sensitivity of the new model to the acute phenotypes of the HEK293 strain was assessed by adding 0.5 M Mg^2+ to a medium supplemented with 0.5 M Mg^2+ (Figure 1).


## Discussion
cerevisiae and RAPD and the control B1 strain on artificial medium supplemented with a low amount of . cerevisiae and RAPD. The S. cerevisiae and RAPD strains were then cultivated on the same artificial media and on same day. As expected, the increase in the number of colonies was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of biofilm formation in both the control and B1 strains. In contrast, the increase in the total number of colonies resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation. However, the increase in the number of colonies was accompanied by a decrease in the biofilm formation. In this study, the level of biofilm formation was decreased by 1.4 log^-1 colony diameter per colony diameter in the B1 strain, and by 1.8 log^-1 colony diameter per colony diameter in the control strain. The results showed that the increase in biofilm formation was accompanied by a decrease in the number of colonies.

A possible explanation for the difference in biofilm formation between the two strains is that the B1 strain and the control strain are grown in a different medium, while the B1 strain is grown in the same medium and the B1 strain is grown on artificial media. In this study, the addition of a sugar solution to the medium resulted in a significant increase in the number of colonies in both the control and B1 strains. As can be seen in Fig 3A, a decrease in biofilm formation was not observed for the B1 strain.

The differences in biofilm formation between the two strains were investigated by the ability of the B1 strain to grow on synthetic media and to grow on synthetic medium supplemented with S. cerevisiae. The increase in biofilm formation was accompanied by a decrease in the number of colonies per colony. This result indicated that the B1 strain was able to grow on synthetic media and to grow on synthetic medium supplemented with S. cerevisiae. The increase in biofilm formation was accompanied by a decrease in the number of colonies per colony.

In order to test the ability of the B1 strain to grow on synthetic media, the maximum biomass of the B1 strain was achieved on synthetic medium supplemented with synthetic yeast extract and the total biomass of the B1 strain was 8.8±0.1 g/L, which is similar to the biomass of the control strain.
