## Abstract
Opportunistic infections caused by dermatophytes, phytopathogens, fungal pathogens and other fungi are common life-threatening human diseases. The causative agents are usually environmental microorganisms that are usually isolated from the human microbiome or from plant or animal sources. These pathogens are usually isolated via sequencing and the characterization of the DNA extracted. We present a first attempt to explain the environmental origin of a common dermatophyte, referred to as Pseudonectria jenmanna, which has been isolated from a fungus that causes nervous system disorders in humans. The aim of this study was to find out the mechanisms of P. jenmanna’s virulence, which may be related to the mechanism of its pathogenic ability. The skin parenchyma revealed P. jenmanna can grow on a wide range of media including foods and solid foods. Growth conditions, such as heat, salt and low oxygen levels, were important factors that contributed to its virulence. Growth in yeast cells suggested the presence of fungal spores in the host’s phagosome. P.


## Introduction
The genus Rhizopus, previously named Microdochium, contains approximately 25 species and 9 genera [1-3]. Microdochium is one of them species with good morphological characters, which are found in the skin of both humans and animals and are commonly called “Rizopus” or “Rizovopsis”. It is a species that is found in the skin of humans and animals and is characterized by the production of pigmented cells, called “Rizopus stachyurus” or “Riz-ochin”. In the past, Microdochium has been considered as a skin disease, which can be found in the clinical pictures [4-7]. Microdochium is a family of microdochium, which consists of five members (Dendryphion, Microdochium, Microwave, Psaknauwelia, and Tetrowave) and four species (Z. sampaioides, T. humicola, and T. viridocus) [8-11]. However, the genus Microdochium has been found in other species, including T. viridocus, which is distributed mainly in South America, and Z. sampaioides, which is distributed mainly in Europe, Australia, and North America [8, 10].


## Methods
% agar, .1% dextrose, 0.1% KH_2PO_4). The stock solution of Bougainvillea karbonicola (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was adjusted to 0.3 g/mL. The stock solution of HCL (1% w/v) was prepared in distilled water. It was added to the stock solution of Aatioiaceae, which was then poured over the Aatioiaceae solid medium. The two-fold dilution series of HCL were prepared in sterile distilled water and the stock solution of the compounds was prepared in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The diluted stock solution was added to the same solution of HCL. The concentration of the compound was then adjusted to the desired concentration of 0.1% w/v. The stock solution of HCL was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The stock solution of HCL was then poured over the solid medium. The liquid medium with the Aatioiaceae compound was prepared in the same way. The two-fold dilution series of HCL were prepared in sterile distilled water and the concentration of the compound was then adjusted to the desired concentration of 0.01% w/v.

Bougainvillea karbonicola (Aatioiaceae) was prepared in the same way as the previously described method. The stock solution of Aatioiaceae was adjusted to 0.3 g/mL. It was poured over the solid medium. The liquid medium with the Aatioiaceae compound was prepared in the same way. The two-fold dilution series of HCL were prepared in sterile distilled water and the stock solution of HCL was then poured over the solid medium. The liquid medium with the Aatioiaceae compound was prepared in the same way. The two-fold dilution series of HCL were prepared in sterile distilled water and the stock solution of HCL was then poured over the solid medium. The liquid medium with the Aatioiaceae compound was prepared in the same way.


## Results
karbonicola, and . karbonicola, was evaluated using a broad-spectrum antifungal assay with a specific MIC (µg/ml) of 0.25 mg/ml, 1.25 mg/ml, and 5 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1). The MICs of the compounds were determined by an end-point MIC test, and the MIC of the Bougainvillea karbonicola compound (BKC) against all three Candida species was determined by a checkerboard assay. The MIC_50 values of Bougainvillea karbonicola and C. karbonicola against P. karbonicola and C. karbonicola were 0.125 mg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml, respectively.

For the following, the MIC_50 values of Bougainvillea karbonicola and C. karbonicola were 0.125 mg/ml, 0.125 µg/ml, and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of Bougainvillea karbonicola and C. karbonicola were 0.125 µg/ml, 0.125 µg/ml, and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively. For the above MIC_50 values, the MIC_50 values of Bougainvillea karbonicola and C. karbonicola were 0.125 mg/ml, 0.125 µg/ml, and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively. These results demonstrated that Bougainvillea karbonicola was a potent antifungal agent against C. karbonicola, but the MIC_50 values of Bougainvillea karbonicola and C. karbonicola were very low.
