## Abstract
Biofilms formed on the human nasopharynx by the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii are resistant to anti-fungal drugs, which might favor the growth of both aerobic and anaerobic lifestyles. To investigate the anti-fungal potential of the cell walls in this microorganism, we constructed a siRNA gene (128-256 bp), the first in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The siRNA was expressed in S. cerevisiae under the control of a laminin producer. We also established the genetic expression of the gene by the screening of mutants that were naturally infected with the host strain, indicating that the host laminin contributed to the cellular environment in this important yeast. The anti-fungal activity of the siRNA gene was determined by a minimal assay, and a grazing assay indicated that the genetic analysis did not indicate laminin limitation. The results presented here thus, evidence the possibility of developing anti-fungal drugs for treatment of human fungal infections.


## Introduction
Phaeohyphomycosis (PHS) is a fungal disease caused by the dimorphic fungus Phaeosphaeria graminicola, commonly known as Ph. borshadicum or Ph. borshadicum-like. It is characterized by the formation of conidia and lesions on leaf surfaces and is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, red to pale brown spots, and necrosis. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and is mainly caused by spores of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) [1].

In tropical and subtropical areas, cryptococcosis is the second most frequent fungal disease with a worldwide incidence of 15 to 30% [2]. It is caused by the protozoan pathogen, C.


## Methods
Strains and Culture Conditions
P. lupus ATCC 90112 (a kind gift of Prof. G. K. K. Nagao, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China) was used as the wild-type strain for all the experiments. All strains were maintained in brain heart infusion (BHI) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C. Strains used in this study were collected from China Laboratory for Environmental Health (CLEH), and used for all the experiments described in this work.

P. lupus ATCC 90112 was maintained on brain heart infusion (BHI) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C. Inoculum of P. lupus ATCC 90112 was prepared by inoculating 0.5 µL of 0.5 mg/mL trypsin/mL of brain heart infusion (BHI) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in 0.


## Results
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a well-characterized antifungal agent that inhibits the first step of fungal growth by binding to the fungal cell membran. Caspofungin (Casp) is a non-vital host-pathogen drug that inhibits the growth of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis, which cause fungal infections [37, 38, 39]. Casp and Casp-AmB have been shown to significantly reduce fungal burden in mice [40, 41]. Casp-AmB is the first antifungal agent that inhibits fungal growth, and Casp-AmB has been shown to reduce fungal burden in a mouse model of cryptococcosis [40, 42]. Our results showed that Casp-AmB treatment significantly reduced the survival of C. neoformans and C. albicans in the CNS during early infection by Amphotericin B. Moreover, Casp treatment significantly reduced the number of neutrophils in the CNS during the early infection by Amphotericin B (Fig 3A). This suggests that the majority of the CNS fungal cells are acting in concert with the innate immune response to Amphotericin B.

Next, we compared the CNS fungal CNS infection with Casp-AmB treatment and the fungicidal effect of Casp-AmB on C. neoformans. Casp-AmB treatment significantly reduced the number of neutrophils in the CNS during the early infection by Amphotericin B (Fig 3B). Our results showed that Casp-AmB treatment significantly reduced the number of neutrophils in the CNS during the early infection by Amphotericin B (Fig 3B). This indicates that the majority of the CNS fungal cells are acting in concert with the innate immune response to Amphotericin B.

Amino acid biosynthesis pathway activates azole resistance in C. neoformans

Azole resistance is a hallmark of fungal infection and is a potential new pathogen for opportunistic infections in patients with fungal infections [43, 44]. To determine the activities of the Amino acid biosynthesis pathway in C.


## Discussion
These cell death mechanisms protect against the oxidative damage caused by antifungal agent. For example, in the case of Candida albicans, endocytosis is impaired in response to cell death [44]. In addition, endocytosis, a stress-response pathway, is activated in response to oxidative stress [45]. Here, we show that the phagocytosis of A. fumigatus by neutrophils in vitro is impaired in response to low osmolarity in the presence of H_2O_2. The results are in accordance with the results in the model yeast S. cerevisiae [31]. Here, we showed that neutrophils and macrophages are able to phagocytose A. fumigatus in vivo and prevent the release of ROS generated in response to phagocytosis. The results suggest that the phagocytic activity of macrophages and neutrophils is diminished in response to A. fumigatus challenge.

We also show that the formation of microconidia by A. fumigatus is impaired in the presence of H_2O_2. This effect is in agreement with results in the model yeast C. neoformans [45]. In contrast, the absence of H_2O_2, results in a rapid formation of microconidia, which produce numerous spores that are then released in response to phagocytosis. The rapid release of spores by phagocytosis of A. fumigatus also results in the formation of microconidia [46]. We have reported that the expression of the mycobacterial H3 adenylate cyclase (ICK) is enhanced in response to A. fumigatus infection in the presence of H_2O_2 [47]. This H3 adenylate cyclase is involved in the production of the cell wall mannoproteins [48]. In response to H_2O_2, A. fumigatus rapidly induces the expression of H3 adenylate cyclase (ICK), a key enzyme for the production of the cell wall mannoproteins [48].
