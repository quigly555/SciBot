## Abstract
Interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) is a key cytokine that plays an important role in the response to several infectious diseases. IL-1ß is the target of the IL-17/23 and T helper (Th) cell inflammatory responses, respectively. The present work aimed to describe the immunomodulatory properties of the soluble and insoluble fraction of the soluble fraction of the soluble subunit of IL-1ß from different clinical isolates of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The cellular and cytokine profiles were compared using live cell imaging, immunoblotting and cytokine microarray analysis. The results showed that IL-1ß was able to inhibit the growth of IL-17/23 and T helper cells but not of IL-1<U+03B3> cells. Also, IL-1ß stimulation led to enhanced expression of IL-17/23 and T helper cell <U+03B3> cells and a decrease in IL-1ß and IL-1<U+03B6> cell-mediated protection against the intracellular growth of the pathogenic microorganism.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. It is currently the most common fungal pathogen of the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV/AIDS (1, 2). Cryptococcal meningitis is a major cause of death in children and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa (3-7). The majority of cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (8, 9).

Cryptococcal meningitis is a major cause of death in HIV/AIDS in the Americas (10, 11). In this study, we present a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a 63-year-old HIV-negative woman.


## Methods
This species is a morphologically different from the others, and the corresponding taxa are presented in the Tabl. Jain is a generous gift from Dr. Mukesh K.K. Sen [2]. Jain is considered a good ally tree because of its deep rooted roots, robust wall, and moderate and continuous growth rate. Jain (JN-1) was isolated from Ajay Bengaluru forest, which was named after it, and was deposited in the Herbarium of the Rishikeshvapala Agricultural University, Chhatrapati, India, and studied by Prof. K.K. Sen [4]. Jain (JN-2) was isolated from Jirang in Southern India, and was deposited in the Herbarium of the Institute of Phytochemistry of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati, India. Jain (JN-2) is considered as a good tree because of its basal root and rootstock. Jain (JN-1) was isolated from the rootstock in the National Herbarium of Jharkhand, and was deposited in the Herbarium of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Kolkata, India. Jain (JN-2) is considered as a good tree because of its natural light [5]. Jain (JN-1) is considered as a good tree because of its growth rate. Jain (JN-2) is considered as a good tree because of its natural light [6]. Jain (JN-1) is considered as a good tree because of its shape [7].

The molecular identification of the morphological characters of Jain (JN-1) was done by comparison of the morphological data of Jain (JN-2) with the morphological data of the other trees. Isolates of Jain (JN-1) were deposited in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC, Pune, India) and the Herbarium of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati, India.

## Results
Antifungal Activity of AMB and PMA against C. albicans
The susceptibility of C. albicans to AMB and PMA was determined against a panel of C. albicans strains, including a panel of clinical isolates from multiple sclerosis and the elderly (Table 1). AMB was more effective against the C. albicans strains than the PMA strain (p<0.0001). PMA was more effective than AMB against the C. albicans strains (p<0.0001), but less effective than AMB against the C. dubliniensis strains (p<0.0001). AMB and PMA were less effective than AMB against C. dubliniensis strains (p<0.0001), but more effective than AMB against C. dubliniensis strains (p<0.0001). AMB and PMA were more effective than AMB against C. albicans strains (p<0.0001) but less effective than AMB against C. dubliniensis strains (p<0.0001).

Allelic Analyses of AMB and PMA Antifungal Activity
We used a disk diffusion assay to investigate whether AMB and PMA can inhibit the growth of C. albicans in vitro and in vivo. AMB and PMA were tested in combination and in vitro for their antifungal activity. AMB and PMA were tested in combination to determine whether AMB and PMA can inhibit C. albicans growth. We first investigated the antifungal activity of AMB and PMA using a disk diffusion assay. AMB and PMA were tested in combination in a disk diffusion assay at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 µg/ml, and 1 µg/ml, and 2 µg/ml, respectively.


## Discussion
Recent studies have shown that the dominant pathogenic fungus in trees has a strong response to infection with a high proportion of immune cells and many micro-organisms (2. The pathogen would then use the pathogen’s inability to colonize the trees as a defence mechanism to counteract infection to outcompete the immune cells for resources. It is therefore very likely that the tree is capable of utilising an immune response to counter against fungal infections. As the tree’s immune response to infection is slow, the immune response could be highly effective.

The second line of defence against fungal infection involves the production of phytochelatins (MCPs) by fungi (3, 4). MCPs have been shown to be involved in several different pathogenic processes (4). MCPs are produced in different biological pathways in plants and fungi, with some species producing MCP-1 and MCP-2, and others producing MCP-3 and MCP-4 (5). The MCP-1 and MCP-2 are the most common genes found in fungi, with the exception of MCP-1 and MCP-2, which have been shown to be absent in other fungi (6). MCP-3 and MCP-4 are also present in the dominant fungus of trees and are involved in a very broad range of cell processes, including growth, differentiation, differentiation, and sporulation (3, 6).

MCP-1 is a well-known MCP and encodes a serine/threonine protein-like protein (7). MCP-3 encodes a serine/threonine protein that contains a serine/threonine cluster, which is found in the C-terminal region of the serine/threonine protein (8). MCP-4 encodes a serine/threonine protein that contains an additional serine/threonine cluster that has been shown to be present in C-terminal regions of the serine/threonine protein (8).

MCP-5 is a serine/threonine protein that has been found in many other fungi (9).
