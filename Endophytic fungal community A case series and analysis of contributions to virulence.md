## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a globally distributed fungus responsible for a growing global threat, and a growing number of human and animal fungal infections have been reported. Fluconazole is the first-line drug available against C. gattii. In this study, we assessed the in vitro activity of the in vitro metabolite deoxycholate (d-Flucon-A) against C. gattii. Our results demonstrated fluconazole to be a viable alternative in the treatment of C. gattii infection. Our results also show that d-Flucon-A can be used as a delivery agent to deliver fluconazole to the cytoplasm of C. gattii yeast cells. In conclusion, our study showed fluconazole can be used as a delivery agent to treat human and animal fungal infections. The findings from this study point to a potential therapeutic strategy for human and animal fungal infections.


## Introduction
The genome of a yeast fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is described as a “disease-prone” habitat (Gow and colleagues 2006; Forche et al. 2007). The fungus is capable of generating various types of oxidative stress, including hyperosmotic and oxidative stress (Wang et al. 2010), which are often lethal to yeast cells. As a result, the yeast genome has served as a major hub for evolutionary adaptation (Wang et al. 2010), providing new drug targets for drug development (Wang et al. 2010; Kunz et al. 2015) and also revealing an increasing number of yeast species with novel drug targets.

Cryptococcosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans.


## Methods
In addition, the following six strains were included: . capsulatum (H. capsulatum), H. pylori (H. pylori), H. verrucosum (H. verrucosum), H. castellii (H. castellii), H. terra delbrueckii (H terra delbrueckii), and H. tetrasperma (H tetrasperma).

Antifungal activity assay
Antifungal activity was measured by the method proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [18]. Briefly, fungal isolates were inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. Afterward, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with sterile saline. Subsequently, the mycelia were ground to a fine powder using a pestle, using liquid nitrogen and the total volume of the liquid was adjusted to 20 g with sterile distilled water. Serial dilutions (5 µL) of each fungal isolate were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were inoculated onto SDA, SDA-ribose, and SDA-silica plates and incubated at 37 °C. Growth was measured on SDA plates for 3 days. The MIC of each tested compound was defined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of fungal growth compared to the control.

Determination of antifungal activity
Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the tested compound (MIC) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines [19]. Briefly, the 96-well microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with 0.25% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.


## Results
flavus and . flavus isolates reveals that the fungus is more resistant to killing by C. neoformans than the other fungi, and more susceptible to killing by C. neoformans. Here, we found that inocula of A. flavus and A. flavus genotypes were more effective against the pathogenic fungi than the non-pathogenic fungi. In this study, we used a qRT-PCR analysis to determine the effect of genotype on pathogenicity. We used a qRT-PCR assay to detect the effects of genotype on pathogenicity. We inoculated wheat cultivar A5, a control strain, with inocula of A5 genotype and genotype V (see Materials and Methods). We compared the killing potential of A5 genotype, V genotype, or genotype E (Fig 1). Our results suggest that genotype E is more potent than genotype A5. We found that inocula of genotype V were more effective than the other genotypes (Fig 1B), and that genotype E is more efficacious than genotype A5 (Fig 1C). Moreover, we found that inocula of genotype V were more efficient than those of genotype E. This suggests that genotype A5 and A5 may be synergistic with genotype V and that genotype E may be more effective than genotype A5.

We observed a reduction in the number of C. neoformans var. grubii isolates in the inoculated host (Fig 2). In the control and genotype V inocula, the number of C. neoformans var. grubii was similar. However, we observed a reduction in the number of C. neoformans var. neoformans isolates in the inoculated host, as we observed that the number of C. neoformans var. grubii was significantly reduced in genotype V inocula (Fig 2). This suggests that genotype E is more potent than genotype V and that genotype E may be more efficacious than genotype V. We also observed a reduction in the number of C. neoformans var. neoformans isolates in the inoculated host. However, we observed that the number of C. neoformans var. neoformans isolates in the inoculated host was not significantly different from that in the non-infected controls (Fig 2).


## Discussion
However, we did not find evidence of differences in soil depth in this case, but only the temporal dynamics of fungal community compositio. We speculate that the environmental heterogeneity that we observed in this study is related to the type of soil type and season. In the case of mangrove scrub soil, we found no significant differences in community composition between the two seasons (see Additional file 1), suggesting that the influence of soil depth is likely independent of season. In the case of the mangrove scrub soil, we found no significant differences in fungal community composition between the seasons (see Additional file 1), suggesting that soil depth and season are independent of soil type and may not be significant for fungal community composition. In contrast, we found that in the case of the SSA soil, soil depth and season strongly affected fungal community composition (Fig 1), supporting our hypothesis that the influence of soil depth and season on fungal community composition is more substantial than soil type.

Despite the limited studies in the NLS, we found that the fungal community composition is influenced by a variety of soil types (e.g., soil pH, C soil, and M soil). We also found that the fungal community composition is influenced by the fungal community structure in a similar manner as it is in other soil types, such as soil pH and C soil (Fig 2). These results suggest that the soil pH and C soil may be important factors in fungal community composition and pathogenesis. In the case of the mangrove scrub soil, the pH and C soil may also be important factors in the pathogenesis of fungi, although the effects of the soil types and seasons were not examined. The influence of soil pH and C soil on fungal community composition is not clear yet, but our results suggest that the influence of soil pH and C soil on fungal community composition is independent of soil type and season.

The contribution of soil properties to fungal community composition
The primary and secondary communities were dominated by Ascomycota (Table 1 and Fig 2).
