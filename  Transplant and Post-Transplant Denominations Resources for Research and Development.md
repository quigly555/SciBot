## Abstract
We report the case of a 57-year-old man with AIDS who presented with an atypical skin lesion and swelling over the right lower quadrant. His parents had both seen similar symptoms, and the diagnosis of a Klebsiella pneumoniae encephalitis was made. The family denied any suspicion of K. pneumoniae encephalitis. The patient's parents also denied any suspicion of Dermatophagia. We report the development of K. pneumoniae encephalitis in a family member who has not met the criteria of this category and in whom the symptoms were not mimicked by the other pathogens. In this case, it is clear that the family denied any suspicion of Dermatophagia.

Case 1: A 57-year-old man with AIDS presented with atypical skin lesions and a swelling over the right quadrant. He denied having any skin lesions and swelling on his right lower quadrant that was mimicked by the Dermatophagia. He initially presented with mild cold-induced sweating, followed by a fever and then headache. He had a good appetite and a good appetite disappeared within 6 months. He did not have a family member with a K. pneumoniae encephalitis who had a similar clinical course.


## Introduction
To the Editor: The finding that Th1-type cytokines play a protective role in protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and encephalitis-like encephalitis (EAE) [1], [2] suggests a potential role of cytokines in mediating protection against EAE and EAE. Th1-type cytokines such as IL-12, IL-6 and IL-9 are key players in the development of EAE and EAE. They play important roles in the induction of host defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens, parasites and viruses. In particular, IL-12 and IL-9 are potent interleukins (IL-12 and IL-9) with IL-12 up to 1-for-3 in Th1- and Th2-type cytokines. IL-12 activates macrophages and leads to the production of IL-12P and IL-23 by Th1-type macrophages. IL-9 up to 1-in the Th1-type cytokines promotes phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DCs) and, on the other hand, promotes eosinophilic granule-bound vacuoles (EDV) that promote Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 promote eosinophilic granule-bound vacuoles (EDV) in DCs.


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/genome/).

We used the E. coli K-selection method in the construction of the bacteria-dense BL21 (DE3) library (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Bacteria-Dense/index.html) and the D1/D2 domain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/DB/DB2008023/index.html) for the mass spectral mapping of the K-selected dendrograms. In the construction of the de novo K-selection procedure, we performed the procedure described above and used the DNA-based approach.

K-selection of the bacterial libraries
A selection of the microbial library was performed by using the DNA-based approach. The library was prepared using the Bio-Rad CFX-connect PCR kit and included 15 µl of 10 mM dNTPs (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 10 µl of each primer, 10 µl of MilliQ water, and 1 µl of 0.1 µM of each probe. The DNA-based selection was performed in the following conditions: 94°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 10 s, 54°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.

To generate a K-selection of the bacterial libraries, the K-selection procedure was performed using the Bio-Rad CFX-connect PCR kit. In the selection, the PCR protocol was as follows: 94°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 10 s, 54°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.

## Results
gi-ps.org/BK95E1-CF0B-5F8E-AAD1-0879D6F9BDE5). We did not find any such reference lists for the gene family or their function in terms of the above-mentioned diseases, and did not find any further links to the gene family or their function in terms of the above-mentioned diseases. We cannot rule out the possibility that the potential use of the gene family is not only due to the lack of genome sequence data but also to the use of the gene family in the construction of genome-scale models to explain the variation of the disease or its severity.

In addition, there are no additional known fungal pathogens and no known pathogen-host interactions in which the expression of fungal genes is altered in the absence of FK506, despite the toxic effects of FK506 [34]. Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that the mechanism by which the FK506 regulates the expression of FKBP12 and FKBP12-related genes might be complex. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of the FKBP12-related genes in the presence and absence of FK506. As shown in Fig 2, FK506 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression of all three genes, especially the FKBP12-related genes, as evidenced by the induction of the expression of these genes in the presence of FK506. Furthermore, the expression of the FKBP12-related genes was higher in the presence of FK506 than in the absence of FK506 (Fig 2). This finding was consistent with the observation that the expression of the FKBP12-related genes was up-regulated after FK506 treatment, and that the expression of these genes was significantly increased after FK506 treatment (Fig 2). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the FK506-induced immune response is associated with the regulation of the expression of the FKBP12-related genes.

FK506 inhibits FKBP12 expression in the host
Fungal pathogens have several mechanisms of pathogenicity against the host, including the antagonistic action of FK506 and the inhibition of FKBP12. For example, FK506 inhibits the fungal cell wall integrity pathway [35-38].


## Discussion
Our results showed that the essential oil from the leaves of Rhizophagus milletii was capable of stimulating the growth of A. fumigatus, A. bisporus and A. uvarum in A. oryzae. In addition, the essential oil from the leaves of R. fabae was capable of stimulating the growth of A. bisporus and A. uvarum in the same assay. The essential oil from the leaves of Rhizophagus milletii was able to stimulate the growth of A. oryzae and A. uvarum in A. oryzae. Our results are in agreement with those of Wang et al.
