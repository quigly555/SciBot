## Abstract
Since the end of the nineteenth century, marine mammals in the Caribbean have been subject to numerous cyclone-like events that have affected their physiology, health and general condition. The effects of cyclone effects on cyclone preparedness are poorly understood. Here we review the current status of cyclone preparedness and recent approaches to modify marine preparedness. We suggest that cyclone effects on marine plants could have beneficial effects on disease risk, health, and development.


## Introduction
The polysaccharide (PS) capsule is a dynamic structure that determines the size, shape, and composition of the exopolysaccharide (exopolysaccharide). The exopolysaccharide is considered a significant fraction of the fungal cell wall and is considered to be more resistant to environmental stress than the surrounding material. This diversity of properties of PS provides the cells with the ability to adapt to environmental changes. Therefore, it plays an important role in the maintenance of cell shape, integrity, and viability. The PS structure has been described in a number of model organisms such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human melanocytes, and some bacteria [1]. In these organisms, the capsule has been well-characterized [2]. The PS structure is highly conserved in yeast and other fungi. It is highly stable at the physiologic pH, which is well below mammalian physiological levels [3], [4]. It also shows little or no changes at serum levels [5], [6], [7]. The PS exopolysaccharide is involved in several physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [8], [9], [10], [11].


## Methods
The corresponding aliquots were analyzed with an XDS-PCR instrument (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) using the capillary voltage of 300 . The chemical shifts are expressed in cm^-1.

Antifungal activity tests
The antifungal activities of the essential oil of toluene, oleane, and vanillin (I2O) were evaluated using the broth microdilution method, as previously described [18]. Briefly, the broth microdilution method was employed with a yeast colony suspension of 10^7 conidia/mL, as the stock solution for each oil, and 0.1% of v/v Tween 20 as a sterol standard. The test was performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as µg/mL. The MIC of the essential oil was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that showed no growth of the mycelial growth.

The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, Germany) in duplicate. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that showed no visible growth after incubation at 35°C for 24 h. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in no growth after incubation at 35°C for 48 h.

The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was evaluated by the broth microdilution method, as previously described [19].

The MIC of the essential oil was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that yielded no visible growth after incubation at 35°C for 24 h.

The antifungal activity of the essential oil was evaluated by the broth microdilution method, as previously described [20].


## Results
The main oils isolated from the toluene, toluene, oleane, and vanillin (I2O) are presented in Table . The predominant oil was toluene, with 25.9% (w/w) and 26.7% (w/w), and the remaining oils were toluene, oleane, and vanillin (Table 2). The relative proportions of oleane and vanillin were 1.0 and 1.6%, respectively. The essential oils of toluene, oleane, and vanillin are shown in Table 2. The crude essential oils of toluene, oleane, and vanillin are shown in Table 2. The oils from toluene, oleane, and vanillin were distributed in 1.5% (w/w) and 0.5% (w/w), respectively.

The petroleum ether extract from toluene (I2O) and toluene (I2O) and toluene (I2O) are presented in Table 2. The major compounds in the essential oils of the two oils are toluene and toluene oxide. The major compounds were toluene, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2). The total oil contents of the essential oils of toluene, toluene, oleane, and vanillin were not higher than those of the essential oils of toluene and toluene oxide. The major oils of toluene and toluene oxide were toluene, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2). The major oils of oleane, toluene, and vanillin were toluene, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2). The major oils of toluene, toluene, and vanillin were toluene, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2). The major oils of vanillin and toluene oxide were toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2). The essential oils of toluene, oleane, and vanillin were toluene oxide, and toluene oxide (Table 2).


## Discussion
The main plant constituents are toluene oxide and toluene oxid. In the leaves of a red fish, the aldehyde tannin is a major constituent of the essential oil [13]. Toluene and toluene oxide are two major constituents of essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide [14]. The essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide showed a significant degree of variability among samples. Some of the samples analyzed showed an average of 9.8-11.6% of the total essential oil of essential oil of Brazilian red fish. This variation might be due to the different requirements of the fish species to be consumed [15].

The major constituents of the essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide showed a significant degree of variability among samples. Some of the samples analyzed showed an average of 10.0-12.0% of the total essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide [16]. The major constituents of the essential oil of toluene oxide showed a significant degree of variability among samples. Some of the samples analyzed showed an average of 10.0-12.0% of the total essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide [16].

The major constituents of the essential oil of toluene oxide showed a significant degree of variability among samples. Some of the samples analyzed showed an average of 8.0-9.0% of the total essential oil of toluene, toluene oxide, toluene oxide, and toluene oxide [16].
