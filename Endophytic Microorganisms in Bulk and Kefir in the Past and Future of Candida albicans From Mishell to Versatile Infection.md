## Abstract
Plant Rhizopus fulva is a highly destructive pathogenic fungus, commonly associated with human disease. It is also a source of major economic losses worldwide. Until now, the impact of the disease has rarely been investigated in the plant-Rhizopus species complex. In this study, we investigated the interaction of Rhizopus elms with Rhizopus fermentans. Our results showed that Rhizopus elms were more resistant to oxidative stress caused by the two Rhizopus strains compared to R. elms. Rhizopus fermentans significantly reduced the number of photosynthesis-competing redox-active proteins (RORPs) in Rhizopus than R. elms. Rhizopus also reduced the capacity of Rhizopus to utilize iron as a sole nitrogen source in Rhizopus. These data suggested that Rhizopus is more metabolically active when Rhizopus is on the host plant than when it is on the rhizopus-yeast cell line. These differences in Rhizopus responses may have important implications for the development of novel plant Rhizopus control strategies.


## Introduction
These include the use of synthetic fungicides such as benzimidazole, propiconazole and carbendazim, which target ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi, and fungicidal synthetic fungicides (egro-fungicides) that target the ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi, which represent the major sources of fungal infections [1,2,3. As a result of the overuse of synthetic fungicides, invasive fungal infections are now increasingly encountered in hospitals, hospitals, agricultural settings and other settings [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Currently, there are five main types of antifungal drugs used for the treatment of fungal infections: azoles, polyenes, echinocandins and flucytosine [11,12,13]. Fungal-specific antifungal drugs are available for the treatment of fungal infections and are primarily used in the clinics. However, there is increasing clinical resistance to and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) fungi in patients with fungal infections [14]. Furthermore, a number of molds are emerging in the clinic, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida krusei-Scedosapii species [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23].

The antifungal agents available in the market are mainly the derivatives of azoles and polyenes, although echinocandins are also available [24,25,26]. Fungi that are resistant to echinocandins are now commonly used in the clinic as antifungal agents [27,28,29]. Azoles are used as first-line drugs in the treatment of fungal infections and as agents for treatment of intracellular Candida albicans infections [30]. Azoles are classically used for the control of the fungal pathogens responsible for both systemic and mucosal infections [31,32]. The azole antifungals such as fluconazole (FLC) and itraconazole (ITC), the most commonly used agents, are fungicidal and fungistatic, respectively.


## Methods
The samples were collected on different days of sampling and stored at -20°C in sterile screw-cap tube. The samples were processed by the microbiology department of the participating hospitals, and the sample was processed by the microbiology laboratory of the participating hospital. The samples were sent to the microbiology laboratory of the participating hospital for confirmation of their identity and for subsequent identification of viable organisms.

Bacterial inoculum was performed by inoculating fresh whole blood from healthy donors with 100 µl of bacterial suspension (1 × 10^8 colony-forming units per ml). The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then used for the bacterial culture and the bacterial concentration was determined by the Limulus amebocyte Lysate (LAL) method (Dharmakrishnan et al., 2015).

Lungs were collected from patients with CM and bronchiectasis (positive control samples were obtained from patients with COPD). The lungs were removed, fixed in 1% formaldehyde and paraffin-embedded (3 µm) sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Giemsa (Gibco-BRL).

The data obtained were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). The results were expressed as the mean ± SEM.

4.5. Bacterial Bacterial Load
To evaluate the bacterial bacterial load in the lung tissues of the patients with COPD, lung alveolar lavage (AL) was performed by using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Hayward, CA, USA). For patients with COPD, the lung alveolar lavage fluid (ALF) was also performed with a Hamilton syringe. The alveolar lavage fluid was used as the positive control. The number of bacterial species present in the alveolar lavage fluid was evaluated by counting the number of colonies of Candida species on the alveolar lavage fluid (ALF) as the average of the number of Candida species per mL.

## Results
The most common fungal infection in the most recent bulk hospitalization was candidiasis (599 patients, 3.3%) followed by pneumonia (1,714 patients, 7.6%), urinary tract infection (1,412 patients, 7.8%), and dermatitis (1,051 patients, 4.3%). The most common fungal pathogens identified in the past 3 years in the bulk hospital were dermatitis (2,779 patients, 4.5%), disseminated candidiasis (1,086 patients, 3.3%), and mucormycosis (1,023 patients, 3.3%). The most common fungal pathogens identified in the past 3 years in the bulk hospital were dermatitis (2,779 patients, 4.5%), disseminated candidiasis (1,086 patients, 3.3%), and mucormycosis (1,023 patients, 3.3%).

## Discussion
dermatidis populations in Kefir are predominantly uniparental and thus are less prone to infection with other microorganisms, which may be due to their less genetic diversity and therefore more survival advantage. Such characteristics could be a potential advantage of B. dermatidis as well as the ability of B. dermatidis to colonize a variety of environments and therefore is a potential alternative to non-native species of B. dermatidis in the current environment of Kefir. These characteristics would have a dramatic effect on the B. dermatidis population. For instance, the B. dermatidis populations in the present study are significantly less pathogenic than the B. dermatidis populations in the previous study (24). In contrast, B. dermatidis populations in the present study are significantly more pathogenic than B. dermatidis populations in the previous study (24). In addition, the previous study found that the B. dermatidis populations in the present study were geographically more geographically restricted and were dispersed throughout the world (23). In our study, the B. dermatidis populations in Kefir are geographically more geographically restricted than the B. dermatidis populations in the present study. In contrast, the B. dermatidis populations in the present study were geographically more dispersed than the B. dermatidis populations in the previous study (24). In addition, the present study found that the B. dermatidis populations in Kefir were highly susceptible to infection with B. dermatidis isolates in Kefir.

The present study showed that the B. dermatidis population in Kefir is significantly less pathogenic than the B. dermatidis populations in the present study. In addition, the B. dermatidis populations in the present study were significantly less pathogenic than the B. dermatidis populations in the previous study (24). In addition, the B. dermatidis populations in the present study were significantly less susceptible to infection with B. dermatidis isolates in Kefir. These findings imply that the B. dermatidis populations in the Kefir are more susceptible to infection with B. dermatidis isolates than the B. dermatidis populations in the Kefir.

The present study found that the B. dermatidis populations in Kefir are significantly less pathogenic than the B. dermatidis populations in the present study. In addition, the B. dermatidis populations in the present study were significantly less pathogenic than the B. dermatidis populations in the previous study (24).
