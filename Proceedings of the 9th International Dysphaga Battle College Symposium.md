## Abstract
Bark beetles play a crucial role in the biology of their hosts, especially in the transition from the female to the male form of insect infection. In this study, the conidial bark beetle Phytophthora ramorum was detected in hibernation sites of three host species in the Dicamba genus, namely Phytophthora ramorum, Phytophthora erectus, and P. ramorum. These three species were isolated on the basis of isolation from three samples of living beetles collected in hibernation and two adults from dead beetles in the same sites. The morphological characters of the beetles were characterized by various microscopic characters, including size, shape, hemiparesis, and hemiparesis. For Phytophthora ramorum, the closest approach to the type species of the three species was revealed by employing the use of a two-hybrid library constructed with the mutant allele of SAGA1 gene. The fungus was also detected in two different samples of wood-boring beetles collected in different areas of the Brazilian Cerrado and found to be more aggressive toward wood ants than the type species of P. ramorum. These results demonstrate that P. ramorum is an interesting and important fungal species for the study of wood-boring beetles.


## Introduction
The most common forms of progressive leukoencephalitis are diffusely infectious, which include diffuse polypleural effusions and pleural effusions [1-3]. Polypleural effusion may be a manifestation of a myriad of infectious causes. It is characterized by a histologically characterized edema, which may be small (<4 µm) or large (>70 µm) in diameter, and may be present in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV/AIDS patients, solid organ transplant recipients, patients with haematological malignancies, and patients with HIV/AIDS with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or for whom polychondroplasty is often the only available therapy [4,5]. Pleural effusions are rare in HIV/AIDS patients. Instead, they are seen in the general population in the setting of high HIV load and organ transplantation.

Although HIV/AIDS patients have more frequent contact with the public, there are still many cases of pleural pleural effusion in which there is no identifiable donor. Polypleural effusions are most common in patients receiving chemotherapy and are typically associated with solid organ transplant recipients. They are seen in the context of chronic hepatitis C infection in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or for whom polychondroplasty is the only available therapy for HIV/AIDS patients. Polypleural effusion may be a manifestation of HIV/AIDS disease or a specific opportunistic infection [6].

In this study, we present a case of pleural effusion in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection in which there was no known donor.


## Methods
.H.P.I., Seoul, Korea), in May 2017, and the next event is planned for August 2018.

In the present study, two different strategies were employed to assess the safety of this clinical trial. First, we assessed the safety of the ‘reinject’ drug treatment. The ‘reinject’ drug was distributed on the basis of the sample obtained. Second, we assessed the safety of the ‘reinject’ drug treatment. For the ‘reinject’ drug, a 50 µL aliquot of the diluted sample was withdrawn from the well, and the half volume of the solution was then placed on a slide. A sterile cotton swab was placed on the slide and a drop of the drug was then placed on the slide. The slide was then placed on a slide and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then for the ‘reinject’ drug, the slide was placed on a slide and examined at the end of the incubation.

## Discussion
Roles of the TCR in controlling bacterial pathogenicity has been well established. In the present study, we evaluated the TCR in controlling bacterial pathogens and the effects of TCR on their ability to colonize and cause disease in a murine model. In addition, we also demonstrated that the TCR plays a critical role in the control of bacterial pathogenicity. The results demonstrated that the TCR was highly expressed in the lungs of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis infected mice. Although the effect of the TCR on the growth of C. albicans was not obvious, our data showed that the TCR had an important role in the control of C. dubliniensis infection. The results also showed that the TCR had an important role in the control of C. dubliniensis infection in mice.

TCR is a potent agent that stimulates the expression of genes that are involved in the activation of the TCR and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The role of the TCR in the control of bacterial pathogens is well established. For example, the TCR of E. coli causes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglial cells. Moreover, the TCR of S. aureus inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages [10]. In addition, the TCR of C. albicans induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglial cells [14]. These results indicated that the TCR plays an important role in the control of C. dubliniensis infection in mice. Our results showed that the TCR was highly expressed in the lungs of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis infected mice.

We found that the TCR was involved in controlling bacterial infection. The TCR of C. dubliniensis was also involved in the control of bacterial infection in mice. Our results showed that the TCR was highly expressed in the lungs of C. albicans infected mice.
