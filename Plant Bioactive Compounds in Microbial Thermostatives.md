## Abstract
In the present study, we identified a gene expression profile and its effect on genes involved in the virulence of a broad spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi. We used RNA-Seq-Seq data from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans to perform natural selection experiments in a laboratory setting. A targeted gene deletion strain (<U+0394>orfB) was constructed to remove one of the drawbacks of using conventional gene models, namely the low expression level of individual genes. This deletion strain produced a low-molecular weight genome. Gene ontology modeling (GOX) revealed that <U+0394>orfB had a larger impact on the virulence of A. nidulans, compared to A. flavus. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed that the <U+0394>orfB genome is likely to have been over-expressed during the infection process. The <U+0394>orfB genome was highly expressed throughout the infection time, with an average of 1.1 log10 CFU/g cells per infected strain. The overall enrichment analysis revealed that the A. nidulans <U+0394>orfB genome has more pathways involved in the regulation of light response and virulence, and the genome of A.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immunity, especially in bone marrow transplant patients [1]. In this context, the concept of a “sick fungus” is a term which has been used in recent years to describe the large number of fungi associated with ILD and other forms of immune-mediated pathology [2,3]. The main causative agents of IFD are mainly yeasts such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus [3,4,5,6]. The major IFD-causing species in the clinical setting are Aspergillus fumigatus, C. albicans, C. auris and C. glabrata [7]. Yeasts are usually opportunistic pathogens that cause disease in immunocompromised patients, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), such as those with hematologic malignancies and solid organ transplant patients, as well as in patients suffering from AIDS, who have a low CD4 cell count and severe renal toxicity [8]. The use of antifungal agents has become more challenging in the past years due to the increasing incidence of drug resistance, which is harmful in these patients [9].

Antifungal drugs have limited available drugs for the treatment of various conditions, which make them difficult to be administered orally and in high doses. The chemical structures of most antifungal agents are complex, which make them ineffective against yeast strains. Thus, it is necessary to develop safer and more potent antifungals.


## Methods
fumigatus that were reported in the literature as the most promising for the antibacterial activity of the compound (a-c), were purchased from the American Chemical Industry (ACI) (Table 1.

The compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were dissolved in sterile distilled water. DMSO was used as a negative control for the antibacterial activity of the compound. For the other two compounds of A. fumigatus, DMSO was used as a positive control.

The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at concentrations of 1.0 mg mL^-1 and 10 µM for 1, 10, and 20 min, respectively. DMSO was used as a negative control for the antibacterial activity of the compound.

2.2. Synthesis of the Compound
To obtain a stock solution of the compound, the stock solution (1.0 mg mL^-1) was dissolved in sterile distilled water and used for the tests. The stock solution (10 mg mL^-1) was then diluted 1:10 with sterile water. The concentration of DMSO in the stock solution (10 mg mL^-1) was determined by measuring the OD_405 of the solution in a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).

2.3. Antimicrobial Activity of the Compound
The antimicrobial activity of the compound (1, 10, and 20 mg mL^-1) was determined by measuring the OD_405 of the stock solution of the compound (10 mg mL^-1). The stock solution (10 mg mL^-1) was dissolved in sterile distilled water and used for the tests. The concentration of DMSO in the stock solution (10 mg mL^-1) was determined by measuring the OD_405 of the stock solution in a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).

2.4. In Vitro Antifungal Activity
The in vitro antifungal activity of the compound (1 mg mL^-1) was determined using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method with the following modifications.


## Results
blackei, . brasiliensis, and P. trichocarpa were isolated from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and B. subtilis, and were not detected in other genera, they were found in the P. blackei and P. trichocarpa samples, in the P. brasiliensis samples, and in P. trichocarpa samples. These compounds were also found in the B. subtilis samples, which were also detected in the P. brasiliensis samples.

A similar number of compounds were isolated from the B. subtilis samples, in which the isolates were identified as P. berghei, P. placenta, and P. trichocarpa (Table 2). All isolates were detected in the B. subtilis samples, and the isolates were also found in the P. placenta samples (Table 2).

## Discussion
A large number of bioactive compounds were detected by column chromatograph. A total of 4,085 compounds were detected by chromatography, and 1,397 compounds were identified by GC-MS. The results indicated that the amount of compounds in the plant biomass was significantly higher than that in the soybean plants (Figure 1).

Cell viability was monitored using the method described in Materials and Methods, and the results indicated that the difference in cell viability between the two types of plants was significant (P = 0.05). In general, the yeast cells in plant biomass exhibited the greatest amount of compounds (20 compounds) as compared to those in the soybean biomass. The highest amount of compounds was found in the yeast cell, as compared to the other three types of plants (Figure 2). The yeast cell contained the highest number of compounds (2,386 compounds) as compared to the other three types of plants, and the maximum amount of compounds was found in the soybean biomass (Figure 3). The result indicated that the yeast cells contained a higher amount of compounds than the other three types of plants.

The results indicated that the yeast cell was the main type of biomass used in this study. The highest biomass was found in the yeasts. This was also observed in the rice plants (Figure 4). The yeast cells of both plants were found in the middle of the plants, and the yeast cells were found at the end of the plants.
