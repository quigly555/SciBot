## Abstract
Lipoargin Monoclonal antibodies (L-Cell Fc) are considered as the most promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of invasive fungal infections.

Three L-Cell Fc (L-Fc), IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b, were evaluated for their potential anti-fungal activity on the clinically important fungal pathogen Candida albicans. In vitro anti-fungal activity was evaluated by the evaluation of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using the broth microdilution method.

The three L-Cell Fc were stable in the presence of different concentrations of Fluconazole (1 µg/mL for L-Cell Fc), itraconazole (10 µg/mL for IgG1, 20 µg/mL for IgG2b), and nystatin (1 µg/mL for L-Cell Fc). These anti-fungal activity could be dose-dependent and could not be affected by the presence of a drug reaction. Furthermore, the anti-fungal activity of the three L-Cell Fc was not affected by the addition of a caspofungin- or flucytosine-buffered saline solution.

These results indicate that the three anti-fungal IgG1 and IgG2a L-Cell Fc could be considered as a promising candidate to be applied for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, mainly because of their activity against C. albicans.


## Introduction
 1997; Croll, 1998; Baeza et a., 2000; Croll, 2001; Croll et al., 2004; Wijayawardene et al., 2006; Eriksson et al., 2007; Hambleton et al., 2010). A wide variety of species of this group has been described in the World, from the south-eastern Asia, the southern Europe, and south-eastern North America, and most of the species in the African Peninsula are pathogenic to both plants and animals (Baeza et al., 2000; Hambleton et al., 2010). Species in the fusaria (e.g., Nakatoka et al., 2007) can be divided into eight major groups, including (i) single-cell fusaria (Croll and Duncan, 1995; Hambleton et al., 2010), (ii) clonal, or multiple-cell fusaria (Croll et al., 2004; Hambleton et al., 2010), (iii) hyperbolaic, or small-cell fusaria (Hambleton et al., 2010), and (iv) the fusaria-like kalaotic and fusarium-like species, respectively (Croll and Duncan, 1995; Hambleton et al., 2010). The two groups, the hyperbolaic and the hyperbolaotic, are related in the sense that the fusaria are the only groups that can infect both plants and animals, and some species are capable of causing disease in both. The two groups, the hyperbolaotic and the hyperbolaotic, are related in the sense that the fusaria are the only groups that can infect both plants and animals, and some species are capable of causing disease in both. Although the infection process can be divided into two major stages, i.e., the early stages (e.g., the infection starts when fungal propagules are inhaled by the host plant), and (ii) the infection process can be divided into three stages, i.e., latent infection, when the pathogen is completely avirulent, followed by (iii) latent infection when the pathogen becomes virulent and becomes pathogenic (Croll and Duncan, 1995; Hambleton et al.


## Methods
The mycelial mat from the slants was transferred to a fresh slant and cultured at 25°C for 48 . The mycelial mat from the slants was dried at 45°C and then stored at -20°C.

Strains were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) (Difco, Detroit, USA) for 12-14 days. The mycelial mat from the slants was transferred to fresh slants and cultivated at 25°C for 48 h. The mycelial mat from the slants was transferred to fresh slants and cultivated at 25°C for 48 h.

The mycelia from the slants were harvested from the slants by centrifugation (16,000 g for 10 min) and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The mycelia were then re-suspended in 1 mL of distilled water and mixed with 1 mL of sterile distilled water. The mixture was poured on a rotary shaker (Savant Technology, India) at 100 rpm for 24 h. The mycelia were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min to obtain the mycelia pellet. The mycelia pellets were washed three times with 1 mL of 1% (w/v) ethanol and then re-suspended in 1 mL of distilled water. The mycelia pellets were then used for the identification of the mutants by colony morphology on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) for 48 h at 25°C.

Genetic analysis
The sequences of the selected strains of F. graminearum were obtained using the DNA sequence analysis tool at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). Alignment of the sequences was performed using the software program BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast).

Morphology
The fungus was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Difco, Detroit, USA) at 25°C. The mycelium of the isolate was collected by vacuum filtration and stored at 4°C.


## Results
For this, we calculated the relative abundance of the fungal taxa that were most abundant in the habitat of the plant in the Attine Ant Garden and the surrounding area. The relative abundance of the fungal taxa in the habitat of the plant in the Attine Ant Garden is shown in Table 1. In comparison with the total fungal diversity, the relative abundance of the taxa in the habitats of the plant in the Attine Ant Garden is shown in Table 1.

## Discussion
Most of these fungi were identified as . clavata (13 species), A. heveanensis (13 species), A. clavata (5 species), A. clavata (4 species), and A. nakashii (2 species). The distribution of these species was further confirmed by their phylogenetic relationship to the Auricallefs. These five species were included in a large group of fungi associated with the Auricallefs (including two species, D. clavatus and M. recurvatum) in the phylogenetic analysis. These fungi are also related to the distribution of the Fungi on the Auricallefs in the Auricallefs: M. recurvatum was isolated from a wood-decaying beetle, and D. clavatus and M. recurvatum were isolated from a tree of Quercus spp. (Bennett et al. 2008). The distribution of these fungi in the Auricallefs was further confirmed by their phylogenetic relationships to the Auricallefs (Table 2).

The results of the morphological and biochemical analyses of the fungal taxa identified in this study were in accordance with those previously reported for fungi associated with the Auricallefs of the Auricallefs in Japan (Bennett et al. 2008). These results are consistent with the previous results of previous studies of fungi associated with the Auricallefs of the Auricallefs of the Japanese-Japanese Natural Ancestor Plants in China (Bennett et al. 2008). Although the fungi associated with the Auricallefs of the Auricallefs of the Japanese Natural Ancestor Plants in Japan were not the same as those associated with the Auricallefs of the Auricallefs of the North American and Chinese natural populations, their morphological and molecular phylogenetic relationship was strongly supported in the morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Fungi associated with the Auricallefs of the Auricallefs of the Japanese Natural Ancestor Plants in Japan (Bennett et al. 2008).
