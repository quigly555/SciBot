## Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been considered as the sole etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in severely immunocompromised individuals, but the literature on this topic has few references.

We performed a retrospective review of the literature until September 2016, to identify any patients who presented with an April 2016, international consensus conference manuscript that was either unavailable, did not include a reference, was performed on a case-by-case basis, or was performed on a case-by-case basis only, to identify relevant studies. We searched for relevant studies and included in the search results studies published since the manuscript publication time line, whichever occurred first. We searched for articles that reported HIV/AIDS as the etiological agent of the illness, either in a published article, a teaching medical journal, a teaching hospital manuscript, a non- teaching article, a non- teaching manuscript, or an article published in the San Francis deukos Review Group, a non-profit journal that provides information for others on acquired immunodeficiency virus. We included studies that reported on the occurrence of hemorrhagic leishmaniasis, either as in-patient or outpatient, and the occurrence of cytomegalovirus infection as the etiological agent of the illness, whichever occurred first.

Selection of relevant articles retrieved from relevant articles published since the manuscript publication time line was continued, with the purpose of identifying relevant studies on this subject. From 36 studies retrieved from the literature, we identified 11 that reported on HIV/AIDS as the etiological agent; in nine studies retrieved from literature only, we found studies on tuberculosis as the etiological agent. The occurrence of cytomegalovirus infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of HIV/AIDS.

In conclusion, we identified several studies that reported on the occurrence of HIV/AIDS as the etiological agent of AIDS, but the studies retrieved from the literature are not enough to make a valid recommendation.


## Introduction
Fungi are among the most important pathogens of humans, with more than 1.5 million species and more than 100 million estimated species of which only a few are human pathogens (Kaur and Aggel, 2006). Most of the human pathogenic fungi are opportunistic and facultative intracellular pathogens that live inside host tissues or on the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Hoch et al., 2009). However, some opportunistic fungi, such as the dimorphic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, have also been reported as opportunistic intracellular pathogens (Joffe et al., 2008; Joffe et al., 2009), which could be important factors in infections of the respiratory tract (Joffe et al., 2009), the gastrointestinal tract (Joffe et al., 2009), skin (Fisher et al., 2009), or skin (Dujam et al., 2009).

The ability of Candida albicans to grow in the skin has been attributed to the secretion of various lipases (a- and ß-glucans) that degrade host tissue (Kock et al., 2010). In addition to the production of lipases, other secreted enzymes could also be involved in fungal growth, such as extracellular chitinases (Eisendle et al., 2004), proteases (Eisendle et al., 2004), and degradases (Wang et al., 2005). Chitinases are part of the extracellular matrix protein chitinase-like proteins (Chit1) that are important in extracellular matrix-dependent degradation of polysaccharides, proteins and lipids (Ribeiro and Dos Santos, 2000). For example, chitinase is involved in the extracellular degradation of lipids in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby allowing the fungus to access the extracellular space (Wang et al., 2005). Secreted chitinases are different from those secreted by other fungi and bacteria, and they have been shown to be involved in the extracellular space (Kock et al., 2010).


## Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Kashiwa University (Protocol number 09-01/08). All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample collection
One hundred and sixty-six patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis who were enrolled from the Department of Pathology, Kashiwa University, were randomly selected and were enrolled prospectively for this study. Forty-seven patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis were included in the study. The patients were included in the study if they had a positive CSF and CSF culture, HIV-associated cryptococcal antigen (HIV) culture, or positive India ink stain, or positive Cryptococcal antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patients were identified as HIV-associated if they were HIV-negative or if they were HIV-transmitted.

Radiological analysis
Blood samples were collected from the right jugular vein, and the left jugular vein. We collected blood from the left jugular vein, the right jugular vein, and the right jugular vein. The right jugular vein was placed in the cuvette, and the blood was drawn directly into a sterile tube and stored at -20°C until further use.

Diagnostic methods
The immunological criteria for cryptococcal meningitis were evaluated by a two-dimensional X-ray of the CSF of all patients. CSF X-ray was carried out with a computerized version of the X-ray system to estimate the lesion size and to identify the CSF with visible blood vessel abnormalities.


## Results
The median age of HIV-positive patients was 32 years (range, 15-70 years.

Of the 917 patients who were not receiving ART, 792 had mixed immunodeficiency syndrome (MID) (Table 1). The MID was present in 61% of HIV-negative patients and in 33% of HIV positive patients. The majority of HIV-negative patients were receiving ART in the early stages of HIV infection (early stage 1, 2, and 3), and the median age was 35 years (range, 16-45 years). The median CD4 cell counts were not significantly different between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients (Table 1).

Of the 242 HIV-positive patients who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy, 205 (56%) had solid organ failure. The median CD4 cell counts were 50 cells/mm^3 (range, 25-53 cells/mm^3) in HIV-negative and 74 cells/mm^3 (range, 20-79 cells/mm^3) in HIV positive patients. The median body mass index (BMI) was 37.5 ± 8.9 (range, 18-45) and the median CD4 cell count was 224 cells/mm^3 (range, 25-331 cells/mm^3). The median CD4 cell count was lower in HIV-negative patients than HIV positive patients (median, 50 cells/mm^3, range, 25-331 cells/mm^3; P = .02). The CD4 cell count was higher in HIV-negative patients than HIV positive patients (median, 42 cells/mm^3, range, 25-333 cells/mm^3; P = .02).

Of the 125 HIV-negative patients with IFIs, 155 (75%) were on antiretroviral therapy at a median of 65 days (range, 18-70 days). The median CD4 cell count was 64 cells/mm^3 (range, 15-71 cells/mm^3). The median CD4 cell count was lower in HIV-negative patients than HIV positive patients (median, 28 cells/mm^3, range, 20-81 cells/mm^3; P = .03).


## Discussion
Approximately 80% of patients in this population will die within a year, which is the median time to death in the general populatio. This patient population is likely to be more susceptible to M. pneumonia 
The patients in this cohort were predominantly immunocompromised patients with AIDS, steroid use, and treatment with fluconazole, fluconazole monotherapy, and amphotericin B. HIV-infected patients were included as a significant group, with a similar incidence to the general population. These patients had similar mortality to the general population and showed a similar progression of the disease.

While the mortality of M. pneumonia infection is relatively high, this disease does have some clinical characteristics, such as increased sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, a longer duration of illness, and a poorer prognosis. M. pneumonia infection is a life-threatening disease, with an overall mortality of 90% 

There are several factors that have contributed to the low overall mortality of M. pneumonia infection, including elevated immune function, a higher prevalence of malignant neoplasia, and a higher prevalence of infectious diseases. These factors include an increase in age, an increase in hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of diabetes. M. pneumonia infection is an opportunistic infection, which is mainly associated with opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis carinii, a disseminated mycobacterial infection, and is associated with an increased risk of other diseases, including solid organ transplants, malignancy, and immune disorders. M. pneumonia infection is a life-threatening disease with a mortality of 90%-100%. 

The overall overall mortality of patients with M. pneumonia infection was 87.2%. The overall mortality was low, especially for patients with immunocompromised status, as was also observed for patients with chronic mycobacterial infections.

There are a number of studies that have demonstrated that the incidence of M.
