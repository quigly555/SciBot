## Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is thought to arise by a complex network of factors, including genetic disorders, malignancy, and malignancy, with a high mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to explore the presence of a wide range of risk factors for HIV among patients with severe immune deficiency, such as type 1 diabetes, chronic alcoholism, abuse of steroids, and organ transplant recipients. An HIV sero-negative cohort was analyzed in our series of studies. Logistic regression model was used to identify the risk factors for HIV development in HIV patients with severe immune deficiency, and all patients were included in our case analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk factors.

Almost two-thirds of HIV patients with severe immune deficiency were HIV-related. From 67 cases in the series, 25 cases occurred as compared to 12 controls. Forty-two percent of cases had unknown risk factors, and 31 cases (22%) had opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and cholangitis. From 33 cases in the series, 20 cases (22%) had known risk factors.


## Introduction
The genus Isaura was described by Sigler (1809) with Isaura monogyna (gasteriously smut) as the type species, and later isavuicola was described with isavuicola (involv.


## Methods
The fungal extracts from the algae were obtained from the Mycology Research Center of China (Mycology Research Center, Beijing. The fungal extracts from the crab shell were obtained from the Freshwater Biological Reserve of China (Waterback Biological Reserve, Jinan, China). The fungal extracts were obtained from the Japan Biological Resource Center (Jiangsu, China) and the Herbarium of China (Hainan, China).

The fungal extracts were obtained from the National Herbarium of China (Hainan, China) and the Herbarium of Japan (Jakji, Japan).

The fungal extracts were obtained from the above mentioned organs of insects and other vertebrates. The fungal extracts were obtained from the Herbarium of China (Hainan, China) and the Herbarium of Japan (Jakji, Japan). The fungal extracts were obtained from the sludge sludge of the fish in the fish tank.

The chemical composition of the fungal extracts were determined by the method of Duyang et al. (2011). The organic layer was formed by the drying of the fresh material at room temperature, while the non-organic layer was formed by the drying at room temperature. The following reagent for each sample was used to distinguish the different types of extracts: a-hexane, b-methanol, c-l-arabinose, d-l-hexane, e-l-hexane, g-l-hexane, and H_2O_2. The obtained extracts were used as the standard for the quantification of the antimicrobial activities of each compound. The color of the extracts was also determined with a colorimeter (Pro-Lab, China).

2.5. Antifungal Activity Testing
Antifungal activities of the different fungal extracts were determined according to the method of Yan et al. (2010). The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined in a 96-well microtitre plate. The test organisms were the microsporidia, a-cymbals, yeast, and filamentous fungi.


## Results

.1. Antibacterial Activity of the B. cinerea LAB Extracts
The results of the MICs against the plant isolates (Table 1) are presented in Table 2. B. cinerea LAB was the main component of the microbial community in the extracts of marine plants. In particular, in extracts from sea squirts and seaweeds, a strong antibacterial activity was observed (Table 2). Among the positive control compounds, acetone, chloroform, methyl sulfone, furfural, ethanol, methanol, methanol sulfone, propionate, methyl sulfone, and furfural, were selected for further evaluation.

The MICs of the extracts of B. cinerea LAB against all the isolates were observed to be >100 µg/ml. The MIC values of acetone, chloroform, methyl sulfone, methanol sulfone, methanol sulfone, and furfural against all the isolates were 0.6 to 5 µg/ml, and >100 µg/ml, respectively. These MIC values were also shown in Table 3.

The MIC values of methanol sulfone against all the isolates were >100 µg/ml, and >100 µg/ml for methanol sulfone, methanol sulfone, methyl sulfone, and furfural, respectively. Thus, the methanol sulfone and methyl sulfone compounds were selected for further evaluation.

2.2. Antifungal Activity of B. cinerea LAB Extracts
The antifungal activity of the B. cinerea LAB extracts against B. cinerea isolates were evaluated against several human pathogenic fungi, including C. neoformans and C. albicans. MIC values against B. cinerea isolates were listed in Table 4.

2.2. Antifungal Activity of B. cinerea LAB Extracts
The MIC values of methanol sulfone against B. cinerea isolates were found to be >100 µg/ml for all the isolates, and >100 µg/ml for methanol sulfone, methanol sulfone, methyl sulfone, and furfural. MIC values of methanol sulfone against C. neoformans and C.


## Discussion
The effects of elevated ILC concentration on pathogenic yeasts grown in media rich in ILC were investigated in the present study. As a primary method, we investigated the ability of cultured yeasts to form biofilm and a medium containing ILC. Biofilm formation was observed when cultured in media containing either ILC or DCM, but the authors did not provide information about the effect of ILC concentration on the biofilm formation. Biofilm formation was a novel finding in this study. As expected, we observed a significant reduction in the total cell count, which was statistically significant. Biofilm formation was associated with a reduced and more significant decrease in the overall biomass (including the number of cells/vesicles per mass of the cell). Biofilm formation was also associated with a decreased and increased number of biomass. The results suggest that biofilm formation is negatively correlated to ILC concentration.

Biofilm formation is associated with increased metabolic activity, a significant increase in cell biomass and a decreased and more significant decrease in biomass. This decrease in biomass is a significant indicator for a decrease in pathogenicity in the absence of a suitable carbon source. Previous studies have reported that the degradation of glycerol and fructose and the release of intracellular metabolites can result in a decrease in pathogenic yeasts (7). Although ILC is not known to be the primary carbon source, its main role in biofilm formation has been shown to be in the synthesis of metabolites such as carbon source, biomass, and the production of secondary metabolites such as ITC, flavonoids, and sterols.

The results of this study suggest that biofilm formation is negatively correlated to ILC concentration. However, the exact role of ILC in biofilm formation needs to be further investigated. Our results suggest that the biofilm formation was negatively correlated to ILC concentration. We did not observe a significant difference between the yeasts in terms of their biomass, carbon source, and biomass content, which suggests that the capacity of yeasts to form biofilm and to produce ILC is not dependent on ILC concentration. A possible explanation for this result could be that the biomass content was not sufficient for the formation of the biofilm. For example, in our study, we observed that the ILC content was sufficient for the formation of the biofilm.
