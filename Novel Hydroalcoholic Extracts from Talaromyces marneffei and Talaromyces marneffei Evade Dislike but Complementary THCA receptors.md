## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections, especially those involving the central nervous system, have become an important clinical problem, and the incidence of these infections has risen dramatically in recent years. Among the etiologies described, Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive candidiasis, and it can cause serious and often fatal infections in immunocompromised individuals, especially in the elderly and those with preexisting immunodeficiency. The antifungal potential of natural products with antifungal properties has also been carefully examined. In this review, current knowledge of natural products with antifungal properties is discussed, and the current limitations of the antifungal treatment of invasive candidiasis will be discussed.


## Introduction
We have previously reported the antifungal activity of Trifolium citrinum (TCC), a well-known herb from the Fertile Crescent, in vitro [13. We have also reported the antifungal activity of a natural extract of TCC against a variety of fungi including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans [14].

TCC is a potent and well-tolerated herb with an extensive shelf life and is generally sold in large quantities in the agricultural and medicinal industries. It is often found in large quantities in Mediterranean countries as a source of medicinal plants, such as Aloe vera, which has an estimated annual annual worth of around USD 100 million. According to the annual production of TCC, it has about 300,000 annual cultivations. It is highly valued for its oil-soluble nature, low pH and good bioavailability. The extract of TCC is obtained by steam distillation in a size range of 300-400 g/mL. The crude extract is obtained by heating at 180 °C for 40 to 60 h. The ethanol is then produced by fermentation at 180 °C for 30 to 60 h. The hydrolytic enzymes, such as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, acyl pyrophosphate dehydrogenase, pyrophospholipase and phospholipase, are the main activities. The degradation of the ethanol is carried out by acetic acid acetic substrate proteinase (Ace Proteinase) (Ab-1) and esterase (Ece1) [15]. The enzyme esterase is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme that converts GPI to GPI-anchored esters. The enzyme esterase is involved in the formation of GPI-anchored lipids in fungi and yeasts [16]. It is involved in the formation of the lipid bilayer and in the formation of the cell membrane by binding with the glycosidic linker proteins (Gly1, Gly2, Gly3, Gly4 and Gly5).


## Methods
For this analysis, we used a 3-mm^3-box fluorescent system (Promega) and a 4-mm^3-box fluorescent system (BD) as well as a 5-mm^3-box fluorescent system (BD) for the conventional modelin. All of the models were equipped with a 20 × 20 mm objective (Fluorocytomethr Traps, GE Healthcare). The three models were fitted with the software Bio-ASP 2.5.1 [37] and were compared with the experimental data (CD1^FR/FR^s) obtained for this study.

Microarray data processing and analysis
All of the experiments were carried out using an Agilent Bio-Rad CFX38401 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The real-time PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reaction mixture consisted of 10 µL of the purified PCR products and 1 µL of diluent (1% v/v final concentration of the diluent in 1× SSC). The specificity of the purified PCR products was verified by sequencing. The purified PCR products were then loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and purified with the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified PCR products were then directly injected onto the Agilent Bio-Rad CFX38401 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The bands were visualized and visualized using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The band intensity was quantified using the ImageQuant software version 2.3.0.

The internal control for non-neutrophil quantification of cytosine (CK) was performed by applying an elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA) in a total volume of 10 µL.

## Discussion
. Synthesis and Characterization
The secondary metabolites from C. albicans and S. cerevisiae are synthesized through the esterase enzyme from the sugar-cane phase of the fermentation process. The secondary metabolites from both species are mainly produced by the esterase enzyme from the sugar-cane phase of the fermentation process. The esterase enzyme from the sugar-cane phase of the fermentation process is the most widely used enzyme in the purification of secondary metabolites in this system.

The molecular weight of the secondary metabolites from C. albicans and S. cerevisiae was determined by the classification of the nucleic acid sequence data (NCU) as a mixture of each of the active compounds from these species. The molecular weight of the two compounds was determined as the sum of the molecular weight of the active compounds and the molecular mass of the natural product.

The compound 1 was identified as C_14H_20O_6.
