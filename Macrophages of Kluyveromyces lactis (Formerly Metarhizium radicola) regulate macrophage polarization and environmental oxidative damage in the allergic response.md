## Abstract
A 33-year-old woman with diabetes presented to the dermatology laboratory with a four-week history of progressive dyspnea, cough, intermittent sweating, and gait instability. She had begun using cyclophosphamide (CX) with concern for ocular damage and visual disturbances. She had begun taking glucocorticoids, which had previously been thought to be directed toward the ophthalmic side of things, and she had deteriorated with increasing drowsiness, cough, and photophobia. She had begun to lose weight. A skin lesion was noticed in the right lower lobe of the abdomen that was initially misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. However, cytology was positive for the same lesion in a biopsy sample taken from the abdomen of the patient's right lung four weeks after the dermatology report. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made, and the patient was treated with intravenous fluconazole. The patient's fever and coughing were again under control for a few weeks. A diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans was made, and the patient was started on antifungal therapy. The treatment was well, and she was discharged after 1 month, albeit with mild gait and visual impairment. This case suggests that cryptococcal meningitis should be suspected in immunocompromised patients with severe ocular or skin lesions.


## Introduction
albicans and . glabrata [7]. This observation led to the proposal that fungal cells have a unique ability to respond to oxidative stress by altering their enzymatic machinery in order to survive and proliferate inside the macrophages, which is a well-known mechanism of host-pathogen interactions [8].

Macrophages are the first immune cells to be activated in the central nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for the induction of a diverse array of inflammatory immune responses, including phagocytosis, cell proliferation, tissue destruction, and allergic responses [9,10]. Although this type of activation is believed to be associated with the activation of innate immune cells, it is thought to be a consequence of the immune recognition of a pathogen and the activation of the adaptive immunity, in which macrophages are activated by pathogens and the host immune response [11]. This activation of macrophages is important in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, and asthma [12,13].

The ability of fungi to activate macrophage polarization depends on the nature of the cell. Under this condition, activation of macrophages by multiple signaling pathways leads to the activation of different types of cells, including transcriptional regulatory cells (Treg), cytokines, and chemokines. Tregs are characterized by their high expression and affinity to inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Activation of macrophages by Tregs results in the activation of various cell types, including the cytokines IL-12, IL-13, and TNF-a [14]. The Treg are thought to activate macrophages by IL-12 and TNF-a, which are associated with the production of the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-12), interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) [15].

The role of macrophages in pathogenesis is generally attributed to the activation of their transcriptional co-activators. This activation is believed to be mediated by the expression of the IL-12 and TNF-a genes, which are expressed during MHC class I IFN expression and are activated by the IL-12 and TNF-a pathways [16].


## Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. The study was approved by the University of Texas at San Antonio Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

C. albicans strains and growth media
C. albicans strain H99 (ATCC 32089) was used to generate the mutant strains. C. albicans strain YEP was used to generate the transformants. C. albicans strain ATCC 10231 was used to generate the wild type strain. All C.


## Results
We used flow cytometry to assess phagocytosis of RAW macrophages by flow cytometr. Dendritic cells (CD11b^+ cells) and CD11b^-CD11b^- macrophages were stained with a antibody to the phagosomal marker pho89 (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, cells from the phagocytosis assays were stained with the anti-CD11b antibody. The CD11b^-CD11b^+ cells, which have similar morphology and function to RAW macrophages (8), were more readily phagocytosed than the RAW macrophages by both Dendritic cells and RAW macrophages (Figure 2C). These results suggest that DCs may play a role in phagocytosis and immune activation of DCs by macrophages.

DCs regulate the immune response in vivo
We next investigated the role of DCs in host cell polarization. We used flow cytometry to assess the phagocytic index of RAW macrophages. The percentage of macrophages expressing the phagocytic index (PI) was higher in the presence of DCs (100%), whereas the percentage of DCs expressing the macrophage marker (MB) was higher in the absence of DCs (Figure 2D). We then infected mouse monocyte-DC fusion cells with CD4^+ DCs and assessed the phagocytosis of DCs. As shown in Figure 2E, the percentage of macrophages expressing PI was significantly higher in the absence of DCs, and the percentage of cells expressing MB was significantly higher in the absence of DCs. In the absence of DCs, the percentage of cells expressing PI was lower than the percentage of cells expressing MB, which is consistent with the conclusion that DCs play a role in the host immune response.

DCs are required for fungal virulence in mice
As DCs play a role in the host immune response, we next investigated the role of DCs in fungal virulence in mice. To study the role of DCs in fungal virulence, we first infected mice with fungal-infected or wild-type yeast cells, which are known to be associated with the lung (9, 10).


## Discussion
fumigatus [44. Moreover, the localized inflammatory response to A. fumigatus is highly dependent on macrophages and macrophages are known to be highly sensitive to A. fumigatus [45]. This strain of A. fumigatus is a more virulent strain with higher survival rates than is observed in mice infected with C. neoformans, which is resistant to infection with this species [46].

The anti-inflammatory properties of the human neutrophils were tested by measuring the concentration of IL-6, which is the major chemoattractant for macrophages. IL-6 is a chemoattractant for macrophages and macrophages are a major cell population in the human body. These cells are important in the resolution of inflammation, and this study is the first to examine the effects of IL-6 on the antimicrobial activity of human neutrophils. A total of 35 neutrophils were cultured in minimal medium (M2) at 4 × 2 × 8 days. The cells were harvested at 4 × 2 × 8 days and the results were visualized in Figure 1. The cells showed activity for IL-6, but no IL-6 was detected in the cell cultures. The cells were then cultured for another 8 days in minimal medium. IL-6 was detected in the culture medium and it was not detected in the culture supernatants. The results revealed that IL-6 was present in the cells. The concentration of IL-6 was the same as the concentration of IL-1ß in the culture supernatants. The results revealed that IL-6 was present in the cells and the concentration of IL-1ß was about 0.8 µg/ml. The results also showed that the concentration of IL-6 was 0.2 µg/ml. These results indicated that the IL-6 is very potent in the control of A. fumigatus infections.

The results showed that the concentration of IL-6 in the cultures of IL-6^-/- mice was 3.3 µg/ml. It was a very potent IL-6, with an IC_50 of 15.4 µg/ml, which is higher than that of TNF-a. IL-6 is a chemoattractant for macrophages, and this study is the first to investigate the effects of IL-6 on the antimicrobial activity of human neutrophils.
