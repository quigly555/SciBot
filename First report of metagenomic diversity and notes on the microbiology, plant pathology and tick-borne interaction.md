## Abstract
The number of hereditarily important and novel pathogens causing infection in humans are increasing at an alarming rate. Cryptococcus laurentii is the main etiological agent of fungal infection in fruits and vegetables. Fungi have been reported to cause mild symptoms in humans, in animals and insects. We used in situ analysis of a natural herbal plant from the coast of Madagascar to analyze and distinguish different pathogenic fungal isolates and to show that they are responsible for the symptoms of patients with invasive fungal infections.

The plant was cultivated and loaded into artificially sweetened water and cultured in potato agar plates. The plant was then inoculated onto skin of rabbits (G7) and leishman (G7), and fungal isolates were counted. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed and fungal biomass was determined.

Elephant grass (Capnodiales, Caeti Solaniense) showed the most important and common fungal isolates (30.5%). The plant contained essential oils (EOs) belonging to the phytohormones family. The EOs from E. laurentii, E. sinense, E. tritici, E. wytheperus, and E. zosteri were isolated from E. laurentii leaf, bark, stem, leaf, and root. The highest number of isolates was found in the plant, which was grown in artificial soil. E. laurentii was isolated from nine different locations, and the soil from three locations had a total of 38. One locality had a total of 39 isolates. The EOs from E. laurentii were more active on roots than in soil, which indicates the presence of more fungal growth in the soil.

The results of this study suggest that E. laurentii is the main etiological agent of this infection in humans in Madagascar. It is important to develop protective strategies for this fungus, and the use of antibacterial and antifungal agents that protect the plant against this fungus should be considered.


## Introduction
Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live within, on, and live in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of living organisms. They perform various physiological functions such as the production of bioactive compounds, cell signaling molecules, and immune/inflammatory responses (1-3). The ECM has a complex architecture consisting of highly complex interconnected microdomains and porous surfaces. Some of the most important and widely studied ECM components include the cell membrane, lipid rafts, and cytoskeleton (4). The ECM is a dynamic and dynamic environment, which has evolved in response to the external environment and stresses. The ECM plays an important role in health, disease, and life in many different environments (5, 6). The ECM has been recognized as a key component in the health of microorganisms (7). The ECM is a complex network of interconnected interconnected networks, which include a network of membrane and lipid rafts, as well as the network of cell-wall interfaces and membranes (7). The network components and the functions of the ECM are highly interconnected and some of them are related (8). The complexity of the ECM is related to the complex network properties, which are different from those of the host environment, such as the presence of a lot of physical and chemical components and some antimicrobial substances (9, 10).


## Methods
fischeri

. fischeri is considered an essentialist species of E. fischeri [26]. It is not considered a parasitic or prototrophic species.

In order to make Ef. fischeri a bit more diverse, we investigated the bacteria and fungi, which are the most common ones in the animal phyla. We considered the community of Ef. fischeri based on the sequence of conserved domains of the genes.

E. fischeri is considered to be one of the major pathogens of Ef. fischeri in Europe. It is not considered a fungal or plant. It is considered to be a major opportunistic disease that is responsible for more than 50% of the deaths in Europe [27].

In order to avoid the assumptions that Ef. fischeri is a single species, we investigated several other bacteria, which are not included in this study. In order to avoid this assumption, we examined the organism-specific composition of the bacterial and fungal species.

A total of 38 strains of bacteria and fungi were used in this study.

The bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from diseased and diseased cattle, sheep, goats, chickens and pigs, respectively, which are commonly used in meat and dairy-processing.

Among the bacteria and fungi, we included three classes (community members, fungi and metagenomic species). We selected five species for this study because they represent the most common and commonly used bacterial, fungal and metagenomic species in the environment.

In order to eliminate the possibility of genus-specific, we searched the species-specific microbiota from the three genera of E. fischeri [28]. We used the database of the Microbial Community Analysis System (MCEAS) [29] which includes the bacteria, fungi, and metagenomic species.

For each of the classes, we identified the most common bacterial and fungal species, and the most common fungal species in each of the classes.

We also compared the bacterial and fungal community composition of Ef. fischeri, which is considered to be a bit more diverse, with the class-specific microbiota of Ef. fischeri.

In order to identify the microbial community composition of Ef.


## Results

The metagenomic diversity in the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region (MANDOVA) is presented in Table . In total, 98.5% of the metagenomic diversity was shared by the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region (Figure 3). The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was also highest for the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region, which is reflected in the presence of all four species of Cercospora that have been described from Cercospora viridispora [6]. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region.

In order to study the ecological and tick-borne interactions in the metagenomic region, the metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was recorded, which is reflected in the presence of all four species of Cercospora that have been described from Cercospora viridispora [6]. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region. The metagenomic diversity of the metagenomic diversity of the 18S rDNA region was highest for the 18S rDNA region.


## Discussion
However, this study was not able to identify any putative bacteria in the sample, and no apparent differences were identified between the OTU classification. In addition, the levels of the putative bacteria detected in the present study (phylum Proteobacteria, which was found in all samples) are lower than those reported in a previous study by OÖstel et al. (17) and are in line with our findings (Fig 1A). Therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted with caution.

Furthermore, the abundances of putative bacterial OTUs in the samples and their relative abundances in the fungal communities are shown in Fig 1B and C. The abundances of Proteobacteria are generally lower than those reported in the fungal communities (31). The relative abundance of Sphingobacteria is generally lower than that of Proteobacteria (32), but this was not observed in the present study (Fig 1A). The abundance of Gammaproteobacteria is generally lower than that of Gammaproteobacteria (33), and the relative abundance of Firmicutes is generally higher than that of Firmicutes (34).

The relative abundances of two OTUs (phylum Chloroflexi and genus Chloroflexi) were detected in the present study, but they were not found in the fungal communities. The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were generally lower than those of Chloroflexi and Firmicutes (Fig 1B). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were generally higher than that of Chloroflexi and the other OTUs in the present study.

The relative abundances of Clostridium and Pseudomonas were lower than that of Clostridium and Pseudomonas in the present study, and were lower than those of Clostridium and Pseudomonas in the study by OÖstel et al. (17), and were higher than those of Clostridium and Pseudomonas in the study by OÖstel et al. (17) and were higher than those of Clostridium and Pseudomonas in the present study. However, Clostridium and Pseudomonas were not found in the present study (Fig 1B).
