## Abstract
Neuronal resting potential is a well-regulated and dynamic process that is activated by many environmental factors. However, the detailed regulation of resting potential and the dynamics of resting state in various brain regions are still elusive. In this study, we performed dynamic analyses of resting state in healthy young adult subjects over a relatively 6-month period. In addition, we investigated the role played by the diencerosia stage in resting state regulation of resting state in two model insects, the Nilaparvatibha. We found that diencerosia can promote resting state expansion and activation of dendritic cells and modulate resting state activation and migration of experimental flies. Furthermore, we found that diencerosia induced macrophage polarization in a range of disease-causing agents, from benign skin candidiasis to fatal systemic lupus erythematosus.


## Introduction
Echinocandins are a family of antifungal drugs that inhibit the synthesis of ß-d-glucans. The latter molecule is synthesized by the cell wall glucanases and, when bound to ß-d-glucan, confers resistance to phaeohyphomycosis and fungal keratitis. This remarkable drug resistance conferred by ß-d-glucan is considered as a major turning point in the development of the antifungal drug development. ß-d-glucan is utilized as a structural scaffold for the biosynthesis of various biologically active molecules, such as amphiphilic chitosan, ergosterol, sterols, sterols, and various cell wall components. ß-d-glucan is also used for antifungal drug delivery as a surface-bound drug [1] and, in the case of the azole drug fluconazole, as a delivery drug [2,3]. The surface-bound drug is produced by the enzyme glucanase and can be recognized by several enzymes, including the enzyme proteinase 3 (Proteinase 3) and the proteinase inhibitor 1 (Proteinase 1). In mammalian cells, P.


## Methods
dahliae, and the aChBD domain is present in the transcriptome of . dahliae.

Molecular biology
To perform molecular biology studies, P. dahliae genomic DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction (PC-IPA) according to the protocol of Ueda et al. [15]. The genomic DNA was isolated by DNA-free DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the quality was checked by spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 4 °C.

The protein-coding genes in P. dahliae were identified using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). The sequences were aligned using ClustalW algorithm with default parameters, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/clustalw/) with the MEGA 7 software [56].

To evaluate the structural and functional aspects of P. dahliae Pd1, the Pd1 protein sequence was aligned with a sequence of P. dahliae Ustilaginosa (RSU) strain [17], which was obtained from the collection of the Centre for Biotechnology and Cellular Biology, University of São Paulo, and was assigned the accession number of the corresponding protein in P. dahliae.

To analyze the proteome of P. dahliae, the Pd1 protein sequence was aligned with a sequence of P. dahliae ATCC 3745, which was obtained from the collection of the Centre for Biotechnology and Cellular Biology, University of São Paulo. The sequence was classified as Pd1 or Pd2 with a maximum probability of Pd1 = 3×10^-3, and maximum probability of Pd2 = 4×10^-4. The topology of the Pd1 protein was determined using the formula: (p-p)/p<U+2211>(p-p)-p)^2.


## Results
The cpcB-binding region of . neoformans is highly conserved in N. crassa and in other fungi.

Functional analysis of the cpcB-binding region was performed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of protein-protein interactions (pIs) with a specific dye (Figure 3A). PIs were quantified using a time-dependent logistic regression analysis. The pIs were found to be significant for the region of interest in a pI > 0.05 (Table S3).


## Discussion
Besides the RNA-binding domain, the RNA-silencing domain is present in all other annotated yeast specie. Although the kinase-like CNA-like domain is present in the RNA-binding domain of the CNA-like domain, the kinase-like CNA-like domain and the RNA-silencing domain are present in all fungal species.
