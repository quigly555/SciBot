## Abstract
A nine-year prospective study was carried out in the valuable commodities exchange of melamine in central Vietnam. The value of melamine in dried biomass was investigated in grams, liters, liters/day, and volumetric volumetric activities (VVV) were calculated as the geometric mean (GM) values. The chemical components in miljyl-lactamidin-gonol (MMG) and lignocellulolytic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (LLLA) were measured using the standard methods. The use of the LLLA in this study showed a significant improvement of the melamine yield (P < 0.01), average VVV (0.48 to P < 0.01) and VVV+ productivity (P < 0.05) in the dry biomass, but a significant reduction in the volumetric productivity (P < 0.01) and GM values (P < 0.05) in the solid biomass. The use of LLLA in this study showed a better results for the dried biomass, as the GM values in the dry biomass were lower than those for the GMs in the liquid biomass (P < 0.05). In the VV, the difference in GM and VVV yields (P < 0.


## Introduction
In the past decade, the case of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis has been increasing worldwide. It is estimated that approximately one million new cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur annually worldwide, resulting in 181,000 deaths [1]. Although the causative organism is usually Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A), C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D), and C. gattii (serotype B), Cryptococcus gattii is most commonly found in the environment. However, other Cryptococcus species have also been isolated from bird droppings, soil, and decaying wood, wood components of houses and nursery building materials, and even from the air of medical devices and human body surfaces [2].

The most common Cryptococcus species that cause meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients are C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans, with C. gattii being the most common [3,4]. In Brazil, cryptococcal meningitis is still a major cause of death among HIV patients in sub-Saharan Africa [5]. In Brazil, cryptococcal meningitis is considered a neglected disease in public health services, and cryptococcal meningitis is also a leading cause of death in HIV patients in the developing world [6].

Although the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has declined in Brazil due to the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), cryptococcal meningitis still accounts for approximately 10% of all cases, and this proportion has increased in the past 15 years [7].


## Methods
The cut of the colonies of PISTEZA AUG1254 and AUG1255 was subsequently transferred to the culture media of the Eucalyptus Fruit Extract (FGS) and Sabouraud Dextrose (SD) agar plate. The culture media used for this work were RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, without sodium bicarbonate (Gibco) and without sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), and supplemented with appropriate supplements (all without sodium bicarbonate). The isolates were cultured on solid MM media.

Antimicrobial byproducts from the wood extract of marine Ningxia pegasi strains PISTEZA AUG1255 and AUG1256
The crude extracts of the Penicillium spp. from the Peruvian (Oryza) and Chinese (Eucalyptus) marine environments were obtained from the respective trees in Ningxia and the Sichuan province of China. The dried pellets of Penicillium spp. were obtained from the Aucalyptus species in China. The dry pellets of Penicillium spp. were obtained from the Sichuan province of China. The powders of Penicillium spp. were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) market. The extraction methods are listed in Table 1.

The dry pellets of Penicillium spp. were obtained from the Sichuan province of China. The dried pellets of Penicillium spp. were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) market. The powder of Penicillium spp. was obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) market. The extract was dissolved in methanol (5% v/v) to a final concentration of 10 g/L. The extract was dissolved in sterile distilled water (SDW) to a final concentration of 10 g/L. The solvents of the extracts were the same as those used in the analysis of the crude extract.


## Results
albicans ATCC 44345 and . neoformans ATCC 44345 respectively (Table 1).

We further investigated the antimicrobial activity of the aromatic compounds by HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed that the aromatic compounds at the aromatic amines level were active against the C. albicans ATCC 44345 and C. neoformans ATCC 44345. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the aromatic compounds showed that the aromatic amines of the black powder at the aromatic amines level were much stronger than those at the aromatic amines level. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the aromatic amines revealed that the aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level were significantly more active than those aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the aromatic amines revealed that the aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level were much stronger than those aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the aromatic amines revealed that the aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level were much stronger than those aromatic amines at the aromatic amines level.

3.3. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activity of the black powder extracts against the five tested fungal pathogens, including C. albicans ATCC 44345, C. neoformans ATCC 44345, C. neoformans ATCC 44345, C. parapsilosis ATCC 44345, and C. glabrata ATCC 44345, was studied. The antimicrobial activity was determined against five fungal pathogens, including C. albicans ATCC 44345, C. neoformans ATCC 44345, C. parapsilosis ATCC 44345, C. glabrata ATCC 44345, and C. parapsilosis ATCC 44345. The MIC_50 of the black powder extracts against the five tested fungal pathogens, including C. albicans ATCC 44345, C. neoformans ATCC 44345, C. parapsilosis ATCC 44345, and C. glabrata ATCC 44345 was determined as 8.8, 16.5, and 16 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 of the black powder extracts against the five tested fungal pathogens, including C.


## Discussion
The PISTEZA AUG2527 was able to produce a toxic product called propidium ethanolysin (PES) and produce polymeric substances, including terpenes, phenols, and flavones, that can cause infections in humans [28. The PISTEZA AUG2527 showed a good antimicrobial activity against P. expansum and P. vulgaris and the two other marine strains were not able to produce any substance. The two PISTEZA AUG2527 strains were resistant to all the tested drugs. The MIC values of the tested drugs ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 µg/mL, and the MIC_50 of the tested drugs ranged from 0.25 to 2.5 µg/mL.

The results of the screening are shown in Table 2. The results showed that the antifungal activities of PISTEZA AUG2527 were in accordance with those of the marine strains. The antifungal activity of PISTEZA AUG2527 was found to be very potent, at least in vitro. The activity of PISTEZA AUG2527 was in accordance with those of the other marine strains tested. The antifungal activity of the tested drugs was more than the MIC values of the tested drugs. The antifungal activity of PISTEZA AUG2527 was much higher than those of the other marine strains tested, and it was the best obtained result. The antifungal activity of the tested drugs was much higher than the MIC values of the tested drugs, and the antifungal activity of PISTEZA AUG2527 was much higher than those of the other marine strains tested. The MIC values of the tested drugs ranged from 0.25 to 2.5 µg/mL, and the MIC_50 of the tested drugs ranged from 0.25 to 2.5 µg/mL.

The results of the screening are shown in Table 3. The results showed that the antifungal activity of PISTEZA AUG2527 was in accordance with those of the marine strains.
