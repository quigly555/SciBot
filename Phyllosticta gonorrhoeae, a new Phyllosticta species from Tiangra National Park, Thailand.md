## Abstract
Post-neurosurgical radiation (PNE) is one of the most aggressive treatments for invasive aspergillosis (IA) due to its safe and effective treatment. However, post-neuroscopy imaging (PSI) of IA after irradiation is rare. We describe a case of sarcoidosis post-neuroscopy irradiated on post-neuroscopy imaging of IA following the operation of two-year-old goat <U+0394>3D-stimulated cortical blindness.


## Introduction
A majority of the world’s population of approximately 1.5 million species are estimated to occupy approximately 75% of the earth’s dry land. The remaining lands are occupied by a small number of important pests of agricultural crops and livestock (e.g., livestock diseases, diseases caused by insects, mites, and termites). The most frequent pests are insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Metrosphaerella, Formicidae), and termites (e.g., mites and termites) [1-3]. Drosophilopsis, the most widespread species of the Diptera, is one of the most devastating plant pathogens, and is responsible for the vast losses that termites and aphids cause on more than 100 economically important crops worldwide [4,5]. It has been estimated that around 40,000 Drosophila species are killed annually by insects in the United States alone, and it is estimated that there are over 23 million names for the most common and least common name for this group of insects [6]. Although the disease cycle of Drosophila is highly complex, the pathogen is highly specialized, and the insecticide is a key factor in the adaptation of the disease to the host [7].

Aphidiosporium species are known to be soil-borne and can survive in soils for over a century [8-11]. This genus contains several important species that are invasive of plants, sometimes causing diseases in different parts of the world [12,13]. In Thailand, A. solani is one of the most important pathogens of rice (Oryza sativa L.) [14]. Phylogenetically, it is closely related to A. iranianus, A. solani complex and A. hirsutum. Phylogenetically, A. hirsutum is closely related to A. parvula, A. eucalypti, A. eucalyptorum and A. ascarus. Phylogenetically, it is closely related to A. solani, A. iranianus, A. solani complex and A. pachydermatis. Phylogenetically, it is closely related to A. pachydermatis and A. kunzeitensis.


## Methods
Spores were collected from the lichens of the Javan National Nature Reserve, Sri Lanka, and the samples were kept at 4 °. Morphological characters were determined according to the colour photographs of these specimens, which were taken using a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting microscope and a Nikon DS-Qi1 light microscope equipped with a digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

DNA extraction and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 7-day-old liquid cultures on V8 juice agar (2% v v v v v) using the method described by Al-Mugey et al. [11]. The extraction protocol was modified to be as follows: the mycelium was transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and heated at 70 °C for 10 min, the mycelium was rinsed with sterile PBS and homogenised by hand using a spatula with the help of a TissueTiter^® Optima^® (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). DNA concentration was measured using the NanoDrop^® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Sequence processing
ITS region was amplified with the universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990) using a PCR reaction mixture of 5 µL of each primer, 10 µM dNTPs, 1.5 µL of each dNTP and 1.25 µL of 10× reaction buffer (Fermentas, Belvieu, France). The PCR programme was as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 45 s and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. Amplicons were purified using a QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the BigDye^® Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Molecular identification of the ITS sequences
The sequences of the ITS region of the Rhizaria spp. were obtained from the ITS database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The sequences were aligned using the online software (http://www.ncbi.


## Results
. Wen & Q. Yang, 2016). This taxon was described as a new species of Phyllosticta in 2012, and is currently considered as a synonym of Phyllosticta laricinae (Schubert et al. 2009).

Phyllosticta laricinae (Schubert et al. 2009) was described as a new species from Tiangra National Park in Thailand (A.Z. Wen & Q. Yang, 2016). Phyllosticta laricinae is a new species from Tiangra National Park in Thailand (A.Z. Wen & Q. Yang, 2016). Phyllosticta laricinae was described as a new species in 2010 from Tiangra National Park in Thailand (A.Z. Wen & Q. Yang, 2018). Phyllosticta laricinae was originally described as an asexual morph of Phyllosticta perfoliati from the leaf of Perfolia species (A.Z. Wen & Q. Yang, 2010). Phyllosticta perfoliati was reported from Central Asia and the Caucasus in the 1970s and 1990s (Zeng et al. 2012). Phyllosticta perfoliati is currently considered as a synonym of Phyllosticta laricinae.

## Discussion
2015. We believe that this new species represents a new species in the genus Phyllosticta.

Phyllosticta spp. are common on plants in many parts of the world, such as Thailand (Murdoch and Risso 2013, Wurzbacher et al. 2013, Fang et al. 2014, Sun et al. 2015, Gao et al. 2016), China (Arya et al. 2016), and Japan (Jankun et al. 2017). However, this species is not present in any other countries. Phyllosticta spp. have been found in China and Japan (Jankun et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017), and they are not the only plant pathogens causing diseases in plants. We believe that this new species represents a new species in Phyllosticta spp.

Phyllosticta japonica is a species of the genus Phyllosticta. The genus name Phyllosticta is based on the water-sparing and biotrophy-inducing habit of this genus. Phyllosticta japonica is known to produce pigmented algae in the rice field (Liu and Gao 2017). This species is also considered a good substrate for red algae (Arya et al. 2012). Phyllosticta japonica was reported to be the most abundant species of the genus in China, but this species is rarely seen in the wild. Phyllosticta spp. are often found in cold environments, such as forest soils and plant debris (Arya et al. 2012). These aquatic, terrestrial, and marine organisms are frequently observed in nature, and they are able to grow up to 10 km away from each other (Luo and Gao 2018). The slow growth rate of Phyllosticta spp. is also observed in plants (Mulloch and Nirenberg 2018), and they are also found in plants infected by phyllosticta spp. (Arya et al. 2012).

Phyllosticta tarda is a freshwater pathogen that causes the disease in freshwater, and it is a common aquatic pathogen causing diseases in freshwater (Hecapuzzo et al. 2012). The disease symptoms of Phyllosticta tarda are severe, and the symptoms are similar to those of Phyllosticta fennae.
