## Abstract
Infection with the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii is one of the leading causes of fungal infection in immunocompromised individuals. This fungus is found primarily in the environment and human infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we investigated the frequency of C. gattii mycobiome isolation in Kuwait, a country with comparatively low burden of the disease.

Two hundred and sixty four C. gattii isolates were investigated and isolated from a total of 5.7% human infections, from 7.3% invasive infections and from 17.1% non-infectious bacterial infections. Their phenotypic and molecular characteristics were compared using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as well as presence of nucleic acid sequences (NCS) from barcoded restriction fragment length polymorphism (bLSU) and peptide-polyclonal hair adhesion protein (pAPES) as controls.

Out of 537/437 (92.5%) mycobiome was isolated from invasive infections, Cryptococcus (94%) was the most common one. Cryptococcus (n = 9, 76.5%) was the predominant species (n = 25), followed by Rhizopus (9.


## Introduction

On June 30, 2017, a large crowd gathered in front of the Michigan Statehouse for the annual Michigan Industrial Agrarian Meetin. The meeting was attended by a diverse and thoughtful group of speakers. One of the speakers, Dr. Alastruez Balci, was one of the speakers from the Michigan Agrarian and Beyond Education Network. Dr. Balci is the Director of the Michigan Agrarian and Beyond Education Network. She was introduced for her work with the yeast Pseudozyma pallida, which has been used for the treatment of respiratory infections, respiratory syncytial hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and fungal infections. She was joined by speakers interested in the impact of P. pallida on the human microbiome, including those from the microbiome of the respiratory tract, such as the antibiotic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She demonstrated that P. pallida is a potent virulence factor and that it can cross the blood-brain barrier and cross the intestinal mucosa. She demonstrated that the human gut microbiome is composed of microbes that are differentially expressed on the intestinal epithelium, and that differences in the fungal microbiome are associated with changes in health, disease, and death.

The speakers at the Michigan Agrarian and Beyond Education Network's 25th Annual Meeting included David Oliveira, a professor of biomedical engineering and the president of the Michigan Agrarian and Beyond Education Network; Marianna van der Werf, president of the Michigan Agrarian and Beyond Education Network; and Pramila Banerjee, a postdoctoral researcher from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Bangalore. Banerjee presented her work on the functional lipoprotein profiling of the bacterial cytochrome oxidase system and demonstrated that the cytochrome oxidase system is a powerful tool for the study of the roles of the two major components of the cytochrome oxidase system, the triacylglycerol (TA) receptor and the PI3K-Akt/PKB and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, in human macrophage functions.

After the meeting, the meeting was closed. The speaker invited was Dr. W. T. Thich, a professor of mechanical and biomedical engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru University ( Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bronx, New York, USA). Dr.

Antifungal Therapy Induced by Pemphigus Leaf Extract: From Farm to Medical Center of Texas Medical University. Exact date of initial use is not yet known.

Antifungal Treatment of C. glabrata

A standard antifungal therapy strategy was employed by the Institute of Clinical Chemistry of Baylor College of Medicine [20]. This strategy was based on the use of L-carnitine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and it has been proven to be superior to other drugs in the treatment of C. glabrata infection [23]. The antifungal agent used was L-carnitine.

Antifungal Treatment of C. glabrata

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [24] revised a protocol for the antifungal agent used in this study. This protocol was adapted from the CLSI document M27-A3 [25] and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine at Texas Medical University.

Antifungal Treatment of C. glabrata

The manufacturer’s protocol was followed to identify and remove known contaminants. All of the tests were performed on fresh BAL fluid obtained from C. glabrata swabs. BAL fluid was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed and the supernatants were mixed with the antifungal drugs and adjusted to the desired final concentration. The antifungal drugs were diluted in RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The drug stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for further determination.

Antifungal Treatment of C. glabrata

To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the drug was diluted in RPMI-1640 buffered with MOPS, pH 7.0, and adjusted to the desired final concentration.

Antifungal Treatment of C. glabrata

The MICs of L-carnitine and L-carnitine were determined from a single isolate of C. glabrata.


## Results
The symptoms on the leaves were variable in the form of leaf spot. The lesions were more intense and more uniform in shape than those on the leaves (Fig 4A).

The lesions were considered as large, irregular, and long-lasting. The diameter of the lesions varied from 1 mm to 5 mm. The diseased leaves were characterized by the appearance of red, purple, orange, and red-orange spots, which were less than 0.5 mm wide (Fig 4B). The leaf tips were covered with a mucus. The lesion diameter in the experiment was between 0.8 and 1 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were between 0.3 and 1.7 mm (Table 1). The lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.8 and 5.2 mm, respectively. The lesions were not uniform, and the diseased leaves were characterized by the appearance of red, purple, and red-orange spots. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 0.5 and 1.3 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.3 and 5.2 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 1.3 and 2 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.3 and 5.3 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 2.3 and 5 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.5 and 4 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.6 and 5.7 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 2.2 and 3 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 1.9 and 4 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 3.8 and 5 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 1.9 and 2 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were between 1.2 and 3 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.3 and 5 mm, respectively. The lesion diameters in the experiment were 2.9 and 5 mm, and the lesion diameters in the experiment were 1.3 and 3 mm, respectively.


## Discussion
We attempted to identify the potential antifungal agents in this study by conducting field trials in the wild-type and infected wheat cultiva. The results of this study showed that C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis could significantly inhibit the growth of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis and C. glabrata were significantly inhibited by C. albicans. The results showed that C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis were able to inhibit the growth of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. glabrata, respectively, although C. albicans was not able to inhibit the growth of C. tropicalis.

The antifungal activity of the Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis were determined by their ability to inhibit the growth of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. glabrata. The results showed that C. albicans and C. glabrata were able to inhibit the growth of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis, respectively. The results indicated that the antifungal activity of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis was probably related to their inhibitory properties on Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis, which is consistent with previous findings [17]. The results also showed that Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis exhibited remarkable antifungal activity against Pemphigus fruitpigae, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies [17].

We also found that the antifungal activity of C. albicans and C. glabrata was important to the antifungal activity of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis. The results showed that the antifungal activity of Pemphigus fruitpigae and C. tropicalis was responsible for the antifungal activity of C. albicans. The results showed that the antifungal activity of C. albicans and C.
