## Abstract
However, the success of this measure requires that it be re-enrolled in neonatal patient. In this study, we evaluated the effect of EHSA on the occurrence of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in blood plasma at hospitalization and in adult men between 2nd and 10th October, 2017 in Apulia, Italy.

We enrolled adult patients (N = 68) admitted to hospital and admitted with isolated cryptococcal antigenemia in the ICU between 1st October and 31st October, 2017. The aim of the study was to collect serum samples from the blood and plasma at hospitalization for CrAg screening using a modified Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and evaluate the relationship between CrAg positivity and serum CD4+ T-cell count.

A total of 292 patients were enrolled, of which 215 were enrolled in the study group (124 in the EHSA group and 125 in the NHA group). Serum CrAg was collected at hospitalization for both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. To analyse the effect of the EHSA, serum CrAg concentrations and CSF CrAg levels were collected at 3rd, 7th, and 14th days after the hospitalization for all patients.

Compared with those who had taken only the EHSA, plasma CrAg concentrations were higher for patients with positive serum CrAg levels (P < 0.001) and positive CSF CrAg (P = 0.016). In the case of the patients with positive CrAg levels (P = 0.025), CrAg levels were significantly higher for patients with positive CSF CrAg (P < 0.01).

In the study population, positive serum CrAg was associated with high plasma CrAg concentrations (P < 0.01). However, the relationship was not significant for both sera for the same patient (P = 0.037).

The use of an appropriate CrAg screening strategy to assess the efficacy of antifungal therapy in neonates and children could be helpful to reduce the high incidence of invasive fungal infections in clinics.

Mechanisms of susceptibility to cryptococcosis in individuals with HIV infection are poorly understood and treatment options limited. The impact of antifungal therapy on susceptibility to cryptococcosis has not been investigated.


## Introduction
Cotton (Triticum aestivum) is a staple in the economy of 60 countries. It is an important source of food, medicine and fiber in most regions of the world. In addition, cotton is a valuable raw material for many industrial applications, such as textile fibers, paper and other materials used in clothing, furniture and other household items (Nakagawa et al., 2017). The cotton crop is mainly cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas and it is the main source of food, feed and fibre in the world (Bates et al., 2016). It is the most important fibre in the world for the production of several textile fibers and paper (Keller et al., 2016).

The cotton rhizosphere is a habitat for a wide range of microorganisms, including fungi, that colonize the cotton rhizosphere (Keller et al., 2016). During the past decades, several important human diseases have been associated with the occurrence of fungal diseases in cotton, such as human-fungus and mould- fungi, as well as dermatophytosis and ascocholiciasis (Santamaría et al., 2015). Some fungi such as Penicillium, Exophiala, Exosporium and Trichophyton are generally considered as pathogens of cotton (Keller et al., 2016). However, the association between fungal diseases and the production of cotton rhizosphere microorganisms has been questioned (Boraston et al., 2016). The fungal pathogens associated with cotton rhizosphere microorganisms are listed in Table 1.

B. anisopliae, B. cinerea, B. tenuissima, B. tenuissima, and B. tenuissima are the most important fungal pathogens of cotton (Santamaría et al., 2015). The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of B. anisopliae, B. cinerea, B. tenuissima and B. tenuissima in cotton rhizosphere microorganisms, and to determine the potential role of fungal spores in the production of these fungi.


## Methods
Patients were excluded if they had received ART (a primary component of ART) within the first year of hospitalizatio. For patients with non-infectious reasons, the patients’ medical records were extracted and the admission data were extracted as the main source of data.

Data Extraction
All data on demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, including gender, age, age at hospitalization, hospitalization for cryptococcal meningitis, and any associated clinical symptoms, were extracted as detailed in the Supplementary Information. The medical records of all patients hospitalized in ICUs were analyzed using the qualitative and quantitative methods.

All data on Cryptococcal Meningitis in neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) were extracted as detailed in the Supplementary Information.

Data Extraction
The microbiological data were extracted using the Gram stain assay and the API-20 Kit (BioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). The LFA was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the results were recorded by an end-point reader.

Data Extraction
The morphological data were extracted using the API-20 Kit. The microstructures were photographed and recorded using the Micromass-5D Scanning Microscope (Dobson, UK).

Data Extraction
The microstructures were examined using the Microstructs Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a magnification of ×10,000.

Data Extraction
The immunological data were extracted using the EZ-View Pro 6.6.0.2 Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

## Results
The . neoformans clinical isolates were obtained from the laboratory-associated (IL) and non-associated (non-infected) yeast species with a pathogenicity index of 100.0% and a risk score of 0.85. The risk score of 0.85 is considered to be safe for patients with fungal infection due to C. neoformans.

The performance of the current global standard for meningitis was evaluated using the C. neoformans clinical isolates from the same three clinical isolates, but the same cART/cPLC system. The C. neoformans clinical isolates were obtained from a laboratory-associated (IL) and non-associated (non-infected) yeast species with a pathogenicity index of 100.0% and a risk score of 0.85. The C. neoformans clinical isolates were obtained from a laboratory-associated (IL) and non-associated (non-infected) yeast species with a pathogenicity index of 100.0% and 0.85.

## Discussion

It is recommended that patients who present with chronic (non-inflammatory) fungal infection should be started on anti-fungal therapy with or without corticosteroids or radiation therapy [8. However, we did not follow up the patient's medical history and we did not find any evidence of a fungal infection. We suspect that the patient's condition deteriorated over time and his alcohol consumption history was probably a contributing factor. This patient did not have any history of drugs or alcohol. We believe that he may have been exposed to a fungal infection in his environment, possibly due to exposure to drugs or alcohol.

The primary diagnosis for invasive fungal infection is invasive fungal disease (IPD). An IPA is most often a primary manifestation of a fungal infection. However, secondary infections have been reported in patients with only a single diagnosis of invasive fungal disease. Our patient had multiple secondary causes of this disease. The patient had a history of asymptomatic travel and the patient had a history of severe asthma and diabetes. We believe that the patient's history of travel was asymptomatic, and the patient had no underlying health conditions. We believe that his travel history was asymptomatic, and the patient had no history of diabetes.

We believe that the patient had a history of cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcus is an encapsulated yeast that is isolated from animals and humans. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that is isolated from mammals and humans. Cryptococcus gattii is an encapsulated yeast that is isolated from cows and sheep. Cryptococcus spp. is an isolated yeast from Eucalyptus forests. Cryptococcus cenocepacia is an isolated yeast from the rhizosphere of Eucalyptus trees. Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast isolated from the rhizosphere of Eucalyptus trees. Other isolates may also be found in the environment. Cryptococcus neoformans was previously reported from the rhizosphere of wild Eucalyptus trees, and was isolated from the rhizosphere of plants belonging to Eucalyptus species. In this case, the patient had no known food or water exposures.
