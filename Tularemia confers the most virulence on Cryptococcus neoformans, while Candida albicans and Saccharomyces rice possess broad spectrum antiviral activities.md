## Abstract
Mycetoma is a potentially fatal fungal infection in children. The most common site of involvement is the lung, which can be asymptomatic or reversible. However, it is often misdiagnosed due to inappropriate testing, malignancy or drug interactions.

We report a case of an 8-year-old girl with Diabetic onychomycosis who was initially misdiagnosed with suspected pancytopenia and treatment withheld. She had a normal cutaneous miliary system and normal weight; however, she developed a powerful nausea and vomiting secondary to acute abdominal pain. She was found to have a history of Asthma, which was suspected to have arisen spontaneously and without specific induction of antimicrobial defense. The patient was treated with oral prednisone. She was treated well with antifungal agent of choice.

Antifungal therapy was withheld in this case because of the delay in treatment of this disease. The nausea and vomiting were replaced by levofloxacin. The patient had no further complications and discharged from the hospital.

This case highlights the importance of early recognition of radiologically if possible. This is probably the first report of a case of Diabetic onychomycosis who was initially misdiagnosed with suspected pancytopenia and treatment withheld.


## Introduction
The genus Perturbata includes about 20 species, including eight varieties (P. mariana, P. iridescens, P. rickii, P. griffithsii, P. tigris, P. nigrum, P. oryzae and P. myristospermum) [1]. P. mariana is a herb that grows in tropical and subtropical areas and is also found in temperate regions in the Mediterranean, Asian, and Indian regions [2]. P. mariana is considered to be a rich source of natural products, such as phytochemicals, flavonoids, minerals, antibiotics, and enzymes, that are important in the fight against pathogenic fungi [3]. Phytochemical investigation in China has revealed that P. mariana has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, as the main remedy against infection of the skin, mouth, mucous membrane and the digestive tract [4]. The phytochemicals and flavonoids in P. mariana are thought to be responsible for its medicinal properties and its antidiabetic, antiinflammatory, antiulcerogenic, and antiulcerogenic properties [5]. The phytochemistry of P. mariana and its compounds are summarized in Table 1.


## Methods

Among the virulent yeasts, . smegmatis has the highest virulence, while A. fumigatus is the most virulent, and A. fumigatus is the only strain to have a single fungal pathogen present in the lungs of infected mice [9, 18]. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most virulent organism in S. cerevisiae. A. fumigatus has the highest virulence, while A. fumigatus has the lowest virulence. For Cryptococcus neoformans, more than 95% of the isolates in the present study were Cryptococcus neoformans. The Cryptococcus neoformans species complex is known to cause symptoms of pneumonia, and none of the isolates presented showed any clinical signs [18]. The most virulent organism in A. fumigatus was also Cryptococcus neoformans. As for A. fumigatus, only two out of 31 isolates were Cryptococcus neoformans, while the others showed that the other species are non-virulent. A. fumigatus was found to be the most virulent of the four yeasts [19].

In addition, four of the five isolates presented in the present study were Cryptococcus neoformans and one was A. fumigatus, while the other two were not Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, seven of the eight yeasts were Cryptococcus neoformans, and five were A. fumigatus, while the other two were not Cryptococcus neoformans.

Algae strains
A total of eight S. cerevisiae isolates were used in this study. One of the isolates was A. fumigatus, while the other was A. fumigatus, which was recovered from the lungs of a group of mice infected with C. neoformans. The other four yeast strains were different from the yeast strains in the present study. In addition, two of the isolates were A. fumigatus, and one was A. fumigatus, which was recovered from the lungs of a group of mice infected with C. neoformans. The other two yeast strains were different from the yeast strains in the present study. In addition, two of the isolates were A.


## Results
The effect of DAFT on tannin production and T-bet production
In order to assess the effects of DAFT on tannin production and t-bet production in T. gondii, T. gondii was grown under DAFT treatment for 48 h. The tannin production was measured by TBC by using a synthetic liquid culture medium and was then analyzed by TLC for tannin production. The results showed that the tannin production increased at DAFT treatment for T. gondii, but not for T. gondii without DAFT treatment, indicating that the effect of DAFT on tannin production is dependent on the activity of DAFT.

Tannin production by T. gondii was investigated by utilizing the standard liquid culture medium and TLC (Figure 1). The T. gondii tannin production decreased in the absence of DAFT, indicating that T. gondii was able to produce tannin. In contrast, DAFT treatment resulted in the accumulation of T-bet production, which showed a slight decrease at DAFT treatment, indicating that T. gondii was able to produce tannin. The results showed that T. gondii was able to produce tannin by DAFT treatment.

DAFT treatment resulted in the accumulation of tannin by T. gondii, but not T. gondii without DAFT treatment
To further evaluate the effect of DAFT on tannin production by T. gondii, the T. gondii tannin production was monitored by using a synthetic liquid culture medium and TLC (Figure 2). T. gondii was able to accumulate tannin by DAFT treatment, and DAFT treatment resulted in the accumulation of tannin by T. gondii.


## Discussion
Similar to . albicans, C. tropicalis and C. krusei, C. tropicalis is able to infect and replicate in the human host through the cuticular cells of the lymphoid tissue, whereas C. krusei infects the lungs through the spleen. C. krusei infects the brain and infects the liver through the liver cells of the liver [49]. C. krusei is found in the gut, but not in the respiratory tract [50]. C. tropicalis is most prevalent in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is also found in the bloodstream and in skin and nail infections [51]. C. krusei is also most prevalent in humans. It was originally reported as a pathogen that is present in the gut and the skin [52]. It was also reported as a pathogen in dogs infected with C. tropicalis [53]. However, the pathogenic potential of C. krusei was reported only in cats [54].

Infections by C. krusei are relatively rare, occurring only in certain species. C. krusei was first described as a causative agent of mucormycosis in dogs [55]. It has been reported as a cause of infection of dogs by C. albicans in France [56]. C. albicans was previously reported as the cause of infection in dogs by C. krusei in France [57]. A recent study by Liu et al. showed that C. krusei is not found in dogs infected with C. albicans [58]. The C. albicans species was also reported as a cause of infection of dogs by C. krusei in India [59]. C. krusei was first described in Europe by Liu et al. [59]. C. krusei was found in the gut of C. tropicalis and was subsequently found to be a pathogen in humans [60].

Studies have shown that C. krusei can cause lethal infections in humans [61]. C. krusei is a member of the phylum Candida, which is found in the gut of humans. C. krusei can cause serious diseases, such as cryptococcosis and fungemia.

Infections by C. krusei can be diagnosed by the culture of the fungus in the blood of patients who have received treatment with antibiotics.
