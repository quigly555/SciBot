## Abstract
The ubiquity and bioavailability of extracellular vesicles, which possess important functions in the host defense system, has been demonstrated in diverse organisms including filamentous fungi, plants, and animals, providing a platform for the characterization of host proteins and molecules that mediate host-pathogen interactions. However, the knowledge about the extracellular vesicle delivery systems is limited, as only a limited number of them have been cloned and characterized. In the present study, we first describe the secretion and localization of several vesicular proteins of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex to host immune cells. We then compare the secretion and localization of these vesicles to target cells and host immune cells. Importantly, we find that many proteins of the Paracoccidioides complex possess a unique and prominent cleavage profile, which differs from those of the helminthic eukaryotes and is significantly larger, as indicated by the size difference among the different dendritic cells and also the higher survival and healing capacity of the targeted lymphoid cells. These differences are associated with the ability of the peptides to induce the secretion of several immune mediators. In conclusion, we report a comparative and discovery approach that differs from the more closely related eukaryotic or helminthic eukaryotic extracellular vesicles and offer a new perspective on the secretion and localization of these key mediators.


## Introduction
In the last decades, fungal pathogens have developed several strategies to control infections. One of these is to secrete antifungal compounds that kill the pathogen. These compounds are released into the environment and can be extracted from a variety of substrates. Their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are highly variable and depend on both conditions, environmental conditions, and growth. In pathogenic fungi, some compounds are released into the extracellular space to inhibit fungal growth [1]. Some of these compounds are able to inhibit the growth of fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. Some of these compounds can inhibit the growth of non-pathogenic organisms such as bacteria and protozoa. Some of these compounds are also able to inhibit the growth of bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of an antifungal compound, TAFE-H37, against the growth of four different yeasts, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mucor circinelloides.


## Methods
db-ts.org; http://www.bdb-tsd.org; [31]), along with fungal species and antifungals. The results of BDB-TSD (www.bdb-tsd.org; http://www.bdb-tsd.org) were compared to the standard MDS methodology using the Candida spp. database (www.candidagenome.org; [32]).

4.4. Antifungal Agents
For in vitro studies, the antifungal compounds (Table 2) were tested against the following fungal species: Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (Sigma), Candida krusei ATCC 6258 (Sigma), Candida tropicalis ATCC 20509 (Sigma), Candida albicans ATCC 90030 (Sigma), Candida krusei ATCC 6258 (Sigma), Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (Sigma), Candida krusei ATCC 6258 (Sigma), and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (Sigma). The antifungal compounds (Table 2) were dissolved in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.125-5 µg/mL. For the in vitro experiments, RPMI 1640 contains M-penicillin (Sigma), 2-hydroxytetracyclo-2-methylphenyl-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (Sigma) and 2-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (Sigma). For the in vivo studies, the antifungal compounds were tested against the following fungal species: Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (Sigma), Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (Sigma), Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 (Sigma), Candida tropicalis ATCC 20509 (Sigma), and Candida krusei ATCC 6258 (Sigma). The antifungal compounds (Table 2) were dissolved in RPMI 1640.

4.5. Fungal Growth
Fungal growth was evaluated using standard culture techniques as previously described (2), with minor modifications. C. albicans ATCC 10231, C.


## Results

Compounds 1 and 2 were identified as hydrophilic and hydrophilic chloroperoxidones, and as naphthalene. Naphthalene is a flavonoid that is a flavonoid composed of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. Naphthalene, a flavonoid that was shown to be particularly toxic in our screen, is a flavonoid that has been found to be toxic in human and animal models of fungal infection (24, 25). The most toxic flavonoids, naphthalene and chloroperoxidone, are polyphenols, which are not easily identifiable by their chemical structures and are generally found to be non-phenolic flavonoids that are typically used to treat infections and neurological disorders (26). In the current work, we screened five new polyphenolic flavonoids for their antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.

3.3. Antifungal Activity of Compounds 1 and 2
In our screen, the compound 1 was found to be the most potent antifungal, with an MIC of 64 µg/ml against all Candida strains tested (Table 2). Compounds 1 and 2 also inhibited the growth of Candida glabrata at concentrations of 0.25 to 0.5 µg/ml and 0.01 µg/ml, respectively, which is a good concentration for growth of Candida albicans. The MIC of 1 was 0.5 µg/ml and 0.01 µg/ml, respectively, against Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida krusei-mold, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. Compounds 2 and 3 showed potent antifungal activity, with MICs of 0.5 to 64 µg/ml for C. albicans, 0.5 to 1 µg/ml for C. parapsilosis, and 0.25 µg/ml for C. glabrata.

## Discussion
., at least one compound with MIC values of > 2 µg/mL, consistent with its ability to produce acetic acid derivatives (Fig 6). This result shows that all isolates of C. tropicalis are capable of producing acetic acid, despite the fact that some isolates of C. albicans are inhibited in a range of concentrations of acetic acid [13,15]. The comparison of the results of the initial yeasts and their newly isolated compounds reveals some interesting features. First, the ability to produce acetic acid derivatives (MICs > 2 µg/mL) is significantly higher than the yeasts, which may be due to the fact that they are not as sensitive to acetic acid as the other yeasts, and thus produce less acetic acid. Second, the oleic acid (MICs ranging from 3 to 6) used in the test is considerably less than that in the studies of the other Candida strains [15,20]. It may be because of the fact that the oleic acid derivatives are smaller in comparison to the other major compounds, and therefore less toxic. The fact that they are able to produce at least one acetic acid derivative is also in agreement with the literature [14,20].

In the present study, the antifungal activity of the tested compounds is considered as significant, as they produce higher levels of antimicrobial activity than the tested compounds. This result is in accordance with the results obtained in a previous study of acetic acid derivatives produced by C. albicans and C. tropicalis [16]. This result was also supported by the findings of the present study which showed that the acetic acid derivatives were active against C. albicans in a range of concentrations [16].

The use of acetic acid derivatives as antifungal agents is also considered as a strong indication for the use of these compounds as a first-line therapy for fungal infections [21]. This is because the inhibition of fungal growth by acetic acid derivatives is considered to be the key factor that explains the emergence of fungal resistance to antifungal treatment [22,23]. This is because the toxic effect of acetic acid derivatives on fungi is related to the inhibition of growth, the formation of secondary metabolites, and the subsequent synthesis of secondary metabolites [23,24].
