## Abstract
Aneuploidy and polyploidy is common in eukaryotes but is also found in metazoans and fungi, forming complex phenotypes that areorphidically and functionally diverse. Alveolar macrophages are among the most divergent ATMTs in eukaryotes, but the macrophage polarization and cellular dynamics of this population are divergent from what is typically found in mammals. Here we report that euploid mice are more polarized and have higher numbers of macrophages infiltrating the subarachnoid space compared with mammals. Mice are more exposed to ionizing radiation and have diminished ability to internalize nucleic acids, an alteration that is likely to mediate the enhanced pro-apoptotic recruitment of this population. Exposure to an LC3 enriched environment with abundant nucleic acids increases polarization of alveolar macrophages, and macrophages exposed to a depleted environment with abundant nucleic acids also exacerbate the immune response. The macrophage polarization ability is also regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK) signaling pathway.


## Introduction
The Mp1 is a unique immune receptor in which two copies are present and expressed, the two copies are removed by the adapter molecule (the adapter molecule binds to a specific antigen. The adapter molecule then binds to the surface of the immune cells and initiates a cellular process of immune responses, such as phagocytosis and Th1/Th2 responses.

The mechanisms of immune responses are complex and involve the direct activation of the host defense mechanisms by immune cells, such as cytokines and chemokines and the activation of the cytokines themselves, such as IL-1ß and IL-17 [31]. The IL-1ß mediates the activation of macrophages and T cells, resulting in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the activation of macrophages and T cells, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and immunoglobulins [32]. The type I interferon (IFN-<U+03B3>) activates T cells, leading to the production of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-1ß and IL-18. The IFN-<U+03B3> is also elevated in response to microbial infection and the release of NO [33,34]. The IL-18 is secreted and is released upon activation of the immune response [35-37].

In Candida albicans, the Th1/Th2 response is thought to be required for the activation of the Th1 response, which is associated with the production of IL-12 and IL-18 and the induction of IL-1ß and IL-18, respectively [38,39]. The Th2 response is associated with the production of IL-4 and IL-13, which is associated with the production of IL-10 and IL-23. The Th1/Th2 response is associated with the production of IL-4 and IL-13. The Th2 response is activated by activation of the Th2 immune response. The Th1/Th2 response is activated by the production of IL-4 and IL-13. The Th2 immune response is activated by IL-10 and IL-23 and the production of IL-10 and IL-23.

The Th1/Th2 response is activated by the production of IL-1ß and IL-4, which is associated with IL-10 and IL-23.


## Methods
The isolates were collected from the Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology of the University Hospital of Pune, Indi. The Hsp90 gene sequence was obtained from the genome of C. albicans ATCC 18804 (GenBank accession number CA90670) and its DNA sequence was obtained from the genome of C. glabrata (GenBank accession number AGC15579). All the Hsp90 genes are listed in Table 1.

Microscopy
The morphology of each isolate was recorded with a Nikon microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Ri2 camera and an Olympus Fluoview FV1000M digital camera using a Nikon DXM1200M for Windows or a Nikon Eclipse 80i for Mac OSX (Photometrics, Woburn, MA, USA). The images were obtained using a Nikon CoolSNAP HQ2 digital camera and a Nikon DS-U2 high-resolution camera (Photometrics, Woburn, MA, USA).

DNA extraction and sequencing
To isolate DNA from the different strains, the genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelium grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 2 days. The mycelium was then washed twice in sterile water, the mycelium was ground in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was suspended in 1 ml of sterile water. The DNA concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The DNA extractions were performed with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit contains a DNA extract kit (Qiagen) with 2 µg of DNA and a 1 µl aliquot of DNA. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract the RNA of each DNA extract.

Total RNA was extracted from the mycelium of each strain using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The total RNA concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000).


## Results
braziliensis/. edodes and S. cerevisiae L. braziliensis/S. pneumoniae strains, L. braziliensis/L. edodes and S. cerevisiae L. braziliensis/S. pneumoniae strains were selected because the deletion mutant strains are often unable to grow in the absence of carbon source, and the respective deletion mutants were sensitive to low nitrogen sources. The selected strains were cultured on L-DOPA medium and the carbon source was added by adding acetic acid (0.3%) or glycerol (0.1%). The specific growth of the selected strains was measured by colony count. The strains were isolated by liquid chromatography and the colony count was used to determine the growth of the selected strains. The minimum growth rate (m/z) of the selected strains was found to be 4.19 ± 0.09 and 4.89 ± 0.19 with the minimum growth rate of 4.18 ± 0.05 and 4.36 ± 0.15 for the L. braziliensis/L. edodes and S. pneumoniae strains, respectively. The minimum growth rate of the selected strains was found to be 3.69 ± 0.14 and 3.27 ± 0.11 with the minimum growth rate of 3.87 ± 0.31 and 3.06 ± 0.05 for the L. braziliensis/L. edodes and S. pneumoniae strains, respectively. The minimum growth rate of the selected strains was found to be 3.29 ± 0.07 and 3.31 ± 0.04 with the minimum growth rate of 3.06 ± 0.04 and 3.08 ± 0.05 for the L. braziliensis/L. edodes and S. pneumoniae strains, respectively. The minimum growth rate of the selected strains was found to be 3.08 ± 0.06 and 3.00 ± 0.05 with the minimum growth rate of 3.91 ± 0.07 and 3.56 ± 0.03 for the L. braziliensis/L. edodes and S. pneumoniae strains, respectively.

Differential Gene Expression Profiles of Mp1 End Associate and Hsp90 Isolates Using the Iron Starvation Level
The Mp1 end associate and Hsp90 end associate were found to be significantly differentially expressed during the L. braziliensis and S.


## Discussion
Candida albicans is a common fungal pathogen causing candidemia in human. Despite the fact that fungal infections are more prevalent in immunocompromised patients, the incidence of invasive Candida disease continues to increase. Candida albicans is a common Candida pathogen causing candidemia in humans. Although Candida albicans is usually the causative agent, it is also one of the most common human pathogenic fungi [34]. The frequency of invasive Candida disease has increased over the past few decades. As of 2013, the first cases of candidemia in HIV-infected individuals were reported [36]. We also conducted a Candida population genetics study. We found that C. albicans is a predominant pathogen in our study, which is in agreement with previous studies that other Candida species were also a frequent cause of invasive candidiasis in humans [11], [37], [38]. This species also appears to be an important target for antifungal drug development. To date, 14 drug classes have been reported for C. albicans, which are the most potent antifungal drugs available to treat invasive candidiasis in HIV-infected patients [39]. Additionally, three novel antifungal drugs, amprenavir, fludarabin and intercurrent drugs, have been developed for the treatment of invasive candidiasis [40], [41]. Amphotericin B is the most potent antifungal drug for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in HIV-infected patients [42], but it is still a very potent drug for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in HIV-infected patients [43]. We also developed an antifungal drug, fludarabin, which is a potent inhibitor of growth factor-alpha (GF-ß) signaling pathway that is used to treat C. albicans infection [44]. In our study, we also showed that the Candida strains that were used in our study were also the most resistant strains to fludarabin and intercurrent drugs.

We have also previously reported that Candida strains isolated from patients with invasive candidiasis were more susceptible than those isolated from non-infected patients [19].
