## Abstract
Phylogenetic studies of a panel of 14 well-conserved and recently lost genes from the mycorrhizal (Mycorrhizaceae) genus revealed that the conserved ÃŸ-linked 1,3-d-glucan synthase domain (MGL domain) protein and the glycosyltransferase domain (GT domain) protein are essential for phygal growth, whereas the transmembrane toxin (TT) domain is dispensable. Other conserved proteins from the Rhizopus species complex are also conserved, although their apparent ortholog in a lichen (Mycorrhiza sp.) indicates that they are not multistep. The glycosyltransferase domain and the glycosyltransferase protein are not related to virulence, but their shared structural motifs make them excellent target compounds.

Here we report on a novel protein, the transporter GRN5, which is an orthologue of the glycosyltransferase protein MGL1, and its co-factors, MGL-1 and MGL-2, together with several known glycoproteins.


## Introduction
Fungal pathogens are involved in a wide range of complex interactions with the host plants, influencing almost every aspect of their life cycle. Fungi are ubiquitous in nature, and they are often found in very different environments (e.g., soil, water, air). They can be found in an extremely diverse range of habitats, and the interaction between a fungus and its host is a complex and dynamic one. This is a fact that is, at least for fungi, very important for the survival of the host plant. It is also a fact that has long been a source of great interest in the field of fungal biology, with more than 700 described species and more than 2000 described species reported in the past 10 years (Hawksworth, 2010; Croll and Cunningham, 2015; Croll and Cunningham, 2016). The complexity of the interaction between fungi and their host plants has recently been described in detail (e.g., Croll and Cunningham, 2015). The biochemistry of fungal pathogenesis is now well understood in detail (reviewed in Croll and Cunningham, 2015). However, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between fungi and their host plants is still very limited, and there are some excellent reviews on the molecular mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis (Croll and Cunningham, 2015). This review will focus on the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between fungi and their host plants. We will focus on the relationship between the modes of fungal growth, the ability to sense and respond to changes in the environment, and the interaction of the fungus with its host.


## Methods
. Material and Sample Collection
This was a retrospective study of a retrospective study conducted from January 2014 to December 2017. This was a retrospective study of a retrospective study conducted from January 2016 to December 2017. The clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in a standardized form. The patients were divided into two groups: (a) Control patients, who were treated by systemic antifungal agents, (b) C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei (Table 1). The patients were informed about the study and signed a consent form. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital of Kunming Medical University (SCHM).
