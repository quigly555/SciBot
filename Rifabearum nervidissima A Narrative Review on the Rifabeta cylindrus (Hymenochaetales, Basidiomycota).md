## Abstract
Fungal biofilms play a significant role in the infection of a wide range of hosts. These biofilms are composed of a heterogeneous population of yeasts that have developed mutualisms of defense with distinct animal host populations. This system is procedurally structured in a way that benefits the yeasts, the majority of the species. This system is advantageous because it allows for a natural and rapid evolution in the chosen host population, allowing for the selection of a fast and sensitive gene deletion strategy that is able to maintain the integrity of the system. The deletion of target genes is accomplished in a manner that benefits yeasts, as it allows for the selection of a fast and sensitive deletion method that is able to ensure the system maintains a stable and species-specific population. This paper reviews the recent advances in the management of fungal biofilms and the control of this destructive microbial community by the various strategies currently available for the management of these organisms.


## Introduction

Phylogeny and phylogenetic relationships of Rifabearum corymbifera and Hymenochaetales were recently resolved based on sequences of the ITS rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA internal to Rifabearum corymbifera and Hymenochaetales) [22. The first comprehensive sequence analysis of Hymenochaetales was performed using the ITS rDNA internal transcribed spacer, which allowed the identification of Hymenochaetales as a sister group to Rifabearum and Hymenochaetales [22]. Since then, several other Hymenochaetales have been resolved within the Rifabearaceae (Hymenochaetales, Diaporthales), including the genera Acanthochaetales, Deimatosporium, Euplastoxylon, Hyphomonastix, Kazachandrea and Lecidea [22].

The genus Hymenochaetales consists of about 15 species and is the most basal phylum in the subphylum Agaricomycotina (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota). Hymenochaetales is represented by just three species, with more than 20% of the species described in literature as true Hymenochaetales [22]. The genus belongs to the family Trichosporonales and comprises about 150 species in the family [22]. The taxonomic status of Hymenochaetales is still unresolved. Some studies described species in the family Trichosporonales that are not found in other Hymenochaetales, and others reported the presence of Hymenochaetales in a variety of substrata and species [22].

The genus Hymenochaetales was established by Bilywers (1909) with two species, Hymenochaetales sp. & Phaetonodis (now renamed Phaetonodisales) and Hymenochaetales sp. & Phaetonodis (now renamed Phaetonodisales) [22]. The genus was transferred to Trichosporonales by Bilywers (1909) and included four species, including Hymenochaetales sp. & Phaetonodis, Hymenochaetales sp.


## Methods
was presented in this pape. In this study, Rifabearumculus spp. were included in the study. A comparative analysis was performed for the isolates, using Rifabearumculus spp. in this study.

For the fungal community analyses, the following criteria were used: (i) Rifabearumculus spp. were included in the study. (ii) The samples of Rifabearumculus spp. were from a specific area of the country. (iii) The identification of the fungal community of the samples was done with the help of the Phyletic Database of Mycology and Plant Pathology, Biomedical Sciences Centre of the School of Pharmacy of the University of São Paulo (ASCP), State University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.


## Results
Phylogenetic analyses of the Rifabeta cylindrus tree showed that the Rifabearum cylindrus group was present in the southern hemispher. However, this group is geographically isolated from the other groups in the Rifabearum clade (Fig 1). The Rifabeta cylindrus group was recently shown to be an important non-Saccharomyces group, and the Rifabeta cylindrus group was proposed to accommodate the non-Saccharomyces group (Lelley et al. 2012).

The Rifabeta cylindrus tree was initially interpreted as a representative of a non-Saccharomyces group, but the taxonomic placement of the Rifabeta cylindrus group was not resolved in the present study. The present study shows that the Rifabeta cylindrus group was more closely related to a non-Saccharomyces group than to a non-Saccharomyces group.

The distribution of polysaccharide polysaccharides in Rifabeta cylindrus was compared to other non-Saccharomyces groups in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 2). Polysaccharides from Rifabeta cylindrus were not evenly distributed in the tree, and the polysaccharides from Rifabeta cylindrus were scattered throughout the tree. Polysaccharides from Rifabeta cylindrus were distributed in three groups, namely Rifabeta cylindrus, Rifabeta cylindrus-related, and Rifabeta cylindrus-related polysaccharides (Fig 2).

Asexual morph development and sexual reproduction of Rifabeta cylindrus
The sexual reproduction of Rifabeta cylindrus was studied in asexual morph development and sexual reproduction of Rifabeta cylindrus was studied in asexual morph development and sexual reproduction of Rifabeta cylindrus. We conducted hybridization of Rifabeta cylindrus and Rifabeta lysates in order to study the sexual reproduction of Rifabeta cylindrus. The hybridization procedure was performed on a per plant biomass basis.


## Discussion
 2017.

Rifabeta cylindrus (Hymenochaetales, Basidiomycota) was the dominant fungus inhabiting the basal position in the phylogenetic analysis, but the placement of this species in the Rifabeta lineage was not confirmed in our phylogeny. Rifabeta cylindrus (Hymenochaetales, Basidiomycota) was recorded as the predominant fungus on the basal position of Rifabeta cylindrus in our analyses, but the position of this species in the phylogenetic analysis was not confirmed in this study.

Comparison of the above two lineages of Rifabeta
To compare the distribution of Rifabeta in the two phylogenetic groups, two lineages of Rifabeta were compared in the phylogenetic analyses. The basidiomycetous fungi in these two groups were collected from the soil of the Yangtze River in Yunnan Province (China), and they were collected from several plant species (Jiaobai et al., 2013). The fungi from the Yangtze River were the closest relatives to the Rifabeta lineages in the phylogenetic analyses. The other fungi collected from the soil of the Yangtze River were also related to Rifabeta. The species of Rifabeta in the two phylogenetic groups are characterized by the presence of aerial hyphal structures, which can be found on the stems of trees in the two groups.

Comparison of the species of Rifabeta in three groups
Comparison of the three groups of Rifabeta species in the tree of the seven groups is shown in Fig 5. Three groups were formed by species of Rifabeta, and they were all phylogenetically related to each other. Three groups were formed by species of Rifabeta, and they were all related to each other. Three groups were formed by species of Rifabeta, and they were all related to each other. Three groups were formed by species of Rifabeta, and they were all related to each other.

In the two groups of Rifabeta, the species of Rifabeta were represented by two independent taxa, Rifabeta sp. 0 and Rifabeta sp. 1.
