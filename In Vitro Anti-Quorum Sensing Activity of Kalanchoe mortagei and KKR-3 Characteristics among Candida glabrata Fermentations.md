## Abstract
Spoilage of barley by yeasts is a major cause of worldwide wheat and legume losses. As the production of single cell oils and carvacrol from renewable sources increases, it has the potential to be a cost saving and renewable process to reduce the use of ethanol for the control of wheat head and disease diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to identify additional sources of oils that can be easily grown and commercialized to alleviate the use of synthetic or in vitro yeasts in the control of legume and grain diseases.

In this study, we evaluated the productivity, yields, and safety of five different yeasts that were evaluated for their ability to reduce the accumulation of malicogenic and biotrophic fungi by different incubation periods. The results indicated that they were able to reduce the accumulation of these fungi up to 70%, and they were not able to cause any adverse effects on grain quality.

In this study, yeasts were found to be a cost-effective source for reducing the accumulation of these fungi in wheat field. They could be used as an alternative for the control of wheat head and disease diseases. Moreover, they showed the ability to reduce the accumulation of recalcitrant and recalcitrant fungi. These results are important for practical use as the yeast cells can be easily discarded without any adverse action on grain quality.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a common human commensal of the human microbiota and a major fungal pathogen. It causes mucosal and systemic infections of the mucosal and upper respiratory tract, affecting millions of people annually [1]. The human body harbors at least 10 million microbial cells, and these cells form symbiotic networks with the host tissues, which are vital for the proper functioning of the body [2]. However, the diversity of the microbiota in the human body is constantly changing, and the major microorganisms are different from other cells in terms of their pathogenicity and virulence [3]. Candida species are an important group of pathogens, which cause infections in the bloodstream, skin, and gastrointestinal tract of humans. It is estimated that about one-fourth of the world's population remains ill or under immune suppression, and the number of people suffering from diseases is growing [4]. Some of these diseases are acquired by humans through inhalation, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with these infections [5]. Some of the most common fungal diseases are Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. These fungi have many virulence factors, including the ability to grow at 37°C, to produce oxidative stress, and to produce adhesion molecules, which are important in fungal pathogenesis [6]. The commensal microbiota, which is the major constituent of the human microbiota, is not only involved in the health and fitness of the individuals, but also in the pathogenesis of other infectious diseases [7, 8]. Candida species are among the most common human pathogens, and some of them can cause diseases like mucocutaneous candidiasis, as well as pulmonary and central nervous system infections [9, 10]. Other groups of fungi, including Histoplasma, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus, are less commonly encountered in patients and cause less than one disease per 100,000 inhabitants [11]. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen and is usually found on the skin, on mucosal surfaces, or in the respiratory tract, but it can also cause infections in patients with other infections like mucocutaneous candidiasis, skin lesions, or mucormycosis [12].


## Methods
Fermentations were performed with 100 µl of a 1% KOH solution, which was diluted to 1 mL with .1% KOH solution and then incubated with 1 mL of 0.1% KOH solution for 10 min. The solution was then diluted with 1 mL of 0.1% KOH solution to a final concentration of 1.0 mL, which was then added to a screw-cap tube with a sterile pestle, and the solution was poured into a 96-well plate. After the treatment of the sample, the tube was rinsed with sterile distilled water, then incubated with a 1:1 ratio of KOH solution to 50 mM sodium carbonate. The number of colonies was counted after incubation for 5 min.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of Kalanchoe mortagei and KKR-3
The antifungal activities of Kalanchoe mortagei and KKR-3 were evaluated in accordance with the microdilution method described in reference 29. The experiments were conducted with Candida glabrata (ATCC 6258) and K. pneumoniae (ATCC 52312) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The inocula were obtained from Candida glabrata culture taken from the spore and broth cultures of S. cerevisiae (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). The fungal isolates were identified according to the ISHAM M27-A3 standard, according to the methods of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and according to the reference 30.

2.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC_50)
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC_50) was determined by the broth dilution method in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The MIC_50 of KKR-3 was defined as the lowest concentration of KKR that inhibits 100% of fungal growth in the test tube. The MIC_50 of KKR-3 was defined as the concentration that inhibits 50% of fungal growth in the test tube. The MIC_50 of KKR-3 was defined as the concentration that prevents 50% of fungal growth in the test tube.


## Results
For both strains, the enzyme activity decreased when the karabinosidase activity was examine. In the assay of anti-quorum sensing activity, the enzyme activity was increased by 6.3-fold with the increase in the karabinosidase activity of KKR-3, while the activity of the two strains decreased in a similar manner.

For the other three yeast strains, the enzyme activity in the in vitro assay was improved by 5.9-fold with the increase in karabinosidase activity. In the assay of anti-quorum sensing activity, the enzyme activity decreased by 3.3-fold with the increase in the karabinosidase activity of KKR-3. In the assay of anti-quorum sensing activity, the enzyme activity decreased by 4.4-fold with the increase in the karabinosidase activity of KKR-3.

Comparison of Activity of the two Strains in an Oral Microbiological Study
In order to evaluate the specific effect of the enzyme activity of the two strains, the fungal strains were obtained from the same oral cavity. In this study, the activities of the two strains were evaluated using the four-gene microarray method. The results are shown in Table 3. The enzyme activity of the two strains was significantly higher than that of the two strains. In addition, the enzyme activity of the two strains was not significantly different from that of the other two strains.

In addition, the enzyme activity of the two strains was not significantly different from that of the other two strains.

In vivo Activity of KKR-3 and KKR-3 in Combination Microarrays
The in vivo activity of the two strains was evaluated using the in vitro assay of anti-quorum sensing activity. The in vitro activity of KKR-3 and KKR-3 in combination microarrays was evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Candida antibody and a mouse polyclonal anti-Candida fluoro-fluoro-fluoro-fluorescein isotype control antibody. The results are shown in Figure 4. The KKR-3 strain showed the highest activity. The KKR-3 strain showed the highest activity against the two Candida species.


## Discussion
As shown in Table 2, the MICs for Candida krusei were approximately 2 µg/m. Candida glabrata were resistant to all the ferric chloride inhibitors tested. No activity of the ferric chloride inhibitors was observed.

Ferric chloride is an antifungal agent and is found in many foods and pharmaceuticals [35]. It is used to treat ocular infections and other bacterial and viral infections. It is present in the human body as well as in fish and plants [36]. It has been found in the plant parts of fish, fruits and vegetables [37]. It has also been isolated from the soil of the plant roots [38] and in fresh water [39]. Ferric chloride has also been isolated from the soil of the plant roots [40]. Ferric chloride was previously isolated from the rhizosphere of plants [41]. Ferric chloride has been isolated from plant parts of plants and humans [42]. Ferric chloride has been found in the environment [43] and in water [44].
