## Abstract
We previously reported that intron loss was associated with increased susceptibility to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) phagocytosis by CD3-CD4 complex formation. To test this hypothesis, we found that male rats were genetically more resistant to PMN phagocytosis than females. We found a higher frequency of intron loss in females, as reflected by lower numbers of PMN phagocytosis, in comparison with males. Moreover, intron gain was associated with decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, decreased fungal burden, and increased susceptibility to infection. These results demonstrate that male rats are genetically more resistant to PMN phagocytosis than females. This finding may have important implications for our understanding of PMN-mediated host immune responses to infection.

Infections with the human opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised hosts. Although there are no reported cases of systemic candidiasis in patients immunodeficient to the primary antifungal agent Candida albicans, we do not know whether this immunocompromised condition is a result of frequent exposure to environmental- and drug-resistant PMN or reflects intrinsic resistance to these fungi. In this study, we observed that introns were frequently lost or removed from PMN in male rats exposed to heat or UV light.


## Introduction
The genus Rhodotorula (Mycosphaerella, Capnodiales) is characterized by having a polyphyletic structure consisting of three monotypic clades: the family Rhodotorula (Rossman et al. 2011) and the Ramosporium (Zhang et al. 2011) genera. This clade is characterized by acervular ascomata with a set of hyaline, textura-like appendages, which are generally sterile, e.g., without a set of hyphae (Liu et al. 2011). The second group includes acervular ascomata with a thickened periphysate appendage, the stipe-less thallus, and acervular sarcophagus cells, all of which are rarely (or never) described in literature. The fourth group consists of more variable multigene families: Agaricomycotina, Agaricomycotinae, and Agaricomycotinae (Rossman et al. 2011; Heil et al. 2014; Mrakoum et al. 2015). Although the type species of Rhodotorula, R. dendroides, is the most common type found in nature, its phylogenetic relationship to the genera Leotiostroma and Phaeosphaeria is less clear (Rossman et al. 2011; Kües 2008).

Leotiostroma and Phaeosphaeria are both able to invade and proliferate within host tissue (Rossman et al. 2011). However, the type species of R. dendroides is limited to the genus Leotiostroma in its acervular ascomata (Rossman et al. 2011). This is particularly true for the acervular ascomata, since a majority of the cases of Leotiostroma and Phaeosphaeria infection are identified as the type of Phaeosphaeria. Although type species of R. dendroides are described as being obligate biotrophic (Rossman et al. 2011), Rossman et al. (2011) and Mrakoum et al. (2014) have shown that there are several types of Phaeosphaeria with acervular ascomata and phaeosphaeria, and only two of the other types were described as pathogenic.


## Methods
The study included patients with a history of the disease or a history of infection with a known pathogen and a history of CNS infectio. Patients were grouped into four groups: (1) patients with a history of CNS infection, (2) patients with a history of CNS infection and (3) patients with a history of CNS infection and a history of CNS infection. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comité de Ética y Recherche et de Protection des Personnes (CEP), Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). The blood samples of patients with CNS infection were collected at the moment of infection, and the blood samples of patients with CNS infection were collected at the moment of febrile neutropenia. The blood samples of patients with CNS infection were collected at the time of febrile neutropenia. The blood samples of patients with CNS infection were collected at the time of febrile neutropenia. The blood samples of patients with CNS infection were collected at the time of neutropenia.

Blood culture
Serum samples were collected using sterile saline (0.85% NaCl) and centrifuged at 3200 g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain serum supernatants. The supernatant was discarded. The remaining supernatants were stored at -20 °C.

Microbiological evaluation of the serum samples
The antigens, serum and CSF samples were evaluated using standard histopathological and biochemical methods, as previously described [15]. The levels of fungi and bacteria were evaluated by the standards of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the standard organism of culture (n = 50).

Statistical analysis
The data was presented as the means ± SD. All data analyses were performed in SAS software (version 9.2.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and analyzed with the Statistica version 8.0 software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The categorical data were presented as the mean ± SE and the continuous data were presented as the median. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used for data analysis. The differences between groups were determined by Student’s t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for the data and statistical analyses. Statistical significance was determined by p-value = 0.05.


## Results
fumigatus infected, and no results were available for microbiological testin. Fourteen days after infection, the patient was clinically stable, but was suspected of disseminating mycosis in a CSF culture or a CSF culture of the skin or the CSF of the sacrificed animal. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a single illness. After 21 days, the patient was transferred to another facility for follow-up. No results were available for the first 3-5 months after admission.

Survival of a case of Neoscytoma bacillisporum with no evidence of underlying immunodeficiency
The survival of the patient was not better than that of the control group (7.7 ± 1.8 weeks vs. 10.4 ± 1.2 weeks). After 12 weeks, the patient was recovered healthy and his condition was completely restored. However, he was repeatedly suspected of having a fatal outcome. Five days after admission, the patient was admitted to the hospital for a single CT scan and was re-tested for CSF culture, CSF proteomics, CSF antigen and CSF DNA. He had a histopathological, CSF lymphopenia, and CSF secretions. CSF cytology showed CSF mycobacterial antibodies in the CSF and serum of the CSF specimens. Five days after admission, the patient was clinically stable, and no evidence of systemic inflammation was seen in the CSF or serum of the patient. The patient was admitted to the hospital for a single CT scan and died on day 14 after the admission.

Survival of a case of Borrelia burgdorferi with no evidence of underlying immunodeficiency
The survival of the patient was not better than that of the control group (5.7 ± 1.8 weeks vs. 9.9 ± 1.9 weeks). After 12 weeks, the patient was successfully discharged from hospital with a single CT scan and died on day 21 after the CT scan. The patient was admitted to the hospital for a single CT scan and was subsequently discharged with the complete antifungal therapy. CSF culture showed Cryptococcus in the CSF and serum of the CSF specimens. Five days after admission, the patient was clinically stable, and no evidence of systemic inflammation was seen in the CSF or serum of the patient. Five days after admission, the patient was admitted to the hospital for a single CT scan and died on day 21 after the CT scan.


## Discussion
The present study presents a case of a patient who developed focal cerebral aspergillosis after corticosteroid therapy. The patient was on antifungal therapy for a cerebral malaria that had been diagnosed earlier in his life and was therefore treated with corticosteroid therapy for 3 weeks. A later report from a patient on antifungal therapy (5) described a patient who developed focal cerebral aspergillosis following corticosteroid therapy. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of a patient who developed focal cerebral aspergillosis after corticosteroid therapy.

Aspergillus spp. are ubiquitous fungi that occur in all locations of the human body, including the brain and the skin [3]. They are also known to cause a variety of diseases, including pulmonary and disseminated mycosis, and to cause a variety of neurodegenerative diseases [4]. In addition, several isolates have been reported to cause cancer in humans, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus [5, 6]. A patient in the present case was severely immunocompromised and had been diagnosed with aspergillosis 1 month prior to the diagnosis of brain aspergillosis. The patient’s clinical symptoms of aspergillosis have been described previously as headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and seizures [4]. In the present case, however, the patient’s physical symptoms and the neurological examination suggested that the aspergillosis was not related to cerebral aspergillosis. Therefore, the patient’s therapy was initiated and then corticosteroid therapy was commenced.

In this case, corticosteroid therapy was started for the treatment of the patient’s aspergillosis. In the patients’ studies, corticosteroid therapy was demonstrated to be effective in the initial 2 weeks of treatment, and then decreased to maintenance therapy.
