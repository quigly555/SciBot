## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that infects immunocompetent hosts and causing life-threatening meningoencephalitis. Unlike C. neoformans, C. gattii does not commonly infect immunocompetent hosts. However, serotype 4, a genetic variant of C. gattii (C4), is reported in most C. gattii isolates. We present a C4 serotype (C4) serotype (serotype A) and a C1 serotype (C1-serotype A) serotype (serotype C) phenotypes, which are significantly different from those of C. neoformans and C. gattii, respectively. The serotype-specificity of the C1-serotype-like phenotype was determined by quantitative PCR and revealed to be an additional 50% in the C4 serotype than in the C1-serotype serotype. The serotype-specificity of the C1-serotype-like phenotype was significantly increased in the C4 serotype than in the C1-serotype serotype. Further serotype-specific phenotypes were identified in the C1-serotype serotype and decreased in the C4 serotype than in the C1-serotype serotype. The increased virulence of the C1-serotype serotype compared to the C1-serotype serotype was associated with a higher polysaccharide production. The serotype-specific phenotypes identified in this study represent a novel species of C. gattii, which should have a great potential for application as a novel antifungal drug target.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella (Pers.) T. Cannon erected the genus to accommodate numerous genera of phoretic fungi, including the ascomycetes Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum species and Exophiala species. Microsporum species are the most common and ubiquitous fungi causing superficial or severe infections in humans, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) and those patients with hematological malignancies. The genus contains more than 10 000 species, of which approximately 50 species are known to cause superficial infections, of which only Trichophyton spp. are known to cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients. Microsporum species are also considered to be an important group of pathogens because they cause diseases such as superficial cutaneous mycosis, vulvovaginal mycosis and invasive candidiasis, as well as life-threatening systemic infections in patients with hematological malignancies.1

There are only few cases reported in the literature on the clinical and pathological features of Microsporum species in ICUs. These reports mostly focus on the clinical features and the microbiological characteristics of the affected tissues and may miss important differences between the species or cause subtle differences that can potentially lead to false-positive results.2,3 Thus, the present review will focus on the present cases of false-positive mycosphaerella infections.


## Methods
Plant material
The plant was cultivated in the Densián de Hejos Plantation, in the municipality of Fuchsánde, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, from May to November 2016. The plant was divided into three parts; the leaf surface, roots, and petiole. The root and leaf of the plant were separated from the root surface by the fact that there is no root in the plant. The root surface of the plant was wiped and then the roots were dried and weighed. The root-tip ratio was divided according to the root-tip ratio of the root tip of the plant, and the number of plants in a given area was divided according to the root-tip ratio of the root tip of the plant.

Growth conditions
The plant was grown in a growth chamber at 20 ± 2°C for 18 h under the conditions described in the previous section. The inoculated fruits were then placed in plastic containers and were then stored at 4°C. The fruit surface was exposed to alternating high and low temperature conditions to keep the fruit moist and sterile. The temperature of the containers was maintained at 20-25°C.


## Results
Growth and viability of the fungal hyphae
We inoculated 8-week-old rice seedlings with hyphae of all other fungi from the cultivar Pseudocladosporidium bieneusi, including P. chrysogenum, P. hominis, P. parietina, and P. verrucosum. We then harvested the hyphae from the two cultivars at different times (6, 8, and 24 h) to determine if any fungus could survive the initial fungal growth in the two cultivars.

Growth and viability of the fungal hyphae
To evaluate the growth of the hyphae, we used sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-labeled hyphae as a surrogate indicator for hyphal growth. We used a sodium dodecyl sulfate-labeled SD hypha to characterize the growth and viability of the fungus, as well as a sodium dodecyl sulfate-labeled SD hypha to characterize the growth and viability of the fungal hyphae.

We observed that growth of P. hominis, P. parietina, and P.


## Discussion
neoformans, and the pathogen was then infected by . gattii VGII, a species previously known to be avirulent in human patients [26].

We did not observe a significant difference in the inflammatory response between the M1 and M2 macrophages at the time of infection. A previous study showed that an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, which was found to be generated in the gut of mice infected with the pathogen, increased in the M1 phagocytic index of macrophages, whereas the IL-10 production was not. This result indicated that the inflammatory response was significantly different between the M1 and M2 macrophages.

In the present study, we observed that the inflammatory response was significantly different between the M1 and M2 macrophages, which was in contrast to a previous study that found that the macrophage response to C. neoformans was significantly more intense in the M1 macrophages [27]. The latter study also observed that the inflammation was more intense in the M2 macrophages, but this is not the case in the present study. The differences in the inflammatory response between the M1 and M2 macrophages were most apparent in the acute phase of infection, when both macrophages were infected with C. gattii VGII. The acute phase of infection is characterized by a significant increase in the inflammatory response. This inflammatory response is most evident in the M1 phase, where the M1 phenotype is highly expressed in the lungs of infected mice [28]. In the acute phase of infection, the M1 macrophages, which are normally activated in response to the early-onset inflammatory response, are activated by the inflammatory cytokine, IFN-<U+03B3>, and are able to produce IFN-<U+03B3> in response to C. neoformans infection. Furthermore, C. gattii VGII infection stimulates the M1 macrophages to produce the IFN-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) in response to C. neoformans infection [27]. In the chronic phase of infection, the M1 macrophages are activated by the inflammatory cytokine, IL-5, and are able to produce IL-4 and TNF-a, respectively [29].
