## Abstract
Purified fungi were used as a model to evaluate the efficiency of a putative antifungal drug to kill all Penicillium isolate. As an additional, three P. brasiliensis isolates with non-Candida albicans antifungal activity had previously been identified as resistant to the antifungal agent fluconazole. We also identified previously reported P. brasiliensis-resistant and non-resistant Candida species. P. brasiliensis isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B (3.2%), itraconazole (6.8%), and caspofungin (1.7%). P. brasiliensis isolates were resistant to flucytosine (3.2%), itraconazole (5%), and voriconazole (0.7%). Interestingly, all P. brasiliensis isolates susceptible to fluconazole had dendritic cell-macrophage cell degeneration (CMB) enhancement at presentation. There was no difference in the expression of markers for the calcineurin and CD40L enzymes between resistant and resistant P. brasiliensis isolates. Taken together, our data reveal the isolation of P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii from an environmental source as well as identification of novel antifungal targets of the P. brasiliensis F. cepa and P. lutzii proteins and their orthologs.

Infections with the fungal cell wall of F. cepa and P. lutzii are common in some fungal species, with a few resistant strains also emerging as a result of infection with these fungi. Here, the authors report the identification of three novel antifungal targets of the P. brasiliensis F. cepa and P. lutzii proteins: CD40L and calcineurin, and their orthologs, allowing the fungus to be used as a platform protein for understanding cell biology of fungal pathogens.

## Introduction

Most studies of the role of protein tyrosine kinases in fungal development have focused on the three kinases, the Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase, the proline-dependent protein phosphatase, and the Ccr1-dependent protein kinas. However, important caveats must be considered in these studies. Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activity is not always effective, and the phosphatases are involved in many physiological processes in fungi. It is important to note that Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activity has not been exclusively a calcium/calmodulin-dependent process. Some studies showed that the Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase plays a role in the synthesis of ergosterol, a key cell membrane component [24,25]. For example, Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activity was required for the degradation of ergosterol to free and lipolytic, and the enzyme was required for the degradation of ergosterol to acetyl-CoA and to form a stable a-arabinofuranosyl linkage [26]. This enzyme was also required for ergosterol synthesis and was not involved in the production of an acylhydrofolate from ergosterol [27]. Other studies showed that the Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activity was important for ergosterol synthesis and that it was involved in the synthesis of free a-arabinofuranosyl [28]. However, these studies were mostly focused on a function of this protein phosphatase, not its role in fungal growth. It is important to note that a-galactosidase (AFS) is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and it is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol and the conversion of ergosterol to acetyl-CoA [29,30]. Acetyl-CoA is a key component of the fungal cell membrane and is important for fungal survival.


## Methods
Study Area
This is a 1-year-old study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who developed opportunistic infections in Uganda during the first year after antiretroviral therapy in 2009. These patients were enrolled consecutively from April 2009 to December 2011. The study was conducted in the hospital teaching hospital, a tertiary hospital, in Kampala, Uganda, under the auspices of the National AIDS Control Program of the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology.


## Results
stipitis, which has a higher percentage of FgROS2 FgRA3, which is not in the same category of fungal FgRA2 FgRA4 FgRA5 FgRA6 FgRA7 FgRA8 FgRA9 and . oxysporum, which has a lower FgROS2 FgRA4 FgRA5 FgRA6 FgRA7 FgRA8, respectively [32].

In fungi, FgRA1, FgRA2, and FgROS2 FgRA3 were found to be in the same category, with the exception of P. stipitis, which has a higher percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is not in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. oxysporum, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. galactomannan, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. oxysporum, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. galactomannan, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. galactomannan, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F. galactomannan, which has a lower percentage of FgROS2 FgRA1, which is in the same category of fungi FgRA2 FgRA3, and F.


## Discussion
The majority of the proteins identified were involved in hyphal morphogenesi. Our results demonstrate that hyphal morphogenesis is a conserved gene conserved in the ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi.

At least three hyphal-related proteins were identified in the species-level genomes of Fusarium graminearum (Fusarium oxysporum) and Fusarium graminearum (Fusarium oxysporum) (Table S6). The first, the Fusarium oxysporum-like protein, was identified in the ascomycetous genus as a key regulator of fungal morphogenesis. A second protein, the Basidiomycete urokinase, was identified as a positive regulator of the fungal cell wall and was also found in other basidiomycetous fungi. The third protein, the Eurotiales urokinase, was identified as a regulator of hyphal-related genes, which is the case of other fungal urokinases.

In addition to the genes identified in the fungal species, the protein kinases that were identified in the species-level genomes were also found in the ascomycete fungi. For instance, the Aspergillus nidulans kinase was found as a regulator of the conidiation-related genes. In addition, the Aspergillus fumigatus-like kinase was found as a positive regulator of the fungal cell wall-related genes.

The urokinase genes were identified as fungal-specific proteins. The urokinase gene family includes a putative urokinase family (UvG) and an urokinase-like protein family (UvF) [16]. The UvG protein family was identified as a positive regulator of cell wall-related genes. The UvF protein family is a negative regulator of the cell wall-related genes. The UvF protein family was also identified as a negative regulator of the cell wall-related genes.

A total of eight genes (Fusarium spp., Aspergillus spp., U. maydis, U. hordei, and U.
