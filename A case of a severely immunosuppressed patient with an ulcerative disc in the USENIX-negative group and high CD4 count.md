## Abstract
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by both innate and adaptive immune cells. IL-17 possesses several functions in regulating disease, including inflammation. In this article, we review the role of IL-17 in the regulation of inflammatory responses and its involvement in leukopenia.

The inflammatory response is an integral part of the host's defense system. In the human leukocyte lineages, IL-17 has been shown to play a role in the resolution of various infectious insults, as well as in the regulation of inflammation and cancer. In contrast, the role of IL-17 in murine and model cells during leukopenia has been reported. In this review, we summarize the main IL-17 functions and compare their involvement in the regulation of leukocyte responses.

IL-17 plays a role in regulating inflammatory responses and in some infections, in addition to promoting the proliferation of leukocytes. IL-17 plays a role in regulating leukocyte polarization in response to changes in the host. IL-17-enriched microglial cells, activated by previous studies, were found to be a key group of cells in the early phase of leukopenia regulation.


## Introduction
 µmol/L was reported [9, 12. This case highlights that immunosuppression and/or defects in T cell function can cause poor outcomes with very limited efficacy and safety in the critically ill with an ulcerative disc. The authors should consider clarifying the role of cytokines in T cell function.

The manuscript is well written, and the conclusions are supported by the evidence. However, the conclusions are not supported by the evidence. The authors should consider re-reviewing the original manuscript or re-considering the original submission. The manuscript needs to be re-written accordingly.

Line 35: there is no word “bioactivity” in the manuscript. How do you define mitochondrial? Are you simply looking for the properties of the compound, or do you have the properties of the mitochondria?

Line 37: “immunosuppression” should be “immunosuppression”, not “immunosuppression”.

Line 143: the statement should be stated in the caption. "In this study, we conducted a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of QTc9 and Tc9A in rats and mice. The compound was tested at two concentrations: high dose of 200 mg QTc9/mouse inhalation suspension (10 mg/kg) and low dose of 100 mg QTc9/H_2O_2 suspension (10 mg/kg). Both compounds were administered orally. In the study area, QTc9/H_2O_2 was administered intravenously and the rats were treated with 200 mg of QTc9/mouse inhalation suspension (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, the anti-inflammatory activity of the compound was demonstrated in both high and low doses (10 mg/kg) by high dose of QTc9/mouse inhalation. The compound could be safely administered in low dose regimens and be administered to animals for treatment induction. In the present study, the compound was tested at a concentration of 100 mg/kg. The compound did not show any toxicity towards animals or humans. The anti-inflammatory activity of QTc9/QTc9A was demonstrated in both high and low doses (10 mg/kg) by high dose of QTc9/mouse inhalation.


## Methods
Study design
We studied the case of non-cancerous skin lesions that had been caused by C. gattii in the context of a clinical episode of dermatophytosis in a single patient, with a diagnosis of non-diseased skin.

All lesions were identified by the inclusion of an acute lesion of the lesion or the onset of the lesion, followed by a mechanical ventilation of the lesion with minor air bubbles, followed by a fresh examination of the lesion using a digital scanning electron microscope.

Patients were excluded if they had a skin lesion with clear superficial ulcer, that showed at least 1/3 of the lesion was free of visible bacterial or fungal infection, and that was larger than 1/3 of the lesion.

The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Hospital of Nanjing University and written informed consent was obtained.

Data collection
We collected data on demographic information, clinical characteristics, treatment decisions, surgical procedures, and antifungal therapies using the computerized data collection system.

Patients were categorized into three groups: (1) non-cancerous skin lesions with ulcer, (2) localized ulcer, and (3) non-cancerous skin lesions with inflammation, which was categorized as non-diseased skin lesions.

The treatment decisions were based on the guideline of the Clinical Research Ethics Bureau of the National People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the guideline of the American College of Dermatology (ACD).

Statistical analysis
All data were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).


## Results
The two patients had a bilateral IFI in the USENIX-negative group and a severe ulcerative disc in the USENIX-positive group, respectivel. The patients were from an endemic area of Gabon and a previously healthy patient. The patient presented with multiple nerve palsies, spleen lesions, and multiple brain abscesses. The CNS lesions included multiple sclerosis and a neurosyphilis. No abscesses were found in the CNS lesions. The patient also presented with multiple brain abscesses. The abscesses were not consistent with a diagnosis of neurosyphilis and included the presence of neurosyphilis in the patient, rather than a CNS lesions. There were no signs of immunosuppression or neurological sequelae in the CNS lesions.

Neuronal lesions were not present in the CNS lesions. The patient had no previous known neurological disease. The lesions consisted of several aggregated inflammatory lesions in the CNS and the CNS lesions of multiple lesions. No signs of neurological sequelae were found in the CNS lesions. The lesions consisted of multiple inflammatory lesions in the CNS, including a bilateral brain abscess in the CNS lesions, and multiple lesions in the CNS. The lesions were not consistent with a diagnosis of neurosyphilis and were not consistent with a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. The CNS lesions were not consistent with a diagnosis of neurosyphilis and the CNS lesions had multiple lesions.

3.3. Survival and Limitation of NPIs
The median survival was 8 days (range: 4-21). The median NPI was 1 (range: 1.5-2.2) NPI per patient. The median NPI per patient was 5.4 (range: 3.4-9.7) NPI per year (2013-2014). The median NPI per year was 1.1 (range: 0.4-3.2) NPI per 100 patient years. The median NPI per patient was significantly higher than the median NPI per year (P < 0.001).

For the NPI subgroup, a significant difference was found in both groups (P < 0.001) (Table 2). The median NPI was 1 (range: 0.4-2.2) NPI per 100 patient years. The median NPI per year was significantly higher than the median NPI per year (P < 0.001) (Table 2).

## Discussion
The findings presented here present evidence that the in vivo activity of A. fumigatus is controlled by genetic factors that are both conserved and divergent. Many of the genetic mechanisms involved in the control of A. fumigatus pathogenicity have been previously demonstrated to be involved in the mating-type locus, A.
