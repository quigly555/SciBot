## Abstract
The sessile fungus Aspergillus niger encounters a range of environmental challenges in the growing population. Surface metal ionizing radiation (SIR) from radioactive, biodegradative, and oxidizing agents or heavy metals can abate the resistance of the fungus. In this study, we show that A. niger sessile metal ionizing radiation (radioactive or nonradioactive) and biodegradative conditions can abate the resistance of this fungal to a variety of heavy metals, with the limits of resistance being in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 µM. To demonstrate the efficiency of A. niger resistance, we generated heat-killed A. niger strain K279 as a decoctive metal ion (CDR) deco, and screened it for its ability to resist metal ion trapping and oxidizing agents. We found that K279CDR deco treated with copper (orf12) was much more effective than the CDR treated with copper-, indicating that the treatment of A. niger with a CDR deco might be an efficient way to combat the radiation generated by the metal ion. Furthermore, we discovered that treatment with the CDR deco strain conferred a resistance buffered by the presence of the metal ion, and the CDR deco strain was also more resistant to the heavy metal ionizing radiation as compared to the control strain. Taken together, our results reveal that A. niger strain can tolerate a variety of heavy metals and has the capability to overcome these environmental challenges.


## Introduction
Talaromyces marneffei (formerly Penicillium marneffei) is an emerging fungal pathogen that causes serious skin infections in immunocompromised patients, including those with haematological disorders such as sarcoidosis or haematologic malignancies [1]. Currently, T. marneffei is the third most common fungal pathogen of human skin infections, after Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. [2, 3]. In particular, T. marneffei is characterized by its thermally dimorphic lifestyle, which produces multi-layered, darkly pigmented macroconidia [4, 5]. The macrophages (M) phagocytes secrete a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to host defense [6, 7]. The macrophage phagocyte subset is activated in response to phagocytes by a Th1-mediated innate immune response, followed by a Th2-mediated immune response. The Th2 response promotes the clearance of the phagocytes and the release of macrophage-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) [8]. Macrophages are the first line of defense against T. marneffei. In this phagocyte subset, macrophages acquire ROS through their action on phagocytes, namely the ROS scavenging enzymes (ROS), which produce ROS-degrading enzymes (Rd) [9, 10].


## Methods
nidulans [20. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the transcription factor SKN7 in A. nidulans.

N. benthamiana, D. hansenii, and F. solani were cultured in PDA broth at 28 °C for 24 h with shaking. The cells were harvested, washed in sterile PBS, and lysed by the addition of 2 ml of sterile 0.01% Tween 80. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was measured by Bradford [20] using the Bradford method (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.

Western blot
The supernatant of the culture was transferred to a NTA-tube, and the protein concentration was measured using Bradford [20] using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.

RNA-Seq
The RNA was extracted from the fungal cells according to the method described by Zheng et al. [20]. The RNA concentration was measured using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The total RNA amount was determined using the RNA Nano 6000 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop 2000. The RNA quality was checked using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The cDNA library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the help of DNase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan® Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The gene expression level was expressed as the Ct value of <U+0394>fribase from A. nidulans.


## Results
albican. As shown in Fig 5, the mycelial growth of H99 was significantly increased in the presence of SKN7 (Fig 5A). In contrast, the host mycelial growth of H99 did not increase the amount of conidia produced by H99 at the time of the experiments, indicating that SKN7 is not responsible for the host mycelial growth.

In addition, we assessed the growth of H99 in the presence of SKN7. As shown in Fig 5B, the H99 strain exhibited wild-type levels of virulence, but the mycelial growth of H99 was significantly reduced in the presence of SKN7. In contrast, the virulence of H99 was restored by treatment with SKN7, demonstrating that H99 is not involved in host virulence. To further investigate the role of SKN7 in host virulence, we tested the effect of SKN7 in S. cerevisiae. As shown in Fig 6, the S. cerevisiae strain exhibited wild-type levels of virulence in the presence of SKN7. However, the S. cerevisiae strain exhibited a slightly reduced virulence in the presence of SKN7 (Fig 6). These results suggest that the two SKN7 proteins are not solely responsible for the host virulence of H99.

A previous study has demonstrated that SKN7 is involved in the initiation of the host immune response in C. albicans [26]. To test whether the two proteins share similar roles in the host response, we assessed the growth of the two H99 strains in the presence of SKN7. As shown in Fig 7, the H99 strain exhibited a wild-type level of virulence in the presence of SKN7. These results suggest that the two proteins share similar roles in the host response in C. albicans.

SKN7 is required for the proper assembly of the fungal cell wall in C. albicans

We next sought to determine whether the two SKN7 proteins also regulate the cell wall architecture in C. albicans. To do this, we generated a strain with a deletion of both SKN7 and SKN7-CAA, respectively.


## Discussion
In the present study, the SKN7 homologue in . albicans is involved in the adaptation of C. albicans to host-pathogen interactions. We identified and characterized SKN7 in C. albicans as a phosphatase involved in the stress response and virulence. SKN7 is involved in the biosynthesis of cellulose and lignin, which are components of the cellulose-based cell wall (CWR) of plants. It has been shown that the cell wall is a crucial virulence factor for C. albicans, and it is a requirement for the successful infection of plants by pathogenic fungi [55]. However, our results revealed that SKN7 in C. albicans was different from that in C. albicans, and that its phosphatase activity was significantly higher in C. albicans. These findings provide a novel mechanism to explain the phosphatase activity in C. albicans.

Our results showed that SKN7 is a member of the membrane-bound phosphatase CgKBP12. CgKBP12 is a membrane-binding protein that plays a key role in cell wall biogenesis and the initiation of cell wall biosynthesis. SKN7 is also a GTP-binding protein and homologs in C. albicans were identified as well as the homologs in C. dubliniensis. GTP-binding protein (Gbp) is a second messenger that is required for the synthesis of GTP, which is important for cell wall biogenesis. CgGbp is a cell wall-binding protein that is required for the cell wall integrity, cell wall biosynthesis and the activation of chitin synthase (CKS) and mannosyl transferase (MNT) pathways [56]. SKN7 phosphatase activity was significantly higher in C. dubliniensis. Gbp is one of the receptors for GTP-binding proteins and is involved in cell wall biogenesis and in chitin synthesis [57]. SKN7 in C. albicans is the first GTP-binding protein in C. albicans, and it has been demonstrated that Gbp plays a role in the biosynthesis of GTP [58]. SKN7 activity is also involved in the cell wall integrity and chitin synthesis in C. albicans [59]. SKN7 in C.
