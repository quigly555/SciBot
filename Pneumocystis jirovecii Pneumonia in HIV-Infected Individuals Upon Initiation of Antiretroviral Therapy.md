Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Two hundred and eighteen patients were enrolled (mean age: 5.8 years, median age: 39 years). The primary endpoint was an acute neurological complication (defined as venous thromboembolism (VT) within 6 months from the primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints were the score of all-cause mortality within 6 months from the primary endpoint and the outcome at the end of the follow-up 2 (i.e. acute VTE [five pathological events occurring >12 months after the primary endpoint]) and 3 (i.e. VTE-driven VTE-related [five pathological events occurring at the end of the primary endpoint]) within 6 months from the primary endpoint. The treatment arms of VT were treated according to the Preferred Reporting Items Odds (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary endpoint. In the secondary analysis, we used univariate and multivariate Cox models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and HIV seroconversion.

In total, 183 adult patients met the primary endpoint of VT, and 32 non-survivors met the primary endpoint of VT. The primary endpoint included VT in 55/183 (34.5%) non-survivors and VT in 47/183 (48.8%) adultuates. The treatment arms of VT were treated according to the same ORs as in the multivariate analysis (adjusted OR: 1.08; 95%CI: 1.02-2.23; 95%CI: 1.07-2.04; P = 0.037). In the adjusted analysis, all-cause mortality in patients treated with all-cause mortality (OR: 2.76; 95%CI: 1.29-4.67; P = 0.005) was associated with increased all-cause mortality within 6 months from the primary endpoint.

The prevalence of acute VTE-related vasculopathy, angiocardial infarction, and cardiovascular events in HIV-infected adults in Brazil was 5.6% and 3.7% respectively. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality were lower CD4+ T-cell counts (OR 2.30; 95%CI: 1.63-3.46; P = 0.005).


## Introduction
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasitic protozoan, which causes toxoplasmosis in humans. It is particularly common in the developing countries and especially in Africa where it is the third most common cause of human disease [1].

The genetic code of T. gondii is highly conserved throughout the parasite’s life cycle, with about 50% of mutations in the coding genes encoding tgT and tgNA1 translated into mRNA, and 5-10% of tgA and tgD trans transcripts are expressed in eukaryotic animal cells, suggesting that this parasite has evolved several genes to encode alternative splicing strategies [2, 3]. The alternative splicing pathways are grouped into eight, named alternative splicing-related (ASEs), and eight, named alternative splicing-specific (ASE-s). Ase1 and tgT are the most abundant genes of the alternative splicing-related genes, while tgBA and tgBAA are the least expressed genes [4].

## Results
and/or Cryptococcus sp. In our study, our group developed a high-confidence method to test the efficacy of topical antiretroviral therapy for cryptococcal infections (Fig 1A). The antiretroviral therapy was compared with the other methods used to evaluate the efficacy of different types of antiretroviral therapy. Results showed that HIV-infected individuals showed high susceptibility to both fluconazole and amphotericin B and low susceptibility to flucytosin and amphotericin B (Fig 1B). These results indicated that HIV-infected individuals were more susceptible to antiretroviral therapy for cryptococcal infection.

Cryptococcal Infection Is Associated With Higher Morbidity and Hemorrhage Rates
In order to evaluate the relation of cryptococcal infection with mortality and morbidity, we evaluated the proportion of cryptococcal organisms in the blood and kidney of HIV-infected individuals. The proportion of cryptococcal organisms in the blood was highest in the HIV-infected individuals (57.5%), followed by HIV-negative individuals (44.8%), and then by HIV-positive individuals (30.0%) (Fig 2). The mean absolute cryptococcal counts were 4.3 × 10^5 cells/ml in the kidney and 3.2 × 10^5 cells/ml in the blood, respectively. The survival rate of the HIV-infected individuals was 14.9% and that of the HIV-negative individuals was 2.5%. The clinical outcome of the HIV-infected individuals was more variable (Fig 2). The mean survival rate of the HIV-infected individuals was 28.3%. HIV-negative individuals had significantly lower mortality rate (12.2% and 4.3%, respectively) and higher hemorrhage rate (18.3%) than the HIV-negative individuals (18.5%). These results indicated that the proportion of cryptococcal organisms in the blood and kidney was higher in HIV-infected individuals.


## Discussion
Although the latter was originally described in a patient with HIV in 1993, since then, Pneumocystis jirovecii has been identified in a large number of cases (5-10. It is possible that Pneumocystis jirovecii was misdiagnosed in this patient and was successfully treated, even though Pneumocystis jirovecii was clinically indistinguishable from pneumocystis pneumonia.

Pneumocystis pneumonia was diagnosed in this case by sputum smear, a routine and rapid test for pneumocystis pneumonia. In addition, culture and serology are essential to confirm the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia in this patient was confirmed by culture, serology, and by serology and PCR. The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia in this patient was confirmed by serology and PCR, which demonstrated the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia.

The pneumocystis pneumonia in this case was diagnosed by serology, PCR and serology. The serology results were confirmed by serology and PCR, which confirmed the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia.

The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia is highly specific. Only a few case reports have been published in the English language, and this is the first report of pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-Infected Individuals. However, cases have been reported in which pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in the absence of HIV infection. In one report, a case of pneumocystis pneumonia was diagnosed in HIV-Infected Individuals and diagnosed by serology, PCR, and serology. The case was then treated with antiviral therapy and the patient was discharged from ICU with neurological deficits. The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia was confirmed by PCR, serology, and serology.

The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia has been previously reported in HIV-Infected Individuals (6, 7). A case report by Vilaria G. Patterson and colleagues in HIV-Infected Individuals (7) was also reported in which a case of pneumocystis pneumonia was diagnosed by serology, PCR, and serology. The case was then treated with antiviral therapy and the patient was discharged from ICU with neurological deficits. The diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia in this patient was confirmed by serology, PCR, and serology.
