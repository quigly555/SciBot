## Abstract
Candida glabrata is a leading opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans, particularly in enteroviruses and echinocandin-resistant Candida albicans. Its high resistance to antifungals and rapid emergence as multidrug-resistant isolates necessitates the identification of novel antifungal targets. To identify these targets, we screened Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a panel of 1,8-dihydroxygranulysin (SDG) antifungal agents for detection of SDG binding. SDG activity and susceptibility assays confirmed their synergistic activity against C. glabrata, a resistant model of candida.

Candida glabrata is a fungal pathogen that is increasingly recognized as a cause of life-threatening infections in humans. Its antifungal arsenal contains diverse antifungal drugs, from fluconazole to caspofungin. These classes of antifungals are largely unknown in the human body, and there is a pressing need for developing new antifungal options to combat this fungal pathogen.


## Introduction
While the latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that immune-mediated pathogenicity is associated with an increase in the frequency of cryptococcal infections in susceptible animals [19], the former has been attributed to a reduction in the antifungal drug susceptibility of . neoformans, which in turn led to the suggestion that cryptococcal infections may be tolerable without antifungal therapy.

Given the reduction in antifungal susceptibility of C. neoformans to azoles and fluconazole, the association of C. neoformans with cryptococcal infections has been speculated for some time [15]. Azoles are thought to inhibit ergosterol synthesis, which is a key sterol in the biosynthesis of ergosterol. However, the role of azoles in cryptococcal infections is still controversial [16]. The significant potency of the triazoles against cryptococcal infections in animals is in part due to the high enzyme activity of ergosterol synthesis, which is thought to be essential for ergosterol synthesis [15], [31].

The presence of antifungal activity in C. neoformans is not limited to the yeast. The pathogenicity of C. neoformans is also closely related to the virulence of other fungi [32]. In fact, C. neoformans is known to cause multiple invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, including fatal pulmonary aspergillosis (21.7%) and aspergilloma (24.1%), disseminated histoplasmosis (8.5%), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (3.1%), and pulmonary otitis media (0.93%) [4], [33]-[35].

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro antifungal activity of two antifungal agents, cycloserine B (ccl-B) and cyclobutyl-2-(3H)-dien-dian-1-ol) and cyclobutyl-2-(3H)-dien-dien-ol) and cyclobutyl-3-(4H)-dien-dien-ol) and cyclobutyl-3-(4H)-dien-ol) against cryptococcal strains obtained from the lungs of mice infected with wild-type C. neoformans and C. gattii. C.


## Methods
The test agent was a range of concentrations (.125-64 µg/mL) of each tested compound. The MICs of the tested compounds were defined as the lowest concentration of drug that completely inhibited growth compared with the control [23]. The MICs were determined for all filamentous fungi as described previously [28].

The MICs were also determined for the tested compounds against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Salmonella typhimurium. The tests were performed in 96-well plates and read at the absorbance of a microplate reader at 48 h, at which the MIC of the tested compound was 0.25 µg/mL. The concentrations of the tested compounds were as follows: 2-(1-phenyl)-2-(3-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-1,3-diphenyl)-4-hydroxy-4,5,5-dimethoxybenzamide, 0.1 µg/mL; 2-(1-phenyl)-2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-1,3-diphenyl)-4,5,5-dimethoxybenzamide, 0.1 µg/mL; 2-(1-phenyl)-2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-1,3-diphenyl)-4-hydroxy-4,5,5-dimethoxybenzamide, 0.1 µg/mL; 3-(1-phenyl)-3-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-1,3-diphenyl)-4,5-dimethoxybenzamide, 0.1 µg/mL. The microplates were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 h. The MICs of each compound were defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited growth. The MIC of the tested compounds against Cryptococcus neoformans was the lowest concentration of compound that completely inhibited growth, as previously reported [27].

The MICs of the tested compounds against the pathogenic microorganisms were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 method [29]. The test agent was a range of concentrations (0.


## Results

## Discussion
All of the patients received amphotericin B plus micafungin for 24 . All of the patients had a median CD4 cell count of 6.3 and had a median survival of 16.6 days. All of the patients received amphotericin B plus micafungin for 24 h. All of the patients received micafungin for 24 h. All of the patients received amphotericin B plus micafungin for 24 h.

Antifungal Chemosensitization in Animals Is Likely to Induce a Different Treatment of Cryptococcus
The antifungal chemosensitization of cryptococcal cells was not observed in vitro. However, in our study, the chemosensitization was observed in vitro. The survival of animals treated with amphotericin B plus micafungin was significantly reduced compared to the survival of animals treated with fluconazole plus fluconazole. This suggests that amphotericin B plus micafungin is more potent in vitro than fluconazole.

In vitro antifungal chemosensitization of Cryptococcus species was not observed in vitro. However, in our study, the chemosensitization was observed in vitro. The survival of animals treated with amphotericin B plus micafungin was significantly reduced compared to the survival of animals treated with fluconazole plus fluconazole. This suggests that amphotericin B plus micafungin is more potent in vitro than fluconazole.
