## Abstract
The cell wall of Candida albicans contains polysaccharides, including glycoproteins, chelating and hydrolases. Polysaccharides play important roles in interaction with the host and the immune system. The glycoprotein glucan synthase, GlcA, has been characterized as an encapsulated cell wall GTPase with an N-terminal domain and is a target of the human oral mycobacterium Acanthamoeba castellanii. A previous study characterized the transcriptional profile of GlcA during host-pathogen interaction. Here we report a detailed profile of GlcA in the glucuronide metabolite transcripts of C. albicans, and identify two putative transcription factors, Jep and TPK. A combination of transcription factors and the transcriptomic analysis of the cells affected cell wall polysaccharides was compared. A total of 353 differentially expressed genes were identified. The transcripts were further grouped using multi-gene analysis and screened for transcripts whose protein domains contained homopolymer sequences. The analysis of the differential expression patterns between the differentially expressed transcripts revealed several differential residues that are important for the differential regulation of polysaccharides. These results add new information on the involvement of polysaccharides in cell wall-related processes and suggest their potential to be exploited for the synthesis of novel polysaccharides and biopesticides.


## Introduction
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a complex group of disorders characterized by progressive dysfunction of the immune system, and the number of patients with IBD has increased over the past 20 years (1,2). The various clinical syndromes are divided into three subtypes: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and IBD.

Crohn's disease (CD) is an intestinal disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the mucosal surface of the intestinal mucosa, which causes chronic intestinal inflammation, which leads to Crohn's disease (CD). CD is characterized by the involvement of several epithelial cells, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. CD is classified into two types: Type I is characterized by the presence of aberrant T-cell responses, and is characterized by the activation of T cells to the Th1/Th2 type response. In contrast, Type II and III disorders are characterized by the presence of aberrant Th17/Th1 response and the activation of the Th2/Th17 response. In contrast, Type I disorders are characterized by the presence of aberrant Th1/Th2 responses and the activation of Th17/Th17 response. The ability of CD to induce an adaptive immune response is mediated by the immune system itself.

CD is also known as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CDI). Both are diseases that are caused by the systemic inflammatory response pathway of the host. CD presents different clinical manifestations, such as a progressive inflammatory disease, chronic inflammation, and juvenile dysmorphism. The CDI is characterized by the presence of the juvenile inflammatory phenotype. The inflammatory response is triggered by the production of T-lytic cells, which secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and interleukin (IL-12), which are responsible for the activation of T cells. The results of the T cell activation program are dependent on the T cell type. CD is characterized by the production of Th2/Th17 cells, which secrete chemokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-21, and CCL2.


## Methods
athogensafet.gov/en/en- checklist) was downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website (http://www.cdc.gov/noaa/). The checklist includes four categories of indicator insects, three species of cyclosporine-active and one species of cyclosporine-active fungi. One category of indicator insect is considered to be ‘high’ indicator insect.

The database contains more than 18,000 species and information about their ecological niche, evolutionary history, ecological system, and functional aspects was obtained from an ongoing research project [35]. In addition, taxonomic novelties were also added to the database. For instance, the comparative species database (CPC) [36] contains over 15,000 species and information about the taxonomic species were obtained from a recent publication [37].

Comparison of biological function of the different indicator insects was carried out using the statistical program GraphPad Prism (version 5.00.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). In addition, a comparison of the biological function of different indicators was also carried out using the comparative species database. The relative function of each indicator insect was also compared by comparing their relative abundance at different time points, based on a previous analysis [38].

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the means ± SD. The statistical significance of the differences between the groups was calculated using the Fisher’s exact test.

Insect-HPC analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To identify the pathogen-host interaction, we performed a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) using STATA software (version 5.1; STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The two-way ANOVA was used to examine the significant changes in the effect of the pathogens on the pathogen-host interactions, as well as their interaction and the pathogens’ interaction. The two-way ANOVA was followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the online version of PAUP 4.0b11 (www.paup.org/phylo/) [38]. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method implemented in PAUP 4.


## Results
The checklist consists of a complete annotation of all the genomes used for this study, including the number of fungal genomes and the number of genome-scale insect.

The checklist consists of a table of all the entries, with links to the literature.


## Discussion

A large number of insect-specific gene losses and gains, such as the gene loss and gain events described above, occur in the same insect-famil. For example, gene losses associated with the ncRNA cluster are common among the nine insect groups studied here. There are multiple gene losses and gains in the insect-specific gene pool, and one gene loss is related to the lpk2 gene, which encodes a conserved protein with a downstream effector for the Lpk2-type ATPase in the A. nidulans MAPK pathway. In contrast, gene gains associated with the insect-specific gene cluster are more frequent in the other insect groups (Table S1). For example, genes that encode lpk2 (A. nidulans, S. macrospora), a lopk2 (A. nidulans) and a aa-1 (A. nidulans) protein (S. macrospora) are common in the insect-specific gene pool, but are less frequently in the insect-specific gene pool of the insect-family Dictyostelium (Table S1).

Another example is the gene loss and gain event related to the core metabolism of the insect-specific gene pool (Table S1). The gene loss and gain events are similar to gene losses and gains in the insect-specific gene pool, but are different from gene losses and gains in the insect-family Dictyostelium. There are four genes that encode a-amylase (A. nidulans), which is a major enzyme in the a-1-amylase pathway (A. fumigatus). It is a common gene in the insect-specific gene pool of the insect-family Dictyostelium, but not in the insect-specific gene pool of the insect-family Dictyostelium. The gene loss and gain events in the insect-specific gene pool are similar to gene losses and gains in the insect-family Dictyostelium, but differ from gene losses and gains in the insect-family Dictyostelium.
