## Abstract
Intestinal fungi play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many microbial pathogens, and have been considered as the most prominent target of antimicrobials. Their discovery as antimicrobials has resulted in a lot of discovery in the field of microbial pathogenesis, and in particular in the recent years with their discovery as a potent antimicrobial agent. Candida albicans, one of the most important opportunistic fungal pathogens of humans, is one of the most commonly identified opportunistic microorganisms in the intestinal tract of people with enteritis or colitis. In this review we will focus on the recent advances in the search of new therapeutic agents which could be applied as potent antimicrobials against this pathogen. The current literature shows that the antifungal properties of C. albicans are mainly due to its ability to thrive in wide environmental niches, and to survive in different kinds of food and various kinds of water, and this adaptation is due to the high efficiency of the fungus in resisting being isolated from diverse ecological niches. The antimicrobial properties of this organism might be attributed to its ability to adapt and overcome different stresses in different food and drink sources, and this adaptation could be adapted in other organisms, for example, by forming microorganisms of interest such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. In this review, we first briefly describe the current picture of antimicrobial resistance and the important controversies surrounding antimicrobial-natural products products and their use as antimycotics. We then describe the main challenges that confront antimycotics and their attempts to overcome it and their potential as therapeutic agents. Finally, we describe the antimicrobial mechanisms of antifungal-resistant strains and the advances in developing new molecules with novel mechanisms of action.


## Introduction
Macrophages play an important role in inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and the development of autoimmune diseases [1]. Macrophages play a key role in tissue remodelling, signal transduction, and tissue repair in inflammation, and regulate many processes including the generation of tissue damage and graft-versus-host disease, regeneration of damaged tissues, and anti-inflammatory response [2]. Macrophages can be divided into two main subtypes: pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages. The former can be classified as the type I and the type II macrophages. Macrophages are divided into two main subsets: the resident macrophages and non-inflammation-depleted macrophages. Macrophages are classified as non-inflammatory macrophages and macrophage-derived cytokines. Macrophage-associated immune cells (MALT) are defined as cells that present an acute inflammatory infiltrate after the injury of the macrophage, and are thus considered to be macrophage-derived cytokines, which are recognized by CD4 and CD8 T cells [3]. Macrophages are thought to be recruited to sites of injury and can differentiate into different subtypes of macrophages: monocytes/macrophages (MALT) and macrophages (MALT-/-). MALT-/- macrophages are distinguished from MALT-/- macrophages by their ability to differentiate into macrophage-specific T cells. A key cytokine expressed by macrophages is IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-6. Macrophages may also express IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12. Both IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-6 are activated in vitro and in vivo [4, 5]. Macrophages are also induced to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12, in vitro [6, 7]. The cell surface receptors (CRs) on which MALT cells differentiate and differentiate, such as IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12, are also recognized by MALT cells.


## Methods

Kuraishiaoga s. in Japan
The Kuraishiaoga sp. is considered a mature fauna of the Weltwendia in Japan. The main lineages and phylogenetic relationships of Kuraishiaoga sp. and the Weltwendia species are presented in Table 1.

Sporothrix sp. in Japan
The Sporothrix sp. is considered to be a fully developed fauna in Japan. Sporothrix sp. is considered a major fauna in Japan. Sporothrix sp. has been identified as the sister fauna of the Weltwendia in Japan. Sporothrix sp. is considered to be the sister fauna to the Weltwendia species. Sporothrix sp. is considered to be a fully developed fauna in Japan. Sporothrix sp. has been identified as the sister fauna to the Weltwendia species. Sporothrix sp. is considered to be a fully developed fauna in Japan. Sporothrix sp. has been identified as the sister fauna to the Seltwendia species.

Isolate 21-210-9. Symptomatic aspergillosis of the Weltwendia
A. fumigatus, the aspergillosis of the Weltwendia in the Japanese language is considered a severe aspergillosis in Japan. This was considered to be the major reason for its isolation in Japan. The isolation of A. fumigatus was considered to be a severe aspergillosis in Japan. A. fumigatus was a clinical isolate in Japan. The treatment of the A. fumigatus aspergillosis was considered to be a good treatment in Japan.

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). The statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test. The A-test was performed by non-parametric test with the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).


## Results

Kuraishiaoga . lat. is described from Japan as Kuraishiaoga sp. and based on the phylogenetic analysis and morphological characters (Fig 1). It was first described by Sato (1923) as a Japanese species of Kuraishiaoga and the type species was named Kuraishia. Kuraishiaoga s. lat. is also described as having fishici-branch (Fig 1).
