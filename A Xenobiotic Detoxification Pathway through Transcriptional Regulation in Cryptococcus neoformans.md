## Abstract
To investigate the occurrence of Pseudallescheria oryzae in two-year-old infants vaccinated with a cotrimoxazole-susceptible strain of PMV, and the effect of this compound on the development of lung epithelial cells, pneumatology slide and spleen.

Two-year-old infants were vaccinated with a cotrimoxazole-susceptible PMV strain of PMV, and the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was evaluated.

The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in two-year-old infants was evaluated.

A total of 556 episodes of PMA were recorded in 56 episodes of PBS, and 156 episodes of PMA in 262 PMA. The PMA activity of the PMA-producing cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.

A total of 556 episodes of PMA were recorded in 56 episodes of PBS. The PMA-producing cells were located in 57 of 262 episodes of PMA. The number of episodes of PMA required to produce a pulmonary mass was higher in the PMA-vaccinated group (236 vs 177 episodes) and in the PMA-incompetent group (111 vs 153 episodes). The percentage of episodes requiring special staining was higher in the PMA-incompetent group (39 vs 39 episodes) than in the PMA-incompetent group (22 vs 18 episodes). The number of PMA episodes required to produce a lung mass increased with the number of coccidioidomycosis episodes (6 vs. 22 episodes) in the PMA-incompetent group (36 vs 39 episodes).

The incidence of PMA-incompetent and PMA-incompetent children was higher in the PMA-incompetent group than in the PMA-incompetent group. In contrast, the incidence of PMA-incompetent children was higher in the PMA-incompetent group than in the PMA-incompetent group.


## Introduction
neoformans)
The filamentous fungus . neoformans undergoes a morphological switch from yeast to hyphae, and from there to an infection structure called conidiophore (C. neoformans) is formed by a complex of conidiophore-associated cells. The switch is linked to the transcriptional activation of cAMP-PKA pathway that is activated by cGAS (GAS kinase) in the vacuole. cGAS is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates a cAMP/PKA pathway to produce cGAS, which binds to the promoter of the target genes. cGAS and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgA) are two key proteins that control the transcription of C. neoformans genes involved in virulence [11,12]. cGAS acts as a second G protein-coupled receptor that activates cGAS kinase and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) to activate cGAS kinase. cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgAPK) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by cGAS kinase and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) [13,14]. cGAS also binds to cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgAPK) and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) [15]. cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgAPK) is activated by cGAS kinase and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) [16]. cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) is activated by cGAS kinase and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) [17]. cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) is activated by cGAS kinase and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) [18].

The transcription factor STAT6 is a member of the cGAS family of cGAS-activated protein kinases [19]. It activates the cGAS and cGAS-activated protein kinase (CgK) in the promoters of target genes, such as those encoding secreted proteins such as PKS1, ROP1, and GRA1.


## Methods
grubii. For the first time, we tested the RNAi gene for expression in a Cryptococcus neoformans strain lacking the C. neoformans H99 gene. The assay was performed by colony PCR. The PCR reaction mixture included 10 µl of 10× Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 µl of each forward and reverse primer, 1 µl of 2 µmol of dNTP mix, 1 µl of 0.5 mM MgCl_2, 1 µl of ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China), and 3 µl of DNA template. The reaction was performed in a Rotor-Gene Q-TOF Dissociation Buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the samples were diluted to a concentration of 1×10^7 cells/ml. The reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The reaction was completed in a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C. The RNAi gene was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.1% agarose. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the RNAi gene was assigned to the representative gene of the housekeeping gene GAPDH (CNAG_057).

For the second time, we used the same method to assess expression levels of the transcriptome. The assay was performed by colony PCR. The PCR reaction mixture included 10 µl of 2× Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 µl of 5× Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1 µl of RNase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in a final volume of 1 ml of 0.1% agarose. The reaction was performed in a Rotor-Gene Q-TOF Dissociation Buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the samples were diluted to a concentration of 1×10^6 cells/ml.


## Results
We identified a total of 22 conserved genes (Table S1) that have been shown to be essential for protein-protein interactions (16, 25, 27. These genes were selected based on their close association to vacuolar proteolysis in the last common ancestor of Cryptococcus and S. cerevisiae, which is a model organism for studying the role of vacuolar proteolysis in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans (15, 17).

A. fumigatus has a conserved vacuolar proteolysis pathway that involves proteolysis of a protein to a vacuole. We found that a conserved vacuolar proteolysis pathway was required for the efficient degradation of the vacuole in A. fumigatus (Fig 4A and B). We also identified a large number of conserved genes required for vacuolar proteolysis in A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae, including a transmembrane transporter and a vacuolar glyoxylase. We identified a conserved set of genes required for vacuolar proteolysis in A. fumigatus (Fig 4C). We identified a conserved set of genes required for vacuolar proteolysis in A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae, including a vacuolar protease and a vacuolar-to-vacuolar transition domain (Fig 4D and E). We identified a conserved set of genes required for vacuolar proteolysis in A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae, including a vacuolar-to-vacuolar transition domain and a vacuolar-to-vacuolar transition domain (Fig 4D and E).

A. fumigatus contributes to the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of cryptococcosis
In addition to the role of vacuolar proteolysis in pathogenesis, the fungus is also known to be an important pathogen in humans and mice. We previously identified a role for A. fumigatus in virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection (9, 10). Therefore, we examined the virulence of A.


## Discussion

We found that the expression of genes involved in cell wall integrity and proteolytic degradation was significantly induced during infectio. In contrast to the wild-type C. neoformans, the transcript levels of three putative transcription factors, FgTyr1, FgGAP1 and FgGAP2, which are present in the wild-type strain, were significantly down-regulated during infection. FgGAP1 is a transcription factor that is critical for cell wall integrity and for virulence in C. neoformans [63]. The FgGAP2 gene encodes a protein that is up-regulated in the C. neoformans strain-infected mutant and in the wild-type strain at later time points. In addition to its role in cell wall integrity, FgGAP2 is a putative serine/threonine protein kinase involved in stress response and protein folding in C. neoformans [64]. The FgTyr1 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the wild-type and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP2 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP1 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP2 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP3 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP4 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP5 gene encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection.

FgGAP1 encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP2 encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection. The FgGAP3 encodes a protein that is expressed in both the infected and the infected mutant during C. neoformans infection.
