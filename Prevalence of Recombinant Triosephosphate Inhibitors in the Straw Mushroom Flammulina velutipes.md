## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii has a worldwide distribution and is responsible for an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis. As the infection rate of this species has increased in endemic regions, the need for more effective methods for the treatment of cryptococcosis is felt. The cryptococcal strain XLR was created to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) by targeting the C-terminus of CCR2, a protein expressed in fungal cell wall and inducing an antivirulence effect. A two-step methodology was used in the two-dimensional gel immunoprecipitation approach, collecting C. gattii cells in serum or cerebrospinal fluid and exposing C.


## Introduction
The use of yeast to produce drugs has been developed to be a safer alternative to conventional culture-dependent methods (Myers et al., 2006). Sterols are glycoproteins of fungal cell membranes and are recognized by the glycosyltransferase (GT) enzyme family of proteins. Both yeast and all other yeast species have these enzymes for the formation of glycoproteins, which are widely distributed in nature, being found in fungi, bacteria, plants and invertebrates. These enzymes include the transferase, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, phospholipase, and proteinases.


## Methods
 2008. The integrity of the RNA was checked by an agarose gel electrophoresis, and the RNA concentration was measured at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The reactions were performed in triplicate, and an average of three biological replicates was analyzed. The quantification efficiency was calculated using the following formula: (Gene Ontology/Functional) × 100.

Protein quantification
For quantification of mRNA, 0.5 µg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with the TURBO DNA TUTORM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The reaction was performed in a 25 µL reaction volume containing 0.5 µL of 3 mM of each dNTP, 1 µL of 2 × RNase and 0.5 µL of cDNA. The reaction was performed in a Veriti 96-well plate with Quant-iT™ 96-well (Bioline, Tianjin, China) (0.5 µM cDNase; 1 µM of each dNTP; 0.5 µM of each dNTP) and a C_T probe (1 µM of each dNTP) in a final volume of 20 µL. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 25 °C, respectively, in a volume of 25 µL. The reaction was performed in a Veriti 96-well plate with Quant-iT™ 96-well (Bioline, Tianjin, China) (0.5 µM cDNase; 1 µM of each dNTP; 0.5 µM of each dNTP) and a C_T probe (1 µM cDNase; 1 µM of each dNTP). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 25 °C, respectively, in a volume of 25 µL.


## Results
FLA MIC_50 values ranged from .25 to 0.5 µg/ml for the strains selected for their susceptibility to FLA. The MIC_50 values of the new isolates were 3-fold higher than that of the original control strains. FLA MIC_50 values were >3 µg/ml for the strains selected for their susceptibility to FLA. The isolates also had a higher MIC_50 value of FLA than the original control strains.

3.3. Antifungal Activity of the Newly designed Fungicide
To determine whether new sulfone sulfate fungicides are effective against the fungus, the MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were tested against the FLA of the new strain. As shown in Figure 5, the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were highly active against the FLA. The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were also >3 µg/ml for all strains tested.

3.4. MIC_50 of the New Fungicide
The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were higher than the original control strains. The new sulfone sulfate fungicides were >3 µg/ml for all strains tested.

3.5. Antifungal Activity of the New Fungicide
The new sulfone sulfate fungicides were highly active against the FLA. The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were >3 µg/ml for all strains tested.

3.6. Antifungal Activity of the New Fungicide
The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were higher than the original control strains. The new sulfone sulfate fungicides were also highly active against the FLA. The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were >3 µg/ml for all strains tested.

3.7. Antifungal Activity of the New Fungicide
The MIC_50 values of the new sulfone sulfate fungicides were higher than the original control strains. The new sulfone sulfone sulfate fungicides were also highly active against the FLA.


## Discussion
In our previous work, we demonstrated the ability of . surfactum to detoxify the xenobiotics of the straw mushroom L. glucoferricum, a species formerly known as L. tropica, and L. aethiopica, a species previously known as L. orientalis. The ability of L. surfactum to detoxify xenobiotics, such as xenobiotics of the flavonoids of L. orientalis and L. aethiopica, is limited by the low cost of this substance, low toxicity and high activity of detoxification enzymes. The use of detoxification enzymes in straw mushroom composting, as well as in the isolation and purification of xenobiotics, is highly recommended as a result of the need to overcome xenobiotic inorganic compounds.

Previous studies showed that the synthesis of the xenobiotics, such as flavonoids, has been inhibited by the enzyme inhibitors eburicol and famulolip (Nag Raj and Jumpponen, 2012), and that flavonoids are also present in straw mushroom composting (Powell et al., 2000). In our work, the crude enzyme, C-Phe, showed high activity against the crude enzyme of the xenobiotics of the straw mushroom L. glucoferricum, a species formerly known as L. tropica. These results provide a good explanation for the high activity of this xenobiotic (Nag Raj and Jumpponen, 2012).

Biological studies have shown that the fungi in straw mushroom composting have the capacity to produce enzymes that are toxic to human cells, which could be used as a target for antifungal drugs (Nag Raj and Jumpponen, 2012). The substrate of the crude enzyme C-Phe was chosen because this is the most promising enzyme for the treatment of fungal infections caused by A. fumigatus, which is caused by the fungus in straw mushroom composting (Powell et al., 2000). The crude enzyme C-Phe was found to be active against A. fumigatus and also had activity against A. flavus, A. terreus and A. niger, as well as against A. flavus and A. flavus-like fungus, which are major human pathogenic fungi (Nag Raj and Jumpponen, 2012).

C-Phe was found to be highly active against A.
