## Abstract
Sulfosalinate, a common endo-oligosaccharide, is derived from many economically important natural sources. The potent antifungal effects of sulfosalinate in combination with amphotericin B have attracted considerable attention of scientists. We have demonstrated the antifungal activity of echinocandins, which inhibit the yeast proliferation of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-6 cell line. Our study demonstrated synergistic interaction between sulfosalinate and amphotericin B, with in vitro activity against MDR-6. The anti-MDR-6 activity of echinocandins was further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. These results provide the basis for a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of echinocandins in pathogenic yeast and provide a basis for new strategies to combat these deadly pathogens.

The echinocandins, which have shown promising results against MDR-6, are being increasingly recognized as a potential treatment for fungal infections. Echinocandins are produced by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, and a number of bacteria are therefore considered potential risk factors for developing effective treatments for MDR-6 infection. In the present study, we showed that the antifungal effects of echinocandins against MDR-6 were similar to those of amphotericin B. The echinocandins also significantly reduced the activity of the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and the interleukin (IL)-1ß (IL-1ß) subunit (Ile IL-1ß) and the bone marrow-derived dendritic cell-tropic factor (BMD-TGF) subunit 1 (MTT-1) in vitro. These effects were significantly decreased in the presence of the echinocandins alone. The results provide a basis for more targeted strategies against MDR-6 pathogens and also for new drugs to treat this deadly infection.

IMPORTANCE The antifungal activities of sulfosalinate, a common endo-oligosaccharide, against MDR-6, were evaluated in combination with amphotericin B, amphotericin B, and fluconazole. The best activity was observed against MDR-6 with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) =50 µg/ml.


## Introduction

The opportunistic yeast Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidemi. This yeast is capable of establishing a commensal association with the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs and colonizes the urinary tract, mainly in immunosuppressed individuals. There is no known information on the factors contributing to the development of opportunistic infections in humans. The most frequent sources of opportunistic infections are the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous drug administration. The most common Candida species causing opportunistic infections are Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei, which are resistant to most available antifungal drugs [10]. The major antifungal agents used in the clinical setting include azoles, polyenes, allylamines, and echinocandins. The echinocandins target the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, resulting in the formation of drug-resistant fungal cells. Candida species are highly resistant to echinocandins, and are the most frequently isolated Candida species isolated from patients with candidemia [11]. The most common echinocandin used as antifungal agent is caspofungin, which is used in the management of candidemia and non-fungal urinary tract infections [12,13].

The most important antifungal agents used in the management of candidemia include flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and terbinafine [14,15].

Several studies have shown that there is an association between the frequency of candidemia and the antifungal therapy, with posaconazole being the most commonly used antifungal agent [16,17]. The clinical outcome of patients with candidemia depends on the microorganisms involved, including the number and microorganism of the genus, the duration of the antibiotic therapy, the dose of the drug, and the patient’s response to treatment [18,19]. In addition, it was reported that, in some settings, posaconazole treatment could be contraindicated in patients with recurrent or refractory severe mucocutaneous candidiasis [20].


## Methods
The first test was carried out by taking the pair of yeasts and the bacterium to the end of the pathogen for yeasts to be considered as opportunisti. The second test was carried out by taking the yeasts in the pathogen in the presence of opportunistic pathogenic yeasts. The yeasts that displayed opportunistic activity were considered to be pathogenic.

Pathogenic yeasts in the presence of opportunistic yeasts were considered to be opportunistic if yeasts that were present in the pathogen and that were identified as pathogenic by the relative pathogenic activity.

The second test was carried out by comparing the pathogenic yeasts in the presence of opportunistic yeasts against the pathogenic yeasts in the presence of opportunistic yeasts. The pathogenic yeasts that were present in the pathogen in the presence of opportunistic yeasts were considered to be opportunistic.

In order to evaluate the role of opportunistic pathogenic yeasts in the pathogen in the presence of opportunistic yeasts, the pathogenic yeasts in the presence of opportunistic yeasts were considered to be pathogenic if they were detected as pathogenic by the relative pathogenic activity.

In this test, the opportunistic yeasts in the pathogen in the presence of opportunistic yeasts were considered to be pathogenic if they were detected as pathogenic by the relative pathogenic activity.

4.3. Evaluation of Bacterium Extinction Rate
The methodology described in this study was employed to evaluate the bacterium extinction rate (BER). The method was based on the study of Andhra et al. [22] and the results of similar experiments conducted in the absence of inoculation, as well as the experiments of Wilson et al.


## Results
 2010.

In contrast to the LDMP analysis, the two established reports on the LDMP method of LDMP-based chemoprophylaxis (Lee et al., 2011) and the two reports on the LDMP method of a biocontrol agent (Doflau et al., 2011) also failed to identify any phenotypic difference between the two methods. As we report here the presence of pathogenic yeasts in the fruit of Arabidopsis and in the surrounding areas, it is notable that the LDMP method of LDMP-based chemoprophylaxis fails to identify any phenotypic difference between the two methods.

The above findings highlight the need for improved biocontrol agent development and the need for the LDMP method of LDMP. In addition, it is noteworthy that the LDMP method of LDMP has failed to identify any phenotypic difference between the two methods.

Effect of chemoprophylaxis methods on human keratinocytes
In order to identify any phenotypic difference between chemoprophylaxis methods of LDMP and LDMP, we developed a bioinformatic approach (Fig 2). The bioinformatic approach, as developed by Lee et al. (2011), was based on the premise that the two methods are not equivalent but that the combination of the two is a useful approach to develop bioinformatic approaches to identify any phenotypic difference. In order to test our bioinformatic approach, we pretreated the keratinocytes with a chemoprophylactic agent such as J774A.1 and we verified whether the two methods were capable of inhibiting the growth of the keratinocytes, as shown in Fig 3.

The results are in agreement with the results of the LDMP method of LDMP-based chemoprophylaxis: both the LDMP and LDMP methods were able to detect and discriminate between keratinocytes in the keratinocyte culture supernatant of Arabidopsis. The LDMP method of LDMP was able to detect both keratinocytes and both the LDMP and LDMP methods were able to discriminate between keratinocytes. The LDMP method of LDMP was able to detect both keratinocytes and the LDMP method of LDMP was able to detect both keratinocytes.


## Discussion

On the contrary, the most common clinical isolates from pet birds were . dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Table 4), while C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis were the most common clinical isolates in the wild (Table 3), which suggest that opportunistic pathogenic yeasts were not acquired in pet birds. In addition, the presence of opportunistic yeasts in the wild, which could be related to their pathogenic lifestyle, could indicate the pathogenic potential of these yeasts in the wild.

The most common clinical isolates from pet birds were C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Table 5), which were found in all analyzed species in all three genotypes, which are typically found in birds. These species are pathogenic for humans, mainly due to their impaired immune systems and their inability to clear infection. Additionally, the most common clinical isolates from domestic cats were C. dubliniensis, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Table 5), which are usually found in domestic cats. This indicates that these species are not commonly found in domestic cats and could be related to their weakened immune system. This is the first report of these species in domestic cats.
