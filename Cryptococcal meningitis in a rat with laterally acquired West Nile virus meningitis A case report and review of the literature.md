## Abstract
The concept of the immune response to opportunistic infections (OIs) has been described for many organisms, including fungi. However, the role of the immune response in the development of acute respiratory failure (AR) and its impact on the immune response to OIs has not been fully described. We hypothesized that acute respiratory failure (AR) is mediated by OI-induced host immunopathology.

We report a case of acute respiratory failure due to OI-induced maculopapular lymphoma (MBL) in a 22-year-old woman, who had not received immunosuppressive therapy and lacked resistance to tuberculosis. She had been treated with corticosteroids for tuberculosis and normal lung function for several months. On the day of diagnosis, she presented with a three-day history of “coming from a distant place” with rapidly increasing incidences of respiratory symptoms. On the fourth day, she was symptom-free for the majority of symptoms. Laboratory tests were consistent with tuberculosis. Skin histology and culture were unremarkable. On the fifth day, MBL was apparent in the form of a painful mass that was indigens to the immune system. Cytology revealed a cell mass in the patient's right upper respiratory lobe. MBL was rapidly and uniformly increased in size from the bronchus to the lung parenchyma. An accompanying histopathological examination revealed that bronchial tissue was inhaled and ingested by numerous fungi. One hundred and seventy-four percent (25/27) of the lung mass was deemed to be MBL.

In acute respiratory failure, the lung is ingested by numerous fungi that cause disease. These observations support the hypothesis that acute respiratory failure is mediated by a host-imposed immune response that is triggered upon the presence of a diverse spectrum of OIs. MBL was seen in a similar fashion to tuberculosis, and in an otherwise well-controlled manner to counteract the effects of MBL. This suggests that the lung microbiota as well as the immune system can be used as a resource for the development of novel therapeutics to combat this scourge in humans.


## Introduction
Protein phosphorylation is critical for the entire biological process of protein phosphorylation. It plays a critical role in many aspects of protein function, from protein folding to phospholipase function (Kulka et al., 2012; Sudmant et al., 2012; de Maisetti et al., 2013). The phospholipid is a key target of protein phosphorylation, as it cleaves phospholipids from phospholipids to form phospholipases that cleave phospholipids to liberate substrate phospholipids (Wang et al., 2010; Rossman et al., 2013). Several phospholipid types are structurally related to each other, and they can interact physically or chemically to form membrane domains (Bao et al., 2011). In the phospholipid domain, which is activated at the interface between two phospholipids and is necessary for protein activity, phospholipid binding can be achieved by coordinated phospholipid binding protein (PBP) (Wang et al., 2010). Moreover, the cleavage of phospholipids from phospholipids is catalyzed by a pyrin domain-containing protein called the phospholipid PxL domain (PxL domain) (Bao et al., 2011). The PxL domain is responsible for the cross-linking of PxL phospholipids, which can be used to perform protein-protein interactions (Prasad et al., 2008). The PxL domain is also involved in the processing of a phospholipid into an inactive protein by a protein kinase (PK) (Wang et al., 2010).

PK regulates a variety of physiological processes, including protein trafficking, carbohydrate metabolism, and signal transduction (Cui et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017). The PKs of various eukaryotic cell types possess several subunits, which are responsible for regulating important cellular functions, such as the cell-cycle, the cell-cycle checkpoint, and protein trafficking (Zhang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017). PKs are highly expressed in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes of organelles, which are involved in important biological processes, such as cell division, apoptosis, and cell signaling (Guo et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012; Chen et al.


## Methods
Construction of the BRB2 gene deletion mutant
The gene deletion cassettes used in this study are listed in Table S1. The deletion cassettes were generated by PCR with the primers, BRB2-NAT and BRB2-PRED. The gene-specific primers used in this study are listed in Table S2. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The construct was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. To confirm the presence of the gene deletion cassette, the primers, BRB2-F and BRB2-R, which amplify the gene from plasmid pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), were used, as previously described (40). The PCR products were purified and sent to Dr. P. S. Somai (University of Tokyo, Japan) for sequencing. The gene-specific primers used in this study are listed in Table S3.

Infection of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells with the deletion cassette
The cells were cultivated in a BHI broth medium at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 days. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000× g for 5 min and resuspended in sterile water. The cells were lysed by bead beating with a Beadbeater^® (Biotek, Hatam, Malaysia). The lysate was incubated with a 0.


## Results

Of the 68 patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, 33 (23%) were in the general practice of referral to a physician, 19 (16%) were in the general practice of the South African government, and 14 (15%) were in the general practice of referral to a clinical practic. Two patients were diagnosed with meningitis by referral to a clinical practice.

A clinical practice of referral to a clinical practice was not established by the guidelines published in the United Kingdom and the United States. A review of the literature suggests that the general practice of referral to a clinical practice is in favor of referral to a clinical practice in some countries.

The most common presentation in the general practice of referral to a clinical practice was fever, followed by headache. Fever was associated with cryptococcal meningitis. There was a trend for a higher incidence of headache in patients who received immunosuppressive therapy.

The median duration of follow-up in the general practice of referral to a clinical practice was 22.9 (range, 3-27) months. There was a statistically significant difference between the median duration of follow-up in the general practice of referral to a clinical practice and that in the referral to a clinical practice.

The median duration of follow-up in the general practice of referral to a clinical practice was 13.3 months (range, 3-32) months. There was a statistically significant difference between the median duration of follow-up in the general practice of referral to a clinical practice and that in the referral to a clinical practice.

A clinical practice of referral to a clinical practice was not established by the guidelines published in the United Kingdom and the United States. The general practice of referral to a clinical practice was in favor of referral to a clinical practice in some countries.

Laboratory results
Of the 67 patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, 50 (30%) were white, 34 (34%) were black, and 2 (2%) were Asian. Of the 50 patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, 31 (33%) were white, 33 (33%) were black, and 2 (2%) were Asian. The median CSF opening pressure was 110/mm^3 (range, 14-190/mm^3). CSF white blood cell count was 116/mm^3 (range, 24-142/mm^3).


## Discussion
In a series of 27 patients with AIDS-related meningitis reported in the United States, 17 of 22 (72%) had initial or later TB. Only one patient had a reported secondary TBM [32]. In a cohort of patients with AIDS-related meningitis, only one patient had a reported secondary TBM [32].

Our patient did not have a primary TBM. The patient had a history of multiple exposures to antiretroviral drugs, including injection drug use, and he was immunocompetent.

Tuberculosis has a higher incidence in AIDS patients [33]. However, it was the second most common cause of TB in the United States [34], and the third in Asia [35]. Our patient had a history of multiple exposures to antiretroviral drugs. However, we did not find any evidence of TB in his initial blood cultures.

In a cohort of AIDS-related meningitis patients, there was a high frequency of cryptococcal meningitis. We did not find evidence of cryptococcal meningitis in our patient, but he did have a history of cryptococcal meningitis [35].

In a series of 29 patients with AIDS-related meningitis, only three had a history of CM. One patient had a history of CM [35]. Our patient had a history of CM in the past, and the patient had an unclear history of CM in the present.

We did not find evidence of CM in our patient. However, cryptococcal meningitis is rare in HIV-infected adults [36], and there is no report of meningitis in HIV-infected patients. However, a patient had a history of CM and had a history of CM in the past. Our patient had a history of CM in the past and had a history of CM in the present.

There was a history of CM in our patient. We did not find evidence of CM in our patient, but we did not find evidence of CM in our patient.

There was a history of CM in our patient. We did not find evidence of CM in our patient. However, we did not find evidence of CM in our patient.

There was a history of CM in our patient. We did not find evidence of CM in our patient.

There was a history of CM in our patient. We did not find evidence of CM in our patient.
