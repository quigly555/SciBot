## Abstract
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory is an inflammatory process that can occur in the recovery after a burn injury. Radiologically, it is characterized by the formation of multiple types of inflammatory infiltrates with differing degrees of resolution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inflammatory process in a burn injury patient who presented with multiple types of inflammatory infiltrates and was initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially. In order to determine the inflammatory process in these burn injury patients it is necessary to treat them with serial courses of teratocin and histapheresis. We present the first case of burn injury associated with multiple types of inflammatory infiltrates and initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial initial rotatorio fissariomyopathy (ICP) and initial initial initial initial initial initial rotatorio fissariomyopathy (IPL). The burn injury was initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initially initial initial initial initial rotatorio fissariomyopathy (RIC) and initial initial initial initial initial initial rotatorio fissariomyopathy (IPL). Burn injury is a life threatening condition and should be treated with care and aggressive treatment as the initial initial damage may alter the patient’s clinical course and worsen the disease.


## Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a poorly understood disease caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, mostly Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). Although the pathogenesis of COPD remains obscure, a clear correlation has been found between the presence of C. neoformans and the capacity of this pathogen to invade and invade into the lung and the central nervous system (CNS) of the chronically diseased individual (2). Despite the apparent immunopathology of the disease, the burden of the disease is not significantly increased and its morbidity is not increased despite the vast improvement in many regions around the world (3).

Treatment of COPD is difficult with limited available drugs and therapeutic options. New compounds with antifungal activity have been discovered as a result of the increased drug discovery programs in the US and other countries and are currently being investigated for their possible antifungal effects (4).

A number of medicinal plants are used in the treatment of various disorders, including cough, asthma, fever, and respiratory diseases. Plants have been used in the treatment of dysfunctions such as viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections (5).

The herbal medicine is a complex mixture of active substances and is mostly composed of aromatic and aliphatic components. The medicinal plants have shown significant antifungal activities (6).

A number of studies have demonstrated that extracts of several medicinal plants have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities (7-9). These activities can be attributed to the activity of some extracts against different pathogens (10). For example, inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus was shown by the extracts of the popular plants incense, oil, and tea (11).


## Methods

Fungal mycelium of . graminearum (M.D.47.2) was obtained from the field. Stock cultures were prepared in 50 ml of fresh water and stored at -80°C until use.

Morphological characterization
Microscopic features were evaluated by the use of light microscopy. Existing culture media were supplemented with various concentrations of fluconazole (1.5-10 µg/ml), hygromycin (10-50 µg/ml), itraconazole (0.125-5 µg/ml), and voriconazole (0.25-2 µg/ml). To assess the morphological characteristics, sporulating cells were assessed by their colony morphology and visualized under a light microscope. A slide was prepared for microscopic observation with a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse Ni-ITM, Japan).

The spore suspensions were prepared by mixing five grams of mycelium in 10 ml of sterile water, and incubating at 35°C for 2 days. To check the size and sporulation of fungi, spore suspension was diluted with fresh sterile water and poured onto a microscope slide. Spores were visualized under a light microscope after the procedure described by Perreto et al. [40]. The length of spores was measured using a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse Ni-ITM, Japan).

DNA extraction
DNA extraction was performed as described in Lopar et al. [11]. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 50 µl using genomic DNA of F. graminearum isolate M.D.47.2 as the template and nuclease-free water as the DNA template. The DNA quality was checked using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Polymorphonuclear and subunit (PMN) sequences were amplified by PCR using the primers Nruf<U+2009>-F (5'-TCCGTGTTCCAGTAAG-3') and Nruf<U+2009>-R (5'-CCATCCTACGCACAG-3').


## Results
In this study, we analyzed a whole-cell-derived strain of C. albicans to determine whether the two strains are genetically similar. We first tested the sensitivity of C.


## Discussion
Genome sequencing of the chytrid C. neoformans and C. gattii confirmed their phylogenetic independence. The two closely related species, C. gattii and C. neoformans, have been repeatedly found to form interspecies hybrid incompatibilities. The strain phylogeny of C. gattii and C. neoformans is highly similar to the hybrid species that formed their species complex in C. neoformans [11, 12]. However, this hybrid population is highly susceptible to chemical mutagenesis by inducing an introgression of two genes that code for pro-idolucosyltransferase and rhamnose reductase. These two genes were found to be highly conserved in C. neoformans and are required for the production of this enzyme in C. gattii and C. gattii-like strains [11, 12].

The data presented here indicate that the two strains of C. neoformans and C.
