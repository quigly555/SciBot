## Abstract
The genus Paracoccidioides is presently treated as a member of Metarhizium aetophyllum in the nuclear system. However, other pathogens in Paracoccidioides complex are known to infect humans. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize pathogens that cause paracoccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected and immune-negative patients.

In this retrospective study, we collected specimens from 51 patients with diagnostically-related diseases and 63 healthy individuals and the clinical records were available. The clinical records were submitted to the Verkley Library of pathology and clinical records analysis software.


## Introduction

. neoformans complex has a large number of receptors for fungal pathogens and a large number of anti-virulence factors, such as extracellular complement, hematopoietic cells and keratinocyte colony-stimulating factor [16,17,18,19]. Besides the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mannoproteins, other important proteins are present in the cell membrane and are involved in various biological processes, such as cell wall integrity, cell morphology and immune response [16,19,20,21,22]. Some of these proteins can be activated by host ligands. In addition, some extracellular proteins are present in the cell wall, including chitinase and protease. Another important virulence factor is the phospholipase, which is present in both cell envelope and cell wall. Chitinase is important for the cell wall formation, and it plays an important role in the immune response. It is present in both yeast and hyphal forms in the cell walls of pathogenic fungi, and it is important for the development of immune cells [23]. The chitinase activity plays an important role in the activation of immune cells, and it is involved in the release of cytokines from infected cells [24].

We have previously shown that the major cell wall component, glucosamine, is a potent anti-virulence factor. Glucosamine inhibits neutrophil extracellular protein-1 (NET-1)-mediated phagocytosis, causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytotoxicity of monocytes and neutrophils, and acts as an antifungal agent against a broad spectrum of Candida species [25]. Thus, the ability to increase the cell wall glycosaminoglycan (GSC) content might be beneficial to promote fungal growth. In the past, we have shown that the major cell wall component, glucosamine, is a potent anti-virulence factor. Glucosamine inhibits NET-1-mediated phagocytosis, and therefore, it can be used as an antifungal agent. However, in the context of cryptococcal infection, we have observed that glucosamine can act as a second messenger, either through binding to the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) or to the binding to the Toll-like receptor (TLR).


## Methods
The presence of pSAP1 in the nucleus and tpkA::HA-2pA-sapA-tet were detected using the SAP1 protein staining method (http://ww.rcsb.org) as previously described [35]. Briefly, the stained cells were examined under fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). To quantify the pSAP1 protein, the intensity of the green (p = 0.7) or red (p = 0.7) band was measured using ImageJ 1.47b software. The pSAP1 protein was characterized as a p-phenylalanine-binding protein, as a p-phenylalanine-binding protein, or as a p-glycosylalanine-binding protein [36]. The pSAP1 protein was characterized as a p-glycosylalanine-binding protein in the presence of p-glycosylalanine and the staining method was performed using the SAP1 protein staining method (http://www.rcsb.org).

Assessment of the expression of pSAP1-kanMX
To measure the expression of pSAP1-kanMX, the pSAP1 protein was stained with an anti-kanMX antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature in darkness. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3% Triton X-100. The stained cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Western blot analysis
For Western blot analysis, the pSAP1 protein was incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-kanMX antibody (1:1000) at 4Â°C overnight, followed by an additional incubation with an equal volume of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature in darkness. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3% Triton X-100. The stained cells were observed under the microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).


## Results
2.1. Chemistry
The E. coli L. donovani capsule was reacted with the M + HCl solution (1 M) for the first time. The reaction mixture was subsequently dissolved in the presence of the M + HCl solution.


## Discussion
We also show that Hbp1 promotes apoptosis and induces apoptosis-related morphogenesis of . infestans and P. infestans-infected cells. We show that Hbp1 promotes cell proliferation and cell fate. Furthermore, we show that Hbp1 promotes cell fate. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that, in fungi, Hbp1 promotes cell fate. For example, the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, Hbp1 was found to promote cell fate by protecting cells from oxidative stress [58], and the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum, Hbp1 was found to promote cell fate by protecting cells from oxidative stress [59]. In addition, in P. infestans, Hbp1 was found to promote cell fate by promoting cell proliferation and cell fate. This suggests that Hbp1 promotes cell fate by promoting cell fate.

In our study, we showed that the expression of Hbp1 was down-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. We also showed that Hbp1 was down-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. In this study, we showed that Hbp1 was down-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. Therefore, we speculated that Hbp1 might be involved in cell fate.

We also found that Hbp1 was up-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. Hbp1 was up-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. In this study, we showed that Hbp1 was up-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. Therefore, we speculated that Hbp1 might be involved in cell fate.

In this study, we found that Hbp1 was down-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. We also found that Hbp1 was up-regulated in P. infestans-infected P. infestans cells. Therefore, we speculated that Hbp1 might be involved in cell fate.

In this study, we found that the expression of Hbp1 was down-regulated in P.
