## Abstract
Protozoan predation is an important factor in the interaction of the various arthropod hosts with their favoured nematodes, including the very popular free-ranging relative Taphrina spiralis. Taphrina is a member of the Verbenaceae family and responsible for a large number of human and animal skin diseases. A new genus of Mycosphaerella was introduced to accommodate this infection. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated dataset of the ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tef1 region sequence data suggest that the genus should be placed in the Mycosphaerellaceae. These taxa are found to be polyphyletic, with Mycosphaerella being the fourth most common family. Based on the concatenated dataset and tef1 region sequence data, Mycosphaerella is placed in the Mycosphaerellaceae. It should be noted however, that the generic circumscriptions of the genus Mycosphaerella are restricted to limited geographic areas and the genera Mycosphaerella simulans and Trametesporomyces are polyphyletic. The present study provides a comprehensive re-evaluation of the phylogeny of the genus Mycosphaerella and the delimitation of T. ericata in the Verbenaceae.


## Introduction
Fungal pathogens of the genus Candida are the most important cause of fungal infections, causing over one million life-threatening infections globally each year, with over one million deaths from 1990 to 2014 (1). Invasive candidiasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with compromised immunity, with mortality exceeding 40% in the absence of other risk factors (2). A variety of factors contribute to this immunopathology, including diabetes mellitus, chronic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and others (3-5). In addition, immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplants (6, 7), are at risk of developing invasive candidiasis (8). In the United States, candidiasis is the second most common fungal disease, and it is responsible for more than 180,000 deaths each year (9). Although antifungal therapies are effective, the mortality rate associated with these infections is very low, and treatment is often prolonged, expensive, and challenging.


## Methods
parvum [31. Insects were inoculated on the surface of the leaves of F. tomentosa with 10 µl of 2×10^6 to 10^6 CFU of L. parvum. After inoculation, the leaves were carefully removed and washed three times with cold distilled water. The leaf discs (5 mm) of each insect were cut and sliced into squares, and then placed in a sterile plastic bag. The insects were then homogenized in 20 ml of sterile water, and then the biomass was harvested with a sterile spatula. The lysates were stored at -80°C until further use.

Enzyme activity assay
The activity of the flavonoids was determined by the method described by Le et al. [32] with slight modifications. L. parvum plants were inoculated with 10 µl of 2×10^6 CFU of L. parvum and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The lysates were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, and then the supernatants were used for the enzyme activity assay.

The assay was performed in triplicate, and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer. The activity of the flavonoids was expressed as units per mg dry matter (mg/mL) equivalent to the amount of lysate.

Molecular docking
The docking of the lipid extract was performed by the method of Buckley and Miller [33] with minor modifications. Briefly, the lipid extract of L. parvum was diluted to the same concentration of 10^6 CFU/mL with 1 mL of 0.1% (w/w) methylene blue. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 µl of the diluted lipid extract to the reaction mixture. The reaction was followed by the addition of 50 µl of 1% (w/w) methylene blue, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 µl of cold methanol. The absorbance was determined at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, and then 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.


## Results
After infection, we quantified extracellular protein in the recipient and control strains, respectivel. The levels of extracellular proteins in both the recipient and control strains were significantly lower than those in the plant infection-resistant strain, indicating that the fungus-inoculated host could exploit plant defense in a manner similar to the plant infection.

Further, we investigated the effect of plant defense mechanisms on extracellular protein levels in the recipient and control strains. At 48 h after infection, the levels of extracellular proteins in both the recipient and control strains were significantly higher than those in the plant infection-resistant strain (Fig 2). At 48 h after infection, the levels of extracellular proteins in both the recipient and control strains were significantly higher than those in the plant infection-resistant strain, indicating that the fungus-inoculated host could exploit plant defense in a manner similar to the plant infection.

## Discussion
For example, the pathogen Bacillus subtilis induced phagocytosis by host cells, and the host of this fungus killed the pathogen by releasing a high level of salicylate (S)-linked to its metabolism [26. In another plant pathogen, M. oryzae, the plant defense response to fungal infection was induced by host recognition of a putative pathogen [29]. In plant pathogens, the defensive response to pathogen infection was induced by plant defense-associated factors, such as chitin synthesis, glucan synthesis, and defense-associated proteins, such as chitin synthase-like proteins (CAS-1 and BCL-4) [27, 30]. In fungi, the fungal cell wall is the major component of the cell wall, and plant defense response is also involved in this response. In this study, the defense response of C. neoformans was not induced by defense-associated factors, as described for S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. The reason why the defense response of C. neoformans was induced by C. neoformans cells could not be elucidated. Further study is necessary to determine the nature of the defense response. In this study, C. neoformans had a strong defense response against C. albicans infection, although it could not be ruled out the possible involvement of CAZymes, including CAZymes of the pathogenic component CAZyme-1, CAZyme-2, and CAZyme-3. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate the possible relationship between the CAZymes and the defense response.

In this study, the cellular components of the cell wall were the main determinants of the C. neoformans cell wall. In addition, the different types of cell wall components were identified in C. neoformans, and the differences between them could be explained by differences in the different cell wall components. In fungi, the cell wall was composed of cell wall components and protein-like structures. The C. neoformans cell wall consists of mainly ß-1,3-glucan and ß-1,6-glucan, and the ß-1,6-glucan and ß-1,6-glucan are the major components of the cell wall of C. neoformans [29].
