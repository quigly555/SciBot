## Abstract
Olea africana leaves are used by Bouquet and their chemical constituents to be re-purified using agro acids, which have the added benefit of inhibiting decay. Here, we investigate the chemical composition of the leaves of O. africana and its active constituents, tannins and flavonoids. The leaves were first collected in late October and early November of 2015 from the Brittany of Oprencia in Portugal. The leaves were then ground, pulverized and were de-parsed to reveal the mature mature or partial mature leaf spots. The active compounds were extracted using acidified precipitate followed by homology purification. The active compounds were identified using spectrophotometric methods. Partial mature or partial mature leaf spots were visible under high ethanol concentration using scanning electron microscopy. The active compounds were identified as limonene (72.2%), 3-a-arabinoyl-9-en-3-branched-8-o virginic acid (29.2%), thymol (23.2%) and carvacrol (5.9%), with a minimum of 88.5% and 95.4% respectively. Tannic acid (25.6%) and thymol (15.7%) were the main antifungal compounds. Tannic acid was the most active compound in limonene, followed by limonene (32.1%), 3-a-arabinoyl-9-en-3-branched-8-o virginic acid (14.5%) and thymol (11.9%). The lowest proportion of the active compounds was observed after 3 days of hydrolysis. The active compounds were found to be mobile and the most active leaf part were inolin-3-a-irino-vital oil (26.2%) and inolin-3-a-irino-vital oil (21.5%). The active compounds were found to have an MIC and MIC50 value of 0.25 Âµg/ml. The MIC values showed that the active compounds are effective against several fungal species and there was no interaction between these compounds.


## Introduction
Among the eukaryotes, fungi share many phenotypes, which enable them to adapt to environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability, temperature, temperature shifts, and nutrient availability. The mechanisms by which fungi adapt to these environmental changes and environmental shifts are highly complex, involving transcription factors and histone proteins that control these processes.

Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are two major fungal pathogens that infect humans and animals. The Candida albicans cell wall is the most important virulence factor and the most extensively studied. The cell wall is an intricate structure of cells, which is usually composed of a complex network of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular proteins, and they are often engulfed by phagocytes, including neutrophils and macrophages. The cell wall is the primary barrier against fungal infections.


## Methods
The proteins with the highest rate of evolution were selected as candidates for prediction of C protein-coupled receptors and subsequently analyze. Only proteins with a predicted C protein-coupled receptor from each chain were included in the analysis. To determine the potential of C protein-coupled receptor in C. albicans, C-terminal domain sequences from C. albicans S288c, C-terminal domain sequences from C. dubliniensis, C-terminal domain sequences from C. glabrata, C-terminal domain sequences from C. parapsilosis, and C-terminal domain sequences from C. tropicalis were analyzed. The C-terminal domain sequences from C. albicans were analyzed to determine the potential of C protein-coupled receptor.

## Results
 2014; Schulze et a., 2014). Interestingly, the specific binding of C. albicans to C. neoformans is weakly dependent on the presence of CAZy (Fig 1B and C). Since binding of C. neoformans to the host is dependent on CAZy, we asked whether CAZy binding to C. neoformans would also be dependent on the presence of the receptor for the C. neoformans-specific binding of C. neoformans to the host. The C. neoformans-specific binding of C. neoformans to the host (Fig 1B) was dependent on the presence of CAZy, as binding of the receptor to C. neoformans was dependent on CAZy binding to C. neoformans. The binding of C. neoformans to the host was dependent on the CAZy binding pattern of C. neoformans to the host (Fig 1C). The binding pattern of C. neoformans to the host was dependent on the CAZy binding pattern of C. neoformans to the host. The binding pattern of C. neoformans to the host was dependent on the CAZy binding pattern of C. neoformans to the host (Fig 1C). These results suggest that C. neoformans is a potential non-classical receptor for C. neoformans-specific binding to the host.

In vitro specificity of C. neoformans-specific binding for C. neoformans
We next attempted to verify the specificity of C. neoformans-specific binding for C. neoformans in a murine model of invasive candidiasis. For this, we first determined the relative activation of C. neoformans by incubating the yeast cells with the C. neoformans-specific binding peptide and then determining the relative activation of C. neoformans by incubating the yeast cells with the C. neoformans-specific binding peptide and then determining the relative activation of C. neoformans by incubating the yeast cells with the C. neoformans-specific binding peptide and then determining the relative activation of C. neoformans by incubating the yeast cells with the C. neoformans-specific binding peptide and then determining the relative activation of C. neoformans by incubating the yeast cells with the C.


## Discussion
albicans and . neoformans [16,18]. As a result, we selected a C-H mutant for the experiments and compared the molecular weight of the peptide and C-H in the broth containing the mutants. The results are summarized in Figure 4. The molecular weight of C-H is comparable to that of the C-H from C. albicans (70.6 kDa), but C-H from C. neoformans (70.7 kDa) is the major component of the C-H synthesized by C. albicans. Thus, we conclude that C-H is not only the major component of the C-H synthesized by C. albicans, but also other C-H. The C-H in the broth contains the major C-H, C-N, C-O, C-S, and C-S from C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, whereas the C-H is the major component of the C-O synthesized by C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, respectively. The major C-H synthesized by C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, respectively, is also C-H. This is because C-H is the major component of the C-H synthesized by C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans. The C-H in the broth contains the major C-H, C-N, C-O, C-S, and C-S from C. albicans, C. neoformans, C. albicans, C. albicans, and C. albicans, respectively. The major C-H synthesized by C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, C. albicans, C. albicans, C. albicans, C. albicans, and C. albicans, respectively, is also C-H.
