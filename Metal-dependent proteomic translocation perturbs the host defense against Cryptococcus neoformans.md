## Abstract
The calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaNce1) is a key regulator of adhesion to surfaces and surfaces-yeasts and baculoviruses, and is important for virulence of several pathogens, including the fungus Candida albicans. The cationic protease Crz1 is an integral part of this key pathway in maintaining proper CaNce1 localization to the cell surface and for promoting survival within phagocytes. To understand the role of Crz1 in the pathogenesis of these fungal pathogens, we performed a proteomic analysis of the C. albicans genome to identify the underlying proteins. Our results suggest that Crz1 is required for maintaining proper CaNce1 phosphorylation and that a novel protein, Hvy2, which is a homolog of Hvy3, may play a relevant role in fungal Crz1 regulation.


## Introduction
The incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains highly significant, especially among patients with severe immunodeficiency (AIDS) and patients with hematologic malignancies [1, 2]. Approximately 50-70% of patients with AIDS present with lymphocyte dysfunction, and their immune status is associated with worse outcomes [3]. As a result, most patients with AIDS present to the emergency room with an intact immune system, but some patients can develop complications of AIDS. It is also important to note that the immune status can change rapidly and profoundly in patients with AIDS [4].

In the case of HIV infected patients, CD4^+ T lymphocytes are the most abundant cells and are associated with a variety of immunologic processes, including the control of inflammation, the control of immune activation, the control of T cell migration, and the control of the production of inflammatory cytokines.


## Methods
In addition, heat-killed Cryptococcus cells were used as a positive control to determine whether . neoformans cells carry a known, conserved protein in the nucleus. The heat-killed C. neoformans cells were treated with 0.5% (v/v) BSA for 15 min in the dark at 37°C. The heat-killed C. neoformans were treated with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min in the dark at 37°C. The heat-killed C. neoformans were treated with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min in the dark at 37°C. The heat-killed C. neoformans were treated with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min in the dark at 37°C. The heat-killed C. neoformans were treated with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min in the dark at 37°C.

To determine the number of C. neoformans cells that were infected with C. gattii, the number of C. gattii cells that were infected with C. gattii was determined in a total volume of 100 µl with a McFarland- and STC fluorometer (Nanodrop, New York, NY). The number of C. gattii cells that were infected with C. gattii was determined with a log_10 of the number of C. gattii cells that were infected with C. gattii.

Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of the C. gattii strains was measured by the Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the C. gattii strains were grown to an OD_600 of 0.8 and then diluted to an OD_600 of 0.


## Results

Cryptococcus neoformans is a cosmopolitan pathogen with limited geographic distributio. The Cryptococcus neoformans genome currently comprises 917,208 genes with a single copy of the human protein (human-pathogen) ortholog (accession no. PR00281862) that is flanked by a large number of other human proteins (accession no. PR00271941). The Cryptococcus neoformans orthologs of human PGR-1, PGR-2, PGR-3, and PGR-4 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2, respectively. The PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2. The PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2. The PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2. The PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2. The PGR-1 PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2. The PGR-2 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2 are largely identical to the PGR-1 PGR-3 PGR-4 orthologs of human PGR-1 and PGR-2.


## Discussion
The natural history of D. melanogaster, which is a sex-specific, was determined by the comparative gene expression data obtained from two closely related isolates. The D. melanogaster gene expression data were then used to evaluate gene expression in different species. The two isolates were then compared with the parental strains by culture independent and in-house techniques.

D. melanogaster is an animal model for the study of the evolutionary history of sex and has been used for genetic analysis of other animals and plants (Kamar and Greig) (7). It has been used to study the evolutionary history of asexual reproduction in other groups of animals and plants (12,13). The species D. melanogaster has been used in the study of sex determination in asexual reproduction in two Drosophila species (14). The D. melanogaster population in this study was 100% female and there was only one other female isolate in this study. The female D. melanogaster population had a total of 30 isolates, of which 12 were female and 10 were female-specific. There were only three female isolates in this study, and they were male-specific isolates. There was a single isolate of D.
