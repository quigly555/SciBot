## Abstract
Fungal infections are a growing public health concern in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations worldwide. However, the number of immunocompromised individuals is rising, especially in HIV-infected patients, and fungal infections have been considered a relatively underreported risk. We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients who had undergone medical school admission or a post-secondary education at the end of 2013 to 2015. A total of 63 patients were identified, including HIV-infected, immune-compromised, and immune-competent patients, for whom candidiasis, an opportunistic fungal infection, sepsis, and/or malignancy were the most common diagnoses. Clinical records were reviewed to identify patients who had fungal infections, and all fungal isolates were sequenced to identify fungal endophytes and potential drug-resistant. A total of 361 non-Candida albicans (NCC) isolates were sequenced, and 87% (31/63) were identified as Candida glabrata, and 85% (30/63) as Candida tropicalis. Overall, 41% (20/41) of the isolates were found to be susceptible to caspofungin, and 78% (23/41) were resistant to fluconazole. Among Candida parapsilosis isolates, Candida glabrata exhibited the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole, at =400 µg/mL. Overall, Candida species was the most frequently isolated species in patients with fungal endophthalmos, and the majority of patients were treated with amphotericin B.


## Introduction
Sugarcatine, an isolated metabolite from a number of other natural products, is used as a first-line anti-inflammatory agent in many areas of life including cardiovascular diseases, cancer and inflammatory diseases [1-3]. However, some bioactive metabolites of the human pathogenic fungus Scutellaria hepatica have also been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents [4-6]. Moreover, the use of sugarcatine has been associated with an increase in the incidence of inflammatory diseases, such as septic arthritis, liver cirrhosis, and even multiple sclerosis [7,8].

In spite of its wide range of biological activities, sugarcatine remains a poor predictor of clinical outcome in patients with inflammatory diseases [9-11]. In fact, S. hepatica has been reported as a potential cause of infection in immunocompromised patients [12-15]. It is known that S. hepatica can survive and proliferate in the environment in vitro but can also pass through the blood-brain barrier in vivo, particularly in the central nervous system [11,16]. Therefore, further study is required to explore the potential pathogenic potential of S. hepatica in vivo.

In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of S. hepatica in vitro and in vivo in order to investigate the possible mechanisms that could be exploited to boost its anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, we investigated the possible anti-inflammatory potential of sugarcatine against S. hepatica in the presence of a high concentration (17.0 µM) of itraconazole. Finally, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of sugarcatine against S. hepatica in the presence of the same concentration of itraconazole.

## Results

These results suggest that the LDA pathway might be enriched in early stage and late stage cancer patients.

Genome-wide analyses of LDA signaling
The LDA pathway regulates several metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, and the metabolic activity of the gluconeogenic enzymes catalase, succinate dehydrogenase and glycolysis, as well as the catabolism of glucan and mannose. As part of the LDA pathway, the lda pathway is a primary pathway for glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate metabolism, respectively. We found that the lda pathway was enriched in early stage cancer patients and in early stage lymphoma patients compared to early-stage lymphoma patients.

The LDA pathway is involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, including glycolysis, glyoxylate and valine and is an important pathway for the metabolism of starch, sucrose and fructose (Cho et al., 2003). We found that the lda pathway was enriched in early stage cancer patients and in early-stage lymphoma patients compared to early-stage lymphoma patients.

LDA is required for the conversion of glucose to phosphatidate (Chang et al., 2011). We found that the lda pathway was enriched in early stage cancer patients and in early-stage lymphoma patients compared to early-stage lymphoma patients.

## Discussion
We also discuss the findings of immunological studies on patients with Hodgkin's disease, other types of lymphomas, and the findings of immunological studies on patients with non-Hodgkin's disease, and also the limitations of the current treatmen.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of lymphoma in the immunocompromised population of a non-Hodgkin's disease. The incidence of lymphoma in non-Hodgkin's disease has been reported to be 0.5 to 2% in HIV-positive patients [22], and 1.5% in the immunocompetent population of HIV-positive patients [23]. However, in the immunocompetent population of HIV-infected patients, lymphoma is present at a higher incidence in patients with lymphadenitis (approximately 2% of cases), tuberculous histoplasmosis (approximately 2% of cases), and tuberculous mycosis (approximately 1% of cases). In patients with tuberculosis, a 2.7% incidence occurs in patients with lymphadenitis [24]. However, in the population of patients with tuberculosis, lymphoma was present at a 2.7% incidence. Our data suggest that lymphoma is a rare disease in non-Hodgkin's disease. The prevalence of lymphoma in HIV-positive patients is about 0.5% to 2% in the non-Hodgkin's disease cohort. However, lymphoma is an uncommon disease in HIV-infected patients. The incidence of lymphoma has been reported to be 0.3% in HIV-positive patients [25].

The present case report emphasizes the importance of lymphoma in immunocompetent patients. In the immunocompetent population of HIV-infected patients, lymphoma is present at a lower incidence than in HIV-infected patients. The prevalence of lymphoma in HIV-infected patients is about 0.4% to 1% in the non-Hodgkin's disease cohort. However, in HIV-infected patients, lymphoma is present at a lower incidence than in HIV-infected patients. In the immunocompetent population of HIV-infected patients, lymphoma is present at a lower incidence than in HIV-infected patients. The present case report emphasizes the importance of lymphoma in immunocompetent patients.
