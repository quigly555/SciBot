## Abstract
L-arginine-dependent protein kinase (LADK) regulates the expression of many proteins in eukaryotes. In this study, we identified the LADK regulator Rpdc1 in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. Using RNA-Seq profiling, we demonstrated that the deletion of the gene encoding the C-terminal lysine dephosphorylceramide synthase (Lda) did not perturb cryptococcal growth. Instead, the Lda deletion led to a decrease in both the cell wall and cell integrity, which was dependent on the loss of lysine homeostasis. These results illuminate the role of Lda in regulating fungal cell wall proteins and reveal the origin of the protective immune response that results in successful infection of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus.


## Introduction
In recent decades, the number of patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics increased substantially. The antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including the action of antibiotics, is a result of their low cytotoxic activity and the survival and antimicrobial activity of the antibiotics are related to their “knock-out” mechanism (Davoli et al., 2010). This mechanism of action is the key to their effective treatment, which requires the activity of the antibiotics to be inhibited at the bacterial cell level, which results in a significant reduction in the number of antibiotics and its concentration. The inhibition of the activity of antibiotics is referred to as “knock-out” mechanism (Riazi and Rose, 2014). Therefore, there is a growing demand for the discovery of new antibacterial agents that can act both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Natural products are an important source of antimicrobial agents (Riazi and Rose, 2014). Natural products are divided into five classes: (i) antibiotics, (ii) drugs, (iii) agents and (iv) biopesticides (Rosenthal et al., 2004). The emergence of antimicrobial drugs is a result of the occurrence of microbial resistance to existing antimicrobial agents. The multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are the major public health problem in the world. The major resistance of bacterial pathogens to antibiotics is due to the resistance of bacteria to various antibiotics. In the past decade, MDR has become a severe threat in clinical practice and the development of antimicrobial drugs has been considered as a major challenge to modern medicine. The emergence of MDR bacteria is a result of the development of antibiotic resistance among many bacteria and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which are also emerging worldwide. Hence, it is crucial to develop new antimicrobial drugs that may act against the emergence of multidrug-resistant MDR bacteria.

Natural products are considered as an important source of antibacterial agents, and natural products are an important source of novel antimicrobial agents (Rosenthal et al., 2004). Besides, natural products have important therapeutic applications (Ruiz-Garcia and Rose, 2014).


## Methods
Strains and media
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The nourseothricin-resistant C. albicans strain was isolated from the blood of a patient with a C. albicans-like disease (C. albicans ATCC 18804). The nourseothricin-resistant C. albicans strain was isolated from blood of an HIV-negative patient with a C. albicans-like disease (C. albicans ATCC 18804). The isolate was cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and incubated at 37 °C.

## Results
In the course of the operation, the patient was admitted with a fever and respiratory symptom. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital with no history of kidney or liver disease. Two days later, he died of a gastrointestinal bleeding and a CSF smear. He had been treated with intravenous antibiotics for the preceding 2 months.

The clinical presentation of the patient in the hospital was as follows: fever, vomiting, headache, seizures, and abdominal pain. He was admitted with a fever of 54.2% (40/44). He was discharged at the time of death with a 50% survival rate. He had no previous bacterial infection and was alive on admission. His CSF test was negative for any fungal pathogens. A computer-generated protein array was available to determine the fungal pathogen in the CSF. The CSF protein profile showed a statistically significant reduction in the protein level of Lactobacillus (P = 0.04; p < 0.001) and Candida (P = 0.02; p < 0.001). There was no difference in the protein levels between the control group and the Pneumocystis group.

Survival of patients with pneumonia in a severe immunocompromised patient with pneumonia
In the group with a severe infection, the surviving patient was admitted with a fever of 58.9% (29/44). The patient was initially admitted with a fever of 42.3% (22/44). After an empirical investigation of the data, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a median survival time of 11.3 days (range: 1-17.7). He had no prior bacterial infection and was alive on admission.

## Discussion
 2016.

It is possible that, with an increasing number of patients with lymphopenia, the incidence of Pneumocystis spp. infection increases with the increasing number of patients with immunocompromised conditions. This could explain the poor outcome of this patient. The observation that the case of pneumocystis pneumonia was reversed by the presence of several other pneumocystis pneumonia cases (i.e., pneumocystosis) was most likely the result of immunosuppression, and not due to an autoimmune response.

Pneumocystis spp. infection is a well-recognized infection, as the diagnosis of Pneumocystis spp. infection is challenging, as in the case of Pneumocystis pneumonia, the patient is immune-competent and may not develop Pneumocystis spp. infection in the absence of immunosuppression or an autoimmune response. Therefore, the presence of Pneumocystis spp. infection in the lungs of immunocompromised patients is highly likely.

In our case, the patient had a normal respiratory function, which was not surprising considering the fact that the patient was immunocompetent and his condition had not deteriorated. This may have contributed to the positive outcome of this case, as the patient had a good outcome despite the pulmonary symptoms. This is the first report of Pneumocystis pneumonia in a immunocompetent patient, but the clinical presentation of Pneumocystis pneumonia is not well-known.

We have reported previously that pneumocystis pneumonia, which is commonly associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RS), can also be associated with the immunocompromised state of the patient, including HIV, cirrhosis, alcoholism, diabetes, and diabetes mellitus (Gupta et al., 2008; Mondello et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014). We believe that this case was not due to a possible immunodeficiency, as we did not perform immunocomprometry, and there was no evidence of an immune-mediated or autoimmune reaction to pneumocystis pneumonia.

The presence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the lungs of immunocompromised patients is rare, although it has been reported in a few cases. For example, pneumocystis pneumonia was reported in two patients with HIV infection (Zhou et al.
