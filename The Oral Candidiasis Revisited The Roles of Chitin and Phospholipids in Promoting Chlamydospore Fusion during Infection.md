Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
A new genus and species, Fusarium avenae (Phaeophyta), is described from debris from a fallen star-in-themeddling tree in South Africa. The fungus was isolated from a pot, bark, and debris of this fallen star-in-the-meddling tree from 1902-2007 in the territory of Victoria, Australia. Morphological features and distinctive taxa are supported by morphology and sequence data, and F. avenae is further subdivided into two novel species, F. avenae canadensis and F. graminearum. F. avenae and F. avenae canadense are reported as new species, and the re-emergence of the fungus during the nineteenth century B.C.E.E. is discussed. The F. graminearum and F. avenae canadense canadensis taxa from Victoria are treated and expanded.


## Introduction
Chlamydospore formation is a key part of the maturation process of microorganisms and can be activated by the phoretic secretion of phoretin, chitin, and chitin, and the expression of chitin synthase (Chs) in vitro and in vivo (Nguyen, Shen, & Quang, 2010; Nguyen, Shen, & Quang, 2011; Nguyen, Wang, & Qiu, 2014. The chemokine that senses chitin, chitosan, and chitin is a specialized receptor that binds chitin-containing DNA and chitin. Chitin can be recognized by the chemokine by means of its receptor, CCR7, which binds the DNA-binding protein CCR7 (Cutter, B.J. , pers. comm.). Chitin synthases (Chs) are conserved proteins that are activated by the recognition of chitin and chitin-containing microorganisms (Quiet, McDonald, & Biermer, 2014). Chitin is synthesized by the synthesis of acyl-CoA:CA, and chitin is synthesized by CCA:CC, with CCA:CC being the major chitin synthase activity (Quiet, McDonald, & McDonald, 2014). Chitin and chitin bind to chitin-containing microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, and convert the molecular mass of the microorganism to ethanol and chitosan. The conversion of chitin to chitosan in the phoretic environment can then be released into the extracellular space, where it can activate the chemokine receptor (Chi3) and other chemokine receptors (Cn2 and Cn4) in the phoretic environment. The chemokine receptor family (CR3) is composed of five subtypes, which are activated by chitin-containing microorganisms, mainly by chitin-containing fungi. The CR3-type subtype of fungi is activated by chitin-containing microorganisms, such as Penicillium marneffei, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Cryptococcus neoformans, whereas the CR3-type subtype is activated by chitin-containing microorganisms, such as M. marneffei, B.


## Methods
The relevance of these studies to the recent discovery of chitin peptides in Chitin Peptides and Chitin Peptides in Infections with Chitin Peptides, was assessed by comparing the results of the tests in the oral candidiasis assays and the RPA test. In addition, the analysis of the antibacterial activity of chitin and phospholipids was performed in order to evaluate the potential protective role of Chitin Peptides on the antibacterial activity of chitin Peptides and Chitin Peptides in the oral candidiasis assays.

The antimicrobial activity of chitin Peptides was evaluated according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines [40] and by the E-test (Sigma-Aldrich).

2.3. Determination of Antimicrobial Activity of Chitin Peptides on the Antimicrobial Activity of Chitin Peptides
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the chitin Peptides were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines [41].

The antibacterial activity of chitin Peptides was determined using the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines [42], in the characterization of the effect of the antimicrobial agents on the growth of C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and the RPA test (Table 2).

## Results
albicans SC5314, in the oral cavity, is related to the fungal colonization in the oral cavit. We hypothesized that C. albicans SC5314 may have a similar effect on C. albicans SC5314 infection in the oral cavity. We further investigated the colonization of C. albicans SC5314 by C. albicans SC5314. We found that C. albicans SC5314 colonization was dependent on both chlamydospore fusion and the presence of C. albicans SC5314 (Fig 2A). C. albicans SC5314 colonized the oral cavity in a dose-dependent manner, and the growth of C. albicans SC5314 was significantly reduced in the presence of C. albicans SC5314 (Fig 2B). The addition of C. albicans SC5314 to the culture medium resulted in a much higher level of colonization than the absence of C. albicans SC5314 (Fig 2C). The results from the candidiasis study revealed that the C. albicans SC5314 colonization was independent of the presence of C. albicans SC5314 in the oral cavity, and we hypothesize that the C. albicans SC5314 colonization in the oral cavity is associated with the yeast colonization by C. albicans SC5314.

To investigate the role of chitin in C. albicans SC5314 colonization in the oral cavity, we used a commercial strain of C. albicans SC5314 as an out-patient. We found that C. albicans SC5314 did not colonize the oral cavity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2D). The addition of C. albicans SC5314 to the culture medium significantly reduced the growth of C. albicans SC5314 in the oral cavity compared to the absence of C. albicans SC5314 (Fig 2D). The results from the candidiasis study revealed that the C. albicans SC5314 colonization is associated with the yeast colonization by C. albicans SC5314.

Chitin and Phospholipid Metabolism
We found that the growth of C. albicans SC5314 in the oral cavity was dependent on chitin and phospholipid metabolism. In addition, the growth of C.


## Discussion
albicans and . neoformans in vitro. We have also demonstrated that chitin plays a key role in the production of chitin in Candida spp. during infection with host-infected C. albicans and C. neoformans. Our results confirm that phospholipid-mediated chitin synthesis is induced by C. albicans during infection with C. neoformans. This is in agreement with other studies showing that phospholipid-mediated chitin synthesis is induced by other Candida spp. (29, 45, 50).

Chitinases have also been shown to be involved in promoting Candida virulence during infection with C. albicans (51). In this study, we have shown that chitinases (CpkA, CPkA, and CPkB) and phospholipid-mediated chitin synthesis (Pmk1) are required for virulence of C. albicans. These results demonstrate that chitin and phospholipid-mediated chitin synthesis can promote Candida virulence in vitro. These results are in agreement with other studies showing that the chitin-mediated synthesis of chitin is important for the production of chitin during infection with C. albicans (52, 53).

Phospholipids play a critical role in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, especially PIMPs, in fungi (54-56). The phospholipids in PIMPs are generally phosphorylated by phosphatase C (Pc) or phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (IP_3-) (57) and are then phosphorylated by another phosphatase C (PcAMP) (58, 59). In our study, phospholipids were detected by CD-1-mediated proteolysis of PcAMP and PcAMP-mediated phospholipase C phosphatase C (PDB-mediated phospholipase C) (60). PcAMP was subsequently phosphorylated to a Ca^2+-binding complex (CaCPB) by the phosphatase C C, which is a key player in the biosynthesis of PIMPs (61).
