## Abstract
Heterocephal disability is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of supra-parietal lobular enlargement and the usual synchronous, inflammatory brain waves. Unbalanced immune responses due to the immunodeficiency state and the development of neurodegenerative disorders may contribute to the development of hemiparesis. We report a case of a young female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma on remission phase and found to be a case of H-DAD.


## Introduction
DHN-2 is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine and is one of the key immune cytokines that promote tissue injury in HIV/ AIDS patients [14. DHN-2, like other cytokines, plays a role in the innate immune system of humans, and during the course of infections, it stimulates adaptive immunity, which, in turn, promotes the immune defense against pathogens. In this regard, it has been shown that the AIDS virus has a positive role for C. albicans in promoting the immune defense against intruding pathogens [15].

The inducible trypanosomatid infections (TICI) are a global health problem and are caused by various pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and even some animal species [16]. TICI have been classified into four major groups according to the pathogen’s genetic origin and immune status. These TICI are acquired by different pathogens during the infection process and include acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [17], acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [18] and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [19]. The AIDS virus is one of the major pathogens of AIDS patients, infecting them with the extremely rapid infection process, in a few days [20]. The symptoms of AIDS and AIDS-related TICI are reported in 15-20% of the cases and include acute, sub-acute, respiratory and central respiratory failure, death [21].

Tight adherence of the host immune system to its innate and acquired immune system is crucial for the survival of the microorganism. Bacterial cells, in particular neutrophils, are the main cells that contact the host, and they are mainly involved in the extracellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, but they also secrete proteins that regulate the immune system [22]. Bacteria secrete a variety of extracellular molecules, including peptides, lipopeptides, lipopeptides and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [23]. Several peptides and lipopeptides were found in the ECM of the host during the infection process.


## Methods
er. strains Sch. sp. and L. sp. were selected as these fungi are present in non-toxic, in vitro, and in vivo conditions. Two R. erz. strains from R. sp. and R. erz. species, R. sp. and R. erz. sp. and R. sp. and L. sp. were selected for the study. The Candida species used in this study is Candida glabrata and R. erz. sp. Isolate GGP1. Isolate BECL4 is a diploid, single-cell derivative of the glucone-elements and is known to be used as a source of non-toxic and in vitro-treated Candida cells. The isolate BECL4 (N.W.) was kindly provided by the Chinese Yeast Culture Collection Center (China) and is a clinical isolate of Candida glabrata (C. glabrata). The isolate BECL4 is a diploid, single-cell derivative of the glucone-elements and is known to be used as a source of non-toxic and in vitro-treated Candida cells. The isolate BECL4 (S.W.) was kindly provided by the Chinese Yeast Culture Collection Center (China). The C. glabrata isolate BECL4 (A.W.) was kindly provided by the Chinese Yeast Culture Collection Center (China) and is a clinical isolate of Candida glabrata (C. glabrata).

Cell culture, agar-solidified, and storage of culture supernatants
The cell culture was conducted according to the standard protocol [41] with the exception that the culture media and solidified media were sterilized at 121°C for 2 h. The collected culture supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were stored at -20°C until use.

In vitro cell culture of Candida glabrata
The cell culture of Candida glabrata was performed according to the protocol described by Liu et al. [42] with the exception that the culture media was sterilized at 121°C for 2 h.


## Results

Epiphytic fungi from medicinal plant Bauhinia s. (Sharma, 1971)
Among the epiphytic fungi from medicinal plant Bauhinia sporithrix reesei, two species were found to be associated with animal skin (Fig 2) (Sharma, 1971). One of these species was named as Myrothecium acerinum (Sharma, 1971), and the other as Myrothecium acerinum (Sharma, 1971). The latter species was named as T. acerinum in the phylogenetic tree constructed by the combined sequence analysis (Fig 2).

T. acerinum has been described as a pathogen of plant material and has been shown to cause disease on plant tissues, and also as a potential human pathogen (Furtado, 1967). Therefore, the fungus was renamed T. acerinum acerinum. The phylogenetic tree based on the combined sequence analysis of the two species of Myrothecium acerinum (Fig 2) showed that T. acerinum was closely related to the Myrothecium acerinum clade and was not closely related to the T. acerinum acerinum clade. However, the phylogenetic tree based on the combined sequence analysis of T. acerinum and T. acerinum was not well supported (Fig 2). In the following study, we will focus on the phylogenetic analyses of the three species of Myrothecium acerinum in order to test the hypothesis that T. acerinum is a potential human pathogen.

T. acerinum acerinum (T. acerinum) is a pathogen of plant material and has been shown to cause disease on plant tissues, and also as a potential human pathogen (Furtado, 1967). Therefore, the fungus was named T. acerinum acerinum (T. acerinum).

T. acerinum acerinum (T. acerinum) was described by T. acerinum in the phylogenetic tree constructed by the combined sequence analysis of T. acerinum and T. acerinum (Fig 2). T.


## Discussion

In our study, the tested fungi demonstrated strong biofilm formation by . dermatitidis and G. mellea in biofilm formation assay and biofilm formation assay, respectively. These results demonstrate that the fungal strains could be used for biofilm formation by B. dermatitidis and G. mellea, which was confirmed in our study. This result has been reported previously by other researchers, but no studies have been published on the biofilm formation by this fungus. This is the first report about the biofilm formation by B. dermatitidis and G. mellea, and the results showed that they were able to increase the biofilm formation in the biofilm of B. dermatitidis.

The results of our study show that the Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20 showed high biofilm formation and some biofilm formation with Bacillus sp. in biofilm assay, and the biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20. The biofilm formation increased after treatment with Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20 and B. dermatitidis, and the biofilm formation was increased by B. dermatitidis. We hypothesize that this strain is able to enhance the biofilm formation of B. dermatitidis by enhancing the biofilm formation of B. dermatitidis.

The results of our study showed that the Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20 showed strong biofilm formation and biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20, and the biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20. The biofilm formation was increased by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20 and B. dermatitidis, and the biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20, and B. dermatitidis, and the biofilm formation was increased by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20. The biofilm formation was increased by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20 and B. dermatitidis, and the biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20, and B. dermatitidis, and the biofilm formation was enhanced by Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.20.

The results of our study showed that the Bacillus sp. strain CBS 207.
