## Abstract
We present a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient with multiple sclerosis with a history of several autoimmune diseases. The patient had been taking fluconazole therapy for the past 10 years. The diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was made on the basis of the culture and histopathology of the isolated lung tissue. The patient was treated with voriconazole, and the patient’s condition improved. The patient was in a better condition with fluconazole therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was confirmed on the basis of the isolated lung tissue. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are very important for the outcome of this patient.


## Introduction
alternata, and . nidulans, were identified [7,8]. While the latter two species are associated with more severe sepsis and septicemia, the latter is often associated with a less severe disease [9].

The cause of aseptic sepsis is thought to be due to microbial overgrowth, not by the infection itself [10,11]. However, it is often the perception of a condition that induces the expression of excessive vacuole activity, which causes the formation of the pericentric plexuses, a narrowing gap between the cell surface and the outside environment, which leads to the production of an extensive set of cysts, which eventually lead to the death of the infected tissue. This situation is often referred to as the “pseudo-epitomereosis” and is commonly referred to as an inflammation of the pericentric plexus. The growth of these cysts is usually accompanied by the formation of suture-like structures, which are not easily ruptured and do not allow access to the cysts to be seen [12,13]. The formation of suture-like structures can be detected on the tissue surface, in the cysts and in the inguinal spaces between the cysts. When the suture is not applied, cysts can develop that are covered with pus or nodules, which can be used to cause aseptic sepsis.

It is believed that the infection starts with a pulmonary infection, which can progress to a systemic infection if the infection is not contained in the body [14]. As a consequence of the infection, the body becomes a sink for the excessive growth of the septic cells, which in turn releases more toxins and infectious particles [15]. Once the body becomes a sink, the bacteria in the body become pathogenic to the host. Therefore, the infection is seen as an important factor that leads to the development of invasive diseases in the host, including otitis media, which are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality [16].

The pathogenic bacteria are divided into three groups, namely, those that can cause septic shock and those that can cause inflammation of the pericentric plexus [17,18].


## Methods
graminis (. gramini) capsule from the capsule of P. graminis, a highly virulent genus, and the first step was to obtain the P. graminis capsule from P. urinos (R. urinos), a pathogenic species, in which P. graminis was used as a source of food. The second step was to obtain the P. expansum (P. expansum), a pathogenic species, and the third step was to obtain the P. expansum from P. trichosporum, a pathogenic species, in which P. trichosporum was used as a source of food. The fourth step was to obtain the P. terreus, a pathogenic species, and the fifth step was to obtain the P. terreus from P. teres.

2.2. Fungal Isolates and Growth Media Preparation
The P. expansum isolate P. expansum was isolated from a rice field in the southernmost part of Yunnan Province of China, which is located in the Yunnan People’s Autonomous County, Yunnan Province (19°35'50.8”N and 39°39'08.9”E) (Table 1). P. expansum isolate was used as the control. The cultures of P. expansum and P. terreus were maintained at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity for the cultivation period. The fungal isolates were cultured on malt extract agar (MEA) (20 g of malt extract, 20 g of peptone, 20 g of glucose, 1 g of agar per liter of water, 1 L of distilled water, and 15 g of yeast extract) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) (20 g of cornmeal, 10 g of dextrose, and 20 g of dextrose per liter of water). The mycelium was harvested by filtration, washed with tap water, and then transferred to a sterile glass tube containing 15 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDB) (20 g of cornmeal, 20 g of dextrose, and 10 g of yeast extract per liter of water). The mycelium was adjusted to a final density of 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/ml.


## Results
. Fludioxonil and Flucenamic Acid Reduces the Growth of M. tuberculosis

The MIC values of fludioxonil and flucenamic acid for M. tuberculosis, as well as fludioxonil for M. tuberculosis, were determined using the MIC_50 method in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (Table 2). In the presence of fludioxonil, the MIC values of fludioxonil and flucenamic acid decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Fludioxonil and flucenamic acid were less effective against M. tuberculosis than fludioxonil (P < 0.05).

## Discussion
stercorellis, a transient vegetative growth event involving the secretory pathway of cells [34. It is clear that the metalloproteinase of Leucosporidium endoglucans was required for the production of the necessary antifungal factors for the successful infection of Pandoraea spp.

In the model fungus P. brasiliensis, the role of the secreted proteases is crucial for the virulence of the pathogen. For example, the LysM-like serine protease from P. lutzii was involved in the infection of the Galleria mellonella larva [35] and the Drosophila melanogaster [36]. In the model fungus Magnaporthe grisea, the serine protease from P. lutzii was involved in the infection of P. affinis [37]. The same serine protease from P. grisea was also found to be necessary for the successful infection of C. neoformans [38]. The C. neoformans serine protease was found to be required for the successful infection of Cryptococcus gattii [39]. Interestingly, in this study, the serine protease from P. brasiliensis was found to be required for the virulence of P. brasiliensis, suggesting that the serine protease from this species is also required for the pathogenesis of this fungus.

The major components of the protein complexes encoded by the pathogenic genes are important for the pathogenicity of the pathogen. Two major components of the protein complexes encoded by the pathogenic genes are well-known for their role in virulence in the model fungus P. brasiliensis. The first component, Ser72, was previously known to be essential for the virulence of the pathogen in C. neoformans [40]. The second component, Ser101, was predicted to be involved in the production of virulence factors in P. brasiliensis [41]. In the model fungus B. dermatitidis, the LysM-like serine protease from P. lutzii was involved in the infection of the Galleria mellonella larva and the severe growth of the pathogen [42]. In this study, the LysM-like protease from P. brasiliensis was found to be critical for the infection of the P.
