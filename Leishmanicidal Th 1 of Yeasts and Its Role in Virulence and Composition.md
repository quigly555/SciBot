## Introduction
Yeast cells play a key role in the virulence of various bacterial pathogens and are responsible for the emergence of resistance to antimicrobials, such as Streptococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [20. Yeast cells also play a role in the development of the virulence of various viruses, including Streptococci [21], mycobacteria [22], and the bacterial pathogen Enterococcus faecium [23]. In addition, the yeast species and the yeast-to-hypha morphological transition are associated with the virulence of some pathogens [24]. It has been reported that the yeasts and other hyphae are able to colonize the human lung in vivo [25].

Yeasts are known to be able to generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during yeast growth [26]. The accumulation of ROS can cause tissue damage, resulting in cell death, and the formation of diseases such as carcinomas, lung cancer, and brain tumors [27]. In addition, the presence of ROS can cause oxidative stress, leading to oxidative stress and cellular injury, which can lead to tissue damage and death [28]. Since the host immune system can sense and respond to ROS in response to different pathogens, the host immune cells use various strategies to defend against oxidative stress [29].

Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes a lethal disease called invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which is responsible for approximately half of all IPA cases [30]. The fungus causes various diseases ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the lung to life-threatening invasive disease [31]. A. fumigatus is able to grow in various morphological forms, such as asci, asci-like, heterokaryons, diencephalic cells, hyphae, and spores [32]. The ability of A. fumigatus to switch between these morphologies is dependent on its morphotype, which has been characterized as asexual or sexual morph. The switch is induced by exposure to a broad range of environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, oxygen, oxidative stress, and biofilm formation [33].

The switch to the sexual morph is a major virulence trait of A. fumigatus. The switch is induced by both oxidative and non- oxidative stresses, including heat shock and heat shock [34].


## Methods
[24. The yeast biomass was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were washed with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO_4, pH 8.4) containing protease inhibitors (50 mM sodium ascorbate, 50 mM ß-glycerophosphate, 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C for further analysis.

For the determination of the dose-response relationship between the strains, we performed the following equation: (C) = (K-C) where K is the concentration of the drug that significantly affects the growth of the strain, C is the dose-response ratio between the strains, and C_K is the concentration of the drug that significantly affects the growth of the strain. We tested three different doses (0.125 to 0.5 mg/kg) in a total volume of 200 µL, which was composed of 0.125 to 0.5 mg/kg, 1.5 to 1.5 mg/kg, and 3.5 to 5 mg/kg. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

To determine the influence of oxidative stress on the yeast cell viability and viability of the tested strains, the experiments were performed in triplicate. The yeast cell viability was evaluated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) [25]. The FICI value is the ratio of the FICI value of the control strain to the tested strain. For the FICI values of the tested strains, the following equation was used: (C) = (K-C) where K_c is the concentration of the drug that significantly affects the growth of the strain, C_k is the concentration of the drug that significantly affects the growth of the strain, and C_k_c_k is the concentration of the drug that significantly affects the growth of the strain. The experiments were performed in triplicate.


## Results
neoformans in a murine model of cryptococcal meningiti. The intranasal inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with 10^6 yeast cells of the previously described C. neoformans strain H99 resulted in a marked reduction in virulence compared to the single inoculation with yeast cells of the WT strain H99 (Fig 7). The total virulence of the H99 strain was approximately 10-fold less than that of the H99 strain (Fig 7A). The C. neoformans strain was avirulent in mouse models of cryptococcal meningitis and had no apparent role in C. neoformans virulence.

We next asked whether Th1 deletion could affect the virulence of C. neoformans in the murine host. We inoculated C57BL/6 mice with 10^6 yeast cells of the previously described C. neoformans strain H99, and we then monitored the virulence of C. neoformans in the murine model of cryptococcal meningitis. We found that in the mice inoculated with 10^6 yeast cells of the H99 strain, the virulence of the C. neoformans strain was significantly attenuated compared to the H99 strain (Fig 7B). This finding is consistent with the previous results from the murine model of cryptococcal meningitis in which the virulence of the C. neoformans strain was attenuated compared to the H99 strain (29). We also found that the C. neoformans strain was avirulent in the murine model of cryptococcal meningitis compared to the H99 strain. This finding is consistent with the previous results from the murine model of cryptococcal meningitis in which the virulence of the C. neoformans strain was avirulent compared to the H99 strain (29).

Taken together, our data suggest that Th1-mediated signaling pathway in C. neoformans is involved in the virulence of C. neoformans.

## Discussion
The key virulence factors of yeast are virulence-associated proteins such as virulence factor alpha (VfA), cell wall integrity (VfB), and melanin production (VfM. The two genes involved in melanin biosynthesis, VfA and VfB, are highly expressed in Candida spp. (29). Yeast VfA and VfB are required for the normal growth of Candida spp. in vitro (30). Additionally, the virulence factors of yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of Candida albicans (31). The yeasts, including Candida krusei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cryptococcus neoformans, have been found to have several virulence factors (32, 33). Yeast VfB is required for the normal growth of Candida albicans (34). The yeast VfA is involved in the normal growth of Candida albicans (35), and the VfB is required for the normal growth of Candida krusei (36). The VfA gene is required for normal virulence of Candida spp. in mice (27, 28, 37). The genes involved in the metabolism of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (AAD) pathway are present in the VfA gene of C. albicans (28), but their function is not yet clear (38). The VfB gene is present in the VfA gene of C. albicans (28), but its function is not yet clear (38). The VfA gene is present in the VfB gene of C. albicans (28), but its function is not yet clear (38).

The VfM gene is present in the VfA gene of C. albicans (28), but its function is not yet clear (38). The VfM gene is present in the VfB gene of C. albicans (28), but its function is not yet clear (38). The VfM gene is present in the VfA gene of C. albicans (28), but its function is not yet clear (38).
