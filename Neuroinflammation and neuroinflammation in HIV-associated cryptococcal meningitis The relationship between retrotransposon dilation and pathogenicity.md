## Abstract
Microbial communities are the first step in the microbial response to stress. The acquisition of these communities leads to pathogen adaptation and the regulation of microbial gene expression, which is crucial for the pathogenesis of many microbial diseases. Although there are many studies about the role of the microbiome in human health, little is known about the importance of this group of natural people, or microbiome in health. In this study, we performed an ecological survey of human health from November 2013 to May 2018, collecting and applying metagenomic and genome-wide comparative genome analysis.

We obtained 177 health-related datasets and processed 4,056 health-related data sets (including community and bacterial community and bacterial genome data, and their primary/secondary genomes) using Roche 454q and RocheOverlabs' MicrobeDB databases. The metagenomic data were assembled into 68,198 pyrosequencing reads. The processing time for sequencing reads was calculated to take place months after collection. Additionally, data on health-related microbiome entries were analyzed using EpiPath and Mannix profilers.

Community and bacterial community composition changed in 73% of the samples. The bacterial populations were significantly subdivided (P < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between community composition and 6-fold change in Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria (P < 0.001). The bacterial populations with a significant positive correlation (P < 0.001) were in 30% of the samples with a moderate positive correlation (P < 0.001).

Community-related microbiome entries provide a useful resource for studying the impacts of community membership on microbial communities.


## Introduction
. Mycoses Involving the Airway and Bronchiectasia
The respiratory tract is the major site of colonization by microorganisms. Each year, more than 150,000 people colonize the airway and bronchiacasia [1]. The prevalence of respiratory tract infections is ~50% in healthy individuals, and can range from 3 to 20% in immunocompromised patients [2]. The etiology of the infections is not yet clear. The incidence of respiratory tract infections varies by disease group, and ranges from asymptomatic colonization of the bronchi to invasive bronchitis, persistent infection with bronchial pneumonia and invasive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3].

Despite this high incidence of respiratory tract infections, fungal infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the respiratory tract and in the surrounding air. The most common pathogenic fungi that cause fungal infections in the respiratory tract include: Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans.


## Methods

The neuroinflammation and neuroinflammation in cryptococcal meningitis, such as hyperalachitic encephalopathy (SEM), haemolytic encephalopathy (HEM), and deep encephalopathy (DEM), are often the causative agents of post-infection CNS infections [27, 28. Neuroinflammation is a common cause of CNS infection, with a large proportion of infected patients presenting with a strong form of CNS infection, such as cerebral edema, stroke, or a seizure [28]. The neuroinflammation is also common in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [28, 29, 30].

To determine the role of retrotransposon dilation in CNS infections, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a group of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients with CSF pathology, and the association between retrotransposon dilation and neuroinflammation in cryptococcal meningitis was determined. In this study, CNS infection was defined as an increase in CSF density or volume of CSF by at least 10% over the previous 12 months in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.

We used the protocol of the Translational Neurology and Therapy (to Previously Known Nerve Damage in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis), established in the Department of Neurology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia [31, 32]. A total of 2-month-old HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients and 6-month-old HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients were included in this study. We used the protocol of the Translational Neurology and Treatment (to Previously Known Nerve Damage in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis), established in the Department of Neurology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia [33].


## Results
For example, the genome of . neoformans and C. gattii (Supplementary Materials 6), as well as the genome of S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Materials 6) and C. neoformans var. grubii (Supplementary Materials 6), respectively, are predicted to be involved in pathogenicity. However, C. neoformans var. grubii is not required for virulence or pathogenicity (Supplementary Materials 5). To assess the role of retrotransposon dilation in fungal pathogenicity, we first compared the genome sequences of the fungal pathogens C. neoformans var. grubii (H99), C. neoformans var. neoformans (NCU00857), and C. neoformans var. neoformans (NCU03940). Using the concatenated sequences, we identified 70,090 and 22,006 differentially expressed genes in C. neoformans var. grubii (Supplementary Materials 7). As a result, we have annotated 98,724 differentially expressed genes in C. neoformans var. grubii (Supplementary Materials 7), including 42,947 genes that are not in C. neoformans var. neoformans or C. neoformans var. neoformans, and 61,904 genes that are not in C. neoformans var. grubii (Supplementary Materials 7).

We next examined the relationship between retrotransposon dilation and pathogenicity. Retrotransposon dilation is known to be associated with the retrovirus lineage leading to C. neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 2A,B). However, we found no relationship between retrotransposon dilation and pathogenicity (Supplementary Materials 8). We further explored the relationship between retrotransposon dilation and pathogenicity by comparing the genomes of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans. Compared to the genomes of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans, we found that the genomes of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var.


## Discussion
neoformans
We previously showed that . neoformans penetrates into the brain and lives inside the host through the cell-type specific transposon dilation of the nuclear factor PTR3, which is normally located in the plasma membrane and activated in the plasma membrane [35]. This transposon disrupts the plasma membrane integrity and induces apoptosis, which leads to cell death. Similarly, C. neoformans penetrates into the brain via the transposon dilation of the nuclear factor PTR3, which is normally located in the plasma membrane and activated in the plasma membrane [35]. In the present study, we found that the C. neoformans genome is significantly enriched in transposable elements and multiple copies of transposable elements in C. neoformans. C. neoformans undergoes nuclear translocation by transposon dilation and nuclear translocation by transposon dilation and nuclear translocation by transposon dilation, respectively. Nuclear translocation by transposon dilation occurs when transposable elements are integrated into the cytoplasmic membrane. Nuclear translocation by transposon dilation results in translocation of nucleosomes and cytoplasmic membranes, which results in cytoplasmic membrane rupture and death [35]. Furthermore, transposable elements are also transported to the nucleus through cis-translational trans-proteins that are activated by transposon dilation and nuclear translocation [36]. Thus, transposable elements are a key component in the brainâ€™s transposon-induced neuroinflammation and neuroinflammation. The transposable elements play a role in the onset of neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, respectively. Thus, these transposable elements play a role in the onset of neuroinflammation.

Additionally, our data showed that C. neoformans is a prominent causal agent of neuroinflammation, including neuroinflammation in the brain, with the onset of neuroinflammation and neuroinflammation in the right eye. In addition, the C. neoformans genome is significantly enriched in transposable elements and multiple copies of transposable elements in C. neoformans. C. neoformans undergoes transposable element transposition by transposon dilation and nuclear translocation.
