Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Cocos nucifera (L.) (Arecaceae) is a plant widely used in South-east Asia for the treatment of asthma, rheumatism, asthma drug hypersensitivity and polymyositis. Here we report the draft genome sequence of a C. nucifera var. bantiana var. bantiana from China. The full-length cDNAs of 29 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1, 5.8S, 28S) and 3.5S rDNA were deposited in GenBank.


## Introduction
 2004; Clemons and Fink, 2011. The ability to detect and quantify infectious species has been widely used for decades to classify microbes and molecular patterns of their interactions (Kozel and Iacobolitos, 2010; Forastiero et al., 2010; Samuels et al., 2012). Although the bacterial microbiome is not well-described, it has been reported to be associated with various diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory bowel disease (IACD), systemic, respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases (Jansen et al., 2014; Caffrey et al., 2015; Aitken et al., 2015). The genus Enterobacteriaceae is a phylum and a large number of members are found in the soil, especially in soil associated with plants and animal droppings. They are associated with both plants and animals, but are also present in human faeces. In most cases, they are associated with specific pathogens, such as Legionella, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus.

The genus Enterobacteriaceae is divided into four subgenera: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Salmonella. Some enterobacteriaceae are commonly found in human stool and are responsible for infections in the majority of patients with indwelling devices. The term “Enterococcus” is used for all members of the Enterobacteriaceae subgroup. This family of bacteria can cause different diseases, including enterocolitis, pneumonitis and enterocolitis externa (Kozel and Iacobolitos, 2010). They also cause pneumonia (colitis) and some patients also develop neuroinfections (Kozel and Iacobolitos, 2010). In addition, some enterococcus can be associated with various human infections including, but not limited to, urinary tract infections, urinary tract infection, urinary pseudoepithelium, liver abscess, colitis and viral infections (Rojas et al., 2011; Aitken et al., 2015). Several studies have shown that several pathogens can be identified and distinguished from Enterobacteriaceae in clinical microbiology laboratories (Aitken et al., 2015). For instance, Enterobacteriaceae can be distinguished from Pseudomonas spp.


## Methods
The study is now known as NCT0150775.

For this study, we screened samples from all patients who presented with persistent cough or fever at the hospital center between January 2010 and May 2013. The sample was considered positive if the specimen showed a distinct culture of pathogen in the brain. A second positive result was considered negative if the specimen showed a single or several pathogen in the other part of the body.

All patients were screened by a trained pathologist and patients were screened by the attending hospitalologist. Candidates who met all the following criteria were considered positive for pulmonary tuberculosis: (1) positive blood culture, (2) positive CSF stain, (3) positive blood culture, (4) positive CSF smear, (5) positive CSF smear, and (6) positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test. Candidates who were excluded from the study were those who were unable to provide documentation of a proven disease, or who did not meet the criteria for a laboratory diagnosis.

Demographic and Clinical Information
The clinical information of the study participants was collected on admission and during the hospitalization.

Ethical Committee on the Use of Human Resources Resources (Comittee) for Public Health Service (Comittee), Affiliated Hospital of the University of Georgia (Comittee), and Ethical Committee of University of Georgia (Comittee)

Definitions
Cases were defined as a patient who presented with persistent cough or fever within 6 days of admission to the hospital center. Patients with persistent cough or fever from a previous period of hospitalization were classified as meningoencephalitis. Patients who were treated successfully and received treatment were classified as meningoencephalitis.

Laboratory diagnosis was performed by:

A positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test, (MS) culture, or (4) a culture showing positive CSF stain, by an infectious agent.

A positive culture of pathogen, such as a blood culture, a positive CSF smear, or a culture of pathogen with positive CSF stain, by a pathogen with a bacterium in the tissue, such as Streptomyces spp. or Streptomyces spp. or Fusarium spp.


## Results
fischeri isolates are presented in Table . The clinical and molecular characteristics are presented in Table 2. The nucleotide sequence data are presented in the Supporting Information (S1 File).

The isolates were identified from the peripheral blood of the eyes and the brain. The isolates were identified as Neospora spp. (n = 34), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 3), and Candida spp. (n = 2).

The molecular identification results of all isolates are shown in Table 3. The molecular identification results are presented in the Supporting Information (S1 File).

All isolates were identified as the same species, Neospora spp. (n = 30), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 3), and Candida spp. (n = 2).

All isolates were isolated from the eye of a child. The isolates were isolated from the eye of a child.

The isolates were isolated from blood from a patient with suspected tubercular Aspergillosis. The blood sample was taken within 24 hours of the sample being taken. The blood sample was taken within 4-6 hours of the sample being taken. The isolate was identified as Cryptococcus spp. (n = 13), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 3), and Candida spp. (n = 2).

The clinical characteristics of the N. fischeri isolates are presented in Table 4. The clinical characteristics of the isolates are presented in Table 5. The clinical characteristics of the isolates are presented in Table 6. The clinical characteristics of the isolates are presented in Table 7.

The most common pathogens identified in the isolate samples were Aspergillus spp. (n = 15), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 5), Candida spp. (n = 2), and Cryptococcus spp. (n = 2). The most common pathogens identified in the isolates were Aspergillus spp. (n = 4), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 5), and Candida spp. (n = 2). The most common pathogens identified in the isolates were Aspergillus spp. (n = 14), Cryptococcus spp. (n = 2), and Candida spp. (n = 1).


## Discussion

The identification of .coli in the patients' organs was confirmed by histological examination. This organism is a human pathogen, and it is commonly found in the environment, especially in the lungs and heart, and is capable of causing infection in the immunocompetent host. E.coli was detected in the blood samples of patients, and this was confirmed by histological examination. However, the number of E.coli was smaller in the patients' blood, and the identification was not confirmed by histological examination. The identification of E.coli was restricted by the use of a highly sensitive and specific PCR assay, and the isolation was not possible by histological examination.

The patient's initial presentation showed a severe sepsis, and he was subsequently diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a bacterial disease of the respiratory system that was previously diagnosed in another patient. The patient's symptoms improved in time, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination. This is the first report of PML in a patient with E.coli.

The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics, and this was also confirmed by histological examination. He had a good response to intravenous antibiotics, and this was confirmed by histological examination.

The patient's clinical condition improved after three months of intravenous antibiotics treatment, and his clinical symptoms improved after three months of intravenous antibiotics treatment. The patient's symptoms improved after three months of intravenous antibiotics treatment, and this was confirmed by histological examination. This was the first report of PML in a patient with E.coli.
