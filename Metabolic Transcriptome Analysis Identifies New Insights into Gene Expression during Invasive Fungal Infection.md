## Abstract
The long-term survival of most microbial pathogens depends on early recruitment of gut microbial communities. Chitosan, a polysaccharide produced by the gut microbiome, has been shown to have antimicrobial activities against some microbial pathogens, including the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. In this study, we investigated the effects of chitosan supplementation on the intestinal bacterial community of C. albicans and human neutrophils. We found that chitosan reduced the relative abundances of C. albicans and neutrophils in the gut compared to wild type and chs3<U+2206> mice. Chitosan treatment reduced the abundance of fungi and increased the relative abundance of bacteria in the gut, which correlated with neutrophil abundance. Supplementation of chitosan partially suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6, in neutrophils. In conclusion, our results suggest that supplementation of chitosan decreases the fungal and neutrophil microbiota communities, which may promote C. albicans pathogenesis.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with impaired immunity, as well as in HIV/AIDS patients [1,2]. It is estimated that one million cases of meningitis occur annually in the developing world [3]. The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system and the lungs, with the highest incidence in the elderly and in patients with other immunocompromised conditions. The central nervous system is usually well controlled and the brain is usually spared from infection. However, the lungs are a critical site of infection. The presence of microbes in the lungs can lead to a range of diseases, including meningoencephalitis, anaphylaxis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and even pneumocystosis [4]. In a recent review, we highlighted a large cohort of patients with HIV/AIDS, who were diagnosed with cryptococcosis at their earliest presentation with subsequent follow-up with intensive cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, which showed that CrAg screening led to a significant reduction in the incidence of CM and was associated with a reduced risk of mortality.

Here, we present a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with HIV/AIDS, who was followed up with CrAg screening after he had received a diagnosis of CrAg deficiency. We provide a comprehensive overview of the screening process, and the importance of CrAg screening in the management of HIV/AIDS patients.


## Methods
Our goal was to obtain as many information on Fungi as possibl. We have searched PubMed and SciFinder (www.scifinder.org) to collect as many relevant scientific articles and to collect additional information on all the available published articles. In addition to this, we have also reviewed the publications on fungi, metazoan fungi, bacterial fungi, and bacterial fungi in order to find relevant articles. The search was carried out by using the search terms “fungi”, “fungal”, “fungal metazoan”, and “fungal metazoan”.

We compared the results of Fungi Studies Consortium (2011) and SciFinder (www.sfinder.org) to determine the relevance of the above search terms and the relevant taxonomic groups in the reported studies. We used the following groups: fungi, metazoan fungi, bacteria, archaea, and fungi. We used a total of 8,052 data points, of which 1,610 were fungi; 7,596 were metazoan fungi; and 3,580 were metazoans. The other 6,883 were metazoans. This comparison of the results of these two searches revealed that, in terms of a list of metazoan fungi, metazoan metazoans were the most predominant.

Finally, we compared the results of Fungi Studies Consortium (2011) and SciFinder (www.sfinder.org) to determine the relevance of the above search terms and the relevant taxonomic groups in the reported studies. This comparison of the results of these two searches revealed that, in terms of a list of metazoan fungi, metazoan metazoans were the most predominant.

## Results
These transcripts include the important multidrug resistance genes (MBR1, MRR1, MRR2, MRR3), the important multidrug resistance gene MDR1 (MLR1, MLR2, MRR2, MRR3), the fungal-associated amino acid transporters (BFS1, BFS2, BFS3), and the protective melanin-associated amino acid transporters (LAC1, LAC2, LAC3. All three MDR genes are upregulated during fungal infection, and these genes are also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2). The MDR2 gene is one of the most highly expressed genes during invasive fungal infection, and it has a high expression level during invasive fungal infection. The MRR2 gene is upregulated during fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2). The MRR3 gene is upregulated during invasive fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes (Table 2).

The MDR1 gene is one of the most highly expressed genes during invasive fungal infection, and it is also upregulated during fungal infection. The MRR1 gene is upregulated during invasive fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2). The MRR3 gene is upregulated during invasive fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2). The LAC1 gene is upregulated during invasive fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2). The LAC2 gene is upregulated during invasive fungal infection, and this gene is also enriched in the transcripts associated with the virulence-related genes in the virulence-related genes (Table 2).

We then investigated the gene expression patterns of these transcripts in response to fungal infection.


## Discussion
The main aim of this study was to determine the role of the Arginine-rich family of protein-coupled ATPases in the response to oxidative stress in response to stress-induced oxidative stress.
