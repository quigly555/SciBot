## Abstract
In this study, we first identified the B-cell lymphoid-specific de novo encoding (BCMD) transcription factor as a novel regulator of diverse invasive fungal pathogenicity. Here, we use BMD as a tool to understand how it influences the host response to infection. We then identify other regulators involved in fungal infection, such as the HLAogen Vibrio type-IV Hax capsular polysaccharide. We find that several B-cell cytokines, including de novo BCR3 and de novo HLA11, are induced following fungal infection. These regulatory pathways are distinct from those common in human pathogenic fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus. Finally, we identify a role for the BMD factor BCR3 in virulence.


## Introduction
The genus Eucalyptus belongs to a family of white-rot fungi that are common inhabitants of the subtler regions of the temperate and subtropical regions and are found in the deciduous and montane regions of North America. Some of them, like E. ornata and E. wickerhamii, are considered saprophytes or parasites of Eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus species are important medicinal fungi in folk medicine and traditional medicine that have been used for thousands of years in different parts of the world. It has been estimated that over 1 million species have been recorded in the Eucalyptaceae, and approximately 20,000 species are known worldwide. In the United States alone, approximately 18,000 species are known to occur in a single calendar year, with most of these occurring in the eastern United States and the south of South America. Approximately 35,000 species are known to occur in Europe and the Mediterranean area.

The genus Eucalyptus has been traditionally classified as white-rot fungi, with a variety of major genera found in the tropics and subtropes. Several species, like E. wickerhamii, E. ornata, E. ornata-are associated with plant diseases, like black rot, black stomper, and scab scab disease, and some, like E. wickerhamii-are associated with plant diseases. However, a recent study reported the existence of an unidentified species in the Eucalyptus family, which is distributed in the tropics and subtropes but rarely described in literature. The species E.


## Methods
Isolation of GFP-CdcM from the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected individuals
We isolated GFP-CdcM from the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected individuals (Supplementary Table 1). Briefly, the GFP-CdcM was isolated by puncture of the halo, and the transposable elements were then removed by the addition of 10 µg/ml G418 solution. The transposable elements were then removed by lysis of the cells by the addition of 1 mL of HBSS and incubation for 5 min at 37°C. The cell-free supernatant was then collected, and the gels were stained with 10% polyacrylamide gels and viewed with a transmission electron microscope (model 7900; Jena, Jena, Germany). The gels were then subjected to flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the number of CD4^+ T cell-associated T cells (CD4^+ T cells).

Fungal burden of GFP-CdcM
The fungal burden of GFP-CdcM was determined using the colony-forming units (CFU) assay [17], [18], [19]. Briefly, the fungus was cultured in 50 ml of complete medium at 37°C. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation, and the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the non-adherent cells. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged again. The pellet was washed with PBS to remove the non-adherent cells. The pellets were then resuspended in 500 µl of PBS and subjected to microscopic analysis. The number of CFU per gram of tissue was calculated. The fungal burden was then expressed as the percentage of cells in the WT group, the FFP-CdcM group, and the FFP-CdcM-FFP group.


## Results
In addition, the absence of p-glycosylation in . brasiliensis brain infection model suggests that P. brasiliensis is more fit in the brain infection model than the other four pathogens.

P. brasiliensis brain infection model predicts less white matter in the brain
To investigate the role of white matter in P. brasiliensis brain infection model, we investigated the role of white matter in the brain infection model. In addition, we compared the white matter of P. brasiliensis brain infection model. Results are presented in Table 1. The white matter in the brain infection model was similar to that of the model with oculomotor and ventricular events, but the white matter of P. brasiliensis brain infection model was significantly smaller than the model with oculomotor and ventricular events.

P. brasiliensis brain infection model predicts lower brain volume in the early larval stage
The effect of the initial larval stage of P. brasiliensis brain infection model on the brain volume in the early larval stage is shown in Fig 5. The brain volume was similar in the early larval stage and the late larval stage to that of the model with oculomotor and ventricular events.

P. brasiliensis brain infection model predicts greater brain infection frequency in the early larval stage
The brain infection model predicts greater brain infection frequency in the early larval stage of P. brasiliensis. The brain infection model predicts greater infection frequency in the early larval stage of P. brasiliensis compared to the other four pathogens (Fig 5).

## Discussion
This intricate network includes a signalling pathway for aflatoxin synthesis and phosphatases and a signalling pathway for the detoxification of toxic substances, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and signal transduction for DNA synthesis and translation (Table 1.

The overall degree of fungal intracellular signalling was mainly influenced by the species of Paracoccidioides
The presence of a signal peptide in the secreted protein sequence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, indicative of intracellular signalling, was detected in the appressorium of the wild-type strain, but not in the appressorium of the mutant. This signal peptide was also present in the intracellular vesicles of the Paracoccidioides spores. These vesicles are believed to be derived from the fungal wall [51], [52].
