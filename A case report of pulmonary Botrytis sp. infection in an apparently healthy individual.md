## Abstract
In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the number of cases of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NSIS) infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (T.T. Typhimurium) has increased significantly over the last few years, leading to its substantial morbidity and mortality. To improve the awareness and understanding of the disease control measures in UAE countries, the current and prospective surveillance system was used.

A search of all published studies up to 31st August 2018, and all studies reporting on the illness in the last six months, was performed. The search terms were: “typhoidal fever”, “non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium” or “T.T. Typhimurium”. The indexing of the terms and data was performed by using the checkerboard technique.

237 studies were independently collected. The search was based on the hospital discharge records of patients with fever between 31st August 2017 and 30th October 2018.

Out of the 237 patients, 155 (9.1%), including all those with nosocomial infection, were included in the analysis. The mortality rate was 55.6% (12/23) and for a period similar to other typhimurans (71/237). The main risk factors for mortality were poor hygiene and malnutrition at the hospital and for 2 months after admission (for a period similar to typhimurans). Fewer than half the diarrhoea cases (33/237) and severe malaria (14/155) were due to T.T. Typhimurium.

Patients in UAE with fever and severe malaria should be given prompt medical attention to the intensive care unit.


## Introduction
Fungi are widely distributed in nature and are considered to be a group of fungi that are ubiquitously distributed. Their life cycles are diverse and, as such, they have been reported to have many potential benefits for the study of fungal biology. For instance, their ability to switch between different morphologies and/or to form different sclerotia can change the ecology of the fungal kingdom (Wertzi and Rolf, 2006). They are capable of producing multicellular structures that are capable of interacting with the host as well as the host plant (Krijgsheld et al., 2013). Thus, it is expected that some of the fungal species in the kingdom are commensal organisms and some are pathogenic (Mishra and Shrestha, 2017). However, other fungi, such as Aspergillus spp. and Cryptococcus spp. can cause diseases in humans and it is very common to find cases of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, due to their ability to switch their morphologies (Khan et al., 2014). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms that have allowed these fungi to change their lifestyles in order to diagnose, prevent and treat fungal infections.


## Methods
Patient details were recorded in patient record forms and standardized with patient informatio.

Patients were prospectively enrolled into the study and subsequently established on admission, at the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) or in a tertiary care hospital at the University of Sydney. These patients were classified into two groups: those enrolled into the RPH RPH group and those who were not enrolled in the RPH RPH group.

Definition of a 'Disease' in the RPH RPH group
A case was considered to be a Disease if a patient developed pulmonary tuberculosis on admission, at the RPH RPH, or in the hospital. Pulmonary tuberculosis was defined as an infection in the lung of more than two persons.

## Results
We were not able to determine whether the patient was dead from the infection or had been hospitalized with other infection. The patient was treated with a corticosteroid prior to the CT. There was no statistical difference in the respiratory symptoms between the two groups.

The histopathological findings in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection are shown in Fig 2. The local and the sub-localized lesions were characterized by many types of inflammation (Fig 2). The lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection showed a higher level of phagocytosis compared with the control group (Fig 2). In the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection, the mucosal tissue was less abundant and less dense than the control group, and the inflammatory infiltrate was more diffuse. In the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection, there were more areas of inflammation and higher numbers of neutrophils (Fig 2).

In the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection, the bronchial epithelium was more abundant, and the pulmonary epithelium was more sparse (Fig 2). There was also a higher frequency of the upper airway epithelium in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection, and the lower airway epithelium in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection (Fig 2).

The histopathological results of the lungs from the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection are shown in Fig 3. The histopathological findings of the lungs are shown in Fig 3. There was a high frequency of the bronchium, bronchium, and the bronchial epithelium in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection, and the epithelium was less abundant and more dense (Fig 3).

The lungs from the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection were stained with the anti-inflammatory cytokine antibody Mito-1. The patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection had a higher number of lymphocytes in the upper airway, and the pulmonary epithelium was more dense. The lymphocytes were not detected in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection.

The histopathological findings in the lungs of the patient with pulmonary Botrytis sp. infection are shown in Fig 4.


## Discussion
The patient had several immunological and behavioral changes following his initial presentation, which was accompanied by a decrease in CD4^+ T cells, which has been shown to be associated with reactivation of viral infection in many cases [6. The patient also had a recent history of pulmonary infections, including a recent case of lung cancer [7].

The patient's pulmonary symptoms were consistent with a non-surgical site infection. There is a high risk of graft rejection as demonstrated by the patient’s favorable response to chemotherapy and improved clinical response. The patient’s history of lung cancer was noted to be nonspecific and he had a history of biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma and aneurysmal necrosis in addition to previously reported infections.

The patient had a history of lung cancer and had a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and aneurysmal necrosis. The patient had a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and aneurysmal necrosis. There were other pulmonary conditions in which the patient had normal lung function, including multiple lung masses, large lesions, and less severe disease, such as pneumonia, which is a well-known risk factor for adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma [8]. The patient had a history of lung cancer and had a biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and aneurysmal necrosis. The patient had a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma and a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The patient had a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma and a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma and a recent biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma.
