## Abstract
Infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a cardinal sign of central nervous system infection (CNSI). The immune system of healthy individuals responds to T. gondii infection by producing several cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>), through several routes including Th1 response and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated clearance. In this study, we found that the expression of tlr1, a previously unreported TLR2-producing gene, was increased in infected mice infected with T. gondii. This was associated with reduced parasite burden and decreased brain parasite load. However, infected mice were unable to survive without parasites. Therefore, we hypothesized that T. gondii infection in the lungs represents a major source of infections in the peripheral tissues, as enhanced immunity promoted the increase in the expression of tlr1.

In this study, we found that the tlr1 gene was upregulated in infected mice infected with T. gondii. This was associated with reduced parasite burden and increased brain parasite load. However, infected mice were unable to support parasite burden in part because they had a reduced ability to form infectious sponges. Therefore, the expression of tlr1 was downregulated in infected mice and increased during parasite replication.

Similar to the role of the TgRsc1 gene, the expression of tlr1 was downregulated in infected mice during infection with T. gondii. Genetic deletion of tlr1 in the lungs of infected mice reduced sphingolipids and resulted in increased levels of inflammatory mediators such as the high-sulfide lipase inhibitor, hypertriglycerolipids, and several cytokines. The expression of the tlr1 gene was upregulated in the spleen of infected mice.


## Introduction
The role of BpG in spore germination has been shown to be crucial for S. sp.


## Methods

Total RNA was isolated from mycelia of strains grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate. RNA purity was checked by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and a Qubit^® 4 fluorometer. The RNA concentration was determined by using the NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A quality control RNA was obtained from a diluted 1:10 serial dilutions of RNA. Total RNA from each sample was subjected to RNA extraction and DNA-free quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the PrimeScript^TM RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as described previously [48].

DNA extractions, PCR and qPCR
Total genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia of wild type (WT) and <U+0394>yap3 mutant strains by using the NucleoSpin^® Plant RNA Isolation Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The 5' end of the D1/D2 domain of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by using the primers V9G (de Hoog et al. 1999) and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). PCR amplification was carried out using 1.5 µL of DNA extract, 1.5 µL of each primer, and 2 µL of sample. The reaction was performed on a PTC-200 Thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following thermal profile: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing and annealing for 30 s at 48 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was amplified using primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and were purified using an Illustra^TM Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol.


## Results
cruzi T-DNA (nt) type (Fig 1, S1 Table. To further test the effect of T. cruzi T-DNA types on cell division in the absence of Pb18, we used confocal microscopy to examine the cells in the absence of Pb18. We found that cells of all T. cruzi types exhibit similar cell division patterns in the presence of Pb18, except for the large cells (Fig 1, S1 Table). To verify that the cell division patterns observed in the absence of Pb18 are true cell division, we also measured the number of daughter cells in the cell lines that were not tested for cell division. In all three cell lines, we found that the number of daughter cells in the cells that were not tested for cell division was significantly lower than in the cells that were tested for cell division (Fig 1, S1 Table). These data suggest that the effect of T. cruzi T-DNA types on cell division is dependent on Pb18.

## Discussion
cerevisiae [10] is an essential component of the fungal cell wall and is the first protein involved in the biogenesis of C1- and C2-containing cell wall glycoproteins [43. The C protein in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe S6 and S6-like proteins were found to be the most abundant proteins in all fungi analyzed, including S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe S6 (Table 1). In S. cerevisiae, the S6-like protein was found to be 20% of the total protein, and the S6-like protein was found to be 9% of the total protein in S. cerevisiae [44]. In S. pombe, the S6-like protein was found to be 20% of the total protein and was also found to be the most abundant protein in all tested strains, including S. cerevisiae [45]. However, the S6-like protein was found to be the most abundant protein in the S. pombe strains tested, as compared to the S. cerevisiae S6-like protein (Fig 2). This finding is similar to the results of previous studies that reported S6-like proteins as the most abundant proteins in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe S6 (S7 and S7.1). In this study, we found that the S6-like protein was the most abundant protein in the S. pombe strains tested, and S6-like proteins were found to be the most abundant proteins in all S. pombe strains tested. The S6-like protein was found to be a major component of the cell wall glycoprotein complex, which is important for the biogenesis of the cell wall, and was present in all tested strains. The S6-like protein was found to be the most abundant protein in all S. cerevisiae strains, as compared to the S6-like protein (Table 1). In S. pombe, the S6-like protein was found to be the most abundant protein in all S. cerevisiae strains tested, as compared to the S6-like protein (Fig 2). In contrast, the S6-like protein was found to be the most abundant protein in the S.
