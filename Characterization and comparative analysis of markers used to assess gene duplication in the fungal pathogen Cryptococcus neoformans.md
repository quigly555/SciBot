## Abstract
In this study, we used a newly developed cell surface gel electrophoresis (CSE) method to identify and analyze whole protein extracts from the four major plant pathogenic fungi of rice plants, namely, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Clonostachys rosea, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This approach led to the identification of the single copy gene (PcNex1) locus that was the most specific of the four. The Chr numbers of 160, 874, 311, and 350 in the four isolates were significantly different (P = 0.001). The comparison of whole proteins with a CSE and specific IgG for all four isolates revealed that the Chr numbers differed significantly (P < 0.05) from that of IgG for IgG-dependent Candida colonization. These results suggest that the P. solani-F. oxysporum-Clonostachys rosea-Sclerotiorum-Clonostachys rosea-P. solani transition was more efficient than that of F. oxysporum. The results also indicated that the P. sclerotiorum-Clonostachys rosea-P. solani transition was more efficient than that of F. oxysporum. These results suggest that the P. solani-F. oxysporum-Clonostachys rosea-P. solani transition was more efficient than that of F. oxysporum. The Chr number of the Nr1 protein was found to be the most crucial factor (P < 0.05) involved in the Cse-mediated transition and was up-regulated at both the Brg and the active site positions of the nr1 and nr2 genes in P. solani. This study highlights the importance of the P.


## Introduction
As a major human pathogen, . neoformans is capable of altering the composition of the human microbiome and its relatedness to the host gut microbiome (3). C. neoformans undergoes asexual reproduction in vitro and in vivo and forms biofilms on solid animal skin and mucosa, but is unable to colonize the human host. This means that the host-pathogen interaction is compromised (4, 5). The host immune response is key to the adaptive response to C. neoformans, and the pathogen is capable of activating the innate and adaptive immune systems, which are involved in the development of protective immunity against the fungus (6).

The human fungal microbiome has been primarily studied in detail, with little attention paid to studies correlating the microbiome with disease symptoms. In vitro studies have shown that C. neoformans is capable of colonizing the human epidermal and intraepidermal layers of the skin and mucosa, but it is unable to grow there (7). In vivo studies, however, have shown that C. neoformans can colonize the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts (8-10). Colonization of the lung and subsequent invasion of the brain are also thought to contribute to cryptococcal pathogenesis (11). In addition, a number of studies have shown that the microbiome is highly associated with the risk for several diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, and oncoagulase-a (OA) and neopterin-1 (12-15). In general, the microbiome is thought to be highly regulated, with C. neoformans exhibiting a complex assembly of microorganisms, which results in the formation of various communities that are collectively known as the microbiome. This complex structure results from interactions between environmental cues, including host immune status, and the composition of the microbiome. For example, the host immune system can exert a high or low level of protection against C. neoformans when the microbiome is low, but C. neoformans can colonize the brain when the microbiome is high (16-18). In contrast, the microbiome is low in the host when the microbiome is high, and this is referred to as “low-nutrient” colonization (19-21).


## Methods

Phylogenetic Tree Construction
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (NJ) with MEGA version .0 [39]. The neighbor-joining tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method with a maximum-likelihood-cum-ratio test and bootstrap values of 50% were used to calculate the confidence of the branch-swapping and branch-swapping trees, respectively. The neighbor-joining tree was visualized using the program Treeview [40].

Analysis of the Methylation of Candida Genes
The Methylation Index (MGI) was calculated by the Methylation Index Multi-Index method [41] using the software Phyloseq [42].

Microscopic Preparations
For microscopy, fungal tissue was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde at -20 °C for 24 h and processed using a Leica DMR microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). For histopathology, fungal tissues were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at -20 °C for 24 h. Parasite suspensions were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and examined with a Leica DM2000B microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany).

DNA Extraction, Amplification and Sequencing
Fungal tissue was homogenized in 3 mL of sterile distilled water and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, followed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and washing with sterile distilled water. DNA was extracted with the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA was quality checked by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer. For the amplification of the ITS region, a PCR mixture consisting of ITS1, ITS4 and ITS4, was used (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified PCR products were sequenced by using the BigDye® Terminator v. 3.


## Results
. two isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans and one isolate of C. neoformans) to eradicate C. neoformans, we selected two independent isolates (P. pastoris and P. aeruginosa) that did not harbor any phenotypic markers (data not shown) and were used to determine the prevalence of each marker in the clinical isolates. In each case, we found that all isolates were true positive and all were CF meningitis-specific isolates. The prevalence of all markers tested in all of these isolates was 1.75%, which was not significantly different from the prevalence of 1.7% in the control isolates (Table 1).

For each of the four markers used to determine gene presence, we used the allele frequency distribution (P-values) to obtain the P value of each marker. We found that the P value was 0.05 for the two isolates of P. aeruginosa and 0.065 for P. pastoris, which were both correctly assigned to the same lineage (Table 2). For the other four markers, we found that they were both correctly assigned to the same lineage or a different lineage (Table 2). In addition, P. pastoris was correctly assigned to the same lineage or a different lineage in the two isolates of P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa was correctly assigned to the same lineage in the two isolates of P. aeruginosa. Thus, we conclude that these four markers identified the same lineage in the clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, P. pastoris was consistently found to be the most commonly identified marker in the clinical isolates of C. neoformans.

To further assess whether P. pastoris was a true clinical isolate, we also tested two isolates of P. aeruginosa. Both of the isolates were correctly assigned to the same lineage in the isolates of P. aeruginosa, and the isolates of P. aeruginosa were both correctly assigned to the same lineage in the isolates of P. aeruginosa. Thus, we conclude that P. pastoris is the most commonly identified isolate of Cryptococcus neoformans.
