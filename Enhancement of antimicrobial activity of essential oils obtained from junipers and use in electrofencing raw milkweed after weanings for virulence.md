## Abstract
Innate immune cells detect bacterial pathogens via surface pattern recognition receptors expressed on the surface of bacterial cells or particles. This pattern enables the innate immune system to detect microbial pathogens in the first place and to guide in the treatment of new infections. However, there is no report on the detection of Bacteroidetes in human peripheral blood. In order to investigate the possibility of blood cells receiving microbial pathogens, we found that Bacteroidetes interfered with the development of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, Bacteroidetes interfered with the development of mononuclear phagocytes in mice deficient for B. aureus.


## Introduction
Amphetamines are endogenous molecules that are present in the human body at concentrations that are highly dependent on the availability of the drug itself (1, 2). Amphetamines are believed to be important in neurodegenerative disorders and other neurological disorders (3). They have been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroprotolar [e.g., anti-inflammatory [e.g., inducible nitric oxide synthase] (NOS2),] neuroprotective [e.g., inducible nitric oxide synthase] (NOS3)], and anti-inflammatory [e.g., inducible perforin-dependent nitric oxide synthase (iNOS2)], neuroprotective [e.g., inducible NOS2] (NOS3) activities. In general, they have been shown to have neuroprotective [e.g., anti-inflammatory [e.g., during inflammation, in the presence of adequate levels of oxygen]], neuroprotolar [e.g., in the presence of adequate levels of nitric oxide] (NO) and anti-inflammatory [e.g., NO, in the absence of oxygen] activities, respectively. In addition, they have been shown to have neuroprotective [e.g., anti-inflammatory [e.g., by blocking eosinophil recruitment to inflamed areas, in the presence of adequate levels of NO]], anti-inflammatory [e.g., by preventing NF-<U+03BA>B activation, and regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-12A, IL-12F, and TNFa)], as well as anti-inflammatory [e.g., by regulating the expression of apoptotic proteins, such as CCL5, CD206, and CXCL1] (3). They also have been shown to have neuroprotective [e.g., by inhibiting the release of apoptotic factors from the necrotic cells of rat leukemic cells, which mediate necrosis] and neuroprotolar [e.g.


## Methods
[25] with modification. Prior to freezing, the stocks of essential oil were thawed, and 50 mL of each were placed into a tube. The tubes were shaken with vortex for 30 seconds, then 100 µL of 50% acetonitrile were added, followed by incubation at -20°C for 10 min, and then 100 µL of 0.1% Tween 20 were added. The tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant (0.1 mL) was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 1.0 mL of 1% Tween 20, and the mixture was kept at -20°C for 20 min. The volume of the supernatant was adjusted to 1.0 mL with distilled water, and then added to the contents of the tube to be added to the mixtures. The tubes were shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the tubes were placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min, then cooled at room temperature to 30°C. The cells were pelleted at 1,200 rpm for 5 min, and then resuspended in 1 mL of 1% Tween 20.

We used the protocol described by Pekka et al. [25] with modifications. Prior to freezing, the stocks of essential oil were thawed, and 50 mL of each were placed into a tube. The tubes were shaken with vortex for 30 seconds, then 100 µL of 0.1% Tween 20 were added, followed by incubation at -20°C for 10 min, and then 100 µL of 0.1% Tween 20 were added. The tubes were shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min, and then cooled at room temperature to 45°C. The cell suspension was pelleted at 1,200 rpm for 5 min, and then resuspended in 1 mL of 1% Tween 20.

To evaluate the antibacterial activity of essential oil obtained from juniper berries, we tested the antibacterial activity of the essential oil by the EO of A. fumigatus. The essential oil was thawed at room temperature and dissolved in 1 mL of 100% EtOH.


## Results
From the data set of 345 976 (67.6%) infants with RIN, the mean age of the paediatric population was 13.4 years. There were 322 776 (68.7%) non-neutropenic patients (range, 1-86) and a mean age of 16.5 years. Out of 325 976 (65.2%) paediatric patients with RIN, the mean age of the paediatric population was 33.1 years. There were 69 437 (61.8%) non-neutropenic patients (range, 1-115) and a mean age of 37.7 years. Out of 351 976 (69.2%) paediatric patients with RIN, the mean age of the paediatric population was 31.6 years.

The distribution of the mean age of the paediatric population with RIN is shown in Fig 1. This distribution of the mean age of the paediatric population with RIN is consistent with the findings of our study and the literature.

The distribution of the mean age of the paediatric population with non-neutropenic RIN is shown in Fig 2.


## Discussion

In this study, we showed that . faecalis showed an ability to kill or destroy bacteria using a concentration-dependent manner. We found that the action of E. faecalis and E. faecalis on planktonic cells of V. carteri was dependent on the nature of the species, and the temperature of the medium. We also found that E. faecalis and E. faecalis had different susceptibility to K. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae, and also that E. faecalis and E. faecalis had significantly higher resistance to WNS-resistant A. fumigatus than other E. faecalis strains. These results are in agreement with previous studies conducted by others (e.g., de Arderr et al., 2017).

The most important factor in selecting E. faecalis for further study was its ability to reduce the ability of E. faecalis to establish biofilm. This was confirmed by this study showing that E. faecalis demonstrated an ability to reduce the number of biofilm formed on biofilms, and also that E. faecalis has an ability to reduce the number of biofilm formation when grown on microtitrated medium (Figure 5).

The study also revealed that E. faecalis demonstrated an ability to reduce the ability of E. faecalis to establish biofilm. This was confirmed by the study showing that E. faecalis had an ability to reduce the number of biofilm formation when grown on biofilms. This was also confirmed by the study showing that E. faecalis had an ability to reduce the number of biofilm formation when grown on microtitrated medium (Figure 6).

The use of biofilm as a strategy to reduce the number of biofilm formed on biofilms is an area of increasing concern in the biofilm-induced infection (De Hoff et al., 2017). The main purpose of biofilm formation is to prevent the spread of bacteria from the body into the environment, and as a result, the growth of bacteria is much more difficult and the population of bacteria is much smaller (Pasano et al., 2017).

The efficacy of E. faecalis against the K. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae biofilm formation was assessed by the combined effect of MIC and CFU (Figure 7).
