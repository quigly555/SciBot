## Abstract
We report a case of an HIV-infected patient with a disseminated histoplasmosis who presented with swelling and a general weakness in the left lower limb. The patient was an immunocompetent individual with a past medical history of non-AIDS, including a liver transplantation in 2005. He had a normal MRI and biochemistry that did not allow direct comparisons between the two regions. MRI revealed a brain mass and cryptococcal granuloma and the patient had multiple pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis was confirmed by thoracic biopsy. Histopathology and biochemistry highlighted a mild nodular cryptococcal granuloma with granulomatous inflammation. He was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine and a complete resolution of his symptoms was achieved. We discuss the importance of presenting a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis in order to aid in early care and treatment, and discuss antifungal options including liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole.


## Introduction
Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a species that causes a systemic infection of the lungs and skin in immunocompromised hosts.1,2 H. capsulatum causes histoplasmosis, a disease that is fatal without aggressive treatment. In untreated patients, the disease can progress to disseminated histoplasmosis, a serious infection that can lead to life-threatening disability.3

In the past two decades, the incidence of histoplasmosis in the immunocompromised has increased substantially.4,5 The overall incidence of histoplasmosis in the general population has increased over the past two decades. The incidence of histoplasmosis has been reported to be 5-7% in AIDS patients, 6-8% in solid organ transplant patients, and 10-14% in patients with hematologic malignancies.9,10 The increased prevalence of these diseases is associated with the increase in the number of patients on immunosuppressive treatments for primary histoplasmosis.11 In the case of solid organ transplant patients, the risk of death due to histoplasmosis is higher than other infectious diseases and this may be attributed to the lower risk of contracting histoplasminosis.12 This phenomenon is the result of an immune response of the host, which triggers an immune response that leads to an activation of the immune system.13

Although the immune response has been a major factor in the development of both opportunistic and non-opportunistic histoplasmosis, there has been a slow increase in the incidence of histoplasmosis.14,15 The risk factors that contribute to the development of the opportunistic infection of the lung are age, systemic immunodeficiency, and the use of immunosuppressive medications.16,17 The present study was performed to determine the risk factors for the development of opportunistic infection of the lung and the incidence of histoplasmosis in AIDS patients.


## Methods
Briefly, the antifungal activity of amphotericin B and fluconazole was determined using a microplate assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer's recommendations and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of drug that resulted in 80% reduction in viable cells, as determined by counting the number of viable cells with the hemocytomete.

To measure the cytotoxic activity of fluconazole against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) at 37°C. Cells were stimulated with 0.1% cell line-free human serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 24 h. The cells were pelleted and suspended in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cells were plated on SDA for 24 h. The MDCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The MDCs were washed and suspended in PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were plated on SDA plates for 24 h. The MDCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The MDCs were washed and suspended in PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were pelleted, suspended in PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were pelleted, suspended in PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were pelleted, suspended in PBS and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS for 24 h.


## Results
brasiliensi. A recent study demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme antioxidant enzyme-inhibitory factor (AHA) exhibits potent antifungal activity in Candida albicans cells [14]. The results from this study showed that the combination of ROS scavenging and lipid scavenging factors significantly enhanced antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis against P. brasiliensis. In addition, the antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis was also demonstrated by the presence of elevated concentrations of ROS scavenging factors in the culture supernatant. The supernatant was supplemented with a ROS scavenger, a non-oxidant, and a lipid scavenger. The results showed that the combination of ROS scavenging and lipid scavenging had no significant effect on the antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis against P. brasiliensis. These results were also consistent with the MIC_50 values of 2 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis. These results indicate that the antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis is dependent on ROS scavenging.

The antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis was also demonstrated by the MIC_50 value of 0.5 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis (Table 2). The antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis was also demonstrated by the MIC_50 value of 1 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis (Table 2). The MIC_50 values of 2 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis (Table 2) were similar to those of the other antifungal agents tested in this study. The MIC_50 values of the 2 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis (Table 2) were also similar to those of the other antifungal agents tested in this study.

P. brasiliensis Antifungal Activity Is Dependent on Carbon Source and Oxygen Sources
The MIC_50 values of the antifungal activity of P. brasiliensis were evaluated by the above mentioned tests. The MIC_50 values of 2 µg/ml of P. brasiliensis (Table 2) were comparable to those of the other antifungal agents tested in this study. This was also the case for the susceptibility of P.


## Discussion
In the present study, all the tested strains of . prolificans were highly susceptible to the three tested lysophosphatidylinositol derivatives, especially lysophosphatidylinositol. L-rhamnopyrone was the best inhibitor for the three tested lysophosphatidylinositol derivatives, but lysophosphatidylinositol was inferior to this inhibitor in the treatment of L. prolificans infection in mice.

In the treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans infection, L-rhamnopyrone, L-rhamnopyrone, and L-rhamnopyrone were the most effective inhibitors, but L-rhamnopyrone had a very potent effect on the four tested lysophosphatidylinositol derivatives, especially lysophosphatidylinositol. Although L-rhamnopyrone and L-rhamnopyrone were also the most effective inhibitors, L-rhamnopyrone was also more effective in treating Cryptococcus neoformans infection.

The most effective inhibitors for L-rhamnopyrone were L-rhamnopyrone and L-rhamnopyrone. L-rhamnopyrone is a lysophosphatidic acid derivative, which was reported as a potent inhibitor of synaptotagmins activity against Cryptococcus neoformans [24]. L-rhamnopyrone is a lysophosphatidic acid derivative, which was reported as a potent inhibitor of synaptotagmins activity against Cryptococcus neoformans [24]. L-rhamnopyrone was also reported as a lysophosphatidic acid derivative, which was reported as a potent inhibitor of lysophosphatidylinositol [25].
