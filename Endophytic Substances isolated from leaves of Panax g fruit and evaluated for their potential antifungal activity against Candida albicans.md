## Abstract
Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are important membrane components and have been extensively studied in the cell biology of eukaryotes. In the present study, we focused on the study of GSLs in the model fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. Recent studies of the mammalian host have largely focused on identifying the functions of GSLs and its receptors. In this review, we explore the paradigm of mammalian GSLs, the various approaches to GSL characterization, the knowledge about the biological functions of GSLs and the potential roles of GSLs as antifungal therapeutics.


## Introduction
The parasite Toxoplasmosis parasite is a self-limiting fungal pathogen that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that can infect both humans and non-human animals. Humans are infected with Toxoplasmosis through inhalation of the infectious particles into the lungs. When the immune system is impaired, the immune system subverts a Toxoplasmosis infection, the toxoplasmosis spreads to the central nervous system and causes a lethal infection that is fatal if left untreated. [1]

It has been estimated that toxoplasmosis is responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide each year. [2] In the United States, the number of deaths due to toxoplasmosis is estimated to be over 1.6 million annually. [3] In addition, toxoplasmosis is also known to cause systemic infections, and toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients is a major cause of death in Africa. [4] In Africa, a prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection is estimated to be 1 in 100 patients. [5], [6]

The route of transmission of toxoplasmosis is by bloodmeal, where a blood meal is taken from the patient. When the bloodmeal is interrupted, the parasite enters the bloodmeal and spreads to the brain. [7]

The term “toxoplasmosis” is used to describe a condition that causes abnormal or ineffective immune responses in the host.


## Methods
The antifungal susceptibility of the tested isolates was confirmed by the MIC test of each one of the tested compounds in 96-well microtiter plates, and by the MIC/MEC/MEC metho.

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested fungal isolate. The MEC/MEC method was adopted to evaluate the fungicidal activity of the tested fungi, and the results were interpreted according to the principles of CLSI M27-A3 (2000).

Antifungal activity of the tested compounds against Candida albicans (R1002), Candida glabrata (JX3048), and Candida krusei (JX3046)
Antifungal activity of the tested compounds against Candida albicans (R1002), Candida glabrata (JX3048), and Candida krusei (JX3046) were determined by the MEC/MEC method according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2002) and CLSI M38-A2 (2007). The MEC/MEC method was followed for the determination of fungicidal activity of the tested fungi.

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested fungal isolate. The MEC/MEC method was adopted for the determination of fungicidal activity of the tested fungi.

Antifungal activity of the tested compounds against Cryptococcus neoformans (JX3048), Trichophyton paratuberculosis (JX3048), and Candida albicans (JX3048)
The antifungal activity of the tested compounds against the Cryptococcus neoformans (JX3048) were determined by the MEC/MEC method.

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested fungal isolate. The MEC/MEC method was adopted for the determination of fungicidal activity of the tested fungi.

## Discussion

The activity of the two compounds was evaluated against . neoformans (Table 2), as well as against C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The MIC values of the two compounds against C. neoformans were recorded at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. These concentrations are within the limits used for clinical usage of the plant (up to a concentration of 200 µg/mL) and suggest that they are not toxic to human and animal health. The MIC value was not determined for any of the compounds tested.

The antifungal activity of the compound tested against C. albicans was evaluated against the cell lines H99a and K562. The MIC values of compounds against these cells were determined in a dose-dependent manner. The MIC values of compounds were determined against all the cell lines.

The results for the MIC value against the C. neoformans cell line H99a are shown in Fig 4 and can be compared to the results obtained for the MIC value against the non-albicans cell line K562. In general, the MIC value against the cell lines was much lower than the MIC value against the non-albicans cell line. This indicates that the compounds tested may be acting on the cell type of the C. neoformans and C. albicans cells. The comparison of the results obtained for the MIC value against the non-albicans cell line H99a and the MIC value against the non-albicans cell line K562 showed that the compounds isolated from the fruit and leaves of Panax g fruit and plants were inactive against the cell lines of these two species, which is in agreement with the MIC values reported for the antifungal activity of the compound in the present study.

In this study, the compounds isolated from the fruit and leaves of Panax g fruit and plants were evaluated for their potential antifungal activity against the two C. albicans strains. The results of the MIC values for the compounds isolated from the fruit and leaves of Panax g fruit and plants are shown in Fig 5.

The results of the MIC values of the compounds isolated from the fruit and leaves of Panax g fruit are shown in Fig 6.

The results of the MIC values of the compounds isolated from the fruit and leaves of Panax g fruit are shown in Fig 7.
