## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is an uncommon disease which usually presents in young adults. It is often misdiagnosed, due to the nonspecific nature of the disease. We report a case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a young adult without any clear neurological symptoms.

A 25-year old Caucasian male presented with an atypical skin disease, cough, and hemoptysis. He was not aware of any suspected immune dysfunction and presented with a 3-day history of coughing, pantyclinic rash, and dyspnea. He was also not aware of any underlying respiratory symptoms. Bronchopulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The final diagnosis was cryptococcal granulomatous meningitis.

We present a case of a young patient who presented with a 3-day history of coughing, pantyclinic rash, and dyspnea. After being managed by a thoracoscopic biopsy, he was diagnosed as having pulmonary cryptococcosis based on the presence of consistent cryptococcal cultures, laboratory findings, and pathological features.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis should be considered in the diagnosis of a suspected immune dysfunction, especially in young patients.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with a spectrum of disease that includes the development of invasive mycoses. IFIs are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and associated with high rates of co-morbidities. These infections are difficult to treat, and their mortality rates have been increasing at a rate that is almost unparalleled. Therefore, the development of new treatment modalities is urgently needed.


## Methods
)

The intron-exon region of T-DNA binding protein was blocked by incubating yeast cells with a primary antibody against TRP2 (Cell Signaling Technology. The reaction was induced by incubation of yeast cells with a second antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). After 3 h, the cells were washed with 0.05% Tween 80 to remove the non-bound protein. The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed with 0.05% Tween 80 and developed by incubation with a rat anti-rat IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature for 1 h.

The intracellular localization of RpC1
The hph-RpC1 and hph-RpC1 proteins were visualized using the Human-RpC1 Phospholipid Chiral ChIP ChIP Array (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The signal was visualized with a DeltaVision ECL Analyzer (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and the data were analyzed using the CellQuest EZ software. The data were normalized with the 1-p-value, and the data were analyzed with a Cramer Statistic (Applied Biosystems).

The levels of P-protein binding by Hph
The binding of Hph to CpG was determined by measuring the P-protein binding by the Hph-RpC1 ChIP ChIP ChIP Array (Applied Biosystems) using an ECM, equipped with a C-capped ChIP Array (IgG DAG-11CH_6) (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and the ChIP ChIP Array kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).


## Results
neoformans, we used the TORC1 promoter to construct the conditional mutant strain, a repressed version of . neoformans (designated in the methods section), in which TORC1 was constitutively expressed. The phenotypic analysis of the conditional mutant strain revealed that the mutant strains exhibited a marked reduction in virulence compared to the wild type (Fig 7A and B). This reduction in virulence was not accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in the number of viable Cryptococcus cells (Fig 7C).

TORC1 plays a role in host defense against C. neoformans infection
TORC1 is the first-line receptor that modulates the immune response of the host. We reasoned that the host defense response might be impaired in the conditional mutant strain. Therefore, we examined the immune response of the conditional mutant strain in the presence of either 30 µg/ml or 100 µg/ml of the stress-inducing compound sodium azide (1,3-difenyl-D-deoxy-methionine), a known inhibitor of the TORC1 protein. Sodium azide can interfere with the TORC1-dependent immune response and are known to induce inflammatory responses in several pathogenic fungi such as Candida species (16, 17). To test if the conditional mutant strain exhibited sensitivity to sodium azide, the strains were grown in the presence of 30 µg/ml sodium azide for 24 h. The results showed that the mutants displayed significant sensitivity to sodium azide (Fig 7D).

To further understand the role of TORC1 in host defense against C. neoformans infection, we constructed and purified the WT strain from the conditional mutant and the repressed mutant strain in the presence of 1,3-difenyl-D-deoxy-methionine. The drug was added to the infected leaves of a rabbit-inoculated host, and the wild type strain was then inoculated in the absence or presence of 1,3-difenyl-D-deoxy-methionine to assess the growth of the fungus. The mutant strain exhibited a marked reduction in the number of viable Cryptococcus cells compared to the wild type (Fig 7E). This finding indicated that the conditional mutant strain exhibited sensitivity to sodium azide.


## Discussion
The TORC1 is involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis and is a component of the regulation of several stress-related genes, including the MyoA-PKA pathway [35. We showed that the TORC1 plays a crucial role in stress resistance in C. neoformans, especially in the presence of antifungal drugs. The TORC1 plays an important role in stress resistance in the cryptococcal strains C. neoformans and C. gattii. In addition, we show that C. gattii is resistant to antifungal drugs, and a protective role of C. neoformans TORC1 in the C. gattii complex (Figure 6). Our data suggest that the C. gattii TORC1 plays a crucial role in the C. neoformans complex.

The C. neoformans complex is a heterogeneous group of multicellular organisms, composed of the most common species in the order Ascomycota, the order Saccharomycetales, and the orders Sporidiobolales, Ustilaginomycotina, and Leotiomycetes. It has been suggested that the fungal species in the C. neoformans complex may have evolved more than once [36]. In the present study, we observed that C. gattii is resistant to antifungal drugs, and a protective role of C. gattii TORC1 in the C. neoformans complex (Figure 6). It is noteworthy that the C. gattii complex is one of the most diverse groups of fungi in the order Saccharomycetales. However, there is still no clear hierarchy of species within the Saccharomycetales. Several species of the order Chytridiomycetes, which is the most common order in the order Saccharomycetales, are resistant to antifungal drugs [37]. In our study, the C. gattii complex is a complex with four different subgroups. C. gattii and C. neoformans are related to the fungi in the order Saccharomycetales and the order Sporidiomycetales, respectively. In addition, the C. gattii complex has four subgroups. C. gattii and C.
