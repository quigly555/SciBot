## Introduction
The genus Malassezia is a group of Gram-positive rods (Vulpesculina, Labiuloascomycetes) that are found in a wide range of habitats (e.g., soil, air, water, plants, and animals) (1).


## Methods
The immune reconstitution process plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of infectio. Through the progression of infection, the cell walls of the host cell are invaded by the extracellular matrix of the immune system, resulting in a cascade of inflammatory events, which are often associated with IPFI. This cascade is termed immune reconstitution.

The IPFI represents the development of the inflammatory process associated with the infection through the permeation of the cell walls and the accumulation of intracellular matrix. The process of permeation includes the formation of interphase, the formation of granulomatous cells, the accumulation of intracellular matrix, the accumulation of intracellular matrix-associated fungi, and the accumulation of cell wall-associated pathogens. The process of cell wall permeation is an important component of the permeation process, as the extracellular matrix of the immune system is invaded by an intracellular matrix of the cell. In addition, the cell wall permeation can also be a component of the inflammation process in the context of infection [29].

Although the P. lutzii strain was able to infect human blood, it was unable to infect human cells. This suggests that the P. lutzii strain was not able to infect human cells, because the P. lutzii strain was able to infect human cells, even though its cell wall permeation could not be detected by human cells.

The P. lutzii strain is known to be a natural target for in vitro mycobacterial infections in animal models [30]. Although it is known that the P. lutzii strain is unable to infect human cells, this does not mean that the P. lutzii strain does not possess immune markers. The P. lutzii strain was able to infect human cells, as it was able to infect human cells, despite its cell wall permeation. This suggests that the P. lutzii strain is not able to infect human cells, as it was able to infect human cells, despite its cell wall permeation.

The analysis of the P. lutzii strain on human skin was done to establish the specific pathogenicity of P. lutzii infection. The P. lutzii strain was able to infect human skin, and the P. lutzii strain was able to infect human cells, despite its cell wall permeation. This suggests that the P.


## Results
Identification of bZIP-like proteins in Cryptococcus neoformans
We identified a bZIP-like protein in Cryptococcus neoformans by sequence similarity (79% identity and 92% similarity) with a human bZIP-like protein (GenBank accession no. KX701622). In addition, we identified a bZIP-like protein in C. neoformans by sequence similarity (78% identity and 87% similarity) with a human bZIP-like protein (GenBank accession no. KX701623). We found that Cryptococcus neoformans lacks the bZIP-like protein homolog from C. neoformans var. grubii. To test whether the bZIP-like protein in C. neoformans is also present in Cryptococcus neoformans, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of the bZIP-like protein from Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (GenBank accession no. KX701624).


## Discussion
Our patient, however, was an immunocompromised individual with a CD4 count of 101 cell/µl and his CD4 count was 60 cells/µl, which was close to the CD4 counts found in HIV-infected individuals [5. In HIV-infected individuals, CD4 counts of CD4 count of <200 cells/µl are significantly less than those found in the general population [6].

There are several immunological and immunological features that aid in the diagnosis of IRIS. IRIS is defined as a chronic, disseminated, or subclinical form of infectious disease [6]. The most common form of IRIS in HIV-infected individuals is hemophagocytic lymphadenopathy (HML) with lymphopenia and/or splenic necrosis [7]. In our patient, lymphopenia was seen in only one episode, but it was more commonly seen in other chronic forms of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, cryptococcus, and histoplasmosis. A similar pattern of lymphopenia was also seen in HIV-infected patients with other infectious causes of lymphadenitis [8].

In HIV-infected individuals, CD4 counts of CD4 counts of <200 cells/µl have been found in both CD4 counts and serum. We believe this is the first case of IRIS in a HIV-infected individual. While the incidence of CD4 lymphopenia in HIV-infected individuals is about 1% [1], it is generally seen in those with a CD4 count of >250 cells/µl. CD4 counts of <250 cells/µl are considered to be less severe than those seen in HIV-infected individuals [1]. In HIV-infected individuals, a CD4 count of <50 cells/µl is considered to be a rare condition and it is uncommon in HIV-infected individuals [1].

The treatment of IRIS is based on the nature of the disease, the extent of the infection, and the timing of the infection. In HIV-infected individuals, treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole is used to manage IRIS [9]. There is no evidence to support the use of fluconazole in HIV-infected individuals.
