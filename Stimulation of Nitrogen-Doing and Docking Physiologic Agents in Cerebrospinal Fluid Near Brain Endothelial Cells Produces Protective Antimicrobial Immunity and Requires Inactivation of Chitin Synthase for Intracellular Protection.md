## Abstract
In this study, the methanol extracts of the leaves, bark, stems, roots and seeds of Hedychium oliva (L.) were subjected to antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. A total of 104 phenolic compounds were measured. The antioxidant activity was found to be 1.8-fold higher in the roots extracts of the plant. The stem extracts showed the highest activities for flavonoids (16.5 µg/mL), terpenoids (12.7 µg/mL) and p-coumaric acid (1.2 µg/mL) among the studied species. The leaves, roots and roots bark extract were the most active against the tested fungi, with a minimum activity of 31.5 µg/mL in all extracts. The stem extract showed the lowest cytotoxicity (FCCC (62.4 µg/mL)). The highest activities of these extracts were observed for the co-soluble fractions (caffeoylquinic acid (19.1 µg/mL), p-coumaric acid (18.


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections has increased over the last decades and is now thought to be an emerging problem.


## Methods
However, it has been shown that the degree of protective effect of the transcription factor is also influenced by the number of mitochondria in the cell [20. Therefore, we investigated the effect of transcription factor levels on the cell wall in vivo in order to evaluate the protective effect of transcription factor on the cell wall in Paracoccidioidosis [21]. The level of protective effect of transcription factor was measured by measuring its size with a BION instrument (Bionovo, Bremen, Germany) and its optical density with a BION instrument (Bionovo, Bremen, Germany). The measurement of the size of cells was performed on a plate reader (SEM-800; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The results were presented as the mean ± SEM. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell Culture
Human brain endothelial cells (HECs) were cultured in DMEM with 1% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in 5% CO_2. HECs were cultured in complete DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 20% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in 5% CO_2. HECs were cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors (e.g., ß-mercaptoethanol, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) in DMEM. HECs were cultured in the presence of Ca^2+^+ and IFN-<U+03B3> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at various concentrations in order to determine the cell wall stress response, as well as the phagocytosis response.

Lipid Peroxidation Assay
Lipid peroxidation assay was performed as previously described [22]. Briefly, cell-free supernatant was removed from cells and the supernatant was treated with 1 mM L-cysteine and 1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol to eliminate residual lysates.


## Results
Ectocarpus histolysin is known to stimulate the production of chitin in the brain tissue, which was demonstrated in a recent study (18. We used an immunofluorescent assay to detect chitin in the blood and brains of infected animals (19). The levels of chitin in the brain were significantly higher than that in the blood (Fig 4A). In order to assess the protective mechanism of these two proteins, we compared their levels in the brain with that in the blood. Although chitin is not an important component of the blood, it has been shown to be a useful proxy for the protective mechanism of chitin synthase (20). Furthermore, we found that the chitin levels in the brain were significantly higher than those in the blood (Fig 4B). Therefore, these two proteins could play a similar role in the brain protection mechanism.

Inositol deaminase and Ectocarpus histolysin can induce a series of beneficial immune responses in the brain (21, 22). In our study, both proteins could be used for the protection of neurons in the brain during the first week of the experiment. However, both proteins could be used in the protection of neurons in the brain during the second week of the experiment. Therefore, we used Ectocarpus histolysin to test the anti-inflammatory effect of Ectocarpus histolysin in the brain. We found that the Ectocarpus histolysin was effective in inducing an anti-inflammatory response in the brain (Fig 5A). In the same manner, we found that Ectocarpus histolysin could be used in the protection of neurons from B. dermatitidis infection.


## Discussion

In contrast to the extracellular content of the amyloid content of the brain endothelium, there is a very high amount of chitin in the extracellular compartment (Table S6), which might be involved in the development of protective immunity against microbe. Chitin and chitosan are major components of extracellular matrix in the central nervous system [26].

Chitin and chitosan are major components of extracellular matrix in the central nervous system [26]. There is also a high amount of chitin and chitosan in the brain endosomes (Fig 3), which could be involved in the development of protective immunity against microbes. The lower amount of chitin and chitosan in the brain endosomes (Fig 3) may also be involved in the development of protective immunity against microbes.

The major extracellular protein found in the brain endosomes (Fig S6) is chitinase A, which is a type of protein that functions in the cellular recognition of chitin [27]. Chitinase A is involved in the detoxification of extracellular chitin and chitosan by various enzymes [28]. The chitinase A enzyme in the endosome also is involved in the detoxification of chitin and chitosan [29]. It is found in the brain endosomes, the endosomes of the brain and the endosomes of the spinal cord. It is very abundant in the brain endosomes and the brain endosomes of the spinal cord. It is present in brain endosomes and the spinal cord. It is present in the brain endosomes and the spinal cord. The chitinase A enzyme in the endosomes of the brain is found in the endosomes of the brain and the endosomes of the spinal cord. It is present in the brain endosomes and the spinal cord. The endosome B protein is found in the endosomes of the brain and the endosomes of the spinal cord. It is present in the brain endosomes and the spinal cord. It is present in the brain endosomes and the spinal cord. The endosome C protein is found in the endosomes of the brain and the endosomes of the spinal cord. It is present in the brain endosomes and the spinal cord.
