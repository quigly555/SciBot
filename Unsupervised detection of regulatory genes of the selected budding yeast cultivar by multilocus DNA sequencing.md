## Abstract
A critical step in the evolution of the human immune system is the recognition of microbial pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are used to fight against infectious agents, and the immune response of mice against S. aureus infection is characterized by the production of type I IFNs and IL-12. These type I IFNs are believed to be key factors in the development of resistance in S. aureus strains, and the production of IL-12 is a key factor in the development of resistance in the otherwise-self-limiting phase of infection. However, recent studies have suggested that certain human self-antimicrobial peptides (S-MICs) exert an immunosuppressive activity that is different from that of natural AMPs. In this review, we discuss the potential for S-MICs to exert immunosuppressive activity in S. aureus that includes the development of resistance to and the immune response to S. aureus.


## Introduction
Fungi are among the most important causes of human infections, and the number of invasive fungal infections continues to rise worldwide (Lombard et al., 2012). Invasive fungal infections are commonly caused by Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Aspergillus spp. However, Cryptococcus and A. fumigatus are often the most common causes of invasive fungal infections in adults (de Beer et al., 2010; Burt et al., 2012; Gallucci et al., 2015). In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of opportunistic fungal infections that are primarily associated with HIV-negative individuals. Invasive fungal infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and the emergence of these pathogens as opportunistic pathogens has changed the profile of antifungal agents (Cendejas-Bueno et al., 2014). As of today, the most common opportunistic fungal infection associated with HIV-negative individuals is cryptococcosis. The mortality rate of cryptococcal meningitis is around 20% in sub-Saharan Africa, and the mortality rate in the general population ranges from 20-25% (Burt et al., 2012).


## Methods
2012. Sequencing was done on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument, and the reads were assembled and edited using SeqMan Pro v.7.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) (Viedtsova et al. 2015). The raw sequencing reads were demultiplexed, quality-filtered, and indexed by Illumina MiSeq (2 × 250 bp) and BWA (v. 4.0.10; Silva et al. 2015). The reads were assembled into contigs using the Trinity version 0.8.11 (http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/trinityrnaseq/) (Pfett et al. 2013). The sequenced reads were assembled into contigs using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment method (BWA) (Li and Bork 2012) and clustered using UCHIME (Edgar 2004). The unassembled contigs were aligned using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Alignment method (BWA) (Bolger et al. 2009). The alignments were filtered by using the Vmatch package (Li et al. 2009) to avoid the use of non-standard sequences. The clustered, assembled contigs were then visualized with the Glimmer version 1.10 (Langmead and Salzberg 2011) software. The resulting alignments were then imported into Gephi (version 1.1.0; Mathur et al. 2012), the Gephi package, and processed using Gephy (version 1.10; Mathur et al. 2012). Gephy uses the Gephy package (version 1.10; Mathur et al. 2012) to sort the alignment data into the most similar pairs of alignments.

Genome sequencing data and annotation
The genomes of P. chrysosporium and P. brasiliensis were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. (4 × 250 bp; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The genomes of P. brasiliensis and P. brasiliensis were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. (4 × 250 bp; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The genomes of P. chrysosporium and P. brasiliensis were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq.


## Results
The gene set was enriched with genes encoding for the transcription factor FGF-ß/ergosterol-3-phosphatase, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of multiple cell processes including cell cycle progression and differentiation, cell division, and cell death (Fungger et a., 2016).

The complete set of genes from the expanded screening included a total of 554 genes with multiple transitive events, including a total of 697 genes that were not annotated with any known function or that were not annotated with the gene ontology (GO) term, including the GO:00074, GO:00075, and GO:00076 genes for the transcription factor FGF-ß/ergosterol-3-phosphatase, transcription factor FGF-ß/ergosterol-3-phosphatase, and cytochrome P450 gene FGF-ß/ergosterol-3-phosphatase (see Materials and Methods). These genes were enriched with genes encoding for a single-copy protein, which is known to be required for proper initiation of cell division in both wild type and mutants of yeast (Sundell et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014).

The list of genes that were enriched with GO terms in the expanded screening included a total of 872 genes with multiple transitive events, including a total of 18 genes that were not annotated with any known function or that were not annotated with the gene ontology (GO:00076, GO:00077, and GO:00078, see Materials and Methods). The list of genes enriched with GO terms in the expanded screening included a total of 68 genes with multiple transitive events, including a total of 19 genes that were not annotated with any known function or that were not annotated with the gene ontology (see Materials and Methods). This list also included a total of 26 genes that were enriched with GO terms in the expanded screening, including a total of 11 genes that were not annotated with any known function or that were not annotated with the gene ontology (see Materials and Methods).

The list of genes that were enriched with GO terms in the expanded screening included a total of 20 genes with multiple transitive events, including a total of 12 genes that were not annotated with any known function or that were not annotated with the gene ontology (see Materials and Methods).


## Discussion
This would be especially relevant for yeast-to-yeast transition, as many of the genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are also involved in cell wall biogenesis and differentiation, including genes involved in ß-glucan biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis and differentiation (27, 28.

The identification of the genes required for the biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes was also confirmed by other methods, including direct sequencing and flow cytometry, using 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequences. The detection of cell wall-degrading enzymes in both non-albicans and filamentous fungi is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to withstand environmental stress. The detection of cell wall-degrading enzymes in the stationary phase (Figure 3A) of non-albicans filamentous fungi supports the hypothesis that these fungi are able to withstand high temperature, which is the main limiting factor for their growth (17). It is also possible that the mutants required for the biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes are adapted to low temperature and are unable to cope with high temperature.

The cells of non-albicans fungi are also resistant to high temperature and other stresses, including UV radiation, heavy metals, etc. (29). The yeast-to-yeast transition is also influenced by the environmental factors, including temperature, and therefore the presence of these factors may be an important factor in determining the outcome of a yeast-to-yeast transition. The detection of cell wall-degrading enzymes in non-albicans species could also be a way to determine whether the strains are able to adapt to stress conditions and to overcome the effect of the high temperature. In contrast to albicans, the yeast-to-yeast transition is regulated by the transcription factor Crz1 (20). The transcription factor Crz1 plays a role in filamentation, biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes and the stress response (29). The growth of the yeast-to-yeast transition depends on Crz1, a protein in the plasma membrane and secreted by the yeast cells. It was found that Crz1 was required for the survival and the growth of yeast-to-yeast transition in the presence of high temperature, which indicates that Crz1 was not required for the yeast-to-yeast transition.
