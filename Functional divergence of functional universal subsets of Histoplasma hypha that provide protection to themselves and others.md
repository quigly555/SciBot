## Abstract
Biogeography is a complex issue that affects both naturalists and policy-makers alike. Whilst most estimates are based on human-pathogenic fungi, due to both practical and anthropogenic factors we have sought to estimate the burden of disease in communities where these communities exist. Whilst this approach has yielded high quality estimates, it fails to consider the impact of local climate on disease caused by pathogenic fungi. Here we analyse estimates of the impacts of climate change on natural barriers to infection by filamentous fungi across a UK Cerrado red fern, the only endemic tree in the Cerrado world. Setting aside the past, the impacts of climate change on the ecology of this tree and the ways in which it impacts disease, we argue that climate change is likely to have profound impacts on the ecology of this tree and that it is likely to impact substantially on the abundance of filamentous fungi present within its walls. Whilst we agree that climate change will have a profound impact on the abundance and distribution of filamentous fungi, we argue that the impacts will be greatest in places where there is relatively little global trade and a largely cosmopolitan community of human-fungal species. We draw attention to two areas where climate change has an impact on fungal biodiversity. Firstly, the impacts of climate change on the ecology of this tree, both occurring at the foot of a chain of abstraction formed by continental drift sediment from the continental Cerrado red fern Elvira daubane (Elviraaceae). Secondly, the way in which climate change impacts the ecology of this tree compared to estimates based on estimates based on humans, highlighting the importance of considering human-only model communities when making assessments of the impacts of climate change on this tree. We argue that the Elvira ecology is ecologically distinct from that of the Cerrado red fern and therefore it is best placed to reassess if this species is a threat to natural barriers to infection by filamentous fungi.


## Introduction
Dosage of cleaning products, such as disinfectants, paints and foam paints, can contribute to the problem of mold and bacterial contamination. In recent years, the use of anaerobic environments for the remediation of wastewater in industrial processes has been increasing. This has led to the use of wastewater treatment facilities such as industrial wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) in areas with a high economic impact, such as the treatment of plant dust and contamination of surface water and the surface of building materials. The use of wastewater treatment plants in the industrial sector has attracted a lot of attention and attention of scientists, who are trying to develop methods to eliminate the problem of contamination by fungi by using cleaning products.

Sustainable wastewater treatment and bioremediation has several advantages, as it is more economical than other types of wastewater treatment. It can be established in less than 10 minutes of work time and can be carried on a large scale without any environmental issues. The use of cheap chemicals can provide a larger amount of chemicals than other wastewater treatment methods, as well as a better treatment of a large area. High cost of chemicals is also lower than that of chemicals used in the industrial process. The use of cheap wastewater is also more stable, safer and produces less wastewater and microorganisms compared to industrial wastewater treatment. It is a very efficient technique for the removal of contaminated wastewater by using cheap chemicals, but the removal of fungi is still a challenge to control. This problem has been a huge challenge for the studies on the fungus removal by using cheap chemicals.

This review focuses on the use of cheap chemicals in the removal of fungal growth on industrial wastewater. The results of the removal of fungal growth on industrial wastewater will be discussed from a plant health point of view.


## Methods
We have used the phylogenetic tree of Histoplasma to assess the concordance between the phylogenetic and molecular methods of our analysi. The concordance between the phylogenetic methods was calculated using the ‘prognostic accuracy’ parameter. If no contamination was found, a phylogenetic model of Histoplasma was selected. If possible, a molecular method, such as BLAST, was selected to test for the absence of contamination. If no contamination was found, a molecular method was selected to test for the presence of contamination. We used the tree of life and the tree of life tree to compare the likelihood of the results from the test of phylogenetic and molecular methods, and to estimate the absolute difference between the results obtained from both methods.

Phylogenetic methods
We used the tree of life and the tree of life tree to estimate the phylogenetic and molecular methods of Histoplasma as well as to estimate the phylogenetic and molecular methods of other fungi, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, in order to evaluate the phylogenetic and molecular methods of fungi. The phylogenetic and molecular methods of Histoplasma species were determined by comparing the results obtained from the tree of life and the tree of life tree. The tree of life and the tree of life tree of fungi were the same. The phylogenetic and molecular methods of fungi were determined by comparing the results obtained from the tree of life and the tree of life tree.

## Results
The fungus has a high degree of conservation with some of its host species and is considered the most common pathogen among fungi (fig 3. In order to understand how a fungal pathogen is able to amplify the defense mechanism of other fungi, we compared the morphologic phenotypes of three potential pathogens and selected them for the following comparative analysis.

Pneumocystis elegans is a nematode pathogen
To identify the nematode-specific antimicrobial mechanisms that might be involved in the pathogenic function of Pneumocystis elegans, we first tested two types of nematode nematode pathogens that are widely distributed in nature and are usually known to cause fatal nematode infections (fig 4). We observed the survival of P. elegans in three independent experiments in which we used two nematode species, the one with the largest number of nematodes in the field and the other with the smallest number of nematodes. Our nematode nematodes were first cocultured with either a C. elegans or C. albicans, and then we used the two species to inoculate the three nematodes (fig 5).

We also used two strains of P. elegans to examine the ability of the nematode pathogens to efficiently kill P. elegans. In the first experiment, we inoculated two strains of C. elegans (1×10^6 or 1×10^6 CFU/mL) in a 2:1 ratio of nematodes. The nematodes inoculated with a C. elegans or C. albicans were then sacrificed. The killing efficiency of each strain was measured at different time intervals, as described in the Materials and methods section. After 1 h of infection, nematodes inoculated with the nematodes that killed the nematodes in the first experiment had a 50% mortality rate, while inoculations with the nematodes that killed the nematodes in the second experiment had a 50% mortality rate. We also tested the ability of nematodes inoculated with either the C. elegans or C. albicans strains to protect themselves or their offspring from nematodes.

In the first experiment, we used a nematode strain with a C. elegans or C.


## Discussion
However, in contrast to the highly diverse and highly divergent Histoplasma species, the paralogous genes in the genomes of the two independent Histoplasma species are found in similar proportions in both basal and basal lineage fung. This raises the possibility that these species may share a common mechanism for protection against host-defense mechanisms, but different in vivo roles of the same gene.

The evolutionary and functional significance of paralogous genes have been examined in numerous fungal species including Blastomyces, Saccharomyces, and Cryptococcus neoformans. The conserved transcriptional regulator genes are involved in fungal cell wall homeostasis and cell wall biogenesis, respectively [54]. In Saccharomyces species, the gene encoding a homolog of the human DHCR1, was found to be essential for survival and pathogenicity in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis [55]. In Cryptococcus species, two conserved paralogs of this gene were found in the fungal genomes of both basal and basal-lineages fungi, suggesting that this gene may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a divergent ancestor. In addition, the putative gene encoding a protein-protein interaction domain is also found in the genomes of two closely related species, C. neoformans and C. gattii, which together form a distinct group of basal- and basal-type fungal species [56]. However, in the genomes of the Cryptococcus and C. gattii basal-type fungal species, the putative gene encoding a histone methyltransferase was found to be absent [57]. These results suggest that paralogs in the genomes of the two closely related species were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a divergent ancestor. These findings also suggest that the paralogs found in the genomes of C. neoformans and C. gattii may be secondary to gene duplication, and may be required for the formation of their respective fungal species.

Paralogs are required for virulence and invasion of host tissue in Histoplasma species [58], and they have been found in both Histoplasma species. For example, the parasite of C. gattii possesses a paralogous gene, ParA, that encodes a putative virulence factor [59]. The H. capsulatum H.
