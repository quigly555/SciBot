## Abstract
The global distribution of Thymus vulgaris spores, the largest single constituent of the fungal spores, has been reported from a wide range of tropical countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the patterns of distribution of T. vulgaris in Australia using a multiple map approach. Data were obtained from the 2001 taxonomy and ethnobotany data of the T. vulgaris species complex. Thymus data were retrieved from the 1989 taxonomy and the database used to analyze and interpret the data. The use of the multi-region biotinylation approach to analyze the distribution of T. vulgaris in Australia was also compared with other species of the genus. The distribution of T. vulgaris in all three countries was comparable according to the combined geographical distribution of the taxa. The distribution of Thymus vulgaris in Australia was also determined by comparing the distribution of the spores of two species, T. vulgaris and T. vulgaris grafted onto the bean fields in West Australia. The results showed that the two species had a single distribution in the Australian bean fields where they were cultivated. The distribution of Thymus vulgaris in Australia was also determined by comparing the distribution of the spore pod and the spore germinating cells of the two species. Results showed that the two species had a similar distribution in the Australian bean fields where they were cultivated.


## Introduction
The fungal diversity and abundance of the soil samples were estimated by analysing combined datasets of total fungal DNA content (CENITS) and NG. This data was used to develop an ecologically sensitive soil indicator that can be used to monitor the fungal diversity of soils in the Amazon region.

The soil microbiome in the Amazon region is a complex ecosystem that is dominated by soil bacteria and fungi [4], [5]. The soil microbiome comprises a diverse range of microbes that are widely present, but are restricted to a few microhabitats. These include fungi, bacteria and ectoparasites [6], [7]. Despite their presence, the fungal microbiome in the soil is largely unknown. The gut microbiome is highly complex and is predicted to be one of the most dynamic ecosystems, affecting ecosystem processes, including soil quality, carbon and nitrogen cycling, water cycling, and the health of the communities [8]. Previous studies have reported that the microbial diversity in the soil microbiome is largely unknown, and therefore it is crucial to identify fungal species that may be sensitive to the current climate change [9].

The genus Mycosphaerella (Pers.: Fr.) is a well-known genus in the family Capnodiales, and is mainly distributed in Latin America. The genus belongs to the family Cantharellales, a group of species that are classified in the Capnodiales order [10]. The genus is widespread in Europe, and it is considered to be one of the most common phytopathogens and causes black rot diseases in trees including Christmas tree, walnut, maple, pear, cassia, kunze, cedar and pine. The disease occurs on a wide variety of trees including beech, oak, lepidopteran and Norway spruce [11]. In Brazil, the main vector of the black rot diseases is bison, bison-euthanoid and bison-ratios causing up to 250,000 annual losses worldwide [12]. Black rot diseases are also caused by several other fungi such as Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Cladosporium and Penicillium [13].


## Methods
The samples were collected from the growing areas of four main trees species: the corymbian corymbianus (. mikatae, C. bambrei, C. pombei, C. terescens), and the corymbian bark corymbianus (C. camberei). The samples were collected in the traditional fields of a variety of Brazilian oak and pecnickel species. The samples were immediately subcultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants and incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 4-6 days. The isolates were identified by PCR, DNA sequencing, and sequencing, and then deposited in the Centro de Salud Carlos (CMR) in Chile. The core sequences of the CMR was constructed by the BLAST program [36] and were deposited in the GenBank with accession number MU09868.

Molecular DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
The fungal isolates were isolated from the soil samples (1-5 cm) of the eight selected samples, using the standard protocol of Borkin et al. [37] with slight modifications. The fungal isolates were subcultured on PDA slants for 1-2 days at room temperature (25 °C) before being used for the PCR. DNA extraction was performed according to the method described by Yasuyama et al. [38]. Briefly, the fungal DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil samples (samples) using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) with the following modifications: the first DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit with the following modifications: 1. The first DNA was subjected to the NucleoSpin Plant Miniprep Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) with the following modifications: 2. The second DNA was subjected to the NucleoSpin Plant Miniprep Kit with the following modifications: 3. The third DNA was subjected to the NucleoSpin Plant Miniprep Kit with the following modifications: 4.


## Results
ultimum)
After exposing . ultimum to heat-shock treatments, we collected conidia from different temperatures at various temperatures in the range of 5°C to 37°C. We found that at temperatures between 5°C and 37°C, the fungus was able to generate extracellular hyphae and viable conidia (Fig 4). At temperatures between 5°C and 37°C, the fungus grew successfully and the conidia were recovered after incubation at a temperature of 37°C for 3 h. The only exception was at 37°C, the fungus was able to produce hyphae and viable conidia (Fig 4).

In addition, we found that after treatment with a heat shock, the fungus was able to grow on the leaves of the P. ultimum plant. In the P. ultimum leaves, we found that the fungus was able to grow on all the different types of substrates, although at different temperatures. In this case, the fungus was able to grow on the leaves of the P. ultimum plant at temperatures between 5°C and 37°C. However, at temperatures between 5°C and 37°C, the fungus was unable to grow on the leaves of the P. ultimum plant.

Growth of the fungus on the leaves of P. ultimum plants
After the fungus was used to inoculate P. ultimum leaf tissue, we observed that it was able to grow on the leaves of the P. ultimum plant. This suggests that the fungus can colonize the P. ultimum plant. We also observed that the fungus was able to colonize the leaves of the P. ultimum plant. The fungus was able to colonize the leaves of P. ultimum at temperatures between 5°C and 37°C. In other words, the fungus was able to grow on the P. ultimum plant at temperatures between 5°C and 37°C. These observations suggest that the fungus can colonize the P. ultimum plant and colonize the P. ultimum plant.

Morphology and morphological characteristics of the fungus
The fungus was observed to be brown, grayish to grayish, and somewhat floccose. In the leaves, the fungus was observed to be very large. The conidial mass was distributed in various colors, ranging from yellowish to reddish to grayish (Fig 5).


## Discussion
krusei (49. The analysis of fungal communities using high-throughput sequencing analysis of fungal community structures revealed that C. krusei was more highly related to the CO 2 production by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis than to the other fungi (Figures 1, 2, 4, 7). The analysis of fungal communities using the CTU/SCU tree revealed that C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were less closely related to each other than the other fungi (Figure 2), suggesting that C. krusei is more closely related to the two types of CO 2 production by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. However, the CTU/SCU analysis showed that the fungal communities of exposed and deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from Chilean ash tree resin and not the fungal communities of the deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from C. krusei were similar (Figure 3). This finding suggested that C. krusei is more closely related to the two types of CO 2 produced by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis than to the other fungi. This result indicated that C. krusei is more closely related to the two types of CO 2 produced by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis.

The fungal communities of exposed and deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from Chilean ash tree resin and not the fungal communities of the deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from C. krusei were similar (Figure 3). This finding indicated that C. krusei is more closely related to the two types of CO 2 produced by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis than to the other fungi (Figure 3). This finding indicated that C. krusei is more closely related to the two types of CO 2 produced by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis than to the other fungi.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the fungal communities of exposed and deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from Chilean ash tree resin and not the fungal communities of the deoxycholate-expressed CO 2 from C. krusei were similar (Figure 4). This finding indicated that C.
