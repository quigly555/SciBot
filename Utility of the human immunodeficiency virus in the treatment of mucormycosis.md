## Abstract
The fungal genus Aspergillus contains many important plant pathogens, some of which are used as biological control agents, not only against plant littermates but also as phytopathogens. The environmental and genetic diversity of the genus Aspergillus is maintained by the concerted action of many distinct genes, some of which have been identified as secreted enzymes or transporters of plant pathogens. These secreted proteins play a crucial role in the control of plant littermates, their exploitation or loss, or even of the fungus itself. In the last decade, a remarkable expansion in the diversity of A. fumigatus gene repertoires has been reported. A further expansion in the numbers and diversity of genes encoding secreted proteins in the genus Aspergillus has been reported with the advent of strain ALP, an organism with high virulence in some plant pathogens. This mini-review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying the different evolutionary patterns, and the genomic variation associated with the fungal kingdom. The diversity of secreted proteins in the genus Aspergillus, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the different evolutionary patterns appear to provide a novel source of novel targets for the development of novel strategies for the improvement of plant species diversity and adaptation to changing needs.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an increasingly recognized problem that affects immunocompromised patients, especially those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). [1] The incidence of IFIs has increased over the past decade due to the HIV epidemic, [2] immunosuppressive chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. [3] Furthermore, the increasing use of implanted medical devices, [4] and invasive medical devices in intensive care units (ICUs) [5] have been associated with increased incidence of IFIs. [6], [7]

The overall incidence of IFIs has increased over the past decade and has continued to increase despite the eradication of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) multidrug-resistant (IDV-R1) superclass of opportunistic fungi.


## Methods
2.1. Bacterial Strains and Culture Media
We used the following bacteria strains: C. albicans (ATCC 750) and C. tropicalis (ATCC 750; ATCC 90028), S. cerevisiae (ATCC 20340), S. pombe (ATCC 27853), and S. cerevisiae (ATCC 700603) (Table 1).

2.2. Biological Assays
A 100 mL culture of the wild-type strain was inoculated into a 6 L Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 37°C with a 5% CO_2 incubator (D-STAR-400) for 24 h. Then, the mycelium was washed in PBS, and 0.1 mL of 0.2% Tween 80 was added. The mycelium was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and then used for the assay.


## Results
4 to .94 mg/ml. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was tested against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates of yeast, and MIC_50 values of 0.04 and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively, were used to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility of the HIV-1 isolate of M. tuberculosis (Table 1). For the HIV-2 isolate of M. tuberculosis, the MIC_50 value was 0.06 mg/ml and the MIC_50 value of 0.06 mg/ml for both isolates were 0.04 and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively. When the M. tuberculosis isolate of HIV-1 was included, the MIC_50 value was 0.06 mg/ml and the MIC_50 value of 0.06 mg/ml for HIV-1 was 0.04 and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively (Table 1). The MIC_50 value for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were 0.03 and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 value of the HIV-1 isolate of M. tuberculosis was 0.04 mg/ml and the MIC_50 value of 0.06 mg/ml for HIV-2 was 0.03 and 0.06 mg/ml, respectively.

For the oral candidiasis model, the oral candidiasis model was used. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed against the 4-week-old mouse model of candidiasis, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.94 mg/ml. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was tested against the 4-week-old mouse model of candidiasis, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.94 mg/ml. The HIV-2 isolate of M. tuberculosis was tested against the 4-week-old mouse model of candidiasis, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.94 mg/ml. The HIV-1 isolate of M. tuberculosis was tested against the 4-week-old mouse model of candidiasis, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.94 mg/ml.

The MIC_50 values of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were 0.


## Discussion
Other patients with mucormycosis with a history of either immunodeficiency or HIV infection have been reporte. Although no immunodeficiency was identified in the patients with mucormycosis in this study, this may have been due to HIV infection.

This study is one of the few to identify mucormycosis patients with HIV infection. The patients included in this study were not HIV-infected patients. HIV infection may be diagnosed in patients with mucormycosis. In HIV-infected patients, mucormycosis may have clinical features similar to other diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and other mycoses. HIV infection may also be found in patients with other chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, or immunosuppressive therapies, which are usually associated with increased risk of mucormycosis.

The study also has limitations. The pathogen may be detected by direct or indirect methods. It is not possible to distinguish between primary and disseminated infections. However, there are some potential limitations to this study. Most of the patients were immunocompetent and the diagnosis of mucormycosis was not made by immunological testing. Therefore, there were some patients who did not undergo immunological testing. The patients in this study were also not enrolled in the HIV/AIDS program. The number of patients in this study was limited to patients with mucormycosis with a history of HIV infection and HIV infection. The total number of patients was limited to patients with HIV infection and patients with HIV disease. The patients in this study had no history of HIV infection or HIV disease. We did not have HIV infection, but it may have been due to HIV infection, although the patient in this study had a history of HIV infection. There was some variability in the study population with the serology test performed in both HIV patients and patients with HIV infection. The sensitivity of the serology test varied greatly from 100 to 200 pg/mL in HIV patients, and 100 to 200 pg/mL in HIV patients. There were some differences in the test result among the HIV patients. Serology tests performed in HIV patients were usually positive with a positive serum result and negative serology test in HIV patients. The results of serology tests in HIV patients were generally negative.
