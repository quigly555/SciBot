## Abstract
Candida glabrata is a fungal pathogen that is increasingly being recognized for causing superficial infections in immunocompromised patients. Infections with the yeast occur due to the interaction between the host immune system and the pathogen, which has been described previously as a result of the inability of the fungus to adapt to the different types of host-imposed constraints. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of C. glabrata infection models and found that two different RNAi (rRNAi and exoRNAi) were significantly up-regulated in the yeast cells. These up-regulation were dependent on different RNAi type, and could not be explained by the host environment or the fungal's own limitations. Furthermore, we found that the level of transcripts involved in pathogenicity and resistance were significantly different between C. glabrata and wild type when the host strain was different. As expected, the level of host-specific genes involved in the response to the pathogen was significantly up-regulated between C. glabrata and wild type. These results suggest that RNAi and not the host environment plays a significant role in the pathogenicity of C. glabrata. This study highlights the importance of transcriptome analysis to guide the rational design of novel therapeutics and opens up the possibility of future studies aiming to discover novel interactions with the host immune system in C. glabrata infection.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have risen dramatically during the last decades and nowadays, the incidence is growing, not only in immunocompromised individuals, but also in patients with chronic diseases, cancer, patients with burns, and patients with autoimmune diseases [1]. These conditions include systemic fungal infections, such as fungal keratitis, and mucormycosis, such as keratitis, in which fungal cells invade the keratinous tissue of the eye. The first reported cases of IFIs are mainly caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, followed by Cryptococcus and other fungal species. Cryptococcus neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen, which can survive inside macrophages, and can also cause cryptococcal pneumonia [2]. Cryptococcus albidus is a facultative intracellular pathogen, and the pathogen can cause severe ocular manifestations [3].

It is well known that C. albidus has a role in the infection of the eye and other tissues, such as skin and mucosa. In the case of C. albidus, it has been shown that some of its components can induce inflammation, and this is the reason why it can cause death in patients with cryptococcal infection [4]. Moreover, it is a common opportunistic pathogen, and it is responsible for fungal infections ranging from cutaneous and mucocutaneous inflammations to pulmonary and central nervous system infections [5]. In addition, it is well known that the development of IFIs in the eye may be associated with the infection with C. albidus, and it is clear that the development of IFIs in the eye is associated with the infections with C. albidus [6].


## Methods
The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, San Francisco (USF-2012-EEC), and the NIH under NIH Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We performed the study in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were fully compliant with the United States Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 98-198).

In addition, all experimental procedures were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed in compliance with the United States Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 98-198).


## Results
The results are presented in Fig .

We have identified the most common genera and the major fungal genera, based on the PCA of the fungal data (Fig 2). As expected, the most common genera were identified in all the samples, followed by the five most common genera: Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, and Aspergillus penicillioides. The distribution of Aspergillus spp. across the samples was also well represented, with the highest frequency observed in the pantry samples. Aspergillus spp. were the most abundant genera in all the pantry samples, accounting for a total of 3.9% of the total identified fungi (Table 1). In addition, Penicillium spp. were the most abundant genera in all the pantry samples, accounting for a total of 2.1% of the total identified fungi. Of the three most abundant genera identified in the pantry samples, Aspergillus spp. were dominant in both the pantry samples and the common bathroom samples, accounting for a total of 6.4% and 1.9% of the total identified fungi, respectively (Table 1).

The phenotypic changes in terms of growth and biomass, and the interactions between fungal genera in the pantry and common bathroom samples are shown in Fig 3. In pantry samples, the most common fungal genera were Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp., with the most prevalent Aspergillus spp. being Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. (Table 1). In common bathroom samples, Aspergillus spp. were the dominant genera, accounting for a total of 7.7% of the total identified fungi (Table 1).

The fungal community in the pantry was dominated by Aspergillus spp., accounting for a total of 2.9% of the total identified fungi, with a total of 3.2% of the total identified fungi in common bathroom samples.


## Discussion
The incidence of Cryptococcus sp. in children is estimated at 5-14% of the total pediatric cases (Lipari et al., 2016). The incidence of Cryptococcus spp. among children is estimated at approximately 10% of the total pediatric cases (Lipari et al., 2016). The incidence of Cryptococcus spp. in children is estimated to be approximately 4% of the total pediatric cases (Lipari et al., 2016).
