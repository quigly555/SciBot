## Abstract
Macrophages are the major component of the innate immune response against fungal pathogens. However, the phagocytosis of fungi by macrophages in the innate immune response is still poorly understood. Here, we show that the de novo assembly of the fungal cell wall with the plasma membrane participates in the innate immune response against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans.


## Introduction
graminearum (Ameliorates Tumor Growth and Helps Control Aneuploidy in Mice and Humans, . graminearum) [19]. In contrast, the antimycotic drugs, such as the flucytosine, amphotericin B, fluconazole, and the voriconazole, are thought to cause tumorigenesis [20]. The importance of the antifungal activity of the C. albicans mycelia during invasive growth and mycelial growth is not well understood.

The mating and sporulation processes of C. albicans are controlled by complex and highly dynamic molecular interactions among cell types. C. albicans hyphae secrete proteins that bind to the hyphae and trigger spore-forming enzymes. When these enzymes are bound to hyphae, C. albicans hyphae undergo a mitotic growth, an event that can lead to the generation of a heteroecious heterokaryon (reviewed in [21]). In addition to the formation of heterokaryons, C. albicans also undergoes a formative morphogenesis, in which yeast cells elongate and undergo a transition to filamentous growth. In C. albicans, the switch to filamentation is controlled by two transcription factors, MATa and MATa [22,23]. In contrast to filamentation, which is governed by the expression of different genes, the morphological transition between yeast cells is controlled by a single gene, MATa.

C. albicans cells are found in an invasive phase in the host immune system, which results in a chronic inflammatory reaction, which can be reversible by the application of antimicrobials and antibiotics [24]. Under conditions of inflammation and infection, the cells are arrested and can not be readily cultured, resulting in a transient cell death [25]. The presence of C. albicans cells in the human body has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infection with some organisms, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected mice, patients with malignancies, and organ transplant recipients [26]. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the ability of C. albicans to switch between yeast and hyphal growth conditions are not well understood.

The ability of C. albicans to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms has been reported in several model systems.


## Methods
neoformans suspension (1 × 10^7 conidia ml^-1) on the tail vein of 3-week-old C57BL/6 female mic. Mice were monitored twice daily and weighed daily. Two mice each were injected with 5 × 10^5 conidia ml^-1 and the score was calculated by dividing the number of CFU counted by the time from the first injection with the last. The experiment was repeated three times.

Western blotting
Total protein was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Mice were inoculated with 1 × 10^7 conidia of C. neoformans suspension (1 × 10^5 conidia ml^-1) on the dorsal vein of 4-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. The mice were monitored twice daily and weighed at the end of the experiment. The experiment was repeated three times.

Determination of intracellular ROS level in the fungal cell walls
The intracellular ROS level in the fungal cell walls was measured as previously described [28]. The conidial suspensions were prepared from the spleens of C. neoformans and were incubated in a dark room at 37°C. The cells were collected, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. The experiment was repeated three times.

Total ROS level was measured by DAPI staining of fungal cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as previously described [28]. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed three times with PBS. The stained cells were washed once with PBS and stained with 0.25% (v/v) DAPI at room temperature. The cells were observed on an Olympus BX-100 microscope and the images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i). The ROS levels were normalized to the intracellular levels of the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) gene and were presented as µC _M + F _2. The experiments were repeated three times.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).


## Results
We tested the efficacy of Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chambers in a mouse model of hematogenously disseminated leukaemi. In this model, hematogenously disseminated leukaemia was used as an alternative model of disseminated infection. The primary immunological responses of mice are likely to be critical to successful dissemination of the organism to the brain, which is likely to be the first line of defense during disseminated infection [37]. In the hematogenously disseminated leukaemia model, the primary immunological responses were observed to be largely unchanged in the Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber (Figure 2A). However, the Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of cells in the brain, as determined by the numbers of neutrophils and macrophages in the brain (Figure 2B). This result is consistent with a previous report that showed that Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chambers in a mouse model have no impact on brain survival [7]. The brain-specific Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber (CTC) was first used as an alternative model in the hematogenously disseminated leukaemia model [7]. However, the Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber is not yet used in the hematogenously disseminated leukaemia model. In the hematogenously disseminated leukaemia model, the Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber was first used to evaluate the role of Tumor proteins in the development of hematogenously disseminated infection in mice. These studies were conducted in a 24-h-old mouse model of hematogenously disseminated leukaemia [37]. The Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber is a new antifungal agent.

Tumor and its Chemotherapeutic Chemotherapeutic Chamber Contribute to Tumor Biofilm Formation and Vaccination
The Tumor-associated chemotherapeutic chamber is a new antifungal agent. Thus, we were interested in investigating the role of Tumor and its chemotherapeutic chamber in the development of hematogenously disseminated infection. Tumor-associated biofilm is a growing and increasing threat to humans in a variety of immunological and pathologic contexts.


## Discussion
We found that atg6<U+0394> cells were more virulent in mice than the wild-type, with greater titers of the chemotherapeutic compound A. Atg6 also had a lower concentration of the chemotherapeutic compound A1 and a higher concentration of the in vivo chemotherapeutic compound A2, which were consistent with a previous report [21]. These findings suggest that atg6<U+0394> cells may have a more efficient chemotherapeutic than the wild-type.

We also examined the cell morphology and then determined whether atg6<U+0394> cells exhibit any morphological changes. It was observed that cells without Atg6 were smaller, while cells with Atg6 were larger than the cells without Atg6. We observed that cells without Atg6 exhibited reduced cell wall strength and reduced viability. We also noted that cells without Atg6 had thinner cell walls and were more sensitive to cell wall perturbation than the cells with Atg6. These findings suggest that atg6<U+0394> cells may have a less efficient chemotherapeutic than the wild-type.

Atg6<U+0394> cells exhibited increased phagocytosis and enhanced immune-stimulation, similar to the cells without Atg6. This enhanced immune-stimulation of the phagocytic cells may be mediated by the increased IgA produced by these cells and their release by the immune cells [15]. However, other studies have shown that Atg6 may not produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [33]. We observed that atg6<U+0394> cells had decreased levels of IL-10 and had increased levels of IL-4, which suggests that IL-10 is a more potent mediator in the defense against Aspergillosis. The increased IL-10 may have increased the susceptibility to the infection and therefore reduced the efficacy of the antifungal therapy.

In addition to the effects on phagocytosis of the clinically isolated strain, we also found that the phagocytic cells of the phagocytosed strain exhibited altered morphology and cell wall structure, including increased lipid content.
