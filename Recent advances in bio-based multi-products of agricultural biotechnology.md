## Abstract
Liposomes produced from Candida glabrata are the first reports to date used for the treatment of candidiasis. Liposomes are commonly used for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, inflammatory disorders, cystic fibrosis, urinary tract infections and other vaginal candidiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity, antimycotic activity, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of the selected natural plant species against C. glabrata. The samples were collected from the vaginal swabs of the female (Vulnayarks), collected during the arachnoid skin infection treatment, and were subjected to cytotoxicity, biotransformation and biofilm formation test. In order to establish that the selected plant species can be used as a biofilm agent, the use of certain commercial antimicrobial agents, including fluconazole, was performed. The presence of the selected plant species is of the most interest in this study. The presence of Candida glabrata in vaginal samples of the female was effective against C. glabrata with IC50 values of 27.1 ± 2.4 × 103 cfu/mL. The biofilm formation and biofilm resistance of the selected plant species against C. glabrata were inhibited by the most effective Candida albicans and C. krusei, respectively. No inhibitory effect was observed in the biofilm formation and resistance was inhibited by the least effective Candida glabrata. The cytotoxicity of the selected plant species against C. glabrata was inhibited by a dose of 58.


## Introduction
This, in turn, has led to the creation of non-biodegradable, high-biodegradable and eco-friendly organic solutions with reduced use of synthetic pesticides and herbicides [12, 13. The use of organic materials for wastewater treatment has also been increasing as more wastewater treatment facilities are built in large cities, which is responsible for the significant increase in the production of bio-based industrial wastewater [14]. This phenomenon of sustainability has become the main feature of the wastewater treatment sector and its usage has recently been increasing in the last few years [15-17].

The main components of wastewater treatment wastewater are organic matter, organic matter, organic compounds, organic phosphate, organic sludge, organic carbon, phosphoric, organic carbon, sponges, solvents, effluents and various chemicals [18-21]. In addition, organic matter, organic compounds and organic carbon are two major components in the concentration of wastewater and in the treatment wastewater [22, 23]. The concentration of organic carbon in the wastewater treatment wastewater (SDW) is very low and is used to feed dairy industry [24], agriculture industries [25], food industries [26], aquaculture [27] and other industrial processes [28]. The wastewater treatment wastewater (SDW) is treated by the microorganisms to obtain a low pH and they can also have the effects of antimicrobial, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities [29]. The treatment wastewater can be prepared by the microbial community and in several cases by the formation of biofilms, which are resistant to a wide range of environmental conditions and lead to microbial degradation and degradation of the wastewater [30]. The use of microbial biofilms has been widely studied in many fields such as wastewater treatment, waste water and agricultural industries [31-33]. In this study, the presence of different fungal species was recorded in the wastewater treatment wastewater of four wastewater treatment plants of Srinakpur, Nagaland, Jhajjarh and Jamigan in India. The effect of the treatment with organic and inorganic contaminants and the effect of different fungal strains on the health of the soil and water quality of the treated wastewater were also recorded. In addition, the effect of environmental factors on the growth and survival of the fungi in the soil and water was also recorded. The obtained results can be used for the development of bio-based industrial wastewater treatment systems.


## Methods

.2. Drug Description
The compounds were synthesized and characterized as described in the previous sections and further detailed in Supplementary Materials. The formulation was prepared with the specific antimicrobial agents, such as fluconazole (FLC), voriconazole (VRC), voriconazole (VRC), or caspofungin (CAS), and the solvent system was composed of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1% Tween 20, and 100% ethanol. The active solubility was determined by using the Thermo Scientific Caspofungin HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The compounds were tested on a Waters Scientific S-300 analytical column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of H_2O, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% TCA, and 0.1% TGA, and the column temperature was maintained at 60 °C. The injection volume was 0.2 µL, and the injection rate was 0.9 mL/min. The antifungal activities were determined according to the previously published method [12], [13]. The compounds were also tested in liquid YPD medium at 25 °C. The same method was used to evaluate the antifungal activities of the YPD solution. The compounds were also tested in liquid YPD medium at 25 °C. The same method was used to evaluate the antifungal activities of the YPD solution. The main components of the compounds were evaluated by the colorimetric method [14], [15]. The compounds were tested in liquid YPD medium at 25 °C. The main components of the compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1200 Series system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent 5975A triple-quadrupole column (30 m × 250 mm, 4 µm; Supelco, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and an Agilent 5975A UV-visible-spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.


## Results
However, the detailed characterization of the colonic microbiota is still comple. This limitation may be overcome by the high number of samples required to complete the sequencing process. Thus, the study of the impact of the colonic microbiota on the management of clinical diseases has limitations.

A new taxonomic classification of colonic microbiota is needed
The first priority is the distinction between the microbiota of a given colonic community and the microbiota of a group of well-known pathogens. The study of the impact of a particular taxon on a particular group of microbes is difficult. Such comparisons are not possible because the microbiota of a given pathogenic host is not always well-defined. This can be partly explained by the limited number of samples for the analysis of the microbiota of the different experimental conditions. The analysis of the diversity of the colonic microbiota of different experimental conditions can be difficult. The fact that our study has shown that the colonic microbiota is composed of bacterial and fungal communities can be very helpful in the investigation of the taxa of the colonic microbiota.

The diversity of the colonic microbiota of different experimental conditions can be very helpful in the study of the impact of a particular taxon on a particular group of microbes. Therefore, the study of the diversity of the colonic microbiota of different experimental conditions is important. A more thorough study of the diversity of the colonic microbiota in different experimental conditions is needed.

## Discussion
This has enabled for the identification of a wide array of microbial communities and a comprehensive analysis of fungal diversity in dairy cattle, which is important for the development of therapeutic and sustainable farming practice.

In the present study, we developed a method for detection of fungal DNA in cattle samples from different geographic regions, which was obtained from 18 of the 30-gene-based Biosynthesis-Based Interaction Database (BID) [41]. The BID database is a powerful and accurate method for identification of fungal DNA in a broad range of soil, aquatic, and agricultural applications, including cattle feed, dairy cattle, and poultry feed [42]. In this study, we found that BID's detection method is a highly reliable method for detecting fungal DNA in cattle samples from different geographic regions. However, this method requires further validation in other studies.

Our results showed that BID detects fungal DNA in 4-10 of the 30-gene-based Biosynthesis-Based Interaction Database (BID) (Table 2). This is because the BID does not only accurately identify fungal DNA, but also identify fungal-like fungi in the soil microenvironment. This is consistent with other studies that have reported that fungal-like fungi were present in the soil microenvironment of cattle in a range of environments. These fungi may be involved in the human diseases caused by cattle [43,44] and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that fungal-like fungi may be present in the soil environment of cattle, which may be a more accurate target for BID.

To further characterize the presence of fungal DNA in our samples, we performed sequencing of the whole genome of the fungus, which revealed a high number of repetitive sequences (26%). We also used the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, USA) for genome sequencing, which resulted in a high number of genes (26%). The percentage of repetitive DNA was higher in the current study. The results from our sequencing analysis indicated that the number of repetitive DNA was higher in the current study than the study of the previous studies [45,46].
