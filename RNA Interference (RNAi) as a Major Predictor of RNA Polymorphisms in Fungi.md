## Abstract
Autophagy is a mechanism used by the immune system to kill bacteria, gain entry into the organelle, and in response to antibiotics and other nutrients. Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can inhibit degradation of the secretory system by the immune system. SOS are capable of decomposing the mixed protein systems involved in autophagy, and autophagy is a key process in the elimination of these pathogens. The protective response of the immune system to eliminate pathogens involves the disruption of autophagy machinery and changes in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of autophagy, and we will discuss the role of ROS in the elimination of bacteria and fungi.


## Introduction
2015) and a component of the RNAi machinery (Soualhine et a. 2016) are well established examples of genes that can be induced in response to environmental stimuli, including temperatures, pH, and nutrient availability (Bishara and Das 2017). Gene transcription is also essential for the expression of many other important phenotypes, such as virulence, and many fungi display intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that allow them to modulate the expression of their genes in response to environmental cues (Buchanan et al. 2014). In addition, it has been postulated that the transcription of these genes could be regulated by the response to stress conditions (Mendes et al. 2012). In fungi, these transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in the growth, development, stress response, and pathogenesis of some important plant and human diseases, such as fungal invasive growth, blast and powder decay, and cell wall thickening (Yergeau et al. 2013; Esch et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015; Mayer et al. 2015).

The transcription of RNAi in Cryptococcus neoformans is regulated by the transcription factor Hap1 (Kozich et al. 2015). Hap1 activates the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in order to regulate the expression of genes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis (Vazquez-Alvarez et al. 2011). In addition, Hap1 has been shown to be required for the expression of genes encoding virulence-related genes (Meyergeau et al. 2013). However, the transcriptional regulation of RNAi in C. neoformans is not well understood, and the molecular mechanisms regulating this transcriptional response are still not well understood. The expression of Hap1 is induced in response to environmental stimuli and is also regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli, including nutrient availability and pH. As a consequence, the expression of Hap1 is induced in response to temperature and is related to the growth, morphology, and virulence of the C. neoformans strain. Therefore, the expression of Hap1 in response to temperature, pH, and environmental stress is regulated by the transcriptional response pathway.

In this study, we have investigated the transcriptional response of C. neoformans to external environmental stimuli and the response to pH, glucose, and light. We demonstrate that the transcriptional response to environmental stimuli is also induced in C.


## Methods
Briefly, the 5'- and 3'-end of each gene were removed from the microarray data, and the 5'- and 3'-end of each gene were added to the array data of the Fusarium specie. For each gene, the following differential expression values were calculated: FPKM value = FPKM_1- FPKM_2. The RNAi data was normalized by FPKM value. For each gene, the relative transcript levels were calculated: FPKM value = FPKM_1- FPKM_2. The FPKM values were corrected for the false discovery rate (FDR) by dividing FPKM values by the FPKM of the most recent isolate. The FUSRIBIO gene was used as a control. The microarray data was normalized using the Fisher's exact test. We calculated the relative transcript levels using the following formula:

2.3. Gene Expression
The Fusarium microarray data were compared to the RNAi data obtained from the same species by two different methods. First, the RNAi data was normalized to the Fusarium microarray data using the original FUSRIBIO gene and the RNAi data obtained from the same species. The FPKM values were calculated using the following formula: FPKM value = FPKM_1- FPKM_2. The RNAi data was normalized to the Fusarium microarray data using the original RNAi data obtained from the same species. The FPKM values were corrected for the false discovery rate (FDR) by dividing FPKM values by the FPKM of the most recent isolate. The microarray data was normalized using the original RNAi data obtained from the same species. The FPKM values were corrected for the false discovery rate (FDR) by dividing FPKM values by the FPKM of the most recent isolate. The FPKM values were normalized using the original RNAi data obtained from the same species. The FUSRIO gene was used as a control.

2.4. Fusarium Bacterial Genes and Primers
The Fusarium Bacterial Genes and Primers were used to evaluate the gene expression profiles of Fusarium species in comparison to the RNAi data obtained from the same species.


## Results
graminearum, we compared the transcript levels of approximately 738 . graminearum genes between the wild-type (WT) and the <U+0394>fgsas1 strain at various time points. A total of 1,859 F. graminearum genes were detected in the wild-type strain, with a median of 1,076 genes per gene in the <U+0394>fgsas1 strain (Fig 2). After removing redundant genes, the total number of genes detected in the <U+0394>fgsas1 strain was 1,636, and the gene density was higher than that of the wild-type strain (Fig 2). Thus, the gene expression trends of the <U+0394>fgsas1 strain were consistent with those of the wild-type strain.

FGSAS1 Is Required for Fungal Genomic Diversity and Plasticity
A key feature of the FGSAS1 gene is the presence of a copy of the F. graminearum gene coding for an ABC transporter (FGSAS1b). RNA polymerase II (qPCR) analysis showed that the transcript level of FGSAS1 was increased by approximately one-quarter at the highest RNA concentration tested, at a total of 2,590 U/mg protein in the <U+0394>fgsas1 strain.

To examine the genetic basis of the observed increases in the transcript level of FGSAS1, we examined the expression of genes encoding two FGSAS1 bifunctional proteins (fgsas1<U+0394>b), a common, predicted ABC transporter with orthologs in S. cerevisiae, and the predicted ABC transporters of S. pombe, M. oryzae, and C. neoformans, which all have orthologs in S. pombe, M. oryzae, and C. neoformans (24). As shown in Fig 3, the expression of the transcripts of the two FGSAS1 genes was generally higher than the transcript levels of the respective FGSAS1 bifunctional genes (Fig 3A).


## Discussion
In this study, we show that the majority of the fungal species tested were capable of RNAi, but not RNA silencin. This is in agreement with the results of a previous study that reported that a majority of fungal species are also able to RNAi, but only a small proportion of these are considered to be transcriptional activators of mRNA expression [6].

The finding that the majority of fungal species in our study are not transcriptional activators is consistent with previous results that showed that the fungus Penicillium marneffei has a very high rate of RNAi [46]. This is a striking contrast to the results of our RNAi studies, in which RNAi was the predominant factor in transcriptional activator-dependent gene expression, and in which RNAi was the dominant factor in non-stress-dependent gene expression [31]. The large differences in transcript levels between the two groups, but not in the number of genes in the RNAi group, are consistent with previous results in which RNAi was only one of the key factors in transcriptional activator-dependent gene expression [6].

In our RNAi study, we found that the majority of the fungal species in our study had no RNAi-independent factors. In other words, most of the RNAi factors that were found in the RNAi group were not transcription factors. In the RNAi group, it was shown that many of the genes in the RNAi group were transcriptional activators of mRNA expression and that these genes were also the most abundant genes in the RNAi group. These results could be explained by the fact that, in the RNAi group, transcription factors play a role in the regulation of gene expression, but not gene transcription. RNAi is the only RNAi factor that is expressed in the RNAi group, but not in the RNAi group. This finding suggests that the transcriptional activator-dependent genes in the RNAi group are not directly expressed in the RNAi group. This result is consistent with previous results that showed that the RNAi group is a strong activator of genes in the RNAi group, but not in the RNAi group.

However, we found that the majority of the fungal species in our RNAi study were not transcriptional activators of mRNA expression.
