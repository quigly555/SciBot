## Abstract
HIV infection is increasingly recognized as a contributor to neurological sequelae in the immunocompromised host. The current study aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics and predictors of spinal cord injury in HIV-infected patients with CD4+ T-cells (CD4+ T-cells) induced spinal cord compression (SCCC) following HIV infection.

This study was retrospective: a) when CD4+ T-cells were induced, or b) symptoms were masked by HIV infection. Univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted for the following parameters: spinal cord compression, age, gender, spinal cord hyperextension, and presence of spinal fluid filled with HIV RNA.

Among 5139 patients, 32 had lesions of at least 2 cm in size. The median (IQR) age was 41 (28-84) years, and 10 (12) were female. The percentage of the population with at least one spinal cord compression (SB) in the prognosis was 75.6% (28/32) in the SB group, and 49(38) were HIV-infected. In the adjusted odds ratio analyses, the inclusion of HIV and/or other prognostic factors was associated with the occurrence of a single, severe, clinical event (adjusted odds ratio: 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-5.3) and an incompletely understood risk of a second clinical event (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.4, 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.92).

HIV RNA levels are low in the prognosis of SB HIV-infected patients. HIV treatment in conjunction with prolonged antiretroviral therapy (VNIR) can decrease the incidence of spinal cord compression and increase the incidence of symptomatic spinal cord compression.


## Introduction
The clinical manifestations of myelosychaeyelitis/septic shock (MSSS) can be acute, subacute and chronic, respectively, and are characterized by the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) manifestations [1]. Although CNS manifestations are usually associated with acute disease, MSSS can also occur in the course of intensive or chronic diseases, such as osteomyelitis/synovium, fibrotic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercholesterolemia and infectious diseases, when the patient is admitted to the hospital. The clinical manifestations of MSSS has been reported in patients with pulmonary or disseminated disease, but also in patients without neurological symptoms [2,3].

An increasing number of studies have shown that MSSS may be a possible complication of pulmonary or disseminated disease, which may be associated with non-specific symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, fever, chest pain, headache, and muscle pains [4,5]. The clinical manifestations of MSSS varies according to the geographical region, patient, type of treatment, and prognostic agent used. Pulmonary disease and cryptococcosis are the main infectious diseases, while CNS manifestations and infections are rarely reported in this population.


## Methods

The whole blood was obtained by venipuncture from one zebrafish larval model that showed a high relative infection rate [13] and was considered a potential source of infection [14. The blood was also collected from one zebrafish model that showed a high relative infection rate [14]. The blood was also collected from the top 5% of the population, which is usually associated with an infection rate [15]. The top 1% of the population in the experiments was also considered to be the source of infection [16].

The zebrafish model used was one of the models used for immunohistochemistry experiments. The model used was a Hamamatsu model of a zebrafish larval model.


## Results
magnophilus Ran1 on immune response, we compared the virulence of strains of . magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi. Twenty-four well-established P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi models were tested for P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi phenotypes (Fig 2A and B). Twenty-four P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi models exhibited different virulence profiles compared to the P. pachyrhizi model (Fig 2A). The virulence of P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains was found to be significantly attenuated (P<0.05) when compared to the P. pachyrhizi model, as they were able to disseminate through the skin and colonize the gastric tract (Fig 2C). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract with higher frequency than the P. pachyrhizi strain (Fig 2D). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were more resistant to systemic infection in the colonized skin compared to the P. pachyrhizi model, as they were able to survive in the colonized gut (Fig 2E). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were more resistant to systemic infection in the gastric tract compared to the P. pachyrhizi model, as they were able to survive in the gut (Fig 2F). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were more resistant to systemic infection in the colonized skin compared to the P. pachyrhizi model, as they were able to survive in the colonized gut (Fig 2G). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were more resistant to systemic infection in the colonized skin compared to the P. pachyrhizi model, as they were able to survive in the gut (Fig 2H). The P. magnophilus and P. pachyrhizi strains were more resistant to systemic infection in the colonized skin compared to the P.


## Discussion
coli, which is the main cause of diarrhea in zebrafish (Liu et a., 2014). In this study, the majority of the isolates of S. suis were S. cerevisiae and S. suis was the predominant species. In the present study, S. suis and S. cerevisiae were the dominant species in the water column samples. In addition, E. coli and S. pneumonia were the other major pathogenic bacteria, which may be due to their different ability to cause infection in fish (Gao et al., 2013). The results indicated that S. suis and S. cerevisiae were the dominant species in the water column samples and S. suis was the dominant species in the water column samples. However, S. pneumonia was the other dominant bacterial species in the water column samples. Therefore, the species of S. suis in this study were the dominant species in the water column samples and S. cerevisiae was the predominant species in the water column samples. However, the species of S. pneumonia were the dominant bacterial species in the water column samples and S. suis was the dominant species in the water column samples. Therefore, S. suis and S. cerevisiae were the dominant species in this study.

The results indicated that the S. suis strain, S. cerevisiae, was more dominant in the water column samples and S. suis strain was more dominant in the water column samples. The difference was in the number of colonies forming the zebrafish larvae. In this study, the number of colonies forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples. The number of colonies forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples. The percentage colony forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples. The percentage colony forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples. In addition, the number of colonies forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples. The difference was in the number of colonies forming the zebrafish larvae was higher than that of the water column samples.

In this study, the amount of nutrients was higher than that of the water columns. The food supplement for fish was included in the Zebrafish larvae. The fish was in the fish to eat supplement.
