## Abstract
This study investigated the importance of colony forming unit (CFU) protein family members for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) survival and immunomodulatory behavior. Bacterial CFB proteins were targeted by CRISPR/Cas9, and their interactions with Cas9 were analyzed by reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Surprisingly, the contribution of B cells to host immune responses was little investigated, which might imply that B cells are specifically targeted by Cas9 in the PBMC and not the B cells. CRISPR/Cas9 overexpression of Cas9 affected the B cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a blockade of the Cas9-Golgi complex complex in B cells reduced the accumulation of the bacilli. The blockade of the GC-DAD receptor pathway also altered the B cells response to Bifidobacterium chapsingensis, suggesting that Cas9 plays a key role in host innate immune responses against this bacterium. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 expression increased in PBMC cultures, supporting the importance of B cells for the recognition of this bacterium. Together, our data demonstrated the importance of B cells as both antigen presenting cells and regulators of host immune responses, as well as helper cells. This study provides novel insights into the regulation of host immune responses in the context of B cell recognition and antibacterial activity, and may help elucidate the immune responses of PBMC to Bifidobacterium chapsingensis.


## Introduction
In addition to this, several genes that govern BCR functionality in vivo [22-24] have been identified as possible targets for the development of new antiviral drugs [25-28. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of BCR signaling to modulate bacterial virulence in vivo. To this end, we screened a set of clinically relevant BCR- and BCR-responsive genes in vitro, and discovered that BCR-R-mediated virulence can be modulated by BCR signaling, particularly when targeting viruses or bacteria.


## Methods
We analysed the dataset using the BIOMOTY web service (https://ww.biomoty.org) and all taxonomic assignments were done using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). We first identified the most common taxonomic groups, the most common taxonomic groups of microbes, and the most common taxonomic groups of bacteria, fungi and archaea, and then used the most abundant taxonomic groups for our analyses. The BIOMOTY website (https://biomoty.org/) is a powerful platform that enables the analysis of the dataset and the use of automated tools. We then compared the results of our analyses of the data to the most abundant taxonomic groups, and compared them to the most abundant taxonomic groups, to obtain the most representative results. We used the same methods to identify the most abundant taxonomic groups, as well as to assess their association with pathogens and the fungal pathogenicity. We then used the BIOMOTY web service (https://www.biomoty.org) to perform a search using the most abundant taxonomic groups and to detect the most abundant taxonomic groups. We used the Biodiversity and Human Microbiome (HMM) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mole/biodiversity/) to search for the most relevant categories, and the HMM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mole/hmm/) to search for the most likely group. We used the HMM (http://hmmer.org/) to search for the most likely group (http://hmmer.org/) and the HMM (http://hmmer.org/) to search for the most likely group (http://hmmer.org/) to add the most common taxonomic groups. We used the HMM (http://hmmer.org/) to search for the most likely group (http://hmmer.org/) to add the most common taxonomic groups.

## Results
dermatitidis, we attempted to generate proteins that exhibit significant reduction in their ability to co-express with . dermatitidis. The production of autophagy-associated proteins is directly dependent on the activity of autophagy-related genes (Figure 2B). To assess whether the autophagy-associated proteins were expressed during the growing period, we assessed the levels of their expression in the yeast cultures grown on rich medium (YPD) and in the absence of autophagy. We observed that most of the autophagy-associated proteins were not expressed during the growth period (Figure 2B, left). These results suggest that autophagy does not regulate the expression of autophagy-associated proteins during autophagic growth.

In contrast, the expression of several proteins involved in autophagy was increased in the yeast cultures (Figure 2B). Most of these were significantly up-regulated in the absence of autophagy. Although many of these proteins were up-regulated in the yeast cultures, we did not observe a clear correlation between the expression of these proteins and autophagic growth. The autophagy-associated proteins are mainly expressed in the yeast cells (Figure 2B). Thus, the autophagy-associated proteins are mainly expressed in yeast cells.

The Biochemical Characterization of the Autophagy-Associated Protein
Our BLASTp analysis identified three autophagy-associated proteins in B. dermatitidis (Figure 3A). The proteins are involved in vacuolar protein trafficking (KAS1) and autophagy (KAS2) (Figure 3A). The autophagy-associated proteins are usually expressed in yeast cells. However, the autophagy-associated proteins were up-regulated in the yeast cultures (Figure 3A, left). We speculate that autophagy may be involved in the functions of autophagy proteins. To test whether autophagy may be involved in the functions of autophagy-associated proteins, we performed a dot blot analysis using whole-cell extracts from the yeast and B. dermatitidis cultures grown on rich medium and in the absence of autophagy. We observed that a few autophagy proteins were up-regulated in the yeast cultures. For example, the autophagy-associated protein (BxIA1) was up-regulated in the yeast cultures (Figure 3A, right).


## Discussion
However, it is unclear if autophagy is activated by the same signals present in the extracellular environment, such as pH, temperature, and environmental cue. In the present study, we demonstrated that autophagy is required for the differentiation of the yeast cell wall by maintaining the integrity of the cell wall by both enhancing the protein content and enhancing the ergosterol content. This may reflect the different cellular functions of autophagy in the yeasts that we studied. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining cell wall integrity by maintaining the cell wall integrity [26]. In addition, the activation of autophagy by E. coli autophagy results in a decrease in the production of glucose and lipid in the extracellular environment [27]. In addition, autophagy has been shown to be required for the maintenance of cell wall integrity by maintaining the integrity of the cell wall by maintaining the cell wall-associated components of the cell wall [28]. These results indicate that autophagy is important for maintaining cell wall integrity in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, our findings are consistent with other studies that demonstrated the involvement of autophagy in the regulation of cell growth and development [29]. However, this study found that autophagy plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and development, as autophagy was not found to be associated with cell death. This result may be due to the fact that the cell wall of S. cerevisiae is highly functional and consists of important cell wall components, such as proteins and lipids, that are produced by autophagy. However, the cells used in the present study were grown in vitro. The results demonstrated that autophagy plays a critical role in cell growth and development of S. cerevisiae.

Also, the BgsA transcription factor was found to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and development of S. cerevisiae. BgsA plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth and development, as cells grown in vitro have significantly reduced cell growth, and the cell growth and development is significantly impaired.
