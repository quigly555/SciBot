## Abstract
We previously showed that the biotrophic fungi Botrytis cinerea and C. multilocularis, which are intrinsically resistant to each other, share the same cytoplasmic membrane and nucleus. To understand the membrane-domain structure of the innate immune cell nucleus, we generated a block spliceosome and identified the M1/S1 domain of the B cationic receptor. The B cationic receptor was required for its activation, transport activity and homeostasis in the biotrophic fungi and C. multilocularis share the M2 domain of the C2 spliceosome. Deletion of the B cationic receptor inhibited the induction of IL-1ß, CXCL1 and CCL5 in the biotrophic fungi, reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased the levels of caspase-9 and FKBP-1 in C. multilocularis, but not B cationic receptor. The M2 domain of C2 spliceosome is unusual in fungi, where it has been previously linked to transcription and splicing. These findings provide a new link between intracellular survival of the biotroph and innate immunity.

Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Genomic studies in mammals have shown that B. neoformans is a multinucleate, biotrophic fungus. However, the cellular and molecular processes that govern cellular differentiation and replication in this fungus are poorly understood. In this study, we identified the M1/S1 domain of the B cationic receptor, BcR, in B. neoformans. M2-like proteins were identified in BcR homologs of the C. neoformans cytoplasmic membrane, and our results expanded on this domain to include BcR homologs of the human nuclear receptor (adr)-like kinase (adrk) and alternatively spliced T-A/H-inducible factor (dsl) in the C. neoformans cytoplasmic membrane.


## Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and poorly understood condition characterized by the presence of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. This condition is often suspected to be an autoimmune-mediated disorder or a rare variant of it.HLH is rare in children. We report an unusual case of HLH with multifocal infiltrates in the lower extremity, as well as an abundant nodule in the lower extremity of the left foot.


## Methods

.5. Induction of Conidial Growth on PDA by Intracellular Osmosulfate Samples
Conidia of the active microorganism PDA (Fungal Microorganisms Association of America) were extracted from PDA plants growing on PDA by the method of Sambrook et al. [23]. The extract was diluted with distilled water and the number of conidia was counted in a Neubauer chamber (approximately 10^4 conidia/mL). The extract was diluted with distilled water and inoculated on PDA for 5 days, and the number of conidia was counted in a Neubauer chamber (approximately 10^5 conidia/mL). The mycelial growth was determined by counting the number of conidia on the leaf edge of the PDA plant. The results were expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.

2.6. In Vitro Effect of PDA and Fungal Osmosulfate Samples on the Clinical Isolates of PDA
The in vitro in vitro susceptibility of the in vitro PDA-based oral candidiasis treatment to C. neoformans was determined by using the antifungal agent Fungal Osmosulfate (FOMS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). In brief, PDA was dissolved in sterile distilled water (1 × 10^4 conidia/mL) and diluted with 0.1% Tween 80 (w/v) before the test. The solution was transferred into a sterile bottle and then placed on a glass slide and covered with a paper towel. FOMS was added to the slide at the same concentrations (10^4-10^6 conidia/mL) and the slide was placed on a glass slide and covered with a paper towel. The slides were incubated at 25°C for 5 days, and the lowest FOMS concentration that inhibited the growth of the mycelial growth was the lowest concentration at which the test was not performed.

2.7. In Vitro Effect of FOMS and FOMS-Based Osmosulfate on the Microorganism PDA
The in vitro in vitro susceptibility of the in vitro PDA-based oral candidiasis treatment to C. neoformans was determined by using the antifungal agent FOMS (FOMS, Sigma-Aldrich, St.


## Results
In this way, the saponification process was applied to the new strain. The amounts of saponified extracts are indicated in Table 4.

When the results of the saponification procedure were compared with those obtained with the conventional method, the leaves of the greenish-white plants were significantly reduced by 9.2% (± 0.6) in comparison with the control leaves, and that of the Mediterranean green leaves was also significantly reduced by 13.7% (± 0.4) in comparison with the control leaves. For the leaves of the Mediterranean green plants, the amounts of saponified extracts were 16.5% (± 0.2) and 23.3% (± 0.4) in comparison with the control leaves, respectively, and the amounts of saponified extracts were 15.7% (± 0.4) and 40.8% (± 0.3) in comparison with the control leaves, respectively. In the leaves of the Mediterranean green plants, the amounts of saponified extracts were 23.3% (± 0.5) and 52.5% (± 0.5) in comparison with the control leaves, respectively, and the amounts of saponified extracts were 13.7% (± 0.4) and 49.5% (± 0.5) in comparison with the control leaves, respectively. The leaves of the Mediterranean green plants showed a significant difference in the amounts of saponified extracts compared with that in the leaves of the control leaves. For the leaves of the Mediterranean green plants, the amounts of saponified extracts were 4.5% (± 0.7) and 27.2% (± 0.5) in comparison with the control leaves, and the amounts of saponified extracts were 9.8% (± 0.3) and 24.3% (± 0.5) in comparison with the control leaves, respectively.

For the leaves of the Mediterranean green plants, the amounts of saponified extracts were 5.5% (± 0.5) and 30.8% (± 0.6) in comparison with the control leaves, and the amounts of saponified extracts were 7.4% (± 0.3) and 41.4% (± 0.


## Discussion
However, it is not possible to determine the concentration of this compound in the decaying plant or to predict its activity in the nematod. It is worth noting that the inhibitory effects of terpenes on the growth of nematodes are closely related to those observed for other compounds such as pyrrolidin and naphthol (Barrs et al. 2008).

The microorganisms that live on the surface of the rotting wood of P. brasiliensis are known to secrete a number of defense compounds, such as echinulin, flavones, and saponins (Gronk et al. 2006). In this study, the compound showed inhibition against the pathogen, P. brasiliensis, whereas this was not observed for other pathogenic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum (Zhou et al. 2014). P. brasiliensis was initially considered as an opportunistic fungal infection, but this was not the case with this compound. The organism has been reported to produce phytotoxins that can lead to serious side effects in humans (Pritchard et al. 2011). However, this compound did not show significant toxicity against the nematode, and the bacterium was able to grow on the leaves of P. brasiliensis leaves. This result is in accordance with previous studies showing that the antimicrobial activity of a number of plant extracts and species of fungi is attributed to their ability to inhibit a number of enzymes (Takahashi and Kato 2012). The anti-microbial activity of E. coli extract could also be attributed to the presence of flavones and saponins in the extract. P. brasiliensis saponins are known to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively (Zhang et al. 2013). The antimicrobial activity of this extract was also reported against A. fumigatus and Escherichia coli (Pietro et al. 2014). In the present study, the antimicrobial activity was observed for P. brasiliensis and other pathogenic fungi. These results are in agreement with the reported literature that shows the activity of other plant extracts against fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus (Cohen et al. 2012), and A. terreus (Ras et al. 2012).
