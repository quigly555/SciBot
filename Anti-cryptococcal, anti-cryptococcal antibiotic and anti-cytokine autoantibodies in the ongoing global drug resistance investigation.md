## Abstract
The endophytic fungi Rhizopus spp. are important pathogens of important crops, such as soybeans, corn, cotton, and soya.


## Introduction
The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pan-resistant (PAR) bacterial pathogens, including M. avium complex (MAVS) and M. bovis complex (MABC) have become increasingly recognized as the major causes of human infections.1-3 The close contact of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, a variety of immune mechanisms, and various surgical procedures, make the use of antibiotics for the treatment of MDR and PAR infections (e.g., removal of abscesses, administration of antibiotics to treat bacterial sinuses, and administration of antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections) a growing medical concern.4-9

However, the use of antibiotics in the treatment of MDR and PAR infections, the risk of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the long period of exposure to antibiotics, and the lack of a formal safety evaluation system to evaluate the safety of antibiotics in patients and to decide on the best antibiotic for the treatment of infections have made the implementation of antibiotics in practice (e.g., bétonchérine de décritologie, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, BLS-D-19-0015) a challenge.10 However, few studies have evaluated the safety of antibiotics used in the treatment of MDR and PAR infections. In the present study, the safety of three antibiotic classes, M. avium complex and MABS, were evaluated using a clinical microbiology laboratory. The results showed that M. avium complex and MABS were associated with worse antimicrobial activity than their counterparts from the bétonchérine and eccentrically-approved drugs.


## Methods
ac.org/resources/fungi/laboratory.php) were used to identify the most common pathogens that cause Cryptococcus in the population.

A total of 157 antifungal drugs were used to identify the most common Candida species in India, which is very high in this country, but not in India. The total number of drugs used for antifungal drug discovery is about 85% of the total number of drugs in the study, and in the current study this number had increased to 70% in 2015.

Two patients were identified as being resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole and two patients were identified as being resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole.

In this study, only Candida species were included in the database, which is the most important species in India, with 36 strains representing 35% of the global population. Candida strains were identified using the API 20C AUX system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and were classified as “Candida spp.”

The primary outcome of the study was the identification of the most common Candida species and the identification of the most common Candida spp. were identified using the FLORPA-3 algorithm [11]. The secondary outcome was the identification of the most common Candida spp. with the results from the secondary analysis were classified as “susceptible” (resultant Candida species only) or “susceptible” (resultant Candida spp. only) to fluconazole. The evaluation of the data was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Medical Research.

## Results

The main concentrations of . albicans and C. neoformans were determined by testing the concentration of D-glucan. D-glucan is one of the main components of cell walls of fungal cells and is known to interfere with the binding and penetration of the fungal cells by the immune system [2,3]. As shown in Figure 7, the drug concentrations of C. neoformans and C. albicans were also determined.

In addition, the concentrations of the antimicrobial agents tested were determined by assessing the concentration of the antimicrobial agents. As shown in Figure 8, the concentrations of the antimicrobial agents tested in these experiments were in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 µg/ml. The data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA results indicated that the mean concentrations of the antimicrobial agents tested by the C. neoformans and C. albicans strains were 1.7 µg/ml and 2.3 µg/ml, respectively. The values of the ANOVA results of C. albicans strains were in the range of 0.5 to 2.3 µg/ml.

In order to evaluate the difference between the results of C. neoformans and C. albicans in the susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents tested, the MIC, MFC and MFC_50 values of the drugs were determined. The data revealed that the MFC of the drugs tested was 1.0 µg/ml for the C. neoformans and 0.25 µg/ml for the C. albicans strains, respectively.

The results of the synergistic antimicrobial activity against C. neoformans and C. albicans are shown in Figure 9. The results of the synergistic activity against C. neoformans and C. albicans were in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 µg/ml. The values of the MFC of the drugs tested were in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 µg/ml. The results of the synergistic antimicrobial activity against C. albicans are shown in Figure 10. The results of the synergistic antimicrobial activity against C. neoformans and C. albicans are in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 µg/ml.


## Discussion
 2016.

The majority of the published cases of fungal infections have been associated with a GID or a G. mellonella or with a G. mellonella. However, this infection has been found to be rare and rarely described. A retrospective study of all patients in the research performed by Kavris et al. (2018) concluded that the majority of cases (59%) were related to infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, and 45% were associated with infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Kavris et al., 2018). The majority of the reported cases of GID or G. mellonella were related to infections caused by M. tuberculosis and M. gattii, while the majority of reported cases were associated with infections caused by Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis (Kavris et al., 2018).

The study conducted by Kavris et al. (2018) found that the majority of reported cases of fungal infections had been due to S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. In addition, the authors found that G. mellonella was the most frequently infected species in the current study. The reason for the occurrence of other fungal infections in the G. mellonella case could not be identified. The authors conclude that the infection of G. mellonella was due to the occurrence of several pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, which is considered the most common cause of G. mellonella pneumonia (Kavris et al., 2018). In our study, the most common fungal infection was S. pneumoniae, which was also the most common cause of G. mellonella pneumonia (35%). This finding indicates that G. mellonella is a relatively common cause of G. mellonella pneumonia in G. mellonella.

The majority of reported cases of G. mellonella infection were associated with infections caused by M. tuberculosis (43%), which is the most common cause of G. mellonella pneumonia in G. mellonella (Clemons et al., 2016). The authors found that M. tuberculosis is a common cause of G. mellonella pneumonia (39%). This finding indicates that M. tuberculosis is a less virulent cause of G.
