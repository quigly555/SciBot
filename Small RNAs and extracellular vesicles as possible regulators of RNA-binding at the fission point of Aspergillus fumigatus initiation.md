## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common etiologic agent of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, and the most frequently encountered fungal mould in this group. However, A. fumigatus is also present as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. To better understand and recognize this fungus as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, we first describe the phenotypic features of the fatal case of Aspergillus fumigatus in a patient receiving combined therapy of amphotericin B and flucytosine. Second, we report the rare case of a patient with a rare genetic predisposition to Aspergillus occurring in a non-endemic setting in Kenya. Although rare, the high degree of immunophenotypic diversity in our patient population makes it a very real possibility that this fungus may be responsible for fatal complications in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction
Cerebrovascular accidents are a common complication of haematological disorders such as haematopoietic stem cell anemia (ABSA) and malignancy. The incidence of bis(2-keto)carboline-induced vasculitis (BKA) is increasing and accounts for 80% of all BKA cases in Europe and the United States (Göker and Voigt, 2002; Selker et al., 2003). The first cases of BKA were reported in Norway in 1988, and the number of cases increased during the same period in Sweden. The most common symptoms are shortness of breath, headache, nausea, and vomiting, and hypertension. A randomized study in Norway compared the incidence of BKA with the incidence of malaria, bacterial infections, and fungal infections (Klugstrom et al., 1989). The incidence of BKA has increased steadily over the past 50 years, with a higher incidence in Africa, especially in the Middle East, and in Spain in the 1990s a case was reported more often than in the United States (Helander et al., 1998). The occurrence of BKA has been reported in two countries in the United States (Nelson et al., 1992) and Denmark (Nelson et al., 1992), whereas the frequency and type of complications have been mostly reported in the European countries. The most common BKA complications include fever, headache, nausea, fever and vomiting, while the incidence of septicemia and abdominal pain was reported in the United States (Nelson et al., 1992). There is also a high prevalence in Brazil (Nelson et al., 1992). The incidence of BKA has been reported in 50 countries and several African countries (Selker et al., 2003). The majority of the cases are caused by the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Odekker et al., 2002).


## Methods

All other RNAs and extracellular vesicles were removed by RNAse A and Hyb . RNAs were also removed by RNAse B. The concentration of RNAs was determined by ELISA using the antibodies: rabbit anti-caspase C (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and rabbit anti-rabbit IgG (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). For RNAse B, the RNeasy™ Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Microarray analysis
For microarray analysis, cells were grown in a liquid medium at 37°C for 16 h with shaking. Cells were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). RNAse B was diluted to 10 µg/mL and treated with RNAse A at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). Samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL).

The RNA-binding to Aspergillus fumigatus was quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA-binding to Aspergillus fumigatus was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the RNA in the presence of the RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at 0 and 25 µg/mL. The samples were incubated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL). The samples were treated with RNAs or RNAs-free RNAse B at the indicated concentrations (25 µg/mL).


## Results
First, we established the FLAG RNAs in the FLAG-RNA-fission strain by employing a Gaussian distribution method (Figure 4A. Second, the FLAG RNAs were delivered via the double-stranded RNAi method. Third, the FLAG RNAs were delivered via the double-stranded RNAi method. Finally, we performed experiments in the presence of the specific FLAG RNAs (Figure 4B). These experiments were designed to assess the total amount of RNAs in the plasma membrane of the FLAG-RNA-fission strain.

The total amount of FLAG RNAs in the plasma membrane of the FLAG-RNA-fission strain was approximately 3-fold lower than in the control strain (Figure 4C). The average number of FLAG RNAs per cell was 4.5 times that of the control strain. These results indicated that the RNA-binding activity of the FLAG RNAs is dependent on the concentration of the RNA-binding complex. In the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) or 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), the total amount of FLAG RNAs was about 10-fold lower than in the control strain. Thus, the total amount of FLAG RNAs in the plasma membrane of the FLAG-RNA-fission strain was approximately 10-fold less than that of the control strain. These results demonstrated that FLAG RNAs bind to the plasma membrane of Aspergillus fumigatus and result in direct binding of FLAG RNAs to the plasma membrane of the fungus.

To further probe the regulation of FLAG RNAs by the FLAG RNAs, we performed a RNA-binding assay. A small RNA (sRNA) was injected into the plasma membrane of the FLAG RNAs and quantified by Western blotting. The RNA-binding activity of the FLAG RNAs was assessed by testing their ability to bind to the FLAG RNAs in the presence of 5-FOA or 5-FOA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RNAs.


## Discussion

The differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex response of the yeasts and filamentous fungi towards sRNAs and extracellular vesicles are likely to be of two type. The first is the dependence on the presence of the DNA-binding machinery, which is suggested to be conserved in S. cerevisiae, and is present in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. The second type is the persistent interplay between the two types of S. cerevisiae during cDNA synthesis [20,27].

The expression of the sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript, which is essential for translation initiation, and the extracellular vesicles, which are mainly responsible for RNA-binding, appear to be induced by a variety of stimuli. For example, the transcription of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript is upregulated in response to sRNAs induced by DNA-binding and by DNA-binding alone [20,23]. The expression of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript was also induced by DNA-binding, and upregulated by DNA-binding alone [20]. This indicates that DNA-binding leads to the induction of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript, and that DNA-binding induces the transcription of the sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript. This suggests that DNA-binding is probably the main mechanism of the induction of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript, as reported previously [20,23].

The expression of the sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript is downregulated in response to DNA-binding, as suggested by the upregulation of the expression of the sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript in the presence of sRNAs [20]. This indicates that DNA-binding is probably the main mechanism of the induction of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript.

The expression of the hIL-17A transcript is upregulated in response to DNA-binding and upregulated in the presence of sRNAs [20]. This suggests that DNA-binding leads to the induction of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript. The presence of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript indicates that DNA-binding is probably the main mechanism of the induction of sRNAs on the hIL-17A transcript.
