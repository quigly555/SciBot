## Abstract
Members of the gnotobacterial genus Acanthamoeba that belong to the order Cryphobacterium have had diverse roles in the last two decades. In this paper, we present the latest studies of the phylogeny of the Acanthamoeba clade and its clade-specific evolutionary traits. These latest results emphasize the importance of cryptic species in the order and provide references for future studies. The evolutionary analyses of these species, which mainly focused on the sexual life cycle of A. flavus, revealed that morphological characters such as colour, framework and stipe can all play a role in their sexual and/or sexual antagonistic roles. Analyses of sexual and antagonistic roles of five different acanthamoeba species in three different evolutionary clades revealed the existence of two additional species, namely A. flavus (now A. flavus) and A. furnani (formerly A. flavus).


## Introduction
Chlamydospores are small spherical, spherical to sub-convex, sub-intense, erect to erumpent, spherical, and with a truncate apex (Kirk et al. 2015). Chlamydospores can be found in a variety of habitats such as air, water, soil, animal feces, and plant litter.


## Methods
Mice were injected with PBS containing .05% BSA (pH 6.0) via the trachea and the trachea extension was used to extract fungal DNA from the lung tissues. Total DNA was extracted using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-3 Kit (Qiagen) and used for the amplification of the forward and reverse primers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA gene. The PCR amplification was performed using the following thermal profile: 3 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. All the primers used in the PCR amplification were listed in Table S1. The PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were used for the preparation of the A. fumigatus antigen and the experiments were performed in triplicate.

## Results
As shown in Fig 3B, the pH of the pH sensor device decreased from pH = 8 to pH = . The pH stabilization effect on the pH sensor device occurred as a result of pH enhancement, which is described in the methods section.

The pH stabilization effect on the pH sensor device was considered to be the result of the increase in pH stimulation, as well as the increase in pH stimulation. The pH stabilization effect was first measured by the time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h. The pH stabilization effect was measured using the time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h. The time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h was used to evaluate the effect of pH stimulation on the pH stabilization effect. The time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h showed a stronger effect on the pH stabilization effect than the time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h, as shown in Fig 3C. This indicates that the pH stabilization effect was caused by the pH stimulation in the pH sensor device.

The pH stabilization effect on the pH sensor device was also evaluated by the time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h. The pH stabilization effect was measured using the time-series imaging of the pH sensor device from 1 to 8 h.

## Discussion
albicans is the production of glycerol, a major component of the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway [17], [18. The glycerol pathway is a major source of carbon for the biosynthesis of glycerol, which is a key component of cell membranes [19]. The glycerol pathway is regulated by several enzymes involved in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway.

In this study, we identified genes encoding glycerol deacetylase, the deacetylase of deacetylated deacetylation of deacetylated fatty acid, and an adenylyl cyclase (cycline-cysteine-deacetylase) that are regulated by glycerol, which is a common component of the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway in C. albicans. Based on the previously described phenotypic and molecular model of C. albicans, we found that the cell membrane-bound glycerol promotes hyphal development and mucin production in C. albicans. The glycerol-3-phosphate pathway is a common pathway that is controlled by several enzymes, including cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (c-merCPP) dehydrogenase (CMP) and cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CPP) [20], [21], [22].

In this study, we showed that the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway is regulated by the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CPP) dehydrogenase genes in C. albicans. Our previous study showed that the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene is regulated by the cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CP) dehydrogenase and cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CPP) dehydrogenase genes in C. albicans, and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene is regulated by the cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CP) dehydrogenase and cyclic-mercapto-phosphate (CPP) dehydrogenase genes in C. albicans.
