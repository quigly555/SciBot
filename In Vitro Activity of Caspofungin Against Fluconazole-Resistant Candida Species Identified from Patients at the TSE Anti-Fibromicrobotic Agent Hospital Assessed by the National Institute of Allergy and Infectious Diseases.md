## Abstract
The genes coding for the polysaccharide capsule have recently been identified, mainly due to the recent increase in the number of Candida strains. However, the role of polysaccharides in the pathogenesis of human diseases and their antibiotic resistance remains unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that polysaccharides play a role in virulence of Candida glabrata in an animal model. Molecular modelling and high throughput sequencing was performed on Armitage occidentale yeast cells. Immunological optima were applied to analyse capsule-mediated factors that were enriched in polysaccharides accumulation. The results showed that polysaccharides were enriched in the secretory pathway in C. glabrata, mainly due to the enrichment of the secretion of a glycoprotein glycine. The encapsulated yeasts were resistant to triazoles and amphotericin B.


## Introduction
Clinicians and clinical microbiologists are still facing serious problems with the use of antibiotics in the management of common infections, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and the formation of biofilms in the skin, mucous membranes, or nails. The use of antibiotics for the management of common infections, such as lupus, is restricted in many countries. The global incidence of bacteremia due to Gram-positive bacteria has risen over the past decades, and the incidence of infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium has increased. While the number of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections has been decreasing, the number of infections caused by fungi has increased and the number of patients suffering from opportunistic infections is increasing [1]. The estimated global incidence of nosocomial bloodstream infections in the year 2019 was 0.97 per million inhabitants, which was the highest number in more than 20 years. The incidence of fungal infections was also higher in 2017 than in 2018 (0.93 per million inhabitants) [2]. The incidence of fungal infections is associated with many factors, including environmental conditions, and their etiology, such as the number of people with immunodeficiency or who have been given broad-spectrum antibiotics [3], [4].

The most common fungal infections are those caused by Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus. The risk factors for the development of these infections include a predisposition to immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. The most common Candida species that cause systemic fungal infections are Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis, but there are also Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. Other Candida species that cause skin, mucosa, and nails infections are Candida dubliniensis and Candida tropicalis. Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis are the most common fungal species causing systemic infections.


## Methods
 2012.

2.4. Antifungal Activity of Caspofungin against Candida Isolates
In the study of our previous report, we investigated the antifungal activity of the Caspofungin against Candida species as a result of the negative fungal inoculation method, according to the principle of “Theory of Flight” by the method of Finn and Freire (2003). In brief, 1 × 10^6 yeast cells in RPMI-1640 medium were inoculated into 96-well microplates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MICs of Caspofungin were determined by MIC_50 method using a spectrophotometric reading at the wavelength of 570 nm (Luo et al., 2001). The procedure of Buckley et al. (2004) was followed. The antifungal activity of the compound against the Candida species was considered the lowest concentration that resulted in no growth inhibition after 24 h.

2.5. Antifungal Activity of Caspofungin Against the Fungal Strain Isolates
The antifungal activity of the compound against the Fungal Strain was considered the lowest concentration that resulted in no growth inhibition after 24 h. The fungal species were selected based on their susceptibility to the compounds and its antifungal activity. The fungal isolates were collected from patients treated with Caspofungin at the TSE Antifungal Agent Hospital, Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, Brazil (Jain et al., 2012).

2.6. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Caspofungin against Fungal Strain Isolates
The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited at least 50% of fungal growth compared with the growth control. In the antifungal activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound that caused 80% of fungal growth compared with the growth control. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

2.7. MFC of Caspofungin against Fungal Strain Isolates
The MFC of the compound against Fungal Strain was determined by the method of Wang and Bailia (2003).


## Results
Fluconazole-resistant species were also identified from patients who were infected with . albicans or C. neoformans. In addition, Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata were identified from patients who were infected with C. albicans. The C. glabrata infection was not detected from patients who were infected with C. neoformans. The most active antifungal drug, fluconazole, was used in 86% of patients, followed by amphotericin B in 68% of patients, and echinocandins in 10% of patients. Caspofungin activity was determined in 81% of patients by the NIAID and the NNIHE, respectively.

3.4. Antibiofilm Activity of Caspofungin Against C. albicans Infection
The antifungal drug fluconazole was used in 88% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. albicans infection. Fluconazole was used in 67% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. albicans infection. Caspofungin activity was determined in 67% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. albicans infection.

3.5. Antifungal Activity of Caspofungin against Candida Infection
The antifungal drug fluconazole was used in 79% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. albicans infection. Fluconazole was used in 52% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. albicans infection.

3.6. Antifungal Activity of Caspofungin against C. glabrata Infection
The most active antifungal drug fluconazole was used in 65% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. glabrata infection. Fluconazole was used in 66% of patients to determine the most active antifungal drug against C. glabrata infection.

## Discussion
[14] The antifungal activity of Caspofungin against . neoformans and Cryptococcus spp. was investigated, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The antifungal activity of Caspofungin against C. neoformans was tested against 657 Candida spp., a total of 15 Candida species, and a total of 67 Candida species. Inhibition of the fungal growth was determined by the in vivo FK506-induced phagocytosis and by the phagocytosis of C. albicans.
