## Abstract
Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen, causing thousands of infections a year. The ability to grow in rich media and tolerate harsh environmental conditions is a prerequisite for development of novel drugs. To identify molecules with potent antifungal activity against this microorganism, we developed an in vitro enzyme-linked nanosuspension system (ELPS) based on a yeast-like scaffold of the fungal envelope. The system binds to the active compounds in the fungal surface and, in particular, the polyenes, and uses these to disrupt the fungal cell wall. The system is particularly effective at killing yeast cells and it produces molecules with the characteristics of antifungal polyenes. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of the ELPS-based nanosuspension system to disrupt the fungal cell wall, using an experimental strain of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Thus, the system could be a new approach for the treatment of infections caused by this fungus.

Candida albicans is a common human fungal pathogen that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. In an effort to identify molecules with potent antifungal activity against this fungus, we have developed an in vitro enzyme-linked nanosuspension system for the treatment of infections caused by this fungus. The system harbors molecules involved in morphogenesis, virulence, and drug resistance, which are also targeted by the system. To evaluate the antifungal activity of these molecules, we developed the enzyme-linked nanosuspension system for the treatment of infections caused by this fungus.


## Introduction

The main component of the fungal cell wall, glucans, plays a critical role in fungal lif. Indeed, fungal glucans are a major part of the cell wall and are present in the cell wall of all eukaryotic organisms, including humans. Fungal cells are considered to be in constant contact with the external environment. Therefore, fungal cell walls are considered as a complex and dynamic interface that allows the growth and survival of the fungus [40]. Therefore, there is an increasing focus on the development of immunotherapies that target the protective mechanisms of the immune system and its interplay with the host immune system [41]. Immunotherapies can be defined as treatments that induce the immune system to recognize and destroy the fungal cell wall. These immune and non-immune therapies will be aimed at preventing the infection and are aimed at: (i) the detection of and detection of fungal cell wall components, and (ii) their degradation and identification.

The cell wall is a structure of microbial cells and is composed of a core core-work consisting of polysaccharides, chitin, and mannoproteins. The cell wall is considered a home environment for fungi, with a significant contribution from the host, and therefore it is expected to be degraded in the course of infection. During the development of infection, the host must recognize and destroy fungal cells and scavenge these compounds to eliminate the pathogen. The first step of pathogenesis involves the recognition and recognition of fungal cells by the host. This recognition is mainly mediated by several receptors and molecules that have different functions in fungi, and have been divided into members of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II. MHC class I molecules have been considered to be secretory molecules and bind to the pathogen, while class II molecules are membrane-bound molecules that interact with other receptors and molecules present on the cell wall. The interactions of MHC class II molecules with host receptors and molecules present on the cell wall are critical in the recognition of the fungus and in the pathogenesis of infection. MHC class II molecules are expressed by many types of fungi and play an important role in the recognition of fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma and other fungal species [42].


## Methods
The bacterial strain was isolated from a patient with a proven diagnosis of cryptococcosis in Spain, and it was identified by microscopy using the same diagnostic methods as the Candida specie. The isolate was confirmed by morphological and molecular identification, and the identification of this organism was confirmed by two pathogen-specific mycobacterial strains: Streptococcus pyogenes (CE/HSC/Cryptococcus gattii) and Bacillus subtilis (CAT/ Bacillus ampicillata).

The Candida species is a heterotrophic bacterial strain of C. gattii. In terms of species distribution, C. gattii is mainly identified as Aspergillus species. A further major order of C. gattii includes C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis tropicalis, and C. tropicalis sp.

A negative control of the fungal culture was also performed. The fungus was grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 37 °C for 48 h, and then diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10^8 CFU/mL. The strain was suspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then added to the sterile petri dishes. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the fungal colony count was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan Ultra-Fine, Germany).

Statistical Analysis
To test the accuracy of the methodologies described by Fonzi, two independent data-dependent tests were performed: one was conducted by the Mantel-Cox log rank test and the other by the Mantel-Cox nonparametric test. The data-dependent test was performed by the Mantel-Cox nonparametric test using the following formula: % = (1 - number of tests in parentheses in parentheses) × 100.


## Results
We therefore investigated the impact of Cryptococcus gattii on the environment and health in the worl.

Effects of Cryptococcus gattii on the Hosts
The C. gattii strain with the highest similarity to C. albicans is likely to infect a higher proportion of humans than the C. glabrata strain. This is in line with the results in the C. neoformans genome database, where the strain with the highest similarity to C. gattii causes higher morbidity and mortality than the C. neoformans strain. Moreover, the fungus with the highest similarity to C. neoformans has been found to have a lower incidence of systemic candidiasis than C. gattii in the USA [25]. The incidence of C. neoformans infection is higher in developed countries than in developed countries, with a median value of 24.9% (25). Thus, the incidence of C. neoformans infection in developed countries is a very high proportion of the total human population. The C. neoformans strain with the highest similarity to C. gattii could also cause morbidity and mortality in humans, but the incidence of C. neoformans infection in developed countries is higher than in developed countries.

The impact of Cryptococcus gattii on the hosts of C. gattii was examined by determining the impact of Cryptococcus gattii on the host tissue of the two host species. Infection of C. gattii in rat liver and brain resulted in the loss of a large proportion of cells in the rat alveolar spaces. In contrast, infection of C. neoformans in rat kidneys resulted in the loss of a small percentage of cells in the rat alveolar spaces (Table 4). These results suggest that Cryptococcus gattii in humans are not only more virulent than C. neoformans, but also can cause pathogenic and/or nosocomial infections in animals.

Effects of Cryptococcus gattii on the Environmental Stress Response
Environmental stress responses are important in protecting the human and animal health. We therefore examined the effect of Cryptococcus gattii on the environment, the stress response, and the health of the animals.

We observed that the stress response was negatively correlated with the C. neoformans strain with the highest similarity to C.


## Discussion
gattii, . neoformans, C. gattii, and Cryptococcus gattii, use diverse and genetically diverse niches and habitats. These microbial species, and their ecological niches, are not necessarily in the same geographical area and season, but rather in a different geographical region. Thus, in a global context, these ecological niches could be exploited for the production of different products. For instance, C. gattii may be the most frequently isolated species in China, which is located in the North-West region, as well as in the Eastern regions, where it is widespread and has been isolated for the past 10 years [59]. The ecological niches of C. gattii can also provide nutrients, especially in the rainy season, for its growth and development [60]. Similarly, the soil microflora of C. gattii, which are associated with a high number of microorganisms, are known to be affected by soil microorganisms, such as soil fungi and Aspergillus fumigatus [61]. In the present study, we showed that C. gattii is the most abundant fungal pathogen in soil samples of middle-income countries of the world, which could be the reason for the significant growth of C. gattii in soil microflora. This may be due to the existence of microorganisms that are able to colonize and colonize soil, such as Fusarium species, which are widely distributed in the soil.

While the ability of C. gattii to cause disease is still unknown, in a previous study, we found that C. gattii could infect sheep and dogs, causing disease in sheep and dogs in a field of 100 sheep and 5 dogs in the same field [62]. Moreover, the disease caused by C. gattii could be detected in dogs and sheep, which is in agreement with our results. In addition, we found that C. gattii is able to infect dogs, which indicates that it could be a potential pathogen of C. gattii in dogs.

Fusarium species are ubiquitous in the environment and can be found in soil, water, trees, and bird droppings [63]. In this study, we found that the fungus is able to colonize and cause disease in the soil, as well as in the water.
