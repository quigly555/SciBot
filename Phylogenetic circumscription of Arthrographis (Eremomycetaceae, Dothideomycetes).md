## Abstract
Fusarium graminearum is a plant pathogen causing devastating losses to many native plants in North America. The key to successful infection of Fusarium species in North America has been the discovery of new methods of inoculation and cultivation. Here we present a review of the methodologies used for the production of Fusarium clavipes from northeastern regions using an Indian framework. The methodologies used include traditional (Western), traditional-inspired, and modified techniques in preparation, nutrient management, and inoculum and inoculum dilution. A comprehensive understanding of F. graminearum, its genetics, and mycological aspects is also provided. This knowledge can be integrated with previous infection data from plant communities in the North American region. Key parameters included (i) plant biomass, (ii) fitness, (iii) location, (iv) mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi, and (v) available inoculum and dilution media. Results show that based on previous data, the dilution media dilutioned Fusarium to medium consisting of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 g/L of inoculum, 0.1 g/L of inoculum dilutioned Fusarium to medium consisting of 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 g/L of inoculum, and 0.1 g/L of an equivalent dilution media dilute of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. These findings were supported by microscopy, which showed that the mycorrhizal and endophytic fungal biomass dilutions were reduced by 96, 78, and 57%, respectively. Microscopy showed that the dilute media dilutioned F. graminearum at a dilution of 0.2 g/L was significantly less efficient than a medium that was diluted with 0.0, 0.1, and 1.


## Introduction
Fungi are highly specialized organisms that inhabit extreme environments and that can survive for long periods in extremely low temperatures (thermo-thermal stress). These organisms are able to adapt to extreme conditions and still be found in extreme habitats, such as glaciers, ice caves, salt marshes, and sea water, as well as in extreme environments with extreme temperatures, salinity, and other environmental stressors. Most fungi are opportunistic pathogens that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients (Santos and Malfe√±a, 2005).

Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common fungal disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and can cause severe and often fatal meningoencephalitis.


## Methods
flavus strain Arthrographis (AFA) was inferred using four species of Arthrographis (AFA_1) and two Arthrographis (AFA_2) as outgroup. The phylogenetic placement of Arthrographis as outgroup is shown in Table 1. Two species of Arthrographis were included: A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The two species of Arthrographis that were used in our study were Arthrographis spp. and A. fumigatus. The species Arthrographis fumigatus was obtained from the Fumigatus species complex [27]. We inferred the phylogenetic position of Arthrographis spp. by two species of Arthrographis (AFA_1) and two Arthrographis (AFA_2). The species Arthrographis fumigatus was obtained from the Fumigatus species complex [28]. The species Arthrographis rhamnosus was obtained from the Rhamnosus species complex [29]. The phylogenetic position of Arthrographis rhamnosus was inferred using three species of Arthrographis (AFA_1, AFA_2) and two Arthrographis (AFA_2). The species Arthrographis rhamnosus was obtained from the Rhamnosus species complex [29]. The two species of Arthrographis rhamnosus were used in our study: A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The species Arthrographis rhamnosus was obtained from the Rhamnosus species complex [30]. The species Arthrographis rhamnosus was obtained from the Rhamnosus species complex [30]. The species Arthrographis rhamnosus was obtained from the Rhamnosus species complex [30]. The species Arthrographis flavus was obtained from the Flavus species complex [31]. The two species of Arthrographis flavus were included in our study: A. fumigatus and A. flavus.

## Discussion
The basidiomycetous yeasts . mucoides and P. commune, as well as the closely related R. sulcatus, are also morphologically similar and contain different ascospores. The addition of yeast-like growth conditions in an area with limited habitat for ryegrass should provide information on the morphological, genetic, and ecological roles of the mycobiome of R. sulcatus in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

The mycobiome of R. sulcatus is distinct from that of the more common S. brevicaulis, which is the closest relative of R. sulcatus in our phylogenetic analysis [59]. In addition to the mycobiome of R. sulcatus, the mycobiome of R. fusoides is also different from that of R. sulcatus. This difference in the mycobiome of R. fusoides is also reflected in its poor growth in the presence of L-DOPA. This is also reflected in the mycobiome of R. sulcatus that is composed mainly of species belonging to S. brevicaulis, R. sativus, and R. sclerotiorum (Table 2).

The geographic distance between R. sulcatus and R. fusoides (100 km) is similar to that of other species of the Dothideomycetes and Basidiomycetes, which are commonly found in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [70-72]. In addition, we found that the R. fusoides genus contains some basidiomycetous species, which are more closely related to R. sulcatus than other species of the Dothideomycetes. Although most Dothideomycetes are saprophytic yeasts, the presence of other species in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is still rare [73].
