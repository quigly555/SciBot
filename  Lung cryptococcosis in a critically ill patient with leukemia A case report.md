## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are common in immunocompromised patients and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The management of these infections is dependent on the individual and extent of the approach to the problem. The patients with immunodeficiency syndrome have a higher prevalence of fungal infections, and these infections are the most common ones reported among immunocompromised patients. The diagnostic work-up of these patients should take into account the specific pathogen, the particular requirements of the particular patients and the particular requirements of particular antifungal agents. This paper reviews the main aspects of antifungal drug administration in the management of patients with fungal infections.


## Introduction
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an infection caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. This organism has a worldwide distribution and is commonly found in soil, especially in tropical and subtropical areas [1]. Due to the fact that this fungus has a polysaccharide capsule, it is essential for the growth of A. parasiticus and for the survival of the species [2,3]. The ability of A. parasiticus to colonize the human skin is due to its ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes and a polysaccharide capsule [4]. Moreover, the virulence of A. parasiticus is linked to the secreted protein extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) [5]. The capsule of A. parasiticus is associated with the cell surface and has been shown to be responsible for its virulence [6].

The capsule of A. parasiticus is characterized by its high porosity, the presence of exoproteic mannoproteins, and the presence of secreted proteins such as chitinases and degradative proteins [7]. Capsule formation is tightly controlled by various factors, such as cell wall composition, membrane composition, and cell wall-associated enzymes [8]. In addition, the composition and function of the fungal cell wall have been studied [9]. The composition of the cell wall is affected by various environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, and osmotic stress [10]. Therefore, the capsule of A. parasiticus is not only a physical barrier but also a physical and chemical target of antifungal drugs and the development of drug resistance [11]. The synthesis of antifungal drugs is a significant problem and new antifungal agents are urgently needed.

Due to the presence of antifungal drugs, there is an increased interest in the discovery of new antifungals, and of these, polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins are the most used in the last years. The first echinocandins were synthesized by chemical synthesis in the 1930s [12]. The polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) and the echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) were also synthesized from polymeric materials [13].


## Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Infectious Diseases Institute of the Medical College of the University of Hilde.

Exposure and Epidemiology
The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis in the patients included the following: (a) Single-dose inhalation of xerophosphate diphosphate (xerphosphate), (b) Lung lavage with xerophosphate, (c) Caspofungin, (d) Proline, (e) Polymorphon X-100, (f) Glutathione reductase inhibitor cocktail, (g) Chloramphenicol, and (h) Glutathione S-Transferase inhibitor cocktail. The exposure and epidemiology of the oral fluconazole was not included in this study.

The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis was followed for 48 hours by assessment of fever and clinical signs, as well as the possibility of bronchial, respiratory, or ocular signs. The exposure and epidemiology of the bronchial, respiratory, and ocular signs were followed for 48 hours and were classified as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and non-bronchial signs (NBS) in the same patient, respectively. The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis was followed for 6 weeks after the initial bronchoscopy. The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis was followed for 7 days after the initial bronchoscopy. The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis was followed for 6 months after the initial bronchoscopy. The exposure and epidemiology of cryptococcal meningitis was followed for 6 months after the initial bronchoscopy.

Infection and Infection Assays
The colonization of C. albicans was examined by use of a disk diffusion assay (DSM-9A, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008) as previously described (Sambrook et al., 2015). Briefly, C. albicans was grown overnight in YPD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30Â°C and diluted to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm. C.


## Results
He was diagnosed with severe acute pulmonary disease, and his lungs were norma. After he underwent antiretroviral therapy, he was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute lymphadenitis. The lung was healthy, and he was seen to have normal inflammatory and neovascular tissue responses. He was receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy for neutropenia and liposomal amphotericin B for neutropenia. After he was discharged from the ICU, he was diagnosed with other cryptococcal meningitis (Table 2). The patient was a 41-year-old male with a history of high-grade fever. He was receiving a combination of aminoglycoside (Amg) and fluconazole (Flu) for the treatment of fever and cryptococcal meningitis. He was in the ICU for 1 month and died on admission.

The patient was a 47-year-old male with a history of meningitis. He was admitted to the ICU on a prednisone (Pride), which is known to cause meningitis [41]. He was seen by a physician to have a fever with a weight loss of 10 kg, and he had a cough of 33.5% at the time of death. The patient was receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy (Amg), which is known to cause meningitis [42]. He had a history of meningitis (not included in Table 2), and he had a history of fever (50% and 50% at the time of death, respectively). He was seen by a physician to have a fever with a weight loss of 11 kg, and he had a cough of 43% at the time of death. He had a history of fever (not included in Table 2) and a history of blood clotting (not included in Table 2). He had a history of headache (not included in Table 2) and signs and symptoms of neurological deficit. He had a history of cough (not included in Table 2) and signs of neurological deficit. He had a history of headache and signs of neurological deficit. He was admitted to the ICU on a prednisone (Pride), which is known to cause meningitis [43].

The patient was a 35-year-old female with a history of meningitis.


## Discussion
Hebert, .D.
