## Abstract
Trichosporonales spp. are an important fungal species in human dermatitis. They are also used for the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus infection and as a skin penetration agent.

The aim of this study was to isolate and identify T. parva, which is the most important dermatophytes for the treatment of skin infections.

Species analysis of isolates was carried out by using ITS1, ITS2, 5.8S rRNA, and RPB2 primers. The identification of species involved in skin penetration included the use of culture-based or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Fourteen species-specific primers were applied to isolates, and two were correctly identified as T. parva by ITS1 and RPB2.

T. parva is distributed across all of the major dermatophytes and is the most common isolated species among skin infections. However, species specific primers may have difficulties in determining T. parva species.

Identification of the T. parva was carried out by macro- and micromorphological methods. The results were further confirmed by molecular analyses.

The majority of the isolated T. parva isolates were congeneric (96.4%), and 83.4% were isolated from clinical samples. All of the species-specific primers were applied to T. parva. Most of the isolates had the same substrate used in the sample processing step (processing time, mass, etc.) and the most common substrate was a-ion [MIC (mg/L) (g/L)]. The minimum effective concentration (MEC) was 0.03 mg/L for all isolates and for A. fumigatus and 0.06 mg/L for A. niger.

This study showed that the majority of T. parva isolates were congeneric and these isolates were difficult to identify. The use of specific primers can be helpful for the identification of important species of dermatophytes.


## Introduction

It is well established that certain viruses are capable of hijacking the host immune system and then leading to a pandemi. For example, influenza viruses can induce a self-limiting polyreactive immune response and thus constitute a basis for pandemic disease [36], [37]. Influenza viruses can cause severe pneumonia and meningitis. Amongst many viruses, the influenza virus can induce an inflammatory response that is involved in the development of life-threatening pneumonia, meningitis, and encephalitis [38-40]. Influenza virus can infect the central nervous system, where it causes severe meningitis, encephalitis, and death [41]. Influenza virus can also invade the skin, lung, bone, or brain causing infections such as acute encephalitis or spinal encephalitis [42], [43].

Lack of understanding of how influenza virus infects the host immune system has hampered our understanding of the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection. Most influenza viruses are common in isolation phase and are initially transported into the host immune system via the circulatory system, the respiratory system and the bloodstream. These host immune cells are known to be important in the immune response to influenza virus infection.

In the present study, we used the nucR gene of influenza virus to identify proteins from the circulatory system that are important for influenza virus infection in the host. nucR gene is a non-coding transcription factor and it was shown that circulatory system proteins play a role in influenza virus infection. nucR gene is expressed in both mouse and human lung and is expressed at a low level. These findings led us to investigate the potential role of circulatory system proteins in influenza virus infection in the host.

In the present study, we identified and characterized the circulatory system proteins nucR family (nucR family) and nucR gene. nucR family is expressed in both mouse and human lung and has a high expression in both hemocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). nucR family is expressed in human lungs, in both bone marrow and neuronal cells. nucR family is expressed in both lung and spleen and has a high expression in bone marrow and DCs. NucR family protein is one of the proteins that can be targeted for virus biogenesis in vitro. In this study, we demonstrated that nucR gene is involved in viral infection in lung, in bone marrow and in DCs.


## Methods
Briefly, BALF and spleen cells were collected from male BALF donors (Charles River, Birmingham, UK) and fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, S. Louis, USA) and were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being embedded in paraffin. The resulting agar blocks were cut and mounted on microscope slides. In the case of infections with P. brasiliensis, 2-3 × 10^6 CFU/mL of monocyte-derived, monocyte-macrophage-like cells were used. The isolated P. brasiliensis cells were incubated with H. capsulatum in serum-free DMEM medium (HyClone, Logan, USA) for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. After incubation, the cell monolayers were washed and added to medium for another 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The number of CFU was counted using a hemocytometer and the control experiments were performed in the absence of P. brasiliensis cells.

In the case of P. brasiliensis infections with P. brasiliensis-infected, non-infected spleens of mice, 1 × 10^6 P. brasiliensis cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM medium for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. After incubation, the cells were washed and added to medium for another 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. After the incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended in medium. The number of CFU was counted using a hemocytometer. The control experiments were performed in the absence of P. brasiliensis cells.

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University College London (UCLU-Protocol No. 2017/1424), and the samples were collected in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The experimental protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of UCLU and the University of the UK.

Mice
Male C57BL/6J mice, 6-8 weeks old, weighing between 50 to 60 g, were obtained from the University of the UK Research Laboratory Animal Facility and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of the UK Animal Facility.


## Results
brasiliensis infected with 10,000 U/mL recombinant HIV infectio. After 24 h of infection, the median number of cells in the kidneys of infected mice was 10^6 (Fig 4A). We next examined the virulence of EVV-infected mice. The median survival time of EVV-infected mice was 4.6 days (Fig 4B). Interestingly, significantly more (P < 0.05) EVV-infected mice survived to death after 24 h of infection compared to wild-type mice (Fig 4C). We further examined the possible role of EVV infection in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. A total of 546 (66.6%) EVV-infected and 183 (36.7%) EVV-free mice were included in the analysis. The median survival time of EVV-infected mice was 4.4 days (Fig 4D). The median survival time of EVV-free mice was 5.4 days (P < 0.05). However, we observed a significant difference in virulence between EVV-infected and wild-type mice. A total of 636 (73.3%) EVV-infected and 177 (41.5%) EVV-free mice were included in the analysis. The median survival time of EVV-free mice was 4.1 days (P < 0.05). In contrast, the median survival time of wild-type mice was 4.4 days (P < 0.05) (Fig 4E). Furthermore, a significant difference was found in the virulence of EVV-infected versus wild-type mice (P < 0.05; Fig 4F). The median survival time of EVV-infected versus wild-type mice was 3.9 days (P < 0.05) (Fig 4G). The comparison of the results of the viral burden and the EVV-free mouse model revealed that EVV infection resulted in a significantly higher (P < 0.05) EVV-free relative burden in the mouse models compared to the control group.

We next examined the possible role of EVV infection in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. The median survival time of EVV-infected versus wild-type mice was 3.


## Discussion
brasiliensis were able to modulate host cell interactions by creating autophagic vacuoles that allowed yeast-like cells to access host nutrients for proliferatio. Autophagy is a key process for cell proliferation that is crucial for the cellular survival and proliferation of many pathogenic microorganisms [1]. Cells infected with N. brasiliensis secrete autophagy proteins (such as PKS, PKS2, and PKS3) to access host nutrients for proliferation [1]. These proteins, which are involved in vacuolar autophagy, are then phagocytosed by the host cells, and this process occurs in vitro [1]. We show that N. brasiliensis secretes proteins to mediate autophagy during infection. As expected, N. brasiliensis autophagosomes released only during phagocytosis and during the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Autophagosome-lysosomes are produced by a variety of cell types, including non-germinated, glycolytic, and non-acytoplasmic cellular structures [1].

N. brasiliensis is a heterothallic yeast species with the ability to produce pseudohyphae and microglial cells, which are produced by a variety of cell types and are also produced by fungal pathogens [1]. Although N. brasiliensis has been reported to produce the autophagy pathway [1], its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Autophagy is involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and the regulation of cell cycle progression in N. brasiliensis. In addition, N. brasiliensis is able to produce a large number of vacuolar autophagosomes, which are produced by N. brasiliensis-like cells [1].

In this study, we used the N. brasiliensis-NPS1 pathway to investigate the autophagy gene transcriptional response in N. brasiliensis. Autophagy is a cellular process that is regulated by a variety of cell types and has been reported to be important for the maintenance of cell wall integrity and cell differentiation in many organisms [1]. The NPS1 pathway is one of the most ancient genes in the genome and has been extensively studied in fungi, plants, and mammals [1].
