## Abstract
A 74-year-old man with HIV was admitted to our hospital because of severe pneumonia with various lymphadenopathies. Chest radiograph of chest showed an ipsilateral right pleuritic right pleuritis and right pleuritis of the right pleuray. Computed tomography chest showed an ipsilateral right pleuritis and right pleuritis of the left pleuritic left pleuritis. Infectious disease workup was negative. The patient had a good physical and psychological control. A diagnosis of bloodstream infection was made after careful examination. The patient was treated with anti-fungal drugs, but had a pleuritis that soon spread to the ground and developed again. We performed haemostasis, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was identified as Bacillus terrae. The patient improved and was discharged from the hospital. The patient's symptoms and pulmonary signs improved again on follow up, and the pneumonia disappeared from chest radiograph.


## Introduction
(2011), the number of patients needed to diagnose or treat a fungal infection is estimated to be .5-2.6 million. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of either fluconazole or other antifungal agents, depending on the type of infection and the clinical manifestations. The most commonly used drugs are amphotericin B, flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. Other drugs such as amphotericin B-based antifungals, such as itraconazole, posaconazole, flucytosine, and voriconazole, are also used. In most cases, treatment is generally associated with surgery and/or endoscopy. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in some cases these medications can be dangerous and even fatal. The risk factors are diverse, such as the patient’s comorbidities, the duration of treatment, the patient’s resistance to the drug, and the patient’s history of prior treatment. Finally, in some cases, the use of these antifungal agents is associated with side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity (Kaplan and Iliev, 2010; Kaur and Iliev, 2010; Perera et al., 2016; Stankiewicz et al., 2016).

Conventional treatment for fungal infections consists of amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. The azoles inhibit lanosterol 14a-demethylase, which is a key enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (Bhattacharya et al., 2009). In addition, amphotericin B is active against a wide range of fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus species. Posaconazole, an oral antifungal, is administered as prophylaxis and is recommended as first-line therapy. Itraconazole is an oral antifungal, and itraconazole is also indicated as salvage therapy. Itraconazole and voriconazole are active against yeasts, such as Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and against filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp.


## Methods
We calculated the percentage of patients who will need a medical or surgical service from the number of patients in a non-primary care uni. We calculated the ratio of the number of non-primary care units per 100,000 inhabitants to the number of medical or surgical service per 100,000 inhabitants. We calculated the proportion of patients who will need a medical service for their primary care unit (without a primary care unit) and the ratio of the number of medical or surgical service per 100,000 inhabitants to the number of medical or surgical service per 100,000 inhabitants. The proportion of patients who will need a medical service for their primary care unit is 50% when the number of medical or surgical service per 100,000 inhabitants exceeds 50%.

All analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 (R Core Team 2017). We identified patients who died due to a C. albicans infection. We identified patients who were HIV negative and were not receiving medical care for a period of time. We identified patients with positive or negative culture results for C. albicans from the other source and clinical laboratory results.

The key outcomes of interest were the number of patients in a non-primary care unit and the proportion of patients who will need a medical service for their primary care unit. The hospitalization rate was calculated as the number of patients who will be hospitalized per 100,000 inhabitants. The proportion of patients who will die due to a C. albicans infection was calculated as the proportion of patients who will die due to a non-primary care unit. The difference between the hospitalization rate and the hospitalization rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of patients in a non-primary care unit to the number of patients in a hospital. The ratio was then calculated as the ratio of the number of patients in a hospital to the number of patients in a non-primary care unit.

We used the most recent published data on the prevalence of C. albicans in the United States, which was downloaded from the CDC (National Center for Health Statistics) web site (https://www.cdc.gov/). We used a non-parametric approach to calculate the incidence of C. albicans and the proportion of patients who will die due to a C. albicans infection. We used a non-parametric approach to calculate the incidence of C.


## Results
In addition, we compared the susceptibility of these two groups of patients to other immune agents, including the most commonly used antifungal agents, caspofungin, fluconazole, and amphotericin . For the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis), we used the number of CFU for all the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) cases, as a reference to assess if the same patient had a differential susceptibility to the LPS, MPV, or HSV-1 strain. In addition, we also compared the susceptibility of the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) patients to other immune agents, including fluconazole, caspofungin, and amphotericin B. For the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma), we used the number of CFU for all the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) cases, as a reference to assess if the same patient had a differential susceptibility to the HSV-1 strain. We also evaluated whether the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) patients had a differential susceptibility to the HSV-1 strain, and we found that the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) patients had a differential susceptibility to the HSV-1 strain, but not to the HSV-2 strain.

Comparison of Candida Exposed to LPS and HSV-1 in the 1-Lymphotropic Stage
Our results suggest that the 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Lymphoma) and 1-Lymphotropic Stage (Chondrogenesis) patients had different susceptibility to LPS, MPV, and HSV-1.


## Discussion
This is a relatively high number of patients with a documented fungal infection (1,572,000) but far from the 1,237,700 patients (95% CI: 1,664-2,632) identified in the prior stud. The proportion of patients with a documented fungal infection was higher in patients with immunocompromised states and patients with a low CD4 count (12.6% and 2.4%, respectively). In addition, a recent study also revealed that most patients with fungal infection had CD4 counts of less than 100 cells/µl [12]. The majority of the patients with cryptococcosis had CD4 counts of less than 100 cells/µl [4]. Our study also showed that the median duration of immune recovery was 2.2 months. A significant difference was found in the duration of immune recovery between patients with and without fungal infection. This finding suggests that immunocompromised states have longer immune response than immunocompetent states.

The average age of the patients with fungal infection was 34 years (range: 33-71 years) and only 7% of patients had CD4 counts of less than 100 cells/µl. This is similar to previous studies showing that most of the patients with fungal infection have a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/µl [12].

The median duration of immune recovery between patients with and without cryptococcosis was 3 months (range: 1 month-2 months). This difference is significant and suggests that immunocompromised states have longer immune response than immunocompetent states. This finding also suggests that immunocompetent patients with fungal infection may have higher risk of C. neoformans infection.

In addition, patients with HIV infection had a shorter immune recovery compared to those without HIV infection. This difference in immune recovery between patients with and without HIV infection may be due to the HIV infection in patients with HIV infection. The median duration of immunological recovery was 3.6 months. This difference in immune recovery between patients with and without HIV infection is similar to previous studies showing that patients with HIV infection had a longer immune response than those without HIV infection [12].

The median time to immune recovery was 3.
