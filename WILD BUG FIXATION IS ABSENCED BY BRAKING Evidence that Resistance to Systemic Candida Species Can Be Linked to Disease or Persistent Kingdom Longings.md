## Introduction
tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major cause of meningitis and pneumonia and is globally distribute. In contrast to tuberculosis, where the vast majority of deaths result from the disease, TB remains a serious public health problem in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, WHO estimated that there were more than 1.5 million new TB cases and 600,000 deaths in 2013, with 10 million deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa alone [1]. The estimated global burden of TB associated with health systems is estimated at 1.6 million people, and this number is expected to increase significantly in future due to TB treatment programs and the expansion of TB awareness.

The TB treatment paradigm has been shaped by evidence from the literature. In the 1940s, British neurologist Sir Robert Hopkins pioneered the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the pathogenic mechanisms of neurological disorders and the spectrum of suspected disease. In the 1950s, the gold standard diagnostic approach was MRI, which showed the spectrum to be the gold standard in the setting of a variety of clinical disorders, including TB, which remained essentially the same over the following decades. MRI guided the development of the first brain MRI system, the London School of Chest Hospital (HCHH), which allowed for the rapid identification of a variety of neurological disorders. It also provided the gold standard of diagnosis, with the finding that a variety of signs and symptoms that occur in a wide variety of patients were seen at the gold standard of 17-hour rule. Although MRI has now been used successfully to identify neurological disease processes, the gold standard for diagnosis still requires the presence of a magnetic resonance emission diodes (MERS) in the brain. In contrast, MRI can detect signs and symptoms that occur with the absence of a magnetic resonance emission diodes (MRI) and provide a gold standard for diagnosis. MRI has been used successfully to identify neurological disease processes over the past decades. In the 1970s, MRI was also used successfully to identify TB disease processes, with the finding that TB disease progression could be identified using a single-hemistatic scan [2]. Since then, it has been used successfully to identify neurological disease processes over the past 20 years using MRI, and its use has continued to this day [3,4]. However, despite its utility, MRI still remains a relatively expensive and technically challenging method to identify brain processes.


## Methods
in India was estimated to be over 10% [15. The prevalence of resistant Candida spp. in India was estimated to be over 20% [16]. The prevalence of resistant Candida spp. in Japan was estimated to be over 10% [17]. The prevalence of resistance to the antifungal drugs, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin in India is estimated to be around 15% [18]. The prevalence of resistance to the antifungal drugs is estimated to be around 50% [19]. The prevalence of resistance to the antifungal drugs is estimated to be over 50% [20]. The prevalence of resistance to the antifungal drugs is estimated to be over 80% [21]. The prevalence of resistance to the antifungal drugs is estimated to be over 80% [22].

Prediction of the Pathogen Population and Growth Curve
A methodical approach was used to predict the pathogen population and growth curve of Candida spp. on the basis of previously established global data [23]. The selection of the pathogen species was based on the availability of complete genome data of Candida spp. from previous studies [24,25]. For the analysis, the Fungal Fungal Surveillance Project (FFP) was used as the reference organism. The FFP targets Candida spp. in India as an eligible reference organism and their identification was confirmed by the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (NIAID), which is the Federal Agency for Health and Welfare (FHTM). The FFP is an international collaboration between Fungal Fungal Surveillance and Surveillance (FUSP) and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and public health institutions, in which a standard methodology is applied to the validation of a particular species based on relevant local and national data [24,25,26].

In the study, Candida spp. were identified from a previous study [27].


## Results
A total of 27,771 patients with FAS and an unknown FAS patient were included in this study. The incidence of FAS was 1.1% (95% CI 1.2-1.4%). The overall mortality rate was 4.7% (95% CI 4.1-5.1%). All patients with FAS had a recent history of drug abuse and were usually treated with amoxicides of Amphotericin B (4, 5).

The most common FAS-related adverse events were dyspnea (42%), vomiting (10%), and hypoxemia (8). Other common adverse events included a mixed seizure (11%), a severe respiratory failure (10%), and a general illness (5%). Most patients had a history of heart failure (17%), hemiparesis (10%), or by aspiration (5%). The most common adverse events were diabetes mellitus (5%) and recurrent seizures (4%).


## Discussion
albicans to CFW in humans is significantly greater than that of . glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei, and that the resistance of these species to CFW is significantly greater than that of C. krusei, which are more susceptible to CFW and resistant to CFW-2 [27]. We found that resistance to CFW in C. krusei was significantly greater than that in C. albicans and C. tropicalis, and that resistance to CFW in C. krusei was significantly greater than that in C. glabrata. We also found that resistance to CFW in C. albicans was significantly greater than that in C. tropicalis, and that the resistance of C. krusei to CFW was significantly greater than that in C. glabrata. Furthermore, we found that resistance to CFW in C. glabrata was significantly greater than that in C. krusei, and that the resistance to CFW in C. albicans was significantly greater than that in C. krusei. This suggests that resistance to CFW in C. krusei and C. tropicalis is significantly greater than resistance to CFW in C. albicans and C. glabrata. This is the first report that in vivo resistance to CFW is greater than resistance to CFW in C. krusei and C. albicans.

Our findings that C. albicans and C. krusei are significantly more resistant to CFW than C. tropicalis and C. krusei are in agreement with a previous report by Hernández-Restrepo et al. [27]. Our findings that C. krusei is more resistant to CFW than C. albicans is in agreement with another study by Habajkova et al. [27]. Our findings that C. albicans and C. krusei are significantly more resistant to CFW than C. tropicalis and C. krusei are in agreement with a previous study by Habajkova et al. [27]. This study also found that C. krusei was more susceptible to CFW than C. albicans. Our results are in agreement with other studies by Hernández-Restrepo et al. [27]. Our findings that C.
