# Regulation of Nitrogen Metabolism by NRT-As: Present and Future Approaches
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract

Nitrogen metabolism is a crucial process in eukaryotes, which is regulated by a number of transcription factors, including the SreA and Phe-related proteins Nnt-GlnRH. To dissect the regulatory mechanism of NRT-As, we investigated the role of the MgDysA gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator, on the phenotypes of NRT-As and NGF-rps, two membrane-enriched proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism. Deletion of the MgDysA gene (<U+0394>MgDysA) did not affect the virulence of Candida albicans or Candida glabrata in vitro, but did affect the ability of C. albicans and Candida glabrata to grow in RPMI-1640 agar plates at 70-80 °C. In comparison with NGF-rps, deletion of the MgDysA gene (<U+0394>MgRps) did not affect growth and conidial production of C. albicans. We also verified the role of MgDysA by transfecting C. albicans <U+0394>MgDysA cells with MgRps homologs from two other fungi, the model Aspergillus nidulans and the nematode Coccidium species. We found that the MgRps homolog family does not contain a functional C. albicans MgRps-like protein (MgRps-like), and that the two other fungal species, Fusarium species and Rhodotorula species, have a distinct deletion pattern. Taken together, our results indicate that MgRps-like proteins are not required for viability or growth, and that loss of the MgDysA gene impairs the ability of C. albicans and Candida glabrata to grow in RPMI-1640 agar plates.

IMPORTANCE The immunological and histopathological changes observed in patients with histoplasmosis are usually diagnostic, but the diagnostic criteria vary widely. The diagnostic factors for histoplasmosis, such as clinical manifestations, radiographic characteristics, and the genetic etiology of histoplasmosis, are usually laborious.


## Introduction
 2009. In the early stages of cancer development, the cytotoxic activity of NRT-As was generally assumed to be stable, as these compounds may interact with the same metal ions that affect the process of neutrophil division (Kirikama et al., 2006). However, the relative stability of NRT-As in their interaction with tumor cells is not always well known, and some authors reported that NRT-As interact with different metals and that NRT-As are thus able to cause toxicity and toxicity-related changes in cell physiology (Al-Anrami and Al-Yousef, 2009). For example, the toxic effects of NRT-As on nitric oxide (NO) produced by tumor cells in the presence of these metal ions have been shown to be enhanced (Khan et al., 2011). The interactions between NRT-As and nitric oxide are also related to the role of nitric oxide as an inhibitor of nitrosyl-CoA oxidase (NRT-I) and thus the NRT-I inhibitors such as the three-dimensional lactoferrin inhibitors (LFIs), can inhibit NO production (Al-Yousef et al., 2009). In addition, the ligand-receptor interactions and their role in the control of nitric oxide and NO production have been studied (Mayer et al., 2006; Hentsch et al., 2011). The influence of ligand-receptor interactions on the biological activities of NRT-As has been demonstrated (Pfaller et al., 2009). However, few studies have investigated the interactions of NRT-As with other metal ions, such as CO_2, HCO3^- and CO_2, and other ions.

In this study, NRT-As and CO_2 were tested for their activity against NO, NO_3^2 and NO_3^4, which are two of the most abundant metals in the atmosphere (Al-Yousef et al., 2009). NRT-As were found to bind to both CO_2 and HCO3^- and CO_2^- ions and to oxygen (Palkova et al., 2008).


## Methods
In this experiment, 5 µl of NRT-As and 1 µl of NRT were mixed with 1 ml of 5 mM NaC. The reaction was initiated by mixing 1 ml of NRT-As with 1 ml of 5 mM NaCl and the mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the mixture was incubated at 80 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10 mM EDTA and the mixture was diluted 1:1 with 5 mM EDTA. The reaction was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and the obtained data were normalized to the amount of NaCl.

The assay was performed in triplicate, using the same procedure described above. The reaction mixture was composed of 100 µl of NRT-As and 50 µl of NRT-As and then incubated at 37 °C. After incubation, 100 µl of NRT-As and 100 µl of NRT-As were added to each well. After incubation, the mixture was mixed with NRT-As and then the reaction was terminated by adding 100 µl of 5 mM NaCl and the mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 µl of 10 mM EDTA and the mixture was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 µl of 0.5 M NaCl and the mixture was diluted with 2% w/v deionized water. The reaction was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and the obtained data were normalized to the amount of NaCl.

## Results
The uptake of nitrate by the host was monitored by analyzing the concentration of nitrite, nitrite-containing compounds, and the level of nitrite in the hos. Nitrite and nitrite-containing compounds were synthesized in the presence of NRT. The addition of ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrite (NH_4NO_3) reduced the uptake of nitrite by the host, and the addition of ammonium sulfate did not alter the uptake of ammonium. The rate of uptake of nitrite by the host was similar to that of the control, indicating that the timing of the uptake was not affected by the ammonium sulfate concentration. The ammonia concentration was increased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05), but the ammonium concentration remained unchanged after 2.1 mM (P < 0.05). The level of nitrite was highest in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which was increased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05). In addition, the level of ammonia in the presence of ammonium sulfate was increased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05). The level of nitrite was highest in the presence of nitrite, which was decreased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05). However, the level of nitrite was elevated by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05) in the presence of nitrite. The level of ammonia in the presence of ammonium sulfate was increased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05) in the presence of ammonium sulfate. The level of nitrite was highest in the presence of nitrite, which was decreased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05) in the presence of ammonium sulfate. The level of nitrite was highest in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which was decreased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05) in the presence of ammonium sulfate. The level of ammonia in the presence of ammonium sulfate was highest in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which was decreased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.05). The level of nitrite was highest in the presence of ammonium sulfate, which was decreased by 2.1 mM (P < 0.


## Discussion
In the process of NRT-mediated nitrogen starvation, the cells use various nitrogen sources to sustain their growth and developmen. This study investigated the nitrogen sources of NRT-As in U. maydis and U. maydis-infecting plants by growing the two U. maydis strains on the same medium. The results showed that NRT-As were produced in U. maydis-infecting plants, but not in U. maydis-infecting plants. Furthermore, the two strains in this study produced nitrogen-sensing-containing NRT-As at a concentration of 1.0 g/L. As the nitrogen sources of U. maydis are higher than those of U. maydis, the consumption of nitrogenous carbon sources may be an additional source of NRT-As in U. maydis.

Nitrogen sources of U. maydis were studied by growing the two strains on the same medium (n-Pro4-Golgi and urea) for 10 days. The results showed that the concentration of nitrogenous carbon was significantly higher in urea-grown cells than in glucose-grown cells.
