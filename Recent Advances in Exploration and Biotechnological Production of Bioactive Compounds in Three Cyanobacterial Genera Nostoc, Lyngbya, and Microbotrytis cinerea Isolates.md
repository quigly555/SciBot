## Abstract
The C-terminus of the N-terminus is the most conserved region in eukaryotes. Previously, we identified two N-terminal regions in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. In this species, only the N-terminal region is homologous to the pre-mRNA-based nucleotide sequence motif (NAT) found in other fungal species, and the other is derived from multiple independent nucleotide changes occurring during evolution. Here we introduce two new N-terminal regions in C. gattii N-terminal region. We found no evidence for recombination within the nucleotide sequences of the other N-terminal regions. Instead, recombination is likely due to changes in the regulation of amino acids.


## Introduction
Fungi are key players in many ecosystems, including plants, animals, and human health, and are essential for ecosystem functioning (Yáñez-Mó et al. 2018). One of the most important functions of fungi is the production of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities, including antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, antimalarial, anticancer, and anticancer compounds (Tsuyama-Yapar and Ben-Yehuda 2017; Tedersoo et al. 2017; El Hadrami et al. 2018). The study of fungal secondary metabolites is a crucial area of research, but few studies have investigated the microbial metabolites produced by fungi, such as phytopathogenic fungi. Here, we describe the microbial metabolites produced by the filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans, which is responsible for causing a plethora of diseases ranging from superficial mycosis to life-threatening invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (Saijo et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2017). Our previous study, however, focused only on the production of phytopathogenic fungi and did not pay sufficient attention to fungal secondary metabolites (Cui et al. 2016). This paper focuses on the development of new strategies to combat fungal secondary metabolites, such as using fermentation processes and high-pressure cultivation, to improve the production of phytopathogenic fungi.

Fungal secondary metabolites have been identified by chemical analysis, and a great number of biological activities have been reported, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, and anticancer activities (El Hadrami et al. 2018). This review will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the phytopathogenic fungi, including the main phytopathogenic fungi, as well as the diversity of phytopathogenic fungi reported. Furthermore, we discuss the phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Pyroglossum, which are relatively rare and under-explored.


## Methods
Synthetic standards for the compounds (10 µg/mL in the presence of .1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5 µg/mL in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The final concentration of each compound was 0.1% w/w.

2.2. Isolation of Microbotrytis cinerea
Microbotrytis cinerea was obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Biotechnology of the University of the Basque Country, Spain. The isolate was previously characterized in detail in our previous work [22]. The culture was maintained in the dark at room temperature (22-25°C). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with sterile distilled water. The cell suspension was filtered using Miracloth (BD) and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The pellet was dissolved in 1 mL of sterile distilled water and the concentration of the dye was adjusted to 10 µg/mL. The resulting solution was applied to a Microbotrytis cinerea, which was maintained at room temperature (22-25°C) for 72 h. The residual dye was removed by passing through a 100% cotton pad, and the cells were washed three times with sterile distilled water.

2.3. Fluorescence Microscopy
The micrographs were obtained with a fluorescence microscope Olympus BX51 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired with an Olympus DP70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were performed with three biological replicates.

2.4. HPLC-MS Analysis
The samples of samples (10 µL) were extracted using a chloroform-methanol method, using a 4% (w/w) acetic acid solution, and using a methanol-methanol gradient (30:0) from a 0-50% MeCN solvent. The solvent was changed three times and the solvent volume was changed three times. The samples were dried at room temperature, and then the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The quantification of the compounds was performed by the LC/MS method. The samples were diluted with the same solvent and subjected to the reversed phase HPLC (HPLC-MS) procedure.


## Results
. Chemistry
The new compounds were synthesized from the crystalline fraction of the yeast Candida albicans. Their peak yields of 1.10 and 1.12, respectively, were almost the same, suggesting the formation of diappactin in the C18-ethylbenzofuranone fraction. The loss of the methyl ester moiety in the acetate fraction of the acyl ester of benzofuranone (1) (1), which is the second most common substitution in the crystal structure of diappactin, led to the addition of the methyl ester of benzofuranone (2). The reduction of the methyl ester moiety in the acetate fraction of benzofuranone (3) was also observed, which was followed by a reduction of the methyl ester moiety in the C18-ethylbenzofuranone fraction of 2.

The crystals of the diappactin structure were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a MALDI-TOF-MS column.


## Discussion
. and N.Y. Biochemicals, Inc.) [19].

In the present study, we used in silico MS/MS analysis to determine the chemical compositions of the four cyanobacterial genera in this study. The composition of the bioactive compounds isolated in this study was similar to that of the compounds isolated from the compounds isolated from the genus Bacillus, such as S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus [25,26]. The main difference between the microbial groups was the ratio of the compounds isolated in the same genus (A. fumigatus). The sample of S. cerevisiae was dominated by the mono-compound P. kudriavzevii, whereas the other four genera (N. crassa, B. cinerea, M. oryzae, and P. marneffei) contained mono-compound P. kudriavzevii.

In addition, the analysis of the combined MS/MS data in this study showed that the major compound of the microorganism (Bacillus) isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc, Lyngbya, was produced by the cyanobacterium Lyngbya in silico MS/MS analysis. The structure of this compound was determined by the analysis of the ^1H-NMR spectra of the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the ^1H-NMR spectrum of the NMR, and the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the FT-radiation mass spectrum. The structural information of the Lyngbya strain CBS 639.04 is similar to that of P. marneffei (Fig 5A) [25], a strain isolated from the cyanobacterium Bacillus. This strain is known for its ability to synthesize bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, flavones, saponins, saponins-like compounds, and pyranosyl derivatives [26,27].
