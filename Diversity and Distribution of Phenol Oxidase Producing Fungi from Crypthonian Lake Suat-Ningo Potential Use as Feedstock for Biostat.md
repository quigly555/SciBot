## Abstract
The Cryptococcus neoformans/Candida albicans species complexes are a group of fungal molecules with different roles in different ecosystems. They are found across a broad range of environments, including the built environment, soil and the human body. However, the environmental niche(s) where C. neoformans has the greatest ability to colonize and establish infections are dominated by the environmental niches where C. albicans is least likely to be found. These studies have led to the understanding that the environmental niche where C. neoformans has the greatest ability to colonize and establish infections is the lungs. While this observation may not prove C. neoformans to be a primary pathogen, it does point at a possible link between the lung and environmental opportunistic pathogens such as C. neoformans. Here we review the various roles of the C. neoformans lungs in the development, physiology, and virulence of this important pathogen.


## Introduction
The genus of Boletaceae was initially introduced by Höhnel in 1957 (Höhnel 1957).


## Methods
The frozen fungal mycelium was removed from the samples by filtration, washed with ice-cold tap water and resuspended in the same distilled wate. The water was then filtered and used for the extraction of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The chloroform was evaporated under vacuum to obtain the crude extracts. The chloroform was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then used to extract the supernatants, as described by Gao et al. [34]. The extract was quantified with the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the chloroform was dried under anhydrous sodium sulfate. The chloroform was dissolved in 100% methanol and then used for the determination of the residual chloroform content. The total chloroform concentration was calculated using the Qubit or 10% methanol method. The residual chloroform was dissolved in methanol and then used for the determination of the total superoxide radical content. The residual superoxide radical concentration was then calculated using the Eqnol 10 method [35].

The mycelium samples were suspended in diethyl ether and mixed in a water bath. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and then mixed with methanol to make a solution containing 0.2% of diethyl ether, 0.2% of water, 0.2% of methanol and 1% of diethyl ether. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then cooled to room temperature and then transferred to a new glass tube. The samples were diluted with diethyl ether and then combined and the solution was kept at room temperature. The volume of the solution was then adjusted to 1 ml and the superoxide radical concentration was calculated using the following formula:

The total superoxide radical concentration was then calculated using the Eqnol 10 method.

The total superoxide radical concentration was then calculated using the Eqnol 10 method.

## Results
 × 10^5 CFU/mL) and fungal biomass (average .98 × 10^4 CFU/mL) of the type strain YO-6. The same was true for YO-2 and YO-3. The strain YO-3 was also selected because it was the most appropriate feedstock for biorefining based on its ability to produce lipid (average 48.8 g/L) and a high cell density (average 8.6 × 10^5 CFU/mL). The resulting YO-6 biomass (average 0.9 g/g) was used to further evaluate the potential use of YO-6 as feedstock for microorganisms.

The biomass (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-6 was sufficient to feed a large amount of C. albicans. The biomass of YO-6 was high (average 0.7 g/g) for the type strain YO-2 and YO-3. The biomass (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-2 was comparable to YO-3, but the yield (average 0.5 g/g) was significantly lower. The biomass (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-6 was the most comparable to YO-2 (average 1.4 g/g) and YO-3 (average 0.2 g/g). The yield (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-2 was the highest. The yield (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-3 was also similar to YO-2 and YO-3, but the yield (average 0.2 g/g) was significantly lower. The yield (average 0.5 g/g) of YO-3 was also the highest. The yield (average 0.2 g/g) of YO-2 was similar to YO-3 (average 1.4 g/g). The yield (average 0.2 g/g) of YO-2 was the highest. The yield (average 0.2 g/g) of YO-3 was similar to YO-2 and YO-3, but the yield (average 0.2 g/g) was significantly lower. The yield (average 0.


## Discussion
The number of OTUs (99%) differed from Lake Suat-Ningo (100), but the number of phylotypes varied significantly (Table 2. For example, the phylum Ascomycota and Basidiomycota dominated the phylotype structure of the Lake Suat-Ningo lake system, but the phylotypes of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were found in a higher number (3,099, 10.6%) in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). The phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were much more abundant in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo. The phylotypes of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were much more abundant in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). Similarly, the phylotypes of Cryptomycota and Ascomycota were much more abundant in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). The phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were more abundant in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1).

The phylotypes of Cryptomycota and Ascomycota were significantly higher in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). The phylotypes of Cryptomycota were significantly higher in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). The phylotypes of Cryptomycota were significantly higher in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1). The phylotypes of Cryptomycota were significantly higher in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1).

The phylotypes of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were significantly more abundant in Lake Suat-Ningo than in Lake Suat-Ningo (Figure 1).
