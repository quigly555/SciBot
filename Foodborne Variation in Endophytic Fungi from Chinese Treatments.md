## Abstract
The emerging pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Several virulence factors of this fungus have been identified; among these are its polysaccharide capsule, melanin and polysaccharide adhesin. The structure and biological functions of its polysaccharides have been related to several virulence attributes, including pathogenicity and virulence-factor production. In this study, we used genome-wide in silico analysis to identify genes and pathways involved in these biosynthetic processes. Approximately half of these genes were classified into candidate polysaccharide transporters and unknown polysaccharide transporter families, based on multi-locus phylogeny. Homologous gene expression in the A. fumigatus polysaccharide capsule and the composition of the secretory protein family, including the polysaccharide transporters, were compared to the structure and biological functions of the A. fumigatus capsular polysaccharide. Further, A. fumigatus polysaccharide transporters were selected and their biological functions were analyzed. Our results showed that a subset of the identified genes were orthologous to other fungal polysaccharide transporters, and their biological functions were related to the polysaccharide properties of the polysaccharide. These results suggest that A. fumigatus secreted and/or synthesized polysaccharides with polysaccharide structures that were similar to those found in the host. In addition, the polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery in A. fumigatus was associated to pathogenicity, indicating that the polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery in A. fumigatus is similar to the A. prowazekii secreted and/or synthesized polysaccharides in other fungi. Furthermore, we also identified polysaccharide transporters that may be involved in fungal virulence. Finally, A. fumigatus could be used as a tool for the discovery of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes in other fungi. These results offer a significant advance in our understanding of polysaccharide biosynthesis in A. fumigatus.


## Introduction
Melanins are a group of natural pigments with diverse chemical structures and known biological activities. They are found everywhere, including in the human skin, gut, and mucous membrane of the mouth and in the sweat glands and mucous membrane in sweat glands. They are also found in the human and animal skin and nails, mucous membranes, saliva, and tissues, in the respiratory tract, skin folds, and in the respiratory secretions and in the respiratory secretions of the central nervous system (1-3). Melanin is a polymer of N- and O-linked fatty acids and is widespread in plants, animals, and plants. The biological activities of melanins are mainly due to their capacity to form insoluble hydroxyl groups on the polymer and to form insoluble macromolecules in the extracellular space. These macromolecules are of high molecular mass, requiring a strong adhesion to other macromolecules, to be absorbed, and to be excreted in the extracellular space. In addition, melanin is usually active in the extracellular space and can be transported from one cell to another by diffusion (2). The transport of melanin is of great importance, as the melanin present in the cell has enormous biotechnological potential and its use is growing faster than that of other molecules (4, 5).

Melanin has two modes of synthesis. The first one is glycosylation, which involves the synthesis of monosaccharides, such as polymers, or esters, such as laccases, and acyl-CoA, which occurs at the level of glycosidic linkages, and is responsible for the formation of the polysaccharides that are used as coatings for the solubilization of the organic molecule. The second mode of synthesis is lignification, in which the synthesis of the polymer is carried out in a process that involves the synthesis of a heterogeneous mixture of polymers.


## Methods
The animals were housed in a sterile and controlled environment, and only male and female insects were kep. The insects were provided with food and water ad libitum. The animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Anhui Medical University, and the experiments were conducted according to the procedures recommended by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2009).

Preliminary checkerboard assay (PBS) experiments were used to determine the influence of the tested organisms on the pathogenicity of the spore suspension. The PDB method was used to identify the environmental factors that influenced the pathogenicity of the spore suspension by the influence of pH, temperature, and humidity.

The PDB method was also used to evaluate the effect of the tested fungi on the endophytic fungal growth, which is the most commonly used method for endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytosis [24]. The endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytic endophytosis was defined as a spore suspension containing a spore in the final PDB concentration of 1% in PBS.

## Results
In addition, we propose that the Chinese medicinal plants represent a powerful source of antioxidants, pharmacological agents, and medicinal propertie.

The analysis of the global plant communities from the Chinese medicinal plants revealed that most of the phytochemical and chemical composition of the Chinese medicinal plants is shown in Table 1. The major phytochemical constituents identified were listed in Table 1 and are presented in Table 2. The phytochemical compositions of the Chinese medicinal plants are presented in Table 2. The chemical composition of the Chinese medicinal plants was found to be well separated from the other plant constituents. The main phytochemical constituents identified in Chinese medicinal plants were flavonoids, terpenoids, and terpenoids, which have been reported to be the main constituent in Chinese medicinal plants [24], [27]. However, flavonols and flavonoid-like compounds, which are present in Chinese medicinal plants, are not found in Chinese medicinal plants, which are mainly associated with the plant-based foodstuffs and medicinal plants. Moreover, flavonoids have been reported to be the major constituents of Chinese medicinal plants [22], [23].

The results of the chemical composition of Chinese medicinal plants are shown in Table 3. The most dominant compounds in Chinese medicinal plants were the flavonoids (53.2%), terpenoids (14.8%), and flavonoids (7.8%). The chemical composition of the Chinese medicinal plants is shown in Table 3. Flavonoids were found to be the main constituent in Chinese medicinal plants. These compounds are also found in Chinese medicinal plants and are mainly associated with the plant-based foods [25], [26]. Moreover, flavonoids have been reported to be the major constituents of Chinese medicinal plants [22], [27].

In addition, flavonoids are the main constituent of Chinese medicinal plants. They are also reported to be the major constituents of Chinese medicinal plants [23], [24]. In addition, flavonoids have been reported to be the major constituents of Chinese medicinal plants [22], [27].

According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of tuberculosis in China is estimated at .7% and 1.8% among HIV-infected patients [8]. It is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients, and patients with severe disease are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis [9]. Among HIV-positive patients, HIV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and other countries [10]. In China, the incidence of tuberculosis has been increasing in recent years, and the incidence of tuberculosis in Chinese people is estimated at 6.7% [11]. The incidence of tuberculosis in China is also rising, with the goal of eliminating the disease [12]. According to the latest WHO estimate of the global burden of tuberculosis, the annual incidence of tuberculosis is estimated at 7.4 million [13]. The global burden of tuberculosis is estimated at US$ 6.6 billion [14]. The estimated global burden of tuberculosis is estimated to be US$ 19.5 billion [15]. The global burden of tuberculosis is estimated to be US$ 5.6 billion [16].

In this study, the prevalence of tuberculosis in Chinese people is estimated to be 7.7% and 1.8% among HIV-positive patients, and the incidence of tuberculosis in Chinese people is estimated to be 2.6% [17].
