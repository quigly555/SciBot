## Abstract
In order to protect the host from microbial infection, a number of important fungi have evolved mechanisms to regulate the expression of virulence factors. These include the ability of pathogenic fungi to mitigate host immunity or display evasion of it. This review will focus on the interplay between fungal virulence factors and innate and adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms of virulence of the main causative fungi, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans, will be discussed.


## Introduction
Vaccines are now a part of daily life in developing countries. In developed countries, their introduction has been modest; India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are the only countries where the prevalence of meningitis has decreased over the past few decades (Rajakumar et al., 2004; Surjewola et al., 2006; Hamad et al., 2010; Surjewola and Vishwakarma, 2012). While immunosuppressive medications have been the cornerstone of this era of immunotherapy, vaccines have been largely ineffective against these entities. The lack of vaccines has led to an increase in severe fungal infections and the resurgence of fungal infections after the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications in the past few decades (Rajakumar et al., 2004; Hamad et al., 2010; Surjewola et al., 2006; Hamad et al., 2010). These infections have been associated with a rising incidence of multi-drug resistant strains of fungi (Rajakumar et al., 2004; Hamad et al., 2010). These infections have been associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs and are associated with the deterioration of the clinical outcomes of patients with these infections (Rajakumar et al., 2004; Hamad et al., 2010). In the absence of effective vaccines, fungal infections are often difficult to treat. Additionally, many of these infections are still endemic in many developing countries (Rajakumar et al., 2004; Hamad et al., 2010). Thus, these infections are particularly challenging to be treat.

Numerous factors have influenced the selection and treatment of fungal infections. The initial development of drug resistance was influenced by the use of immunosuppressive drugs and the use of synthetic compounds, which are susceptible to toxicities and are difficult to control. The most common synthetic compounds are amphotericin B, itraconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole (Santi et al., 2015).


## Methods
Field sampling
Field sampling of the wild rice grassland in the Panchkula region (a region of Maharashtra and Maharashtra being the most important agricultural region of Maharashtra and Maharashtra-based states) was conducted during the rainy season. The grassland was located in Panchkula district, Maharashtra, India. It covers a stretch of 6 km from the village of Kodam, near the village of Anantnagar, and is managed by the Government of Maharashtra Agriculture Development Committee. The grasslands were collected at four different stages (Phase 1, 1.5, 2.5 and 2.5 m) of May-October, 2017. The fresh grassland was collected from May to October in the two weeks of June and July. The grasslands were collected after that in the two weeks of August. All grassland samples were collected with the permission of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India and their area was classified as D3 area according to the criteria of the Indian Forest Research Institute.


## Results
There are no commercially available ethnochemical reports on the ethnochemical composition of herbal plant. The ethnochemical composition of traditional herbal medicine is very complex, and it is difficult to establish a well-developed ethnochemical composition. Our research found that herbal herbal tea practitioners cultivate plants that have the highest antifungal activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis, among others. This may be due to their higher tolerance to the antifungal drug posaconazole, and also their adherence to traditional medicine, especially to medicinal plants (Figure 1). Our results indicate that herbal tea practitioners cultivate plants that are not only nutritionally superior but also have high antifungal activity against the fungus C. albicans. Our findings suggest that herbal tea practitioners cultivate plants with high antifungal activity against the fungus C. albicans.

To evaluate the potential of herbal tea practitioners to increase the effectiveness of herbal tea against C. albicans, we tested the antifungal activity of herbal tea against a panel of five Candida species, including C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. parisensis, and C. krusei. The antifungal activity of herbal tea against these species was dose-dependent. The results indicated that herbal tea practitioners cultivated plants with high antifungal activity, and thus, herbal tea practitioners cultivated plants with moderate antifungal activity.


## Discussion
The present study confirmed that all members of the genus Entyloma clustered with and clustered with Cryptococcus spp. In addition, Cryptococcus spp. clustered with other Cryptococcus species, which is in line with the results from previous studies on Cryptococcus species [1], [4], [8], [10], [12].

The phylogenetic analyses of the available genomes of Cryptococcus spp. identified eight different members of the genus. The most common type species in the Cryptococcus genus is C. gattii, which was identified in a study of the genomes of C. neoformans [12]. This species was also recovered in a study of the genomes of C. albicans and C. tropicalis [13]. In addition, the Cryptococcus species in the genera Agaricus and Aureobasidium were also identified, which is in line with results from previous studies [13], [14], [15].

There were several species of Entyloma clustered in the other genera in the phylogenetic analysis, which is in line with the results from previous studies [12], [14], [16]. The Cryptococcus spp. genus is characterized by a broad array of morphological characteristics, such as the presence of conidiophores and conidia, which are characteristic for the Cryptococcus species [12]. Other taxa included also the genera Penicillium, Pneumocystis, and Pectinium.
