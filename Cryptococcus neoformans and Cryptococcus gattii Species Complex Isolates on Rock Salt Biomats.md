## Abstract
We report the first case of tuberculosis in a child living with HIV in Cuba. A 52-year-old woman with HIV presented with symptoms of new-onset fever, headache, and neck stiffness for 3 months. Her blood examination revealed a leukocytosis-like lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed a mild nodule in the posterior horns and at the base of the ears. A combination of microbiological, molecular, and histopathological examinations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a complete blood count led to tuberculous meningitis. This is the first case of tuberculosis in a child living with HIV in Cuba. Treatment included induction of antiretroviral therapy with 400 mg intravenous ceftriaxone, complete blood count, and steroids. Although the treatment was well-tolerated, residual tuberculous meningitis following antifungal treatment was extremely difficult to eradicate.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection of the central nervous system, which is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) and C. gattii. This pathogen is a ubiquitous environmental fungus and can be found in soil, plant litter, and bird droppings [1]. The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system, lungs, and central nervous system, especially in immunocompromised patients and those with haematological malignancies [2].

C. neoformans is a basidiomycetous yeast that is found ubiquitously in the environment. It can be isolated from pigeon droppings, decaying wood, and pigeon guano, although no published reports exist on the occurrence of C. neoformans in the environment [3]. The environmental route of infection is found in birds, soil, and pigeon droppings, although there are no reports of pigeon nests infected by C. neoformans [4, 5].

The most common targets of C. neoformans infections are the respiratory and skin sites. The respiratory and skin sites are the most common sites of infection. The skin infection sites are the most common target, and the skin infection sites are very rare. In the case of a positive skin test, cryptococcal meningitis is usually reported as the initial manifestation.


## Methods
mellonella (AB, BD, BAB, BDL, BIF, and BIF), . albicans (AN, AGG, AG, AGG-1, AGG-3, AGG-5, AGG-7, AGG-8, AGG-10, AGG-14, and AGG-15), S. pneumoniae (CH, CN, CN-1, CN-2, and CN-3), and S. suis (BR, BZ, BZ-1, BZ-2, and BZ-3), respectively). The four bacterial species present in the fungal community on the other samples were S. pneumoniae, S. suis, S. kluyveri, and S. kluyveri-N. fowleri. The bacterial species present on the fungal samples were S. pombe, S. japonica, S. dermatitidis, and S. maltophilia. The fungal species present in the fungal community on the other samples were S. citri-floccosa, S. albicans, S. luteus, S. luteus-uncinocarp, S. oxysporum, S. pyrenoviridis, and S. lycopersici. The fungal species present in the fungal community on the other samples were Candida albicans, C. albicans-broad, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. The fungal species present in the fungal community on the other samples were C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis-uncinocarp, C. parapsilosis-pyrenoviridis, C. parapsilosis-tanneroviridis, and C. parapsilosis-tanneroviridis.

2.3. Sequence Analysis of the R. vinifera LMS Microbiome
The ribosomal DNA sequences of R. vinifera were obtained from the NCBI RefSeq database using the BLAST algorithm and the BLASTp tool in the default settings. The rRNA sequences were aligned using the ClustalW tool in the default settings.


## Results
In addition, the compounds identified in the present study are listed in Table S2 and Table S.

The compound profile of compounds isolated from the field samples identified in the present study were identical to those reported in literature [21], [22]. The concentration of C5H6 was the most potent compound in the present study, showing that the compound isolated from the field samples was C5H6. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was also comparable to that reported in literature [21]. It was also found that the concentration of C5H6 was high in the present study. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was the highest in the water and the mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was also high in the mineral soil, suggesting that it was insoluble.

The compound profile of compounds isolated from the present study is shown in Table S2. In this study, the concentration of C5H6 in the present study was found to be the highest in the water and the mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was high in the water and mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. In addition, the concentration of C5H6 in the present study was found to be the highest in the mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was found to be high in the mineral soil, suggesting that it was insoluble. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was low in the water and the mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was high in the water and mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was high in the mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form. The concentration of C5H6 in the present study was low in the water and mineral soil, suggesting that it was in an insoluble form.

The compound profile of compounds isolated from the present study are listed in Table S2 and Table S3.


## Discussion
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are both encapsulated species, and are also found in soil and trees in the USA and in the U. The main differences between Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are their mating types, which are rather different from that of the two species of Cryptococcus [41,42]. The species Cryptococcus neoformans is only found in Antarctica, while the Cryptococcus gattii is in the USA and UK. However, the same species of Cryptococcus neoformans is found in Antarctica and other locations around the world. The differences between the two species of Cryptococcus are shown in Table 2.

The genus Cryptococcus is a monotypic genus, that includes both mating type and type-specific haplotypes, which can be recovered from environmental samples. The MATa mating type locus, which is used to identify the mating type of a serotype A strain of Cryptococcus neoformans, also exists in humans and some other organisms, but the MATa locus has not been found in any of the isolates of the Cryptococcus genus. The MATa locus of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii is similar in structure to that of the MATa locus of Cryptococcus neoformans, but the MATa locus of Cryptococcus gattii is different from the MATa locus of Cryptococcus neoformans.

The genome of Cryptococcus gattii has been sequenced and assembled into 12,586,092 contigs, which have an average genome size of 4.74 Mb (Table S1). The genome is composed of 483 genes with an average gene density of 1.52 Mb per gene. The gene content of genes involved in the sexual reproduction were significantly higher than those of the genes involved in the production of proteins, cell wall components and the secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The gene content of genes involved in the production of cell wall components was significantly higher than those of genes involved in the production of cell wall biosynthesis.
