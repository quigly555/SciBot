Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Introduction. Elaphomycetous dermatophytes (E. dermatophila) are emerging as a cause of serious infection and serious morbidity in immunocompromised patients. They are responsible for the extensive pathologies known to occur with this species. This review article discusses the clinical and histopathological features of these dermatophyte-like fungi and discusses the diagnosis and treatment of these infections. Subjects discussed include the challenges encountered in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis and the utility of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques in the diagnosis of these infections.


## Introduction
This antifungal, and earlier used for the treatment of mucormycosis, was initially found to be fungistatic and ineffective for Candida infection, but later, it was found to be effective against Aspergillus and Cryptococcus infections (Arci et a., 2014; Gonçalves et al., 2014; DiCosmo et al., 2016). In a recent review, the efficacy of amphotericin B against invasive aspergillosis was found to be significantly reduced compared with amphotericin B alone (Gonçalves et al., 2014).

The mechanism of action of amphotericin B is thought to involve its interaction with ergosterol, a by-product of the ergosterol biosynthesis, to facilitate the formation of the biologically active sterol 14a-demethylase (Gonçalves et al., 2014). The mechanism of action of amphotericin B against A. fumigatus is thought to involve inhibition of the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the 14a-methyl sterol moiety to the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme erg-2-demethylase (Gonçalves et al., 2014).

## Methods

.2. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the tested agents were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A3 [19]. Briefly, the test was performed in 96-well microtiter plates containing RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma). After 24 h of incubation, the MIC of the tested drugs was determined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth. The susceptibility of the tested drugs to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and voriconazole was confirmed by the presence of a red fluorescence upon the addition of a drop of 0.01% Tween 20 and the colorimetric results were read at the end of the experiment.

2.3. Antifungal Activity in a Cell Culture Supernatant
Cell cultures of C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. glabrata ATCC 90030 were routinely maintained at 37°C in RPMI-1640 medium with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell culture supernatant of C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. glabrata ATCC 90030 were obtained by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. The cell density was adjusted to the final concentration of 1 × 10^6cells/mL by adding 20 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.0). The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate containing RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma). After 24 h of incubation, the cell density was adjusted to the final concentration of 1 × 10^6cells/mL by adding 20 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.0). The microtiter plates were kept at 37°C for 48 h. The MICs of tested compounds were determined by comparing the absorbance at 492 nm and 585 nm. The MICs of the tested drugs to fluconazole and voriconazole were determined by comparing the absorbance at the 492 nm and 585 nm absorbance, respectively.

## Results
There was no mortality (.0% and 1.9% in the ICU, Table 2) after administration of the administration of 10^5 CFU/mL. The ICU-susceptible ICU-susceptible group was almost completely protected against the pulmonary infection by the combination of amphotericin B and fluconazole (Fig 2).

Treatment and Intravenous Antiretroviral Therapy for Candidiasis
The antifungal drugs used to treat C. albicans were amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole. Treatment was started in the ICU-susceptible group and followed by oral amphotericin B and fluconazole. The ICU-susceptible group received fluconazole in the ICU for 4 weeks and voriconazole for 2 weeks, and the ICU-susceptible group received fluconazole for 1 month. After the initial antifungal therapy, the patient was treated with fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B, with the following schedule of antifungal therapy: 1 month with fluconazole, 1 month with fluconazole, and 1 month with fluconazole and amphotericin B, and 1 month with fluconazole and voriconazole, and 1 month with fluconazole and fluconazole and voriconazole, and with oral amphotericin B or fluconazole for 2 weeks. The patient was treated with oral amphotericin B for 1 month. The total duration of antifungal therapy was not significantly different in the groups receiving fluconazole, amphotericin B, or voriconazole compared to the groups receiving fluconazole and fluconazole and voriconazole.

Treatment and Intravenous Antiretroviral Therapy for Candidiasis
The doses of antifungals used to treat C. albicans were amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole.


## Discussion
There was no infectious process associated with gastric ulceration and no previous infection with the fungu.

In a previous study, the authors compared the histopathological features of the patients with chronic ulceration and prostatitis [19]. Of the patients with chronic ulceration, the authors found that the histopathological features were similar in both groups, with the typical histopathological features in patients with chronic ulceration (hemorrhagia, granulocytopenia, and pleocytosis), while the histological features in patients with prostatitis were similar.

In this study, the histopathological findings of the patients with chronic ulceration were different from those of the patients without chronic ulceration. The histopathological findings in the patients with chronic ulceration were similar to those of the patients with prostatitis, and the histopathological findings were similar in all groups. The histopathological findings in patients with chronic prostatitis were similar to those of patients with chronic colitis, with the histopathological findings in the patients with chronic prostatitis were similar to those of those with prostatitis.

A few studies have reported the occurrence of colitis in patients with chronic ulceration [20-22]. However, the clinical manifestations of chronic ulceration are generally nonspecific, and there is no information about the cause of the chronic ulceration. Therefore, the use of antibiotics and antifungal treatment in the cases with chronic ulceration might be recommended.

There are several possible reasons why patients with chronic ulceration might not be treated with antibiotics or antifungal therapy. The patient’s age is higher than those of the patients with chronic ulceration and the patients with chronic prostatitis have a lower BMI [23]. The patient’s BMI was 32.7 kg/m^2, which is significantly higher than those of the patients with chronic ulceration [24]. The patient’s BMI had been reduced to 35 kg/m^2, which is significantly higher than those of the patients with chronic ulceration [25].
