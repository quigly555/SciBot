## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii recently emerged as one of the most common causes of human disease in the western world. This species is transmitted by airflow from trees in low densities (less than 1%) or from trees infected by treeshane (10-20%). C. gattii has been shown to rapidly evolve new virulence factors that can confer resistance to both human and tree pathogens. For example, genetic diversity in the recently sequenced genome of C. gattii revealed the highly specific transcriptional regulation of gene clusters involved in iron homeostasis in the early stage of infection. These results led us to identify and utilize a number of gene clusters including the one involved in the induction of the genes for the biosynthetic routes for copper and iron, as well as those related to adaptation to extreme conditions. In addition, genes encoding the transcriptional regulator SREBP, a highly conserved SRE family member, as well as the multi-layered regulatory networks of the Neurospora crassa, the causative agent of mucormycosis, and the antifungal drug flucytosine, as well as the crosstalk between these gene clusters. These data revealed SREBP, SRE-1, and the closely related kinase Cog1 as key regulators of iron homeostasis in C. gattii, which are discussed in the context of the evolution of iron uptake mechanisms in the fungi.

## Introduction
Since then, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized as a critical mechanism of cellular immunity to infections by Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae [12], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [13] and Staphylococcus aureus [14. In the host environment, AMPs are generated by different mechanisms including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage-induced cell death (DID) [15]. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been demonstrated to play a role in multiple types of pathogenesis including immunity, invasion, invasion-related, cell proliferation, metastasis, and modulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, AMPs were demonstrated to be involved in wound healing, tumorigenesis, and cancer metastasis [16].

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and peptidases (PPR) are immunomodulatory molecules that mediate host defense against microbial pathogens. PPR are classified into four groups: the group I group I (GIT-I) peptides, which are classified as small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules that interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis [17]. GIT-I have been proved to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including to mediate both innate and adaptive immune responses, and to induce cell death in host macrophages [18]. The group II group are characterized by the production of various biological activity such as antimicrobial peptides [19], anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial peptides [20], or peptidases [21].

The antimicrobial peptide (AMP) is a type II secretion system, consisting of a membrane-bound endopeptidase, a chaperone, a large endopeptidase, and an extracellular surface protein [22]. During infection, the pathogen cell must first induce the secretion of a membrane-bound endopeptidase. The endopeptidase is cleaved by a caspase-8, which is active on serine proteases, and then cleaved by two different proteins, termed endopeptidases (EPSs) and phospholipases (PLs) [23]. Eps and PLs are classified into different groups, depending on their functions.


## Methods
. grandulosum was isolated from the plant in 2009 and deposited in the European Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (ECMC), where it is the only species found in the United Kingdom. In this study, we used the fresh leaf samples for a combined analysis of the antimicrobial activity of T. grandulosum and the ß-cycloserine (CDN) and ß-cycloserine (AMT) [3].

Antimicrobial activity test
The antimicrobial activities of the extracts obtained from the plant were evaluated by the broth microdilution method (IC_50) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 (2008).

The experiments were performed according to the methodology described by the CLSI. Briefly, two sterile 10 ml sterile conical flasks were inoculated with 5 ml of the broth, the microbial growth was measured after 48 h, and the MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the extract that caused 80% of the visible growth of the yeast [3]. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts were compared with the controls without the addition of the extracts and the yeast.

## Results
grandulosum CBS 10441, CBS 10764 and CBS 10903) and in the culture broth of the other two strains (CBS 10764 and CBS 10903. This was also observed in the broth of the other two strains tested, as previously described for the yeasts CBS 10764 and CBS 10903 [21]. No antimicrobial peptide was detected in the cultures of these strains.

Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial peptides identified in Candida species

The present study was the first to examine the phylogenetic relationship between Candida species and fungi. Two Candida species (C. neoformans and C. gattii) were recently identified as pathogenic to humans (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05; Kitas et al., 2014). Both Candida species are homothallic with the former being a member of the Ascomycota (Arcanomycotina), while the latter is a member of the Basidiomycota (Ascomycota). As C. neoformans is the only fungus to have been found to contain a specific dikaryotic ancestor [10], this is unexpected. However, Candida species are known to have been found to be phylogenetically related to the Ascomycota, with a close relationship to the Basidiomycota, and also to the Ascomycota (Chamystomyces hirsutum, a basal member of the Ascomycota) [10].

The tree of Candida species based on the concatenated four gene sequences (Fig 1) revealed a well-supported clade containing six distinct lineages, one of which is sister to the species that is currently known to be C. neoformans (Fig 1a) and C. gattii (Fig 1b).

## Discussion
The combination of two peptides, salicylic acid and 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one and Salicylic acid and 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one, and the formation of a novel antimicrobial peptide from two leaves of . grandulosum (or P. digitatum) T.A. (Orthoendomycetes) [63] was investigated. The compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit Plectramelum grandulosum and against other pathogenic fungi.

The antimicrobial activity of compounds 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one and 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one was determined by their inhibitory concentrations. The concentrations of compounds 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one and 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one in the tested concentrations of compounds were in the range of 2-32 µg/mL, while in the other compounds the concentrations of compounds were in the range of 128-256 µg/mL. In the case of compound 2, the highest activity was observed when the compound was in the range of 128-256 µg/mL.

A new compound, 4,5-trifluoperazine (4), was tested for its activity against Plectramelum grandulosum and P. digitatum by the use of the combination of two compounds (2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one and 2,3,4,5,7-tetrazolium-2-one) as the biofilm-envelope. The results showed that compound 4 was able to inhibit the growth of Plectramelum grandulosum and P. digitatum.
