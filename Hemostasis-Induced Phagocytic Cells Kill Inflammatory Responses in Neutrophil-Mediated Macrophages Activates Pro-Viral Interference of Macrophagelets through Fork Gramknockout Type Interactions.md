## Abstract

An infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii was triggered by a rejection of an immunosuppressive regimen of Interferon-G suppressed immunotherap. The failure to activate protective immune responses drove a neutropenia. The activated macrophages responded with a severe suppression of neutrophil-derived chemokines and apoptosis, leading to death. Th1-associated macrophages rapidly phagocytosed the parasite, resulting in the loss of cellular integrity and the appearance of autophagy-related proteins. These macrophages had lost their innate immune response and were responding with a high-fructose, acidified-glucose, steroids and proteins that are known to induce TIP-associated regulatory T-cell (Treg) formation. These inflammatory responses were required for the induction of a select group of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby leading to TIP-associated disease (TOD). Toxoplasmosis responded by killing neutrophils, thereby triggering a large cell death, programmed neutrophil death, and cytokine immunopositivity. In turn, TIP triggered by the TGF-ß-derived ligand TGF-ß had the following effect: inhibiting Toxoplasma induced IL-10 production, which in turn inhibited IL-10-a and IL-10-ß production, as well as increasing IL-10-ß production in IL-6 and TGF-ß-deficient cells. These results indicate that TIP plays an important role in triggering a select group of inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby inducing a significant Th1/Th2 cytokine response.

Toxoplasmosis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among AIDS patients and has become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in our Western countries. The mechanisms that underlie this outcome remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms of action of the highly toxic combination of drugs, including mycophenolic acid (MSA), on the spleen of HIV-1 RNA-dependent mutant strains of C. albicans.

In this study, we found that MSA produced by the C.


## Introduction
Oral candidiasis is a common opportunistic fungal infection that affects over one million cases worldwide. The incidence of ophthalmic complications is high with the most prevalent Candida species being candidaemia. Other pathogenic species such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Pneumocystis jirovecii are reported to be responsible for the highest number of ocular manifestations. In the literature, Candida spp. are generally classified into two groups according to clinical presentation. The first group includes C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis; the second group includes C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata [1].


## Methods
In brief, neutrophils from non-phagocytosed macrophages were treated with 1 mM 4-hydroxy-1-deoxy-ß-D-galactoside (H_2O_2) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 mM HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), .1% v/v non-essential amino acids, and 1% a-tricaine. After 24 h, culture medium was removed, macrophages were lysed, and conidia (3×10^6/ml) were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640. For experimental validation, cells were cultured in an 8-well plate at 37°C, 5% CO_2. For a live-cell assay, cells were grown to stationary phase in RPMI-1640 medium and were collected by centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and then centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile PBS. For heat-inactivated macrophages activation, a-tubulin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the macrophages were incubated for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO_2. The cells were then lysed by adding 200 µl of cold PBS (pH 7.4) and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium. The cells were plated on a 24-well plate at a density of 1×10^4 macrophages/ml. After 6 h of incubation at 37°C, 1 ml of PBS was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1×10^3/ml. The plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO_2.


## Results
Identification of the Major Genes in S. cerevisiae
To characterize the major genome in S. cerevisiae, we selected genes that encode genes involved in translation, cell cycle and growth, stress response and virulence. We found that S. cerevisiae has 21 genes with significant similarity to the known S. cerevisiae genes and all are conserved among different fungal species (Figure 1). In particular, the CNAG_01702 (transcriptase) cluster from S. cerevisiae encodes a homologue of the catalytic subunit of riboflavin synthase and is responsible for the synthesis of riboflavin. In S. cerevisiae, we identified the CNAG_02566 transcription factor gene (http://genome.jgi.doe.


## Discussion
albicans by macrophages, which are a less efficient receptor of IL-12, . albicans is able to recruit IL-12 to macrophages via M1- and M2-mediated phagocytosis, respectively. In addition to the lack of detectable IL-12 release upon C. albicans-induced phagocytosis of C. albicans, we observed no significant differences in macrophage phagocytosis between C. albicans- and C. neoformans-infected macrophages (Fig 3C). In contrast, IL-12 release was not sufficient to induce C. albicans phagocytosis by macrophages, which may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of IL-12. The observed differences in phagocytosis of C. albicans and C. neoformans by macrophages are consistent with other studies that show C. albicans and C. neoformans phagocytosis is increased in macrophages following C. albicans infection [26-29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Interestingly, the magnitude of IL-12 production by macrophages following C. albicans-induced phagocytosis of C. albicans-infected macrophages was similar to that of C. neoformans-infected macrophages. This suggests that macrophages are more efficient in phagocytosis of C. albicans than C. neoformans. However, the magnitude of IL-12 release by macrophages following C. albicans-induced phagocytosis was still smaller than that of C. neoformans-infected macrophages. This suggests that macrophages may be less efficient in phagocytosis of C. albicans than C. neoformans.

The phagocytosis of C. albicans-infected macrophages by macrophages requires the recognition of C. albicans by phagocytes. IL-12 is required to recognize C. albicans, which is dependent on C. albicans to inhibit phagocytosis [36].
