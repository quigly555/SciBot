## Abstract
Infectious meningitis (IS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The rapid diagnosis and treatment of IS are hampered by delayed initiation of treatment, both in terms of clinical and immunological concerns and because of the rarity of the disease in clinical cultures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Amphotericin B (AMB) against the MUM and WHO grade 3 and 4 sepsis organisms, respectively.

Two hundred and fifty patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 62% were male and median age was 50 years. Amphotericin B was administered intraperitoneally at first dose (48 mg/kg) in 200 subjects (median dose 23 mg/kg) with a cumulative effect of 1.5 months (IQR 1-2.5). The study was a multicenter, in-house, double-blinded, open-label, phase II/III study. The primary end points were baseline hemoglobin, serum creatinine, bacterial clearance and treatment response to Amphotericin B. The toxicity and safety of AMB were evaluated by disc diffusion and microtiter plate counts at first dose and at the end of treatment.

All the study subjects were negative for clinically confirmed bacterial infection. Mean age was 39.1 ± 9.9 years, 70% were male. Median age of patients was 36 years ± 18 years, and 68% were culture positive. The FilmArray MUM/WCC-2 panel had a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 94.9%, and a positive likelihood ratio (PPR) of 71.5, within the acceptable range for therapeutic efficacy.

In this Phase II open-label trial, the efficacy and toxicity of AMB were evaluated against MUM and WHO grade 3 and 4 sepsis organisms. The results were comparable between both groups, with the exception of MUM, in which efficacy was comparable between the two groups.


## Introduction
The development of novel drugs against drug resistant strains is one of the key challenges in drug discovery and development. This review aims to discuss the main challenges faced in the search for new anticancer agents against drug-resistant drug-resistant pathogens.


## Methods
The mycelium was harvested, washed twice with 10% cold water and freeze-dried at -20 °C until us. The mycelium was ground using a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen and extracted with 100% methanol. The resulting supernatant was used for enzyme digestion. The quality of the enzyme was determined using a Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The residue was purified using a Bead Beater reagent (Beyotime Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China) with a Millipore Microbial Protein Purification Kit (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA) to remove residual water, methyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide, phenylketone, butyrate, and ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was stored at -20 °C before use.

2.3. Screening for Antifungal Activity of Trichoderma Isolates
The antifungal activity of Trichoderma schimacanthum was evaluated using the test compound 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a positive control in the test of antifungal activity. The test compound was dissolved in DMSO and was diluted to 0.01% in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The mixture was placed on a growth chamber (Lab-Tek, USA) at 28 °C and the optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) was measured. The test compounds were diluted in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with L-glutamine and without sodium bicarbonate, at the concentration of 50 mg/mL. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and were then diluted with DMSO. The test concentrations were set at 0.01% in RPMI-1640 medium and 0.01% in RPMI-1640 medium with L-glutamine and without sodium bicarbonate.


## Results
We tested the production of lipids by the engineered strains and found that most of the engineered strains produced the highest amount of lipids, with the exception of two strains, which produced the highest amount of lipids (Figure 2. However, the high level of lipids produced by the engineered strains did not always correspond to the predicted lipid contents (Figure 3). For example, most of the engineered strains produced low amounts of lipids, with the exception of one strain, which produced high amounts of lipids (Table 3). Finally, the engineered strains produced the highest amounts of lipids when the lipid content was increased (Figure 3).

In contrast to the lipid accumulation phenotypes, the cell wall remodelling phenotypes of the engineered strains were similar to those of the control strains. For example, the engineered strains showed increased cell wall phenotypes than the control strains (Figure 4).

Taken together, our results suggest that lipid synthesis is a robust process and the engineered strains produce lipid and membrane-exposed lipids with very similar phenotypes to the control strains.

The engineered strains are able to tolerate high temperatures
We have previously demonstrated that the engineered strains are able to grow and survive in high-temperature environments. Our results suggest that the engineered strains are able to grow in the presence of high temperatures. The engineered strains were able to grow at 30°C, 37°C and 42°C on YPD agar plates, with the exception of one strain that grew well at all of the temperatures tested (Figure 5).

In contrast, the engineered strains were unable to grow in the presence of high salt concentrations. In addition, the engineered strains were not able to grow in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, which is not a known stressor for this organism. In contrast, the engineered strains were able to grow at low salt concentrations and the growth of the engineered strains was not inhibited by the high salt concentrations tested (Table 4).

The engineered strains are able to withstand the effects of high salt concentrations
We investigated the ability of the engineered strains to survive high salt concentrations. In addition, we investigated the ability of the engineered strains to withstand the stress of high salt concentrations.


## Discussion
The lipid synthesis ability of Trichoderma schimacanthum lipids is in agreement with the in vitro lipid production [36. However, our results are in agreement with previous reports in yeast. In a study on cellobiose, the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) by Trichoderma longicornisii was reported as being severely impaired in the cellobiose concentration of untreated cells [38]. In a murine systemic infection model, the production of TAG by Trichoderma longicornisii was investigated in a modified intracellular culture of mice [39]. In this study, the fungal cells from the stomach of mice were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of different fungal species (Ficus, Candida, and Aspergillus spp.) [40]. Our results showed that the synthesis of TAG was not affected by different fungal species and strain. However, the amount of TAG produced by Trichoderma longicornisii in the growth conditions used in the present study (Fig 2) is still not equivalent to that produced by strains of Trichoderma in vitro and from an in vitro culture of Candida albicans [41]. In the present study, the lipid yield and the lipid composition of Trichoderma in the mycelium grown in the presence of different fungal species and strains of Trichoderma were determined by cultivation and extraction of the lipid fractions and by their enzymatic production by the recombinant strain of Trichoderma longicornisii. The lipid yield of Trichoderma in the mycelium grown in the presence of different fungal species and strains was 57.7% and 39.3% and the lipid composition of Trichoderma in the mycelium grown in the presence of different fungal species and strains, respectively, was 64.9% and 14.7%.

Previous studies in yeasts have demonstrated that Trichoderma longicornisii has a remarkable ability to synthesize fatty acids, fatty acid esters, and fatty acids-derived intermediates (FAIs) from the cellobiose concentration [40].
