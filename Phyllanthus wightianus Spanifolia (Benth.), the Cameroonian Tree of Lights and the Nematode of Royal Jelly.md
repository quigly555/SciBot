## Abstract
Different preparations of plant parts and their derivatives were obtained by infusion, and different concentrations of the main components were added to shake the pot at least onc. The crude extracts were stirred in a stock infusion medium to collect the microbial products. After that, the solvent extracts were precipitated in a water solubilization method. The extracts were precipitated in an acid fast acid fast acid fast agar with the addition of 1% Sulfolacilaria (SFTA) followed by 1.5% ammonium sulphate. The crude extracts were kept for a long time in the presence of the yeast extract solution. The extracted components were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry for differences of their fatty acid profile and free fatty acid mass of their monoterpenoid linoleic acid, respectively. The results were further confirmed by the difference of the fatty acid profile of the extract constituents extracted from the crude extracts. Furthermore, the crude extracts showed various antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Sporothrix rubra. The crude extracts of P. wightianus and P. wightianus-P. wightianus-P. wightianus-P. wightianus-P. nificans were evaluated as antifungal agents by using the broth microdilution method, and the results were further confirmed by the broth microdilution method. Moreover, the antifungal activities of the extracts and the phenolic compounds were determined. The results showed that the extracts were more effective against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The isolated compounds were further evaluated by the Western blot technique to verify the results. The isolated compounds were further evaluated by the assay of their effects on the cell viability and viability of cells treated with different doses of the extracts. Finally, the results of the assay were confirmed by the minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained. Results of the assay showed that SFTA extract was more effective than the standard antifungal compound, SFTA. SFTA extract was also more active against the three tested fungi compared to control.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a member of the human microbiota and is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen of the mucosal and systemic environment. C. albicans is considered to be a benign commensal organism and can be found in the oral and gastrointestinal tracts of healthy individuals (McKenna, 2002). It can cause superficial infections with a high mortality rate. C.


## Methods
Plant material
Plant material was purchased from Nakhon Kaen University. It was obtained from the local markets of the local market in Zhejiang Province.

Strain and culture
The wild-type F. graminearum strain, S. cerevisiae JOH113, was kindly provided by Dr. F. Dong (Nanjing Institute of Botany and Chinese Medicine, China). The fungal isolate was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at 4°C, at room temperature (22-25°C). The fungal mycelial suspension was prepared as previously described [11]. The strain was maintained in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 37°C for 48 h.

Isolation of filamentous fungi
Fungal mycelial cultures were prepared as previously described [11]. The fungal strains were cultivated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 37°C for 24 h. The mycelium was collected and washed with sterile distilled water. The mycelium was lyophilized, and the powdery mycelium was suspended in sterile distilled water. The mycelium powder was filtered and transferred to a sterile tube. The mycelium was suspended in sterile distilled water.


## Results
From the description of the type specimen (. bombycis), the following conidiophores are observed: monomitic, subcylindrical, branched, straight or slightly curved, smooth-walled, cylindrical-oblong, filiform, 3-7(-8) × (1.5-)2-3(-4) µm, (x¯ = 3.5 × 2 µm, n = 60), pluriseptate, not constricted at septa; with 2-5(-6) apical hila, arising from the basal cell of the conidiogenous apparatus; apex usually rounded or attenuated, (0.5-)1-2(-2.5) µm long, (0.5-)1-2 µm wide at the base, 0.5-2 µm wide in the upper half, sometimes slightly to distinctly protuberant, (1.5-)2-4 µm wide at the base, with a relatively flat or slightly convex dome and a narrow ocular chamber, surrounded by a narrow, dark brown, somewhat thick-walled, brownish, somewhat paler halo. Conidiogenous apparatus (4-)6-10 × 2-3 µm; single or in small groups, usually unbranched, sometimes branched, occasionally with a single conidiogenous apparatus; conidiogenous cells phialidic, lageniform, cylindrical-oblong, (9-)11.5-14(-17.5) × (2.5-)3-4(-5) µm (x¯ = 13 × 3 µm, n = 20), lageniform or subcylindrical, hyaline, smooth-walled, 5-8(-10) × (1.5-)2-3 µm (x¯ = 8 × 2 µm, n = 20), determinate, proliferating several times percurrently near the apex, with a single apical or periclinal hilum, with 1-3(-4) tubular apical hila, smooth- and thin-walled, pale brownish, walls somewhat thickened, endotunica-like, hila protuberant, (0.5-)1-2 µm diam, (0.


## Discussion

The Drosophilidae group comprises four genera of trees that form mixed communities, and have been found to be closely related to other Dothideomycetes [1. The Drosophilidae are a well-studied group of fungi that are known for their ant mode of growth, which is involved in the production of secondary metabolites, such as resinous compounds [5]. The Drosophilidae were also found to be closely related to the Nematode of Light in the symbiosis between C. torreyi and O. beauranis [21].

The genus of Dothideomycetes comprises three groups: a clade of the Dothideomycetes branch is closely related to that of the Sclerodermatinellales [21], a clade of the Dothideomycetes branch is closely related to that of the Sclerodermatinellales [5], and a clade of the Dothideomycetes branch is closely related to that of the Dothideomycetes branch [4], suggesting that the Dothideomycetes branch is an intermediate between the Dothideomycetes and the Nematodeomycetes.

The Dothideomycetes branch is found to be a monotypic genus, which is similar to those of Dothideomycetes which comprises the Dothideomycetes branch [4], [6].

The Dothideomycetes branch is found to be a heterotypic genus, which is similar to those of the Nematodes of Light, which includes members of the Dothideomycetes branch [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].

The Dothideomycetes branch is phylogenetically closely related to the Dothideomycetes branch, which comprises members of the Dothideomycetes and the Nematodeomycetes branches. The Dothideomycetes branch is found to be closely related to the Nematodes of Light, which includes members of the Dothideomycetes branch [4].
