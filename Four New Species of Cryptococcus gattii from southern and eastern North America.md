## Abstract
We found a total of 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the four genes that encode the basidiomycete Major histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in the MHC subunits of the C- and C-helix of MH. Phylogenetic analyses of several loci showed that the MHC subunits share a common structural motif with C. neoformans, suggesting that this motif has been modified by environmental factors or by evolution. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the MHC subunits of the C-helix and C-helix subunits of the minor histone choroid protein B (CHC1, CHC2, CHC3, and CHC4) and the major histone choroid protein M (CHC1-4, CHC2-1, CHC1-4, and CHC1-5) have evolutionary common origins from a common ancestor sharing the same structural motif. The phylogenetic analysis highlighted that a functional variant of the MHC subunits C- and C-helix has been recently found in the MHC of more than 95% of the isolates from the North American C. gattii VGII/VGIII population. The presence of multiple mutations in the C-helix and C-helix subunits of MHC in the C-helix of MHC subunits of the major histone C (CHC1, CHC2, CHC3, and CHC1-4) and C-helix subunits M (CHC1, CHC2, CHC1, and CHC1-2) indicates that these subunits of the MHC are likely under pressure pressure differently from the MHC units of the other major histones. Our study highlights the different evolutionary strategies used by MHC isolates to evade host immune recognition. The results of this study can impact the development of new diagnostic tools for the rapid detection and treatment of fungal infections.

Identification of the genetic structure of the fungal cell wall is critical for fungal pathogenesis. The MHC contains many putative components but is limited in its structural diversity because of the varied organization and organization-compatibility properties of the cell wall.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic fungal infection and its global incidence has been increasing worldwide due to the increase in immunocompromized patients and the use of immunosuppressive drugs (Robinson and Diez-Mendy, 2006). The most common clinical presentation of cryptococcosis is meningoencephalitis (CM), which is a secondary infection with high mortality in the majority of patients. There are no effective antifungal drugs for cryptococcosis and the clinical course of these diseases varies from one to the other. Among the antifungals used in the treatment of cryptococcosis, amphotericin B (AMB) and azoles are the most widely used. AMB is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is widely used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is a component of the innate immune system and has a variety of pharmacological properties that make it useful for the treatment of both fungal and bacterial infections. This review summarizes the current knowledge of AMB therapy for treatment of cryptococcosis and its role in immune and nervous system disorders.


## Methods
Cryptococcus gattii were isolated from medical specimens as well as from the infected skin of rabbit. Cryptococcus gattii were identified by the yeasts and fungi identified by the yeast colony. Cryptococcus gattii from the southern parts of the world were isolated from animals in the animal house in the central area of Cameroon. The yeast isolates from the southern region of Cameroon were isolated from animals in the animal house in Cameroon. Cryptococcus gattii from the eastern region of Cameroon were isolated from animals in the animal house in Cameroon. These species were the only strains of C. gattii from the Cameroon.

In order to characterize the species of C. gattii present in the samples, a fungal species identification of the fungal isolates was performed in Cameroon. The fungi isolates were obtained from the southern region of Cameroon by inoculating the blood from the thorax of rabbits infected with Cryptococcus gattii and the blood from the rabbits infected with C. gattii.

DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the fungal genomic DNA
DNA extraction was performed from the blood of the rabbits. The extracted DNA was stored at -20 °C. The purified fungal DNA was then used for the DNA extraction using a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA samples were stored at -20 °C. The DNA was extracted according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Seward, UK) with the following modifications: 1. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and was then diluted 1:50 in 50% ethanol and kept at -20 °C. 2. The DNA was purified using a QIAamp Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 3. The DNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The concentration and purity of the DNA were estimated using NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

PCR amplification of the fungal genomic DNA
The DNA of C. gattii was amplified by PCR using the universal fungal primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et al.


## Results
Other species were isolated from the oral mucosa, esophagus, and feces, but not from the lungs, spleens, or lung. The isolates were characterized as “S. gattii” in the literature and “A. gattii” in the current literature, but no isolates were identified in the current literature.

Six isolates were isolated from blood samples, one from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease and two from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease. The blood of the patient had blood cultures negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis, but no culture was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis. The patient was a white man with a white-brownish blood color. A culture of the blood was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis. The patient was a white man with a white-brown blood color. The patient was a white man with a white-brown blood color.

The isolates were characterized as “B. dermatitidis” in the literature, but no isolates were identified in the current literature.

Four isolates were isolated from blood samples, one from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease and two from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease. The blood of the patient had blood cultures negative for B. dermatitidis and B. dermatitidis, but no culture was negative for B. dermatitidis. The blood of the patient had a culture of the blood was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis, but no culture was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis. The patient was a white man with a white blood color.

Three isolates were isolated from blood samples, one from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease and two from the blood of a patient with a hematological disease. The blood of the patient had a culture of the blood was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis, but no culture was negative for M. tuberculosis and B. dermatitidis. The patient was a white man with a white blood color.


## Discussion
gattii)
This species is characterized by its large (up to .5 cm in diameter) conidia and reddish to yellowish-yellow basidiomes. The sexual morph of C. gattii is rather uncommon and even rarer (Ivanov et al. 2009). The species is known only from Europe and North America. The sexual morph of C. gattii is a morphologically distinct species and has never been reported from Europe. The species has been reported from Europe and North America but not from southern China.

A new species in South Korea has been reported (C. celestine) (Zhou et al. 2015). This species is characterized by its smaller size (5-7.5 mm) and subcuticular to subglobose to subglobose to subglobose basidiomes.
