## Abstract
The evolution of anti-infective therapeutic antibodies has been pivotal in aiding in the discovery of new therapeutic antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated that the A antibody family in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans binds and mediates the interaction between serotype D and serotype A. The CNV family binds to and mediates serotype D antigens, thereby mediating antifungal activity.


## Introduction
The global incidence of invasive fungal infections is increasing, which has been attributed mainly to the rise in immunocompromised patients. The number of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other diseases such as mucormycosis and invasive aspergillosis is increasing, as well as high-risk patient populations [1-3]. Candida species are the most common etiological agents of candidemia. The number of infections in patients with AIDS and mucormycosis is increasing. This is due to an increase in the incidence of candidemia, mainly acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, endometritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The incidence of candidemia is also increasing, as evidenced by an increase in candidemia-associated deaths in the past decade [4, 5]. Candida albicans is a normal part of the human microbiome and colonizes the human body colonizing the mucosal surface of mucosal surfaces, such as the oral cavity, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, and vagina, for many years [6, 7]. The major form of fungal colonization in the human body is mucocutaneous candidiasis [8].

A large number of studies have demonstrated that candidemia is associated with the expansion of Candida species and invasive aspergillosis (IA) [9]. C. albicans is the most common species and the most common cause of candidemia in humans [10-15]. The cause of these infections is mainly due to its ability to acquire nutrients from the environment and to proliferate within the host [16]. This fungus can live in a wide range of temperatures from 20°C to 37°C [17], and can cause severe infections in healthy individuals [18].

The ability of C. albicans to proliferate within the host is related to its virulence, which includes biofilm formation, the formation of multicellular biofilms [19]. The most important virulence factor is the ability of C. albicans to switch between the yeast and hyphal forms, with the formation of basidioma and pseudohyphal forms [20-22]. The former is an elaborate network of hyphal cells, which allows the fungus to grow in a wide range of environmental conditions and the latter is a morphological switch between yeast and hyphal forms [23, 24].


## Methods
Ethics statement
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal studies did not involve endangered or protected species.

Experiments
C. parapsilosis strains were grown in minimal essential medium (MM) for 3 days, and used for the experiment. For the experiments, C. parapsilosis strains were grown in minimal medium with 0.5% (w/v) glucose. The growth medium used for the experiments was YPD (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, and 2% w/v glucose). MM was composed of MM with 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 2% w/v glucose.


## Results
There were a total of 16 patients with proven cryptococcal meningitis (adjusted OR .29, 95% CI 1.05-1.67). The most common clinical manifestations were fever (21/36, 95% CI 4.22-50.1), inflammation (17/36, 95% CI 2.22-44.8), headache (12/36, 95% CI 1.27-50.1), gastrointestinal tract (12/36, 95% CI 2.35-43.5), vomiting (8/36, 95% CI 2.05-14.3), meningeal irritation (7/36, 95% CI 2.50-21.9), hypotension (4/36, 95% CI 2.56-9.1), and cough (5/36, 95% CI 2.84-17.6). The most common clinical manifestations were meningeal irritation (35/40, 95% CI 22.83-74.7), headache (12/40, 95% CI 2.67-35.2), vomiting (11/40, 95% CI 2.60-24.1), and hypotension (9/40, 95% CI 2.47-23.5).

The current clinical manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis was meningeal irritation (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.92) and headache (adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01-1.81) (Table 5). The most common clinical manifestations were headache (11/40, 95% CI 2.67-35.2), vomiting (7/40, 95% CI 2.60-24.1), and meningeal irritation (6/40, 95% CI 2.55-17.6).

Overall, 6 patients had a CSF opening pressure of 0.4 mmH2a (range: 0.5-1.2 mmH2a) and 1 patient had a CSF opening pressure of 1.0 mmH2a (range: 0.2-1.0 mmH2a). Of these, 4 patients had a negative CSF culture result, 2 patients had a negative CSF cryptococcal antigen test result, and 1 patient had a CSF culture result positive for cryptococcal meningitis.


## Discussion
A double-stranded DNA-binding protein (DSBP) was originally described as a yeast and has been shown to play a role in eukaryotic development and pathogenesis (22). DSBP is a vacuolar protein containing a terminal domain that contains three subunits, one of which is a DNA-binding protein (Fig 1). This DNA-binding protein is primarily present in yeast and is thought to be required for the proper assembly of the nuclear envelope in budding and for the proper internalization of DNA (22). The majority of the DSBP in eukaryotes is found in the cytosol, where it has been found to be involved in gene expression and gene conversion (23). However, little is known about the molecular basis for the localization of DSBP. In yeast, the function of DSBP is unknown, but its function is known to be involved in the regulation of the genome integrity (24). In addition, the localization of DSBP was not investigated in S. cerevisiae. In this study, we identified and characterized DSBP in C. albicans. As a subunit, DSBP is a member of the DNA-binding protein family (Pfam). The molecular function of DSBP is still unclear.
