## Abstract
In the last few decades, the number of completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes has increased considerably, and many of these genomes are now available for comparative purposes. However, there are also a large number of non-coding RNAs that are still missing from the genomes of important eukaryotic lineages, and these missing proteins are the main cause of the genome reduction. Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) are short synthetic RNA viruses that are produced after specific RNAs are lost.

## Introduction
The genus of Apiospora is a highly diverse and ubiquitous genus of saprophytic fungi. Apiospora (syn. Ophiostomatales, Ophiostomatricineae) is one of the largest and most polyphyletic genera in the subphylum, which includes approximately 25,000 species (http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp) (Crous et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2015). Several Apiospora species have been reported as pathogenic organisms in humans, insects, and other mammals (He et al. 2007; Corrigan et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2015). These pathogenic species are characterized by a thick-walled, dark-brown, and black ascomata with globose, brown-ish, and ellipsoid, multiseptate conidia. These conidia are phialidic, verruculose, and verruculose, with short, thick-walled, and black conidia that are typically ellipsoid, verruculose, or with a small cap on top. The conidia have a long, tapered stalk, and are mostly straight or flexed, resembling a truncated tuber. There are three main groups, namely, A. flavus, A. nidulans, and A. porosum, which are distributed in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, while A.


## Methods
This approach is similar to that used for the previous study (Silva et a. 2017) but with the use of two different PCR primers (Pritchard et al. 2014). The primers used for the present study were ITS1 and ITS4, and for the primer sequences of the present study, they were as follows: for ITS1, 5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAAAAG-3' and 5'-GGTTCCTCATTTAGAGGAAGT3'; for ITS4, 5'-CTTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3' and 5'-GCTGCGTTCTCTCCGAGCTT3' and ITS4, 5'-GCTGCGTTCTCCTCCGGG3'. The PCR conditions were: denaturation (94 °C, 4 min), annealing (94 °C, 30 s), extension (72 °C, 30 s), and elongation (72 °C, 1 min). The PCR products were purified by a One-step PCR Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). The PCR product was digested with a Ligation Reaction Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and the products were then purified by electrophoresis in 1 × TAE buffer (GE Healthcare). The purified PCR product was used to prepare PCR products for sequencing, which were analyzed by electrophoresis in a BigDye^® Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were purified and sequenced using the same primers. The sequences were compared with the sequences available in GenBank (Table 1).

Phylogenetic Analysis
The alignments of the sequences were performed with the online version of MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh & Toh 2008) and the sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table 1). The sequences of the present study were deposited in GenBank (Table 1). The sequences of the previous study (Silva et al. 2017) were deposited in the GenBank database (Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbour-joining method in PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) with the default parameters.


## Results
To determine if the filamentous fungi are able to sense and engulf polystyrene foam in the host host, we cultivated the fungus in a manner similar to that used in the current study (Figure 6. After 2 weeks at 25°C, the fungus was able to form dense and brown-colored, smooth and creamy hyphae with a smooth surface (Figure 6). The filamentous fungi also showed a high degree of filamentous growth (Figure 6). The filamentous fungi were very efficient in growing on fresh OA plates containing OAA and 10% glucose, and this growth pattern was observed in at least two different trials (Table 3). The fungal growth was restricted to the first 2-5 days of incubation at 25°C, but this growth was observed in at least two of the four trials (Table 3). The filamentous fungi were also able to grow in liquid oatmeal medium (Figure 7).

To determine whether the fungal filamentous fungi were able to control the surface smoothness, the different fungal species were co-cultured with the L. dahliae strain H99 and the ß-1,3-glucanase-producing strains S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. These co-cultures were performed in the presence of different concentrations of OAA and glucose (4.0, 25, and 100 µg/ml) to ensure that no visible alterations were present in the fungal cultures. The co-cultures were also performed in the presence of glucose in a ratio of 4:1 and glucose was used to provide 2-5% OAA (Figure 8). The fungus was able to grow on solid OA plates containing OAA and glucose in both the presence and absence of glucose, while glucose did not show significant effects on the fungal growth. The filamentous fungi were also able to grow in liquid oatmeal medium, and co-cultures were found to be highly efficient in co-culturing the fungal species with the OAA-producing L. dahliae strain H99 (Table 3). The co-cultures were also found to be highly efficient in co-culturing the filamentous fungi with the ß-1,3-glucanase-producing L. dahliae strain H99 (Table 3).


## Discussion
In this system, the target dsRNA-mediated system is constrained by the P:Lx_H intro. The P:Lx_H intron is required for dsRNA recognition, and the F:Tx_H intron is required for dsRNA-mediated recognition. In the model system, this system has a single-stranded RNA-binding motif (Rd-Rdu) that has a dual function, thus, to bind to the dsRNA-DNA complex and facilitate the fission of dsRNA.

To test the hypothesis that dsRNA is a homolog of the Drosophila genome, we tested the model system with dsRNA-DNA and dsRNA-RNA-DNA complexes and found that dsRNA is bound to the dsRNA-DNA complex, but not to the dsRNA-DNA complex (Figure 4B). In this model system, we observed that the dsRNA-DNA complex does not bind to dsRNA in the model system, but binds to the dsRNA-DNA complex in the model system (Figure 4A). In this model system, the dsRNA-DNA complex is constrained by the P:Lx_H intron and the F:Tx_H intron, and the P:Lx_H intron is required for dsRNA recognition. However, the dsRNA-DNA complex binds to the dsRNA-DNA complex in the model system (Figure 4B). In this model system, the dsRNA-DNA complex is constrained by the F:Tx_H intron, and the F:Tx_H intron is required for dsRNA-mediated recognition. In this model system, we observed that the dsRNA-DNA complex does not bind to dsRNA in the model system (Figure 4A). In this model system, the dsRNA-DNA complex is constrained by the P:Lx_H intron and the F:Tx_H intron, and the F:Tx_H intron is required for dsRNA-mediated recognition.
