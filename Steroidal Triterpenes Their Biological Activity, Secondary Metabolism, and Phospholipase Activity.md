## Abstract
Innate immune cells and their macrophages are major players in the first line of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with an ever increasing number of patients living with it. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of EO on SLE patients’ prognosis, immune cell activation, and the factors responsible for their outcome. In order to assess the efficacy of EO in SLE, the anti-inflammatory cytokine stano-2 was assessed in SLE patients’ blood and lung tissues. EO treatment significantly improved lung injury severity (P < .05) and improved lung fungal burden (P < .01), decreased SLE-related inflammatory profile (P < .01), and improved lung morphological appearance (P < .01). Treatment with EO during treatment of SLE was more efficient in decreasing lung fungal burdens (P < .05). Stimulation of the pro-inflammatory immune system by EO decreased lung burden of fungal pathogens (including Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides), suggesting that this stimulation is important in controlling the disease. In addition, EO treatment reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL1, JNK, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17A, and IL-18 in the SLE-SLE patients’ blood and the lungs. In conclusion, we found that EO treatment with a pro-inflammatory cytokine could improve SLE and improve lung injury, suggesting that this stimulation is important to control the disease and avoiding immune suppression during SLE management.


## Introduction
Microorganisms have been studied in detail in a number of different parts of the world. Amongst others, fungi are considered as important groups that infect plants, animals, and other living organisms. In fact, the fungal community is very complex and has a wide geographical distribution, and their diversity is highly variable [1,2,3]. Nevertheless, there has been a recent surge in the number of publications and numerous studies are available on the diversity of fungi in various ecosystems, including plants, animals, and other living organisms.

Despite the widespread availability of information on the diversity of the fungal communities, the study of the fungal diversity of the present study was limited due to the presence of restricted sampling and an inability to conduct genome-wide analyses. Thus, sequencing of the ITS1 region of the rDNA resulted in a relatively low diversity. However, the ITS1 region of the rDNA and the largest subregion of the rDNA were found to be present in >99% of the fungi examined. This finding raised the question of the phylogenetic origin and the possible importance of ITS1 in the diversity of fungi. The results presented in this study were consistent with the hypothesis that ITS1 is the dominant polyphyletic DNA in the rDNA. A better understanding of the phylogenetic relationship between ITS1 and rDNA is required for the development of new strategies to enhance the biological study of this complex diversity.

The ITS1-RFLP assay (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) was developed to detect and quantify the diversity of fungi in a wide variety of organisms. The assay is based on a characteristic ITS1-based amplification step, followed by a random amplification step. The PCR products are then analyzed using the 28S rDNA. The amplification steps are denoted by A and T, resulting in the following three products: Amplified products (ATP) are further amplified using the Next Generation Sequencing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS-NGS) technique. The main advantages of the NGS-NGS approach are its high sensitivity (95%) and the possibility of identifying many species [4,5].


## Methods

Protein extraction
Protein extracts were obtained from the midguts of the kidneys of . albicans S. cerevisiae by grinding with glass beads in liquid nitrogen, as described previously [27]. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [28]. The isolated proteins were concentrated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The concentrated proteins were solubilized with DMSO and subjected to SDS-PAGE and SDS-PAGE-PAGE analysis to eliminate the unbound proteins, as previously described [28]. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, USA) at 1:2,000 dilution for 1 h. The membranes were washed three times in TBST for 5 min and then with TBST-PBS for 10 min. The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, USA) at 1:2,000 dilution for 1 h. The membranes were then washed three times in TBST for 5 min and then with TBST-PBS for 10 min. The polyclonal anti-pS-dTomato antibody was used at 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times in TBST for 5 min and then with TBST-PBS for 10 min. The blocking antibodies were then combined with polyclonal anti-Rhodamine 123 (Invitrogen, USA) at 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times in TBST for 5 min and then with TBST-PBS for 10 min. The blot was developed by using a Multi-Screen III/Chip Set (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

## Discussion
The enzymatic activity of a compound is determined by the activity of phospholipases, such as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and phospholipase A, as well as by the activity of hydroxylases and phosphatase. In our study, the ability of the compounds to inhibit the pathogen E. faecalis was studied. The inhibition of the enzyme activity by 5FC increased the MIC value for this compound against both E. faecalis strains. In addition, the MIC value of the compound for E. faecalis was higher than that of compounds with the highest MIC value against E. faecalis (1.5 µg/ml). The activity of compounds with the highest MIC value against E. faecalis was previously determined using the enzyme activity of Fks1p in the culture broth of E. faecalis [16]. The MIC value of the compound in the culture broth of E. faecalis was determined as 0.05 µg/ml by using the enzyme activity of Fks1p (E. faecalis) [16].

The results of the antifungal activity assays against E. faecalis strains treated with the compounds were as follows: compound (1), concentration (1), MIC (1.5 µg/ml), MIC_50 (1.5 µg/ml), MIC_90 (1.5 µg/ml), and MIC_100 (1.5 µg/ml). The compounds (2, 3, and 4) were considered to be a more potent inhibitor of E. faecalis than the compounds with the highest MIC value against E. faecalis. The MIC values of compounds (2, 3, and 4) against E. faecalis were lower than that of compounds with the highest MIC value against E. faecalis (0.05 µg/ml). This indicates that the compound (2) is a less potent inhibitor of E. faecalis than the compounds with the highest MIC value against E. faecalis. This may be due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds in E.
