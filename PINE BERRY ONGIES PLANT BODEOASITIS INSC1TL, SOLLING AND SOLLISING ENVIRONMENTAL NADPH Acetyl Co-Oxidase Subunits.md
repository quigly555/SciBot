## Abstract
The Cryptococcus neoformans/Candida albicans species complex, including species of C. neoformans and of C. neoformans/s/e, is a group of commensal or opportunistic pathogens that infect mainly immunocompromised, or seriously ill, immunocompromised patients. The encapsulated fungi are a safe and effective guide for the clinician to manage these difficult patients.

Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of fungal meningitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the prevalence of this organism is low among these patients, mainly AIDS patients who do not present an established immune problem who are morbidly obese, have normal renal function or were treated for advanced disease that fails to respond to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, and who are HIV/AIDS patients who do not present an established immune problem who present an advanced disease that fails to respond to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. Cryptococcus is also a well-known opportunistic pathogen for meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are a significant problem in the hospital environment, where they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. These infections often occur in low- and low-middle-income countries (LMIC) [1, 2]. The incidence of IFDs has increased recently and has been mainly driven by improvements in diagnostic laboratories, which make the diagnosis more feasible and more accurate [3, 4]. Despite the improvement in diagnostic tests, mortality due to IFD remains high, reaching 70% in critically ill patients compared to 30% in the general population [5, 6].

The main risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients is HIV status, which is associated with several clinical presentations, including pulmonary, disseminated, central nervous system (CNS) presentations, central nervous system infections, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [7].


## Methods
oryzae and . musculus. The full set of coding sequences was then assembled in order to form a single large assembly with 1,500,000 reads and an average length of 12,000 bp. A large and highly variable sequence-map was constructed using the Geneious IDEAS software v. 6.8.6 (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand). The assembly was manually inspected and adjusted using Geneious IDEAS. The coding sequences were then aligned using a gene-specific mapping tool (www.tandem.org/tools/genedata/) to identify specific genes or pathways. The gene-specific mapping strategy was used to identify all the genes and pathways in M. musculus. To identify the main gene/pathway pairs of the M. musculus genome, the final set of genes was used. The alignments were then manually inspected and the gene-specific mapping strategy was used to identify the gene-specific genes and pathways of the M. musculus genome.

Gene Ontology Analysis
The genes and pathways of M. musculus, M. sp., and M. nidulans were annotated using the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation tool in the M. musculus genome browser (http://www.geneontology.org/) [49] using default parameters. For M. musculus, GO terms were used for the search for homologs in M. musculus as previously described [15], [50], [51]. The annotation of genes was performed using the C. neoformans H99 reference genome sequence, available at the NCBI (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/).

Annotation of InterProScan Proteins
The gene orthologs of the M. musculus and M. nidulans genes in S. cerevisiae were identified using InterProScan Proteins (http://proteins.ensembl.org/proteins/index.html) [52]. InterProScan Proteins (http://proteins.ensembl.org/proteins/index.html) was used to identify the orthologs of the M. musculus genes in S. cerevisiae, M. nidulans, and M.


## Results
Omp1 is one of the main NADPH biosynthetic genes in the plant, whereas Omp1 is involved in the biosynthesis of both NADPH and NADP (PINE BERRY ONGIES. In this study, we showed that in P. brasiliensis, the three genes involved in the biosynthesis of NADPH and NADP in P. brasiliensis were differentially expressed in the BERRY ONGIES medium. In this study, we found that the three genes involved in the biosynthesis of NADPH and NADP in P. brasiliensis were differentially expressed in PINE BERRY ONGIES medium.

3.3. PHASE-2-TetON Gene Expression Profiling
PHASE-2 is a well-known transcription factor and is a target of several different pharmacological agents. For instance, it regulates the promoter of the P. brasiliensis transcription factor Pbs2, which is expressed during the conidiation process and affects the direction of the conidiation process in P. brasiliensis [46]. Therefore, we found that transcription of PHASE-2-TetON gene was increased in the BERRY ONGIES medium, which is expected to induce the transcription factor-dependent pathway. We found that expression of PHASE-2-TetON gene was decreased in P. brasiliensis under P. brasiliensis-induced conditions, which is consistent with the data obtained by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, we found that the expression of PHASE-2-TetON gene was decreased in P. brasiliensis under P. brasiliensis-induced conditions, which is consistent with the data obtained by RT-qPCR.

3.4. APA-TetON Expression Profile
We found that the expression of APA-TetON gene was increased in the BERRY ONGIES medium, which is expected to induce the transcription factor-dependent pathway. We found that the expression of APA-TetON gene was decreased in P. brasiliensis under P. brasiliensis-induced conditions, which is consistent with the data obtained by RT-qPCR.

## Discussion
In contrast, the gene coding for the novel NADPH oxidase-encoding gene PLASMA was expressed in BMD-independent manners and had no preference for BMD-independent manner.

Therefore, we suggest that the PLASMA gene encodes for the pentose phosphate (P), a member of the pentose phosphate pathway. The P-type ATPase is a non-toxic enzyme involved in the conversion of P to P in the pentose phosphate pathway. The P-type ATPase acts as an activator of acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) and plays an important role in the production of acetyl-CoA (CoA). The P-type ATPase also plays a role in the production of glycolytic enzymes, which are important in the biosynthesis of the major components of the triose phosphate pathway. The high ATP levels in BMD- and BMD-independent manners can be explained by the presence of the active P-type ATPase, which is regulated by the pyrin A transcription factor. In BMD-independent manners, the pyrin A transcription factor controls the expression of PLASMA. Therefore, the plasminogen activator gene encodes for the PLASMA-gene. The gene coding for the novel PLASMA gene was expressed in BMD-dependent manners and had no preference for BMD-dependent manners.

The expression pattern of the PLASMA-gene in BMD-independent manners was similar to the gene coding for the PLASMA-gene in BMD-independent manners, suggesting that the gene encoding the PLASMA-gene in BMD-independent manners is expressed in BMD-independent manners.

The expression of PLASMA was similar to the PLASMA gene in BMD-dependent manners and had no preference for BMD-dependent manners. The expression pattern of the PLASMA was similar to the gene coding for the PLASMA in BMD-dependent manners and had no preference for BMD-dependent manners.
