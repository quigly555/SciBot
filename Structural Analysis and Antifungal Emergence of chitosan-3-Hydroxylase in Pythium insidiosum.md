## Abstract
It is now evident that hygromyalgia (HM) is a chronic inflammatory fibrosis and that it is of growing importance to address clinicians regarding its presence and clinical manifestations. The purpose of this review was to shed some light on the diverse disorders associated with HM and to identify relevant studies that could be considered in the literature.

HM is characterized by chronic inflammatory fibrosis, primary and secondary inflammatory lesions, and relapses which are characterized by disturbances in nutrient balance, energy, immune function, and associated changes in well-being. It is also of growing importance in light of reports of HM in patients suffering from metastatic cancer, diabetes mellitus, HIV/AIDS, pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and autoimmune disorders.

This review focuses on HM and its manifestations, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes. It also highlights the use of complementary and/or advanced treatments that are widely available in clinical practice.


## Introduction
Chitosan is a polymer that contains the polysaccharide mannan, a structural element with structural and biological characteristics similar to chitosan, and it is synthesized by the polymer deacetylation of chitin [18], [19. Chitosan is formed by deacetylation of chitin and chitosan by deacetylation of its carbon monomers [20], [21]. The first enzymes synthesized by fungi were chitinases, and enzymes of higher eutrophic organisms are those responsible for the degradation of chitosan. Chitinases are classified as fungi-like organisms. The first fungal chitinases, chitotriosidase (Cht) and zygomycidases, were first discovered in fungi, and they are found in all phyla of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota [22]. Cht and zygomycidases are also found in the majority of lower eukaryotes and are classified as plant- or animal-derived enzymes. Zygomycetes and Neurospora crassa chitinase are the most important chitinases and the major chitinase in the N. crassa genome [23], [24].

The development of the first chitosanases was driven by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [25]. Chitosan is produced by the cleavage of chitin by chitin synthases (Chs), which catalyze the hydrolysis of the nascent polysaccharide moiety to produce chitosan [26], [27]. Chs contain a catalytic domain called chitin synthase (CHS) that produces chitosan when transformed to the polysaccharide state [28]. The CHS domain is a homodimer consisting of two a and ß subunits, which share a specific sequence, namely, the C-terminal a and ß subunits, and a and ß subunits, which are conserved in humans and animals and share a common structural region, namely, the C-terminal ß-sandwich sequence [29], [30]. While the majority of fungi have a single catalytic and a regulatory domain, in some species (e.g.


## Methods
 1998) in order to obtain a complete description of the fungal cultures, all chitosan-3-hydroxylase was observed in chitosan-3-hydroxylated fungi in order to confirm the presence of chitosan-3-hydroxylase in Pythium expansu. The comparison of the fungal morphological features of Pythium expansum with those of Pythium globosa and Pythium purpureum (Eubauer et al., 1999) confirmed that the characteristic chitosan-3-hydroxylase morph is conserved between the two species. The yeast cultures were cultivated at 28 °C for 7 days in SD (0.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% sodium citrate, 2% dextrose, 0.1% phenol red). The fungal cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000× g for 10 min and washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01% Tween 80, 1.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% phenol red). The number of cells and the number of spores were counted. The samples were inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco) plates (Difco) and incubated at 28 °C. The yeast colonies were counted after 24 h and the number of yeasts was calculated as the number of colony forming units per gram of tissue.

Antifungal Emergence of Chitosan-3-Hydroxylase
The assays were conducted with a Bactec 9-well microplate, with three inocula (0.5, 1, and 2 yeast cells/mL) in 100 µL of RPMI 1640 medium. The test compounds were added to the wells to a final volume of 500 µL and the plates were incubated at 35 °C for 3 days. The test compounds were used at concentrations of 0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 µg/mL.


## Results
In the present study, we found that the activity of the chitin synthase is higher than that of Pythium insidiosum and that this difference is not statistically significant (P < .001) (Figure 3A). Pythium insidiosum is known to possess two or three chitin synthase genes (CPB1, CPB2, CPB3), which are closely related to those of Pythium hemigens (Figure 3A). This observation indicates that this chitin synthase is likely responsible for the high activity of this chitin synthase in Pythium insidiosum.

The antifungal activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum has been previously reported [21]. In our study, we found that the activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum was higher than that of Pythium hemigens, and that this difference is not statistically significant (P < 0.001). The antifungal activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum is consistent with the finding that the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum does not contain a transmembrane domain [22]. The activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum is consistent with the finding that the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum also lacks a transmembrane domain [22].

The Chitin Synthesis of Pythium insidiosum
The chitin synthase activity of Pythium insidiosum was evaluated by the chromatographic absorption spectrum of the extract with and without SDS-PAGE, which is a well-established method for the characterization of chitin synthases. Figure 3B shows that the activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum is higher than that of Pythium hemigens. It also shows that the activity of the chitin synthase of Pythium insidiosum is higher than that of Pythium hemigens.


## Discussion
F-13 is an amoeba-like fungus that was isolated from soil samples collected in North America and Europ. It is an opportunistic fungus that can cause infection of healthy humans, animals, and plants. Pythium has been reported in soil and bird droppings, but only a few studies have been reported on it in this study. The recombinant Pythium sp. F-13, purified from soil of non-target soil samples, exhibited a wide spectrum of growth and was produced in approximately 5 days. Pythium sp. F-13 was able to grow in culture supernatants of DSSD medium and supernatants of DSSD medium with peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound as described previously [25]. Interestingly, only the recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 showed growth in the presence of different media, including a mixture of peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound (Figure 1).

The recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 was purified from soil and bird droppings and was present in supernatants of DSSD medium and supernatants of DSSD medium with peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound as described previously [25]. The recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 showed growth in culture supernatants of DSSD medium and supernatants of DSSD medium with peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound as described previously [25]. These results indicated that the recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 could be used for the production of recombinant, prokaryotic, and fungal-derived, proteins from fungal extracellular vesicles.

Reassuringly, the recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 exhibited higher yields than the recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 in culture supernatants of DSSD medium with peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound as described previously [25]. The recombinant Pythium sp. F-13 was able to grow in culture supernatants of DSSD medium with peptide, phospholipase, and polymeric adenine racemic compound as described previously [25].
