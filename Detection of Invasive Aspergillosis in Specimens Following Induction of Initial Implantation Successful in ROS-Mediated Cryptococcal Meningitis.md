## Abstract
Candida albicans is the most common causative agent of candidiasis. In recent years, it has been shown that it has a great ability to coordinate multiple virulence factors, to become a multi-virulent organism in multiple host species, to evolve virulence strategies on multiple occasions. The ability to coordinate these multiple events and their resultant adaptation to different environments has been demonstrated previously. In this work, the establishment of the genetic architecture of the complex metabolic pathways necessary for adaptation to environmental changes, as well as the use of molecular assays and genome sequencing in silico to explore the detailed regulatory network of this microbe was investigated.

We have identified the candidate gene ( called FKS1 ) encoding a highly conserved lipid-binding transcription factor, which is essential for virulence. We have also analyzed the regulation of this gene in a baculovirus infection model and identified two conserved orthologues in Candida albicans . Both of these genes encode small RNAs that control transcription of genes which are essential for virulence. The first is required for proper induction of the second event and the second for proper induction of the third. The FKS1 orthologues are conserved in viral species Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans. This novel analysis of a conserved region in the FKS1 gene might be useful to better understand the fungal adaptation to diverse environmental conditions.

The FKS1 orthologues are essential for virulence in the filamentous fungi Candida albicans. The first is required for proper induction of the second event. The second is required for proper induction of the third.


## Introduction
Treatment of invasive fungal infections is challenging. Fungal infections can be management by conventional microbiological methods such as hematologic, cytology, microbiology, and culture, or by the use of antifungal drugs such as polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins. However, the use of antifungals is still limited in many cases due to their toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains. Fungal infections are notoriously difficult to treat because of the lack of specific treatment modalities and the emergence of resistant strains. However, a few options are currently available, such as the azoles, which target ergosterol biosynthesis, and the echinocandins, which target cell wall biosynthesis, and the polyenes, which target ÃŸ-1,3-glucan synthase [1-3]. Although these approaches have been successful in treating fungal infections, they have not been applied in systemic infections.

Clinical management of fungal infections depends on a prompt and adequate response to antifungal therapy, with the goal of decreasing fungal burdens to the site of infection, but also improving the clinical outcome.
