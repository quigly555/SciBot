## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is the most common cause of adult meningitis in Africa. A comprehensive review of the literature is needed to determine if there is an expanding role for immune cells in this population.

We prospectively collected data from 121 Cameroonian adults presenting to the examination with clinical symptoms and complications of meningitis and to conduct demographic and risk factors information.

Mean CD4+ T cell counts, CD8+ T cell counts, and the risk factors for death were determined. Data were extracted from charts and case notes. The analysis was based on factors analysis including, age, body mass index (BMI), cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure, and duration of symptoms and signs.

The mean age was 39.5 ±8.6 years, 64% female, and the median CD4+ T cell count was 2250/I. Higher percentage of CD4+ T cell lymphocytes (17.2%) were in the CSF (P < .001) and higher percentage of CD4+ T cell lymphocytes (49.8%) were in the PBMC (P < .001). Forty percent of CD4+ T cells in the CSF were TCR positive.


## Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been used for more than 30 years as a tool for the detection and treatment of bacterial, viral and other microbial infections. However, only a few studies have focused on the antimicrobial efficacy of AMPs. AMPs are synthesized from natural peptides or peptide fragments, called pathogen-derived peptides (PDEs) [1]. Some of the PDEs have a key role in the innate immune response and are known to be effective in reducing bacterial and fungal infections. Several studies have shown that PDEs have direct bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [2], [3]. The antimicrobial efficacy of PDEs depends on several factors including the size of the particle, the size of the resistant bacterial cell, the amount of PDEs isolated and the PDE parent compound [4]. Some studies have demonstrated that PDEs have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against a wide range of targets, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and parasites [5].

The major classes of PDEs, including the hydrophobic class, the hydrophobic class and the hydrophobic peptide class, were first characterized in 1946 by Lebel and Lebel [6]. The hydrophilic PDEs are found in all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasites.


## Methods
At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (200 mg/kg in 200 µl of saline. Thirty-four hours after inoculation, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of xylazine (30 mg/kg in 1 ml of saline) followed by a systemic anesthetic overdose. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h after infection, and the body weight was measured at days 4, 8, and 12 postinoculation.

Endotoxin Levels in Plasma
Endotoxin levels were measured using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, BMG Labtech, Milan, Italy). At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intraperitoneally perfused with 0.5 ml of saline. Lung tissues were excised and weighed and homogenized in saline by an automated cell disruptor (CellSensitrix, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Serial dilutions of homogenate were plated on YPD agar plates and incubated at 30°C for 72 h. After incubation, colony forming units per gram of tissue were counted.

The determination of cell density
To determine the cell density, the lungs were dissected, weighted and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 24 h, in the presence of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS (1:1000). The cell density was determined by a plate reader (Infinite M200, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 570 nm, using a plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 nm and 488 nm, respectively.

Lungs were removed from mice by using aseptic technique and homogenized in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% sodium pyruvate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and stained with 0.5 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St.


## Results
The Tumor Microenvironment was found to be highly variable (mean ± SEM, 7.3 ± 2.8) among the three replicates of the airway, mucosa and blood samples. However, the overall variability in the microenvironment of Aspergillus fumigatus was not high.

The Tumor Microenvironment in the Unexpectedly Transferred a Microorganism of a Rat Using a Seemingly Heterogeneous Microbiota was found to be highly variable (mean ± SEM, 29.7 ± 5.2) among the three replicates of the airway, mucosa and blood samples. However, the overall variability in the microenvironment of Aspergillus fumigatus was not high.

## Discussion
Most patients with fungi-infected lung (69%) had at least one fungal pathogen, or non. These patients had at least one fungal pathogen, or one fungus-tumor pathogen, and these cases were, on average, three times more likely to have an infection with Cryptococcus gattii (14 cases). These patients had a mean age of 63.8 years. Patients with Tumor-associated lymphadenitis had a mean age of 41 years. Patients with disseminated infection had a mean age of 24.5 years.

We found that patients with fungal-related lung diseases had a mean age of 52 years. We also found that patients with fungal-related lung diseases had a mean age of 53 years. We also found that patients with lung diseases had a mean age of 56 years.

We also found that patients with fungal-related lung diseases had a mean age of 57 years. We also found that patients with disseminated infection had a mean age of 63 years.

Our results show that the results of Tumor Profiling are important for diagnosis of fungal-related lung diseases in non-Tumor-host.

A total of 581 fungal-related lung diseases were identified among Tumor-host patients with lung diseases. Of these fungal-related lung diseases, 67 were Tumor-associated. Of these fungal-related lung diseases, 59 (33.6%) were Tumor-associated. Of these fungal-related lung diseases, 59 (33.6%) patients had at least one fungal pathogen, or one fungus-tumor pathogen, and these patients were, on average, three times more likely to have an infection with Cryptococcus gattii (14 cases). These patients had a mean age of 63.8 years.

Our results show that Tumor Profiling Is Important for Diagnosis of Tumor-Associated Lung Disease in Non-Tumor-Host Region of Non-Red-Fungi-Host Regions.
