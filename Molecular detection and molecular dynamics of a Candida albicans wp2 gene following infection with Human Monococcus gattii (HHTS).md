## Abstract
Fungal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with AIDS and other immunocompromised conditions, especially in organ transplant recipients. However, the role of lymphocyte transplant in lymphoid-related fungal infections is not completely understood. We evaluated the role of lymphocyte-related macrophage (LINC) function in the control of Candida albicans infection using murine and HCT-116 monocytes.

Sera from BALB/c mice were infected with C. albicans or control HCT-116 (Candida albicans) using anti-Candida oseltamivir, intravenously immunized mice were then challenged with C. albicans or control HCT-116 (Candida dubliniensis or control Lamivudine or Lamivudine) by intraperitoneal injection. The immune response of mice to C. albicans or control HCT-116 was assessed by the following two parameters: (i) the number of viable Candida colonies injected in the culture supernatants (120 and 250 cells/ ml, respectively) and (ii) the intracellular concentration of Lamivudine, an inhibitor of this macrophage type. Lamivudine immunization success was assessed by colony-forming of Candida yeasts counts and viable Candida counts at different time points of infection.


## Introduction
 2008; Bao et a., 2014). Although these findings provide important insights into the biological properties of this gene, their use in combination with morphological and physiological analysis, combined with the detection of high level of fungal DNA in the sample, has not yet been performed.

Candida albicans wp2 is a major human pathogen of humans, which has been implicated in many infections, including gastrointestinal (e.g., rales and pneumonia), skin infections, and even respiratory (e.g., influenza and pneumonia). Candida albicans wp2 is also associated with systemic infections in patients with chronic respiratory infections (e.g., bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) (Jumpponen and Müller, 2012; Sury et al., 2014). In the context of candidiasis, C. albicans is the most common species involved in mucosal infections (Jumpponen and Müller, 2012; Sury et al., 2014). Although C. albicans is a common microorganism, its clinical relevance has not been fully addressed. In the context of candidiasis, C. albicans is usually implicated as being involved in systemic infections such as invasive candidiasis (IC), an infection that is often associated with high mortality and morbidity rates (Hijri et al., 2008; Hammer et al., 2013). In the context of these infections, C. albicans is also implicated as being associated with both mucocutaneous and invasive infections (for review see Hammer et al., 2012). However, the underlying mechanism of the association between C. albicans wp2 and the lung epithelial barrier function remains to be fully elucidated.

In this study, we investigated the potential of C. albicans wp2 in mediating mucocutaneous and invasive candidiasis, which may contribute to the better outcome of C. albicans infections in the patients. C. albicans is a facultative intracellular pathogen, which can persist in the lung for long periods. C. albicans has been implicated in the progression of IC and other invasive fungal infections, including mucormycosis (Burgess et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2012), invasive aspergillosis (Sury et al., 2014), and mucormycosis (Burgess et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2014).


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
Two strains of C. albicans (serotype A, MATa) and two strains of C. dubliniensis (MATa, H99) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The ATCC strains were maintained in the Agropymp Laboratory (Centre d’Ecole Nationale, Marcy l’Etoile, France) at 30°C for filamentation and 24 h at 37°C in darkness. The ATCC strains were cultured on solid MM (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.67% glucose, 1.0% peptone, 1.0% yeast extract, 0.0372 M MOPS, pH 7.0) with or without 1% glucose.

The C. albicans strains were maintained on solid MM plates (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.67% glucose, 1.0% peptone, 1.0% yeast extract, 0.0372 M MOPS, pH 7.0) at 30°C for filamentation and 24 h at 37°C in darkness. The fungal mycelium was collected and kept on nutrient agar slants (50 mL) at 37°C in darkness. The mycelium was gently mixed and transferred to a sterile glass vial. The agar vial was removed, the vial contents were mixed with sterile 0.45 mm diameter glass beads, and the contents were extracted with 10 mL of 10% (v/v) sterile sodium carbonate for 15 min. The vial was washed three times with sterile distilled water and then placed in a sterile vial containing 50 mL of nutrient broth (200 mg/mL).


## Results
However, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the environment of the host may be responsible for the low frequency of Candida infections, which in turn might account for the high mortality rate of . albicans during infection. To check this hypothesis, Candida strains were inoculated with H. pylori, the fungal model of fungal infection, and survival rates were compared to the WT (Figure 3). In the survival data, the survival rate of the Candida strains was significantly decreased (p<0.05) (Figure 3). In addition, the percentage of fungi in the non-infected controls was significantly higher than that of the infected Candida strains (Figure 3). This finding suggests that the fungal infection induced by H. pylori may be an important virulence factor for C. albicans, as well as the host.

In addition, the S. cerevisiae genome harbors a highly conserved operon for the ABC transporter in S. pombe (Lu et al., 2014). The ABC transporter family is widely conserved in yeast and is found in the fungal genome (Rao et al., 2004; Fan et al., 2005). The fungal ABC transporter operon in S. pombe is located in the ERG11 and ERG14 genes, respectively. In the H. pylori-infected control, the ERG11 and ERG14 genes were present in the same operon, which indicates that the ABC transporter operon is likely present in the S. pombe genome. These results suggest that the H. pylori infection may have altered the expression of ABC transporter operons in C. albicans, in particular the ABC transporter operon.

H. pylori infection alters the expression of ABC transporter genes in C. albicans

ABC transporters are involved in pathogenesis and virulence (Hughes et al., 2008; Beilharz et al., 2014). In addition to their roles in fungal pathogenesis, ABC transporters are also important in innate immunity (Kruskal-Wallis et al., 2010). In addition to their function in innate immunity, ABC transporters play important roles in pathogenesis in various fungi (Hignson et al., 2007; Broome et al., 2010). For instance, the ABC transporter family has been shown to be involved in the regulation of pathogenesis in C.


## Discussion
The present study represents the first report of the disease caused by M. restricta in a dog. The patient was a 19-year-old man with acute otitis media and developed a new type of fever on admission. M. restricta infection has been described in dogs with severe otitis media. M. restricta infection has been reported in dogs with neutropenia and in dogs with septic meningitis [18, 19]. In one case of mixed infection in dogs, the infection was diagnosed in one dog [20].

The pathogenic mechanism of infection by M. restricta is thought to be two-fold.
