## Abstract
Chitin is a major polysaccharide component of fungal cell walls and cell membranes. Chitosan, as an added layer, is essential for cell signaling, morphological switch, and signal transduction processes. Chitosan may regulate cell signaling through the regulation of oxidation-reduction processes, ion channel modulation, and signaling pathways. Chitosan biosynthesis, an essential cellular function, and its biosynthetic pathway are central to all fungal virulence processes. To gain insight into the mechanisms of chitosan biosynthesis, we identified the non-canonical mevalonate end product of the chitin pathway, chitosin C1 (C1). This monomeric sugar is essential for many processes including cell adhesion, cell adhesion/filamentation, as well as adhesion/coagulation, cell wall assembly, and many other important cellular processes. C1 is also a structural contributor to virulence of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani. C1’s mevalonate domains are conserved from bacteria to humans, and their absence in A. fumigatus likely contributes to the dual role of chitosan biosynthesis and virulence. In contrast, the chitin-coupled receptor C2 (ChaR) that is conserved in the human pathogen A. fumigatus, is a key factor in A. fumigatus pathogenesis and virulence. C2’s absence in A. fumigatus likely contributes to the dual role of chitosan biosynthesis and virulence. In contrast, the chitosan-coupled receptor C3 (C3) that is conserved in the A. fumigatus pathogenesis and virulence strains is a key factor for the human pathogen A. fumigatus. C2’s absence in A. fumigatus, likely attributable to other drug-induced defects, probably contributed to the upregulation of several key enzymes of chitosan biosynthesis, including dsR2, a homologue of the enzyme chitin deacetylase (ChdaN).


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection caused by the yeast-to-mycelium (m) transition of C. neoformans. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Several studies have suggested that the immune response is essential for the clearance of C. neoformans from the lungs. ^1-3 In the context of the central nervous system, it has been reported that there are several factors that determine the outcome of this infection, such as the availability of an adequate supply of nutrients, an impaired immune response, and the presence of a co-infectious process. ^1-3 Although the role of the immune system in the response to C. neoformans infection is well established, its role in the control of cryptococcosis remains poorly explored.

Neutrophils are the first line of defense in the host against cryptococcosis.


## Methods

A recent review of the literature indicated that the use of antimicrobial compounds has been very successful in eradicating filamentous fungi [27, 29. The antimicrobial effect of compounds in the current study was a promising one as they have been tested in different concentrations (5 µM, 1.25 µM, and 2.5 µM) and no antimicrobial side effects were seen [30, 31].

In addition, antimicrobial activities of compounds are often recognized as an indicator of the protection of plant material from antifungal agents [31]. In this study, we compared antimicrobial activity of cyanobacteria compounds against the antimicrobial activity of green algae. The antimicrobial activity of green algae is attributed to the yellow-green color of cyanobacteria [32, 33].

5.4. Bacterial Strains
The most common pathogenic bacteria of the studied species was Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis [34, 35]. The use of antibiotics in antibacterial activity was indicated as in [26]. The antibacterial activity of antibiotics against a wide range of bacterial strains was also noted in the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic-susceptible bacteria [36].

5.5. Antimicrobial Activity of Cyanobacteria
The antimicrobial activity of cyanobacteria was also shown by the method of Avanti (2,4-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) chloride (ABTC) method [36, 37]. Avanti (2,4-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) chloride (ABTC) is a colorimetric compound, which decreases the temperature of aqueous solutions of formic acid and dehydrates the precipitated material, thus reducing the pH of the solution [38]. The initial reaction of ABTC with bacterial solution of formic acid and dehydrating the precipitate gave a very good antibacterial activity [38].

5.6. Antimicrobial Activity of Cyanobacteria
The antibacterial activity of cyanobacteria was also demonstrated by the method of Biphasimova (2,4-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) chloride (BAPC) method [39].


## Results

The compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of different bacteria, including . subtilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. fumigatus, in the mouse liver and spleen, as well as the ability to inhibit the growth of the fungal species, including Candida spp., C. albicans, and A. fumigatus. For this purpose, we designed the compounds to be tested against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. fumigatus using the MICs (Table 1).

The MICs were determined for the compounds in the MMV of the mouse liver, spleen, and spleen. As shown in Table 2, the compound 1 did not show any activity against the fungi. The activity was higher in the MMV of the mouse liver, spleen, and spleen, which suggests the activity of the compound against fungi.

2.2. Antimicrobial Mechanism of MMV
In order to investigate the mechanism of action of MMV against the fungi, the MICs of the compounds were determined. The concentrations of MMV are found to be very low in the mouse liver, spleen, and spleen, and higher in the mouse kidney, which suggest the action of the compound against fungi. However, we have previously reported that MMV can act against the yeast and filamentous fungi of the order Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19]. In the mouse kidney, the concentration of MMV was significantly higher than that of the other tested drugs, which indicates the fungicidal action of MMV against the fungi.

2.3. Molecular Characterization of Compounds
The purified MMV were subjected to chemical mutagenesis to confirm the antifungal activities of the compounds. The results showed that all the compounds were active against the tested fungi (Table 3).

## Discussion
 2008. However, we were unable to identify any antimicrobial compound from Trichosporon species from the environment.

In our study, we found that a significant number of bacteria were colonized by the opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The species was recovered from the soil sample of one hospital. The microbial communities were similar to those of the environment (p > 0.05). The microbial community composition of the soil samples was very similar to the ones of the environment (p > 0.05). All bacteria except one were associated with the opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous agent causing oral candidiasis, as well as invasive fungal infections in humans (Cantrell et al., 2014). The clinical relevance of Cryptococcus neoformans infection is still unclear, but the presence of this fungus in the environment is of concern.

Interestingly, the genus Aspergillus was also found in the soil samples of two different hospitals. The clinical relevance of this genus is still unclear. A previous study by Hernández et al. (2015) found the genus Aspergillus was found in the environment. This genus is widely distributed in the environment, and this study revealed that this genus was present in all the soil samples of the two hospitals. These results are in line with previous studies that have also identified the genus Aspergillus as a possible pathogenic genus in the environment (Hernández et al., 2015). However, the lack of these results from our study suggests that the environmental strains in our study were not representative of the strains of this genus.

On the other hand, the genus Cryptococcus was found in all the soil samples of the two hospitals. The ecological relevance of Cryptococcus is still unclear. The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans was found in the environment of two hospital branches. This fungus is an opportunistic fungus and it is the causal agent of cryptococcosis (Holland et al., 2009). Cryptococcus gattii was found in the environment of one hospital branch.
