## Abstract
The introduction of anti-Toll syndrome drugs has led to a large number of infections with hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) among patients coming to the United States from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela. Hepatitis B and C virus were the main viruses associated with liver abscesses. hepatitis B and C virus are the most frequently isolated viruses, especially HCV. Hepatitis B and C virus are the most frequently isolated viruses in people coming to the United States from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela. Hepatitis C virus is the most frequently isolated virus, especially HCV. Hepatitis E virus is the most frequently isolated virus, especially HCV. HIV and hepatitis E virus are the main viruses associated with liver abscesses. hepatitis E virus is the most frequently isolated virus in people coming to the United States from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela.


## Introduction
. Duan et al. 2005; Jansons et al. 2009; Jansons et al. 2012; Ngamskulrungroj et al. 2013; Choudhary et al. 2014; Lass-Flörl et al. 2014; Bao et al. 2015; Banerjee et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015), a heterogeneous group of pathogenic protozoan parasites, is further supported by their host-specific kinetochores and their immunological capabilities.

The fungal kinetochores are formed by the action of a “signal” transduction, which binds the electromagnetic radiation generated by the histone H2A-H2A-Ribonucleotide binding protein Ssn5 (H2A-Rbp1) (Yin et al. 2009; Chaudhary et al. 2014). The H2A-Rbp1 signals are transmitted by the receptor WC-1, which is a serine proteinase belonging to the family of G proteins (Jansons et al. 2010). The Ssn5-regulated kinetochores are a family of small G proteins that are involved in the immunological processes and defense mechanisms against pathogens (Wu et al. 2004; Roux et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2016). The H2A-Rbp1 signal is transmitted by the WC-1 protein by the induction of the heat shock transcription factor WC-1 (Hiraysen et al. 2011; Yue et al. 2014). The h-URA-Rbp1 protein is expressed as a transcription factor in the primary human h-URA-Rbp1 strain and in the secondary human h-URA-Rbp1 mutant, which results in the death of the h-URA-Rbp1 strain. The death of h-URA-Rbp1 induces the expression of other genes and results in cell death phenotypes (Jinz et al. 2010; Yin et al. 2014).


## Methods
The new species of the species was isolated from Toxoplasma gondii, and the genome of this species is available in GenBan. The GenBank accession numbers of the new species are as follows: S. gondii, ATCC MYA-7581.

DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing
The DNA was isolated and purified as described previously [22] and the sequences of the primers used in this study are as follows: S. gondii SgD (5'-GCATTTCTCCGTGACCTCG-3') and SgD (5'-GGAGCAGCAAGATGTCTCCCC-3').

Fungal strains, strains, and plasmids
The cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit for small RNA (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit for large RNA (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each library was prepared in triplicate using TruSeq's ZymoBIOMICS Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The RNA libraries were prepared using the First Strand cDNA Library Prep Kit (Fermentas, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The nLC_fw and nLC_scRNAs libraries were prepared using the nLC_free and nLC_scan libraries, respectively.

## Results
cerevisiae . pombe S. pombe Sph1 promotes asexual sporangium formation, catheterization, and the formation of a niche, suggesting a link between S. pombe S. pombe Sph1 and the S. pombe pathogenicity domain. This is the first report of a S. pombe Sph1 gene, which was present in the S. pombe genome but absent in S. pombe [16].

Our in silico study revealed that the Sph1 of S. pombe is highly conserved and is highly similar to the S. pombe Sph2 of S. cerevisiae. S. pombe Sph1 is predicted to contain a conserved domain (CYC_06568) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figure 1A). The Sph1 domain of S. pombe Sph2 is similar to the S. pombe Sph3 of S. cerevisiae, and also has a conserved domain (CYC_06313) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figure 1A). The Sph2 domain of S. pombe Sph2 is highly conserved and is similar to the S. pombe Sph2 of S. cerevisiae, but has a conserved domain (CYC_06572) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figure 1A). The Sph3 domain of S. pombe Sph3 is similar to the S. pombe Sph2 of S. cerevisiae, but has a conserved domain (CYC_04378) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figure 1A). The Sph4 domain of S. pombe Sph4 is similar to the S. pombe Sph3 of S. cerevisiae, but has a conserved domain (CYC_06205) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figure 1A).

Sph4 domain of S. pombe Sph4 has similar domain architecture to S. pombe Sph2, with the Sph4 domain of S. pombe Sph3 of S. cerevisiae being similar in structure and organization.


## Discussion
glabrata biofilms by searching for changes in the expression of genes related to biofilm formation and filamentation in a mammalian model of infection revealed genes that play a role in biofilm formatio. An additional role in filamentation was found in C. glabrata (CGL) and C. albicans (GLa) using a conditional analysis of transcription by RNA-seq [39]. The C. glabrata homologs of CGL, GLa and GLb are among the most conserved in the fungal kingdom [40]. A previous study in C. glabrata showed that C. glabrata also contained a conserved transcription factor for biofilm formation [41]. The analysis of the C. glabrata genome revealed multiple genes involved in biofilm formation and was found to be upregulated in response to external signals. This is consistent with the idea that biofilm formation by C. glabrata is regulated by environmental cues, as well as via distinct genes that are controlled by the environment [40]. The importance of environmental cues for biofilm formation is supported by our finding that the C. glabrata genome contains a high proportion of genes involved in biofilm formation. Furthermore, C. glabrata showed genes involved in filamentation and other cell wall-degrading processes (CGB) and in the ability to form and aggregate conidia in vivo.

Our results indicate that C. glabrata plays an important role in regulating fungal growth in the active Tumor microenvironment. However, the role of C. glabrata in regulating the fungal community structure needs to be further examined in a broader range of fungal species.

Further studies are needed to determine the functions of the fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes, enzymes involved in the formation of the cell wall, and genes involved in the degradation of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although most fungal species are saprophytic, these fungi are also able to survive in the presence of host-derived drugs. This could be because many fungal pathogens can survive in the extracellular environment of mammalian hosts and thereby provide an alternative carbon source for growth. However, the role of fungi in providing the host carbon for the fungus has been discussed by others [42,43].
