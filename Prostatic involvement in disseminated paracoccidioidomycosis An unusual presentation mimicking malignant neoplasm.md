## Abstract
Oleaginous fungi can utilize a wide variety of carbon sources for energy, but the biochemical composition of their carbon skeletons remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a bioinducible cellulose sugar binding motif to demonstrate that carbon sources are dominant in the oleaginous fungus Cystobium smegmatis, an economically important fungus. We show that this motif is necessary for cellular uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) after stimulation with O-acetylated CO2, and that disruption of the DC metabolism resulted in significant increases in CO2 uptake and down-regulation of the fungal cell wall. Our data suggest that CO2 is necessary for the yeast to survive within DCs, which are critical for fungal pathogenicity. This work provides a new way of understanding how oleaginous fungi use CO2 for energy generation, and provides a powerful tool to discover new drug targets.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is the most common presentation of central nervous system (CNS) infections, with over 620,000 cases globally and over 10,000 cases globally in the United States alone [1]. Currently, there are only 13 antifungal agents available for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis [2], [3]. Antifungal therapy in HIV patients is relatively lengthy and requires a high level of drug resistance. However, antifungal agents have now been extensively used for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in resource-limited settings [4], [5], [6], [7]. In addition, many antifungal agents are available as intravenous (IV) therapy for patients with CM, which is considered a superior therapy due to the reduced incidence of drug-resistant fungal infections and ease of administration [8]. However, the emergence of drug-resistant fungal infections is increasing due to the “Trojan horse” syndrome of amphotericin-B-mediated cryptococcal-e.d-symptomatic patients, which allows the development of drug-resistant cryptococcal infections without the need of amphotericin-B, and the emergence of newer antifungal agents, such as azoles [9]. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of antifungals is essential to improve the effectiveness of current antifungal agents, especially the newer antifungals, in the management of fungal infections.

The mechanism of action of antifungals is summarized in Table 1.

Antifungals act by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This interaction leads to the formation of a toxic lipid complex, which inhibits the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme lanosterol-14a-demethylase, thereby reducing the permeability of the cell membrane. This phenomenon is referred to as lipid permissiveness. Furthermore, the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis results in cell death. The cell membrane is the main target for antifungal drugs, and thus, ergosterol is one of the most important molecules inhibiting the ergosterol biosynthesis. This phenomenon is called the “Golem effect” and is generally associated with the inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme 14a-demethylase.


## Methods
This phenomenon is caused by a hyphal infection, or by the mycobiont syndrome, which is caused by a single hyphae embedded in the phagocytosed yeas.

In the murine model of systemic mycosis, we studied a mouse model of systemic mycosis using five clinical isolates of cryptococcal meningitis (C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C. neoformans).

A mouse model of systemic mycosis was established by inoculating mice with C. albicans (200 mg/kg) or C. glabrata (200 mg/kg) in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth, which is used for the maintenance of the immune system [26].

C. albicans and C. glabrata were isolated from patients with systemic mycosis and confirmed as C. albicans or C. glabrata by diagnostic PCR using the universal primers V3/4 and V4/6. Cryptococcal cells were isolated from blood samples by direct colony growth in BHI broth. V3 and V4 PCR products were cloned in the pGEM-T vector and then purified by using a T7 RNA-Seq Kit (Promega). The purified PCR product was subjected to the DNA sequencing approach and the C. albicans or C. glabrata was subjected to the PCR approach. The purified PCR product was subjected to the digestion and quality control steps using the M-MLV (New England Biolabs). The quality of the purified PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and by running it on a 1% agarose gel. The purified PCR product was applied to a 1% agarose gel and then gel-purified by using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was subjected to the DNA sequencing approach and the C. glabrata was subjected to the PCR approach. The purified PCR product was subjected to the digestion and quality control steps using the M-MLV (New England Biolabs).


## Results
It is possible that the immunogenic CSF sample might have been collected by nonimmune immune infiltrating bloo. It is possible that the CSF sample might be contaminated by CSF immune infiltrating bacteria. The role of Th1 cells in a noninflammatory neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neoplasmosis is controversial. In this context, the requirement of Th1 cells in a noninflammatory neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neutropenic neoplasmosis is a novel possibility.


## Discussion

Correlating with chronic inflammatory diseases in the setting of chronic inflammation may be an interesting avenue for future investigatio. In the current case, the patient presented with chronic gastritis and gastritis was followed up for 1-2 years. In addition, renal failure was observed in both cases, and he had a history of diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an autoimmune disease presenting as chronic pancreatitis.

Pancreatic diseases are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with the abovementioned autoimmune disease. However, in the present case, the patient was not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or had a history of diabetes. It has been suggested that this patient may have suffered from malignant neoplasm and systemic infection. However, as the patient was a smoker, the patient was not considered to have diabetes.

Our patient had a history of cancer, with three cases of kidney cancer occurring in the past two years. This case highlights the potential for systemic infection to develop in the face of chronic pancreatitis.

The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs for four months and then he was started on steroids for four months. At this point, he developed severe gastritis, gastritis, and lymphadenitis, which included the most common pancreatic granulomatous tumor. These patients have been reported to have a history of diabetes mellitus and multiple malignant neoplasms, and these diseases are not uncommon in this patient. The patient's physical appearance was not typical for pancreatitis, and was considered to have a well-defined tumor with no infiltrating necrosis factor (Nrf) and inflammatory factors (IL-6 and Th2-like cytokines). The patient also had lymphadenopathy and no evidence of liver damage. The patient's presentation was typical for gastric cancer and lymphadenitis. The patient's disease progressed slowly and was very difficult to manage. In addition, there were no positive tests to diagnose pancreatic cancer. The patient's clinical condition was characterized by fever, neck stiffness, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Although there was no evidence of cancer, it was suspected that this patient had pancreatic cancer.

The patient had a history of pancreatitis and reported that the patient had a history of diabetes. This case highlights the potential for systemic infection to develop in the face of chronic pancreatitis, which has been reported in the literature.
