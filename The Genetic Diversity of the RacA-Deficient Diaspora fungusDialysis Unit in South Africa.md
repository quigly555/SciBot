## Abstract
We present a patient with HIV infection, who had epiphytic polycythemiafta treated with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB). We discuss the significance of L-AmB and its adverse effects and safety factors and recommend treatment with benzampizumab. This is the first case of HIV-associated liposomal amphotericin B-induced epiphytic polycythemiafta in a patient with HIV infection. We also review the literature on antimycotic drug-induced epiphytic polycythemiafta.


## Introduction
The number of neonates is increasing, and neonatal mortality is increasing disproportionally with the growing population of immunosuppressed infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established the National Neonatal Nosocomial Organization (NDO) to advise the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on neonatal hospital care. The CDC also provides guidelines on neonatal infectious disease management. CDC also provides resources to pediatric infectious diseases, such as pediatric idiopathic inflammatory syndrome (CIN), to counsel the patient on early management of this infection. CDC is an online-based resource to facilitate a timely, accurate and timely diagnosis of infectious diseases in both adults and children worldwide.

## Methods
Yeast strains and culture conditions
Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) media at 30°C and harvested at the indicated time points. The cell-free culture supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and stored at -20°C until use.

Taxonomy
Rhizoctonia is a genus of fast-growing, filamentous and rarely septate, two-celled, conidial forming a rare character of the genus. Phylogenetic inference of this taxon proved that it represents a novel species in this taxon.

## Discussion
Based on the structural similarity between the Diaspora sp. with their phylogenetic tree, the genetic diversity of Diaspora has been estimated to be 12-20% in the case of these two species, which are closely related to each other. Genetic diversity of Diaspora has been estimated to be 18-31% in the case of D. destructans, which is higher than the theoretical maximum of 19.5%. However, the large genetic variation in these two species makes it unlikely that they are genetically identical, and it is also possible that their differences in the DNA sequences of the genes they encode are linked by a DNA-binding protein.

However, the most likely explanation for the relatively high genetic diversity of Diaspora spp. in the present study is that their divergence occurred before the divergence of these two species, which may have resulted from the loss of their respective genomes. The high genetic diversity of Diaspora spp. may be due to a large number of genes (e.g. the paralogous gene cluster in D. destructans), gene duplication events, and the increase in genomic diversity over time. However, the vast majority of genes are likely to be either lost in D. destructans or duplicated in D. sclerotiorum, which is in agreement with previous findings [37].

The analyses of the data provided further support that the genetic diversity of Diaspora is relatively low and that the more divergent species in this group may be due to genetic recombination or recombination within the Diaspora genome. In addition, the sequence divergence between the two Diaspora species within the Diaspora genome is consistent with previous findings in other fungal groups [7], [38].

The genetic diversity of Diaspora spp. may be due to the relatively high genetic recombination rates that occur among these species. However, the genetic recombination rates in these two species are not significantly different, and recombination has occurred before the divergence of D. sclerotiorum and D. sanguineus. The evolutionary history of the three Diaspora species in South Africa suggests that the evolution of the Diaspora spp. in the evolution of Diaspora spp. in South Africa is very recent, and that these two species may be genetically closely related to each other.

In conclusion, the genetic diversity of the Diaspora spp.
