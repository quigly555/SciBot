## Abstract
Plant fungal pathogens are causing a great global food security crisis, with potentially devastating consequences for crop production and human health. The fungal cell wall is a structural defense system against the myriad of organisms that can enter and disseminate across the plant tissues, causing damage that can be devastating to plant health. The cell walls of plants are highly structured and highly resilient to stress, and often protect the plant against pathogens that the plant produces. Studies of fungal cell walls have been largely performed using culture-based approaches. The significance of such studies has been considerable, and several studies reported that the fungal cell walls were involved in cell wall maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown and many studies reported that the cell walls were not fully understood. This lack of knowledge is particularly concerning for the ways in which the cell walls function and are maintained during the interaction of fungal pathogens with plants. This review will discuss the mechanisms of the different fungal cell walls and how they are maintained throughout the interaction of fungal pathogens with plants.


## Introduction
Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by dimorphic fungi in the genus Chromobacter. It is commonly caused by polymorphic yeast in the environmental reservoirs such as soil and pigeon droppings. Under certain conditions, such as in the lungs, fungal cells can differentiate into hyphae which can invade and invade the epithelium and invade the respiratory tract. The growth rate of yeast cells in the respiratory tract is highly dependent on oxygen availability. In the respiratory tract, the first step in the development of fungal pathogen infections is the germination of yeast cells into the hyphal form. Once the hyphal form has been generated, it can exit the host organism. The hyphal form can be re-isolated and cause infection of the lung tissue.


## Methods
The pPPC-5' UTR was isolated by treating the pPC-5' UTR with NAT and cloned into pPPC-5' UT. This construct was then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 (S1 Table). The transformants were selected on YPD medium supplemented with nourseothricin (100 µg/ml) and incubated at 30°C. Single-stranded DNA was purified using NucleoSpin^TM (Macherey-Nagel) and was subjected to sequencing with a BigDye^® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and an ABI Prism BigDye^® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies). The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Expression and purification of recombinant pPPC-5' UTR
For plasmid propagation, the pPPC-5' UTR was amplified by PCR using the primers pPPC-5'-F (5'-TCCGTGTTCTCCGACACG-3') and pPC-5'-R (5'-CCAGTGTGTTCCCCAGTCC-3') [32] and the pPPC-5' UTR was amplified by PCR using the primers pPPC-5'-F and pPC-5'-R. The resulting product was purified by PCR and ligated to pPPC-5' UTR. The PCR product was transformed into E. coli strain DH10B (DE3) to generate strain E-pPC-5' UTR (S1 Table). The transformants were selected on YPD medium supplemented with nourseothricin (100 µg/ml). The recombinant plasmid pPC-5'UTR was purified by Ni-NTA agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into E. coli strain LB101 (DE3) to generate strain E-pPC-5UTR (S1 Table). The recombinant plasmid pPC-5UTR was purified by Ni-NTA agarose gel electrophoresis and then transformed into E.


## Results
cerevisiae, the Cdc7/Cdc11 gene is a transmembrane protein that is homologous to the . albicans Cdc1/Cdc9 gene, which is a member of the ATPase-dependent ATP-citre transmembrane protein family [4, 5]. Therefore, the Cdc7/Cdc11 gene is expected to be involved in the Cdc1/Cdc9 transmembrane network in C. albicans. The C. albicans Cdc1/Cdc9 transmembrane protein has been shown to be essential for full virulence and as a target for antifungal drug agents [4, 5].

In S. cerevisiae, the Cdc7/Cdc11 gene is known to be required for full virulence and as a target for antifungal drug drugs [4, 5]. The Cdc7/Cdc11 gene was found to be essential for full virulence in a study of the wild type (WT) strain and the cdc3<U+0394> mutant. However, the cdc7<U+0394> mutant was avirulent in a murine inhalation model of cryptococcosis [5]. The cdc3<U+0394> mutant was also avirulent in the murine model of cryptococcosis, but did not cause any clinical signs and symptoms after challenge with the cdc3<U+0394> mutant. However, the cdc3<U+0394> mutant was avirulent in a mouse model of cryptococcosis [5].

To identify which of the two transmembrane proteins is responsible for the cdc7/cdc11 mutation in C. albicans, the Cdc7/Cdc11 gene was cloned from the cdc3<U+0394> mutant and expressed from the cdc3<U+0394> mutant. As shown in Figure 4A, cdc3<U+0394> mutant was avirulent in a murine model of cryptococcosis.


## Discussion
The immunophenotype of . neoformans is variable in different immunological conditions and this phenotypic switch in this organism can lead to increased susceptibility to infection and the development of lethal infections [29].

C. neoformans is a member of the phylum Ascomycota, and the species in this group are usually considered to be ascomycetous [30]. C. neoformans is considered to be ascomycetous, with an average of approximately seven copies per genome [31]. The number of C. neoformans strains has been estimated at 12,000 in the USA [32], and in a recent population study the number was estimated at 10,000 in Australia [33]. The strain KUCF has a worldwide distribution and is most frequently isolated from patients with hematological malignancies and those with AIDS [34]. In our case, we did not have any evidence of this strain in her brain, but we could not exclude that it might have been acquired from the environment, which is an uncommon finding in this setting.

The causative agent of cryptococcosis is Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. The organism is a member of the order Cryptococcus neoformans and is a common cause of cryptococcosis in humans. There is a very low prevalence in this population [35]. There is a high correlation between the frequency of travel, the use of intravenous drugs and the presence of immunocompromised states such as those in this case.

The organism has been known to cause a broad spectrum of disease in humans. A majority of cases of cryptococcosis are caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii [36]. Other species of the order Cryptococcus have been associated with several respiratory infections such as pneumonia and histoplasmosis [37], as well as lung and skin infections [38].

Cryptococcus can be acquired by inhalation of aerosols from aerosols, inhalation of aerosols or inhalation of soil. Cryptococcus can cause a variety of symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, altered mental status, vomiting, seizures, and neck stiffness. Cryptococcus is usually associated with respiratory infections, with the most common infection being pneumonia.
