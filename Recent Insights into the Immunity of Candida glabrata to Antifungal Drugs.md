## Abstract
In the past few years, Candida albicans has been increasingly associated with opportunistic infections, particularly of the life-threatening life-threatening opportunistic yeast, Candida krusei. This yeast is especially lethal in immunocompromised patients with AIDS or other immunodeficiency states. Existing antifungal drugs targeting this yeast have several limitations, including their low efficacy and high toxicity. The use of alternative therapeutic strategies for C. albicans infections is limited by the high toxicity of this species, especially to sensitive and commensal Candida species. This review provides an overview of the current options, as well as some of the key antifungal drugs and molecules targeting this yeast. The current state of the art in antifungal drug discovery and development makes it a no-no, but we are also able to provide a solid foundation for future research into the development of antifungal drug combinations with other antifungal drugs targeting this yeast. In addition, we describe the development of an efficient, yet inexpensive, strategy for targeting this yeast. Finally, we discuss and highlight novel approaches to treat fungal infections.


## Introduction
Infectious diseases and organ transplantations are important causes of mortality among immunocompromised patients and poor patients with chronic diseases. As a result, a large number of patients without comorbidities die without their patientsâ€™ knowledge or consent. The most vulnerable organs are the kidneys, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and skin [1]. The incidence of infection in organ transplant recipients is still very low. However, immunocompromised patients can develop severe complications and death rates due to infection, especially in renal transplant recipients [2,3,4]. The majority of these patients are poor patients with renal disease and lack of other risk factors [5]. The causative agents of infection in organ transplant recipients are diverse and include infections by Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida parapsilosis.

Candida albicans is a normal commensal organism and the most common cause of fungal infection in humans. This organism is found on the skin and in the oral and vaginal mucosa. The most common species isolated from the oral cavity belong to the Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. In the oral cavity, Candida albicans accounts for over 90% of all these infections, with Candida tropicalis being the most prevalent species. Other non-albicans species, such as Candida albicans and Candida krusei, can also cause infections in immunocompromised patients. Infections caused by non-albicans species can cause a serious disease, which can affect the nervous system, skin, bones, joints, or even the central nervous system, and rarely affects the central nervous system of animals. Non-albicans Candida species account for less than 1% of all candidiasis cases in patients with HIV/AIDS [6].

Candida albicans can cause opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients in many countries, including West Africa, in Western Europe and in Brazil. Among the HIV/AIDS patients, the highest incidence is found in the USA (13.6%) [7].


## Methods
.1, 5.2.1, and 7.3.2.1, respectively). The three-compartmental approach, which uses information of the population and the antifungal drug to predict the effects of a drug-drug interaction, is also useful for identifying possible drug interactions with different Candida species (5.3.1, 7.3.1, and 7.3.1.2, respectively).

For this analysis, we used a two-compartmental approach to define the effects of a drug-drug interaction on the immunity of Candida glabrata. The two-compartmental approach is applicable to the assumption of negative selection, since the effect of a drug-drug interaction on the effect of a drug-drug interaction depends on its interaction with the effect of a drug. In addition, we also studied the effects of a drug-drug interaction with the effect of a drug-drug interaction in a different Candida species (6.2.1, 7.3.1, and 7.3.1.2, respectively). All these approaches were performed with the input data (Supplementary Data Sheet S1, Table S1). In this analysis, we used the data obtained from the two-compartmental approach as the input for the dual-compartmental approach (5.2.1, 7.3.1, and 7.3.1.2, respectively).

Analysis of the Protection of Aspirants from Dried Candida Glabrata
The susceptibility of the selected fungi from dried Candida glabrata was analyzed by two-compartmental methods, which is applied to the assumption of negative selection, and the effect of a drug-drug interaction on the effect of a drug-drug interaction. The method used for this analysis has been described previously (4). The inocula of the selected fungi from dried Candida glabrata were prepared by inoculating a small quantity of fresh Candida glabrata on the surface of a mixture of Sabouraud's dextrose (SD) broth and glacial acetic acid (G-AC) agar.


## Results
Antifungal drugs, including fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole, and amphotericin B-2, were used as the positive controls in this stud. In the Candida glabrata interaction, antifungal drugs were used as negative controls, except fluconazole and amphotericin B-2.

The interactions of Candida glabrata and fluconazole were investigated in both drug-free and drug-free culture mediums (Fig 3). Fluconazole-treated Candida glabrata-infected mice displayed a higher fungal burden in the lungs (Fig 4), which was also observed in the lung (Fig 5). Fluconazole-treated Candida glabrata-infected mice displayed a similar pattern of colonization (Fig 6).

The interaction of Candida glabrata and fluconazole is considered to be a novel antifungal agent. As the fluconazole-treated Candida glabrata-infected mice presented a higher fungal burden in the lung, we also tested the fluconazole-treated Candida glabrata-infected mice. The results showed that fluconazole-treated Candida glabrata-infected mice were more resistant to fluconazole than fluconazole-treated controls (Fig 7).

We also investigated the interactions of Candida glabrata and fluconazole using the two different cell line lines. Candida glabrata was used as a positive control in this study, and fluconazole was used as a negative control.

In order to better understand the interactions between Candida glabrata and antifungal drugs, the interaction between Candida glabrata and antifungal drugs was also investigated using a cytotoxic assay. As shown in Fig 8, the Candida glabrata-infected mice showed a much higher level of T_H1 than the fluconazole-treated control group.


## Discussion
Interestingly, this phenomenon has been associated with the innate immunity to fung. In a mouse model, macrophages were used to express Th1 and Th17 responses, respectively (36). In this study, the anti-Candida antibody against IL-4Ra-D69 produced in vitro potent anti-Candida glabrata phagocytosis by human macrophages, resulting in enhanced fungal killing in the lungs of mice. Although the mechanism underlying this potent innate response is still unclear, the enhancement of anti-Candida phagocytosis in the lungs of mice infected with C. glabrata can be related to the Th1 and Th17 immune response (36). In addition, the Th17 response, as well as the protective immunity, also contributes to the innate immune response to Candida glabrata (36).

The primary goal of this study was to identify novel antifungal drugs that could inhibit the fungal growth and killing in the human immunodeficient mouse model. To this end, we have evaluated the efficacy of antifungal drugs against C. glabrata by using a combination of drugs. Our data demonstrate that amphotericin B, a class of fluconazole, was effective in inhibiting the fungal growth and killing of C. glabrata in vitro, resulting in significantly reduced fungal burden in the lungs of mice. In addition, we observed that the antifungal drug, fluconazole, was more potent in inhibiting C. glabrata growth and killing of C. glabrata in vitro. These data suggest that the antifungal drug combination might be an effective alternative strategy for C. glabrata infections.

The current study was designed to address the question of whether antifungal drugs could be used as an alternative strategy for C. glabrata infections. The antifungal drugs were tested against C. glabrata by combining the drug with fluconazole. The antifungal drugs showed potent antifungal activity in combination with fluconazole, demonstrating that fluconazole and amphotericin B could be combined to treat C. glabrata infections. The antifungal drugs were also tested against C.
