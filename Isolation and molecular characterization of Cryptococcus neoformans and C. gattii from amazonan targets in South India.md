## Abstract
The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased dramatically in recent decades. Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the leading fungal pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality. It has a high resistance to a variety of antifungal drugs including amphotericin B, atazanavir, caspofungin, and is the second most frequently prescribed azole drug in the United States. A high level of evidence is available to suggest that IFIs occur more frequently in A. fumigatus than in A. orophilis and are mainly caused by opportunistic infections. The current study focuses on the epidemiology, genetics, and antifungal susceptibilities of A. fumigatus to four azoles commonly used in the antifungal treatment regimens, amphotericin B, echinocandin, isoflazan-1, and azoles such as, echinocandin, and fluconazole. The data are compelling for both elucidating the etiology and antifungal resistance in A. fumigatus, and for identifying areas for future research.


## Introduction
The fungus Candida albicans is a commensal of the skin and mouthparts, which can cause skin and nail infections in healthy individuals. However, in immunocompromised individuals, C. albicans can cause life-threatening systemic infections, such as invasive candidiasis. In patients with low immunity, invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening complication that can be fatal if not treated [1]. The most common antifungal agents used to treat C. albicans infections are azoles and polyenes, and a number of other classes of antifungal agents [2,3]. However, despite some attempts to develop antifungal agents based on echinocandins, such as caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, many of these agents are still limited in the clinical applications, especially in the first-line of antifungal therapy, which often does not have an appropriate safety profile and in some cases, are associated with serious side effects [4,5,6].

C. albicans is found in the extracellular environment in a variety of cell types and morphologies, including the cell wall, the cell wall architecture, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex and dynamic structure that includes a protein complex and a lipid complex [7,8]. The ECM plays an important role in the interaction of Candida spp. with the host, and it is the most abundant microbial component in the ECM, comprising more than 20% of the total ECM content [7,9,10]. Furthermore, Candida spp.


## Methods
fumigatus isolates were isolated from amazonan coated glassware used at the University of the South (Ustilagin) Chandigarh department in Chennai (South India. The isolates were identified as C. gattii (CgA-CgA) and C. neoformans (Cneoformans) based on the morphological features of the fungus. The amazonan-coated glassware was washed with 20% sterile water to remove the aqueous phase. The glassware was dried over night at room temperature (around 200 rpm) and then the isolates were isolated by direct microscopy and the morphology of the basidia was examined by a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera and a Nikon DS-Qi5 fluorescent microscope.

Cryptococcus neoformans isolates were purified from amazonan coated glassware using the method described by Singh et al. [37] with slight modifications. A. fumigatus isolates were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE-based medium and the optical density was measured at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer. The purified isolates were then purified using the method described by Zhang et al. [38] with slight modifications.

For purification of amazonan-coated glassware, the isolate C. gattii (CgA-CgA) was inoculated into 1 × TAE-based medium and incubated at room temperature for 48 hours. A. fumigatus and C. gattii were then purified using the same procedure and the isolates were then purified by subculture on 1 × TAE-based medium containing 1 × TAE-acetic acid. This procedure was repeated three times. The purified amazonan-coated glassware was then used for micro-analysis.

Amazonan-coated glassware micro-analysis
Micro-electrochemical analysis was performed according to the method described by Bains et al. [39]. Briefly, C. gattii (CgA-CgA) was suspended in 1 × TAE-acid-acetic acid solution and the extracts were mixed on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h.


## Results
gattii crystal structure showed that the amazonan binding site of . gattii CNAG_01353 is composed of a small non-covalent (NS) and a large non-covalent (WA) (Fig 1A) (Fig 1B). The putative binding sites of the C. gattii CNAG_01353 are located within a domain of type I N-terminal and a domain of type II (NS) and type III (WA) N-terminal regions (Fig 1C). The domains of type I N-terminal regions and the domain of type II (NS) N-terminal regions have been shown to be highly conserved in C. gattii and Cryptococcus genomes [20]. The topology of the C. gattii crystal structure with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1D) and CNAG_01353 (Fig 1E) is shown in Fig 1. The C. gattii crystal structure with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1D) shows a typical C. gattii structure with the typical RCA crystal structure of a typical C. gattii crystal. The molecular weight of the C. gattii crystal is ~22 kDa. The crystal structure of C. gattii crystal with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1E) is similar to the crystal structure of the other strains. The molecular weight of the C. gattii crystal with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1E) is ~34 kDa. The C. gattii crystal with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1E) is similar to the crystal structure of C. neoformans and C. gattii. The molecular weight of the C. gattii crystal with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1F) is ~36 kDa. The crystal structure of C. neoformans and C. gattii crystal structures with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1G) are similar to the crystal structures of the other strains. The molecular weight of the C. gattii crystal with the CNAG_01353 (Fig 1G) is ~42 kDa. The C.


## Discussion
gattii, and . albicans were isolated from amazonan (8), while C. neoformans and C. albicans were not (3). The observed association between amazonan and C. albicans suggests that the yeast is a viable member of the human host, which is in agreement with the earlier findings of several studies (8, 11). This suggests that the fungus may be an opportunistic pathogen in the HIV-infected population and that C. albicans could be a viable pathogen in patients with HIV infection, but not in those without HIV infection (8, 11).

Fungal infections are a complex entity that includes infections with unknown etiologies, as well as those caused by opportunistic pathogens, such as C. neoformans and C. gattii (8, 11). Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are the most prevalent species in South India (8, 11), which is in agreement with previous findings from India (8) and other Asian countries (8). C. gattii was identified in India in 2004 (8), but no reports have been reported in other regions, such as the United States and Indonesia (8, 11). C. gattii was isolated in South Africa in 2009, but no reports have been reported in other regions, such as India (8). It has been reported that the incidence of cryptococcosis in South India is about 5-8% (8).

In this study, we showed that Cryptococcus neoformans and C. albicans are the most common isolates in HIV-infected patients, and C. albicans was the most frequent species in HIV-infected patients (Table 1). It has been reported that C. albicans is a possible opportunistic pathogen in patients with HIV infection (8). In HIV-infected patients, C. albicans is the predominant species, with a frequency of 10-20% (8). In our study, the occurrence of C. albicans in HIV-infected patients was 2.6% (Table 1).

We observed that C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species from patients with HIV infection, but the frequency of C. albicans in the HIV-infected patients was not statistically significant (Table 1). C.
