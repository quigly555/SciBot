## Abstract
This study investigated the occurrence and microbiological diversity of spore-related bacteria in three Antarctic locations and their interactions with human epithelia. Microbial community analysis was performed using the ISHAM M2776 Live-Soil Complex (ML-7) partitioning analysis. The results showed that spore-related bacteria were prevalent in all samples and were most frequently isolated from human epithelia. In addition, a high percentage of bacteria were isolated and colonized human epidermis. Moreover, a high percentage of yeasts were isolated and colonized both the human epidermis and the partner epithelia. The presence of many phenotypic classes, such as dendritic cells, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and IL-12, together with the increased frequencies of these classes in recently infected patients, indicated that these microorganisms may contribute to the development of several diseases in humans.


## Introduction
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening infection that has been increasing worldwide in recent years. The pathogen is a mold found in the air, soil, water, and in the environment. It is caused by inhalation of conidia from the warm-blooded animals. These can be found in moist environments such as dishwashers, catheters, and dishwashers. IA can also be caused by other mold species, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium species. The most frequent agents are inhalation and are associated with different respiratory diseases including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. The spectrum of these diseases is diverse, and some diseases can be associated with severe respiratory complications [9]. A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients, including those with hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT), solid organ transplant (SOT), and other hematologic diseases. The most common A.


## Methods
This risk has been assessed and summarized in Table .

C. albicans strains from the era of modern biocatalysts, C. albicans ATCC 90030, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. tropicalis ATCC 90028, C. albicans SC5314, C. dubliniensis ATCC 90028, C. parapsilosis ATCC 90028, C. tropicalis ATCC 22019, and C. glabrata ATCC 90028 were identified using PCR-RFLP (Applied Biosystems). For each strain, two samples were tested in triplicate, and the results were analyzed using the SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The biofilm formation was assessed using a modified method described by Köppen et al. [27] and its efficiency in assaying the biofilm diameter was also assessed using the Microbiology Reference Laboratory (www.microbiologylab.org). The biofilm diameter was defined as the diameter of the biofilm surrounding the biofilm and as a percentage of the total biofilm. A negative control was included in all tests, which showed no detectable biofilm by SPSS.

The efficacy of the antibacterial and antifungal drugs in combination was also assessed using the blood and urine cultures [28]. The efficacy of the antifungal drugs in combination was also assessed using the blood culture and serum from healthy volunteers [29]. The efficacy of the antibacterial and antifungal drugs in combination was also assessed using the blood and urine cultures, which showed no detectable biofilm by SPSS.

3.4. Phaseing-Phase Analysis of the Effect of Drugs on the Phase-Time Changes of the Virulence of Mice
A series of two successive phase-changes experiments were conducted. The first phase consisted in the administration of 2-3 µg/mL of both fluconazole and voriconazole in combination with the other drugs. The second phase consisted in the administration of either fluconazole and voriconazole only. The animals were monitored and sacrificed at least once a day in order to evaluate the survival rate.


## Results
Because of the importance of the GI tract in the colonization of microorganisms, we investigated the importance of the gut microbiota in environmental pathogen. We inoculated mice with the 4-week-old gut-targeting strain SC5314 and subsequently monitored the colonization of the gut by ex vivo real-time PCR.

Using the genotype of each strain to calculate the probability of successfully colonizing a human gut sample was performed using an “nationally” method. If the same strain was randomly selected from a multicenter study, we would expect to observe a larger number of strains in the gut of the same strain. Using the American Indian strain Y-1 strain from the University of Washington, we found that a total of eight strains were detected in the Y-1 gut (Table 2). In addition, each strain was isolated from a different animal. To detect a single strain, we identified strains in the Y-1 gut from blood, urine, stool, and oral rinse. We found that 12 strains were not identified by the microarrays (data not shown). The first strain in this group, the Y-1 strain, was isolated from a male (Al-Hatmi et al., 2012). The second strain, the Y-1 strain, was isolated from a female (Al-Hatmi et al., 2012). Finally, the third strain, the Y-1 strain, was isolated from a female (Al-Hatmi et al., 2012). Taken together, the results indicate that the number of strains in the Y-1 gut is relatively small. However, these results also indicate that a large number of strains can colonize a human gut sample.

Mating-type-1 (MST-1) and MST-2 (MST-2a) strains are usually found in the Y-1 gut, but they are not always found in the Y-1 gut. We found that the number of strains in the Y-1 gut varies. In the Y-1 gut, the most common strains were identified by using the ITS region of the rpb2 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the 18S rRNA gene. However, in the Y-1 gut, the strains in the Y-1 gut were more frequently isolated from blood, urine, and feces.


## Discussion
The genus Cryptococcus contains species that can be found in different environments and are known to inhabit different niches. Cryptococcus neoformans has been isolated from water, soil, plants, and other habitats, and may be found as a single individual or as part of multiple species. Cryptococcus gattii, which has been isolated from soil, wood, and plant debris, has been identified as a member of the genus Cryptococcus, and may be associated with different environmental niches, such as plant roots, leaf litter, and the saprophytic environment of soil (Yegidi et al., 2005; Dauter and Jacobson, 2006; Nelson et al., 2007; O’Meara et al., 2008). In addition, the fungus can be recovered from other habitats such as the rhizosphere, the vagina, and water (Nelson et al., 2007). We have previously reported Cryptococcus sp. on the surface of plant litter, but the fungus was not identified on the surface of the soil, thus suggesting that it may be another potentially pathogenic species (Kim et al., 2005). The genus Cryptococcus includes numerous pathogenic species that cause disease on various plant species, including Cryptococcus sp. and Sporothrix sp. (Schaet et al., 2006). Most of these species are important agricultural pests and human pathogens, but the fungus has been previously detected in compost and other biological waste (Klengel et al., 2009). We believe that the fungus and its surrounding environment are a potential source of new genetic diversity in the Cryptococcus genus.

The genus Cryptococcus is composed of saprotrophic, saprotrophic, and pathogenic species that are found in various habitats, including the plants of the genus Cryptococcus, such as C.
