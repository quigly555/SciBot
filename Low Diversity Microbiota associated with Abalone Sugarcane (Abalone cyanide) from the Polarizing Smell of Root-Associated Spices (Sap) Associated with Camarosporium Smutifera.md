## Abstract
This is the first report of an unusual occurrence in the genus Ophiostomatomycetes, which occurs in the environment. These rare and species-defining fungi are associated with the decay of medicinal plants in the central part of the Atacama Desert (Ard) of the South Sandwhar West region of South Africa. The study revealed the existence of a complex microbial community within a sandstone structure and described the structure as to be an 'obietture chamber. Described were: the genus Ophiostomatomycetes, including Ophiostoma, Ophiostomroma, O. lunata, O. minutis and O. untrimenyta, and the genera Cladophialophora, Pseudoma, Pseudoma-Leotiomyceta, Cladophialophora, Viridiplantae and Synnemella. Among the fungal species, the genus Pseudomancera was most predominant in total membership. The community was dominated by members of both phyla and sub-genomes. Of the Pezizomycotina, Ophiostoma and Cladophialophora were the most abundant, representing 95% of the bacterial phyla. Comparison of the fungal community also revealed the most abundant fungal genera, including Cladophialophora, Ophiostoma and Cladophialophora, representing 95% of the fungal genera, respectively.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly in critically ill patients [1]. In this setting, amphotericin B (AMB) is the drug of choice for treatment of these infections, particularly as salvage treatment [2]. However, AMB is toxic, has limited bioavailability, and has a high cost. AMB is often associated with severe renal toxicity and cardiac toxicity [3]. In addition, AMB has a high propensity to develop resistance, which can be difficult to overcome by azoles, which are often used as prophylactic drugs [4].

The echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) are the most widely used antifungal agents for the treatment of IFI. These agents inhibit fungal cell wall synthesis and thus inhibit fungal growth [5]. AMB is an important drug in the development of novel azole drugs, but the emergence of resistance to echinocandins and resistance to caspofungin has been seen in several fungal species [6-8].

To treat IFI, development of novel agents with low toxicity and pharmacokinetics are urgently needed. Current antifungals are highly active against azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. [9]. However, resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B is increasing. In this context, our group has previously reported a high frequency of resistance to amphotericin B and echinocandin-resistant C. albicans [10].

We therefore investigated the potential of the echinocandin class (e.g., the echinocandin-resistant A. fumigatus) to reduce the toxicity of AMB in patients with renal toxicity.

First, we assessed the echinocandin-resistant C.


## Methods
In this species, root-associated Spices were based on the relationship of root-associated Spices with root-associated Spices (Cuhly & Laetzer, 2010; Berke & Winkler, 2015; Kluwe et a., 2016). Roots were treated with an acid solution of pH 5.5 (8 mM), shaken for 24 h and then filtered to remove root-associated Spices and Acacia. The filtered root-associated Spices were removed by filtering the filtered root-associated Spices from the root-associated Spices (Cuhly & Laetzer, 2015). The filter-filtered Root-associated Spices were then lyophilized to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and used for the study.

To examine the effect of K_i on the localization of K_i on Mayocarpus, roots were treated with pH 5.5 K_i and the K_i concentration was kept at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. K_i concentrations were maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. To evaluate the effect of K_i on the localization of K_i on Mayocarpus, roots were treated with pH 5.5 K_i and the K_i concentration was kept at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. K_i concentrations were maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h.

After the treatments, K_i concentration was kept at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. The active site (k) of Mayocarpus was characterized with the following observation: (a) K_i concentration was maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. K_i concentration was maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. (b) K_i concentration was maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. (c) K_i concentration was maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h. (d) K_i concentration was maintained at 0.8 mg/ml for 24 h.


## Results

As shown in the figure 2C, the fungal community of the Malus indica leaf inoculated with . aureus was highly enriched with all three morphological classes of fungi. Malus indica (Malus indica) and Camarosporium smutifera (Camarosporium smutifera) (Figure 2B) are more similar than the other two species, and it is not surprising that the latter is less different from S. aureus. However, the two Malus indica species are different from S. aureus, and the two Camarosporium smutifera species are more similar from the other two species, and the two Malus indica species are more similar from the other two species.

The abundant presence of the morphological classes of fungal community in the Malus indica seedlings inoculated with S. aureus suggests that the two Malus indica species are closer than the other two species. As shown in the figure 2D, the fungal community of the Malus indica seedlings inoculated with S. aureus was similar to that of the other two species, and the fungal community of the Camarosporium smutifera seedlings inoculated with S. aureus was similar to that of the other two species. However, the fungal community of the Malus indica seedlings inoculated with S. aureus was different from that of the other two species. The species from the Malus indica species were more similar from the species from the Camarosporium species than from the other two species.

The association of different fungal morphological classes with each other indicates that the two Malus indica species are more closely related to each other than to the other two Malus indica species. The Malus indica species are more similar to the other two Malus indica species than to the other two Malus indica species. The Camarosporium species are more similar to the other two Camarosporium species than to the other two Camarosporium species.

## Discussion
The genus Pucciniomyces was introduced by White [62] to accommodate Pucciniomycetes, which are monophily distributed genera in the Euryarchaea (Basidiomycota) clad. The morphological characteristics of Pucciniomyces were also confirmed by its conidial and conidial cell morphology.

The genus Alpinus was introduced by White [62], a member of the class Alpinoidae, which are cosmopolitan among Alpinoidomycetes, and which includes several species of species such as Tritichum and Tritichum bicolor. Alpinoidomycetes are composed of many species, and although their molecular phylogenetic studies are not yet available, Alpinoidomycetes can be divided into two subfamilies, the A. oryzae-A. niger and A. terrestris-A. sylvaticus, and the A. oryzae-A. sylvaticus-A. niger subfamily. These two subfamilies are well-characterized, and the taxonomic classification of the A. oryzae-A. niger and A. terrestris-A. niger subfamilies will be the subject of future studies.

The genus Alpinus (Alpinomyces) was introduced by White [62], and the family is distinguished by its conidial and conidial cell morphology. This genus is a monophyletic group of A. bicolor and A. niger, which is a member of the Alpinoidae clade, and it contains several species, such as Alpinus velutipes and Alpinus spinosa, and it is also associated with Pezizomyces (Coleoptera). Alpinoidomycetes are also well-established and many species in this group are well-known, such as Alpinus sitchensus and Alpinus bicolor, which is associated with Eucalyptus (Coleoptera) and Dioszegia (Coleoptera) [63].
