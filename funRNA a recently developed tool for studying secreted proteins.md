## Abstract
In this study, we evaluated the activity of a polyphenol pellet extract (PEP) from Pichia pastoris (PG) against the tested yeasts. The effect of PEP on the viability of yeasts was studied by viability assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was measured using a fluorogenic rabbit mycelium. The extract induced d- and g-proteome release from the yeasts by inhibiting the expression of the genes (including COX3 and DAF-1) of the ÃŸ-glucan metabolic pathway. A decrease in the intracellular levels of sterol (i.e., glucans, glucosylceramides, and fatty acids) was observed.


## Introduction
Among them, phospholipase C is the most important enzym. In addition to the number of amino acids, the secretome of most proteins is characterized by the presence of complex and conserved phospholipids. These complex phospholipids are highly conserved within the small and large subunits of ATP-binding proteins.

The mechanism of protein secretion is remarkably complex. Some proteins are secreted in extracellular ways, e.g., chaperones, for example, the secretory proteins that enter the secretory pathway are mostly produced by chaperones and are transported to the cell membrane (Sucher et al., 2007). Chaperones are relatively small proteins containing a common shape (called secretory domain) and are composed of a (1-3) amino acid residues. The cleavage of the secretory domain initiates the secretion of a variety of secreted proteins. The cleavage of the secretory domain is crucial to the transport of secreted proteins from the cell membrane to the cytosol, for example, the secretion of secreted chaperones by the secretory vesicles to the Golgi (Vitti et al., 2010). The cleavage of the secretory domain is also important for the secretion of proteins that have a membrane (lysosome) motif and are not present in the cell membrane. The secretory domain has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of some viruses such as influenza A (Morton et al., 2002) and mycobacteria (Chan et al., 2005). In addition, the secretory domain is also involved in mycobacterial cell adhesion, for example, secretion of molecules that cross the cell wall (Sucher et al., 2007).

A recent study suggests that the secretory domain is involved in the transport of a large number of proteins, including RNA, that enter the cell. The authors suggest that a protein with a secretory domain, such as the RNA-binding protein (RBP), is required for the transport of small RNAs, including micro RNAs (miRNAs), from un-coding genes, which have a small binding area and are able to bind microRNAs (Pineau et al., 2010).


## Methods
Genome sequences, assembly, and annotation
The genome of T. harzianum was used in the study of the construction of the genome of T. harzianum. The genome was deposited in NCBI GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under the accession number AZ797413.

The T. harzianum genome was assembled, edited, and assembled using ALLPATHS version 2.3.6. The assembly of the genome of T. harzianum was done using ALLPATHS version 2.3.6. The sequences of the annotated genes were selected and compared with those of T. harzianum using BLASTP. The protein domain sequences of T. harzianum were predicted using a web based analysis tool.

The gene models of T. harzianum were predicted using the TOPO database (http://www.topo.org/) and the NCBI protein databases. The gene models of T. harzianum were predicted using the NAMD database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nr/).

Genome annotation
The protein domain sequences of T. harzianum were predicted using the TransProScan database.

Genome annotation was performed using the Protein Mask Generator (http://pmaskgenerator.org/) with the DNA and protein structure data from the genome of T. harzianum.

Genome annotation was performed using the TransProScan database.

## Results
The RNA-seq data showed an average of .9 and 4.5 times higher number of reads in the transcriptome of A. fumigatus ATCC 12090 compared to the control samples, respectively (P < 0.05). The PAML analysis revealed a significant difference in the total number of reads between the control and the RNA-seq samples. The total number of reads obtained from the control samples was 4.3 times higher than the RNA-seq results (P < 0.05). The PAML results showed that the total number of reads in the control samples was significantly higher than the RNA-seq results.

## Discussion
albicans serotype A strain on mating and infection in a yeast-like strai. The C. albicans strain was originally isolated from a soil sample and demonstrated the ability to infect plant roots, which was later shown to be associated with virulence [33]. The current study provides important information regarding the possible involvement of the C. albicans strain in virulence. As with any new approach to investigate the role of C. albicans in pathogenicity, this study will provide valuable insights into the C. albicans serotype A strain. In addition, we also showed that the C. albicans strain can infect rice plants and produce hyphae in rice leaves. These results are in agreement with previous findings [34], which suggested that the C. albicans strain was able to invade and colonize rice plants.

The C. albicans serotype A strain was isolated from soil samples of different ages, and was used to study the infection mechanisms of rice plants. In addition, the C. albicans serotype B strain was isolated from soil samples of different ages, and was used to study the infection mechanisms of rice plants. Our results showed that the C. albicans strain was able to infect rice plants. The results of the present study indicate that the C. albicans strain is able to infect rice plants, and can be used as a basis for the development of a novel infection strategy in rice plants. The C. albicans strain was also used as a host for a strain of C. neoformans, which was used as a host for a strain of C. gattii, which was used for host specific mating and infection strategies in rice plants [35].
