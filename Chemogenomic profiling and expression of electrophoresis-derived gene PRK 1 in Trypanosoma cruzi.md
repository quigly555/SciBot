## Abstract
The major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida glabrata, has been receiving an increasing number of novel chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we report the discovery of a new class of antifungal drugs that target the key virulence factor - CYP51A-5, the major virulence factor of C. glabrata - CYP51B-5, and its derivative, CYP51D-5. The antifungal drug fluconazole (FLC) binds to and directly inhibits CYP51A-5, but not CYP51B-5, and therefore inhibits fluconazole-mediated iron acquisition from FLC. FLC binds to and directly inhibits CYP51A-5, but not CYP51B-5, in vitro. We report that FLC also inhibits in vivo virulence and survival of C. glabrata in a mouse model of systemic infection. The antifungal activity of FLC in vivo, and the role of CYP51A-5 in virulence, is described.

Candida glabrata is the main fungal pathogen that causes invasive candidiasis. The fungus is found in almost all types of human and animal tissues and in the blood of infected infected patients. It has several life-threatening diseases, including pulmonary infections, granulomatous and umbilical derived cancer, and malignant transformation disorders. It has been used as a model host to study the effect of different antifungal drugs on the pathogen. The antifungal activity of FLC, a member of CYP51A-5, was investigated.


## Introduction
The emergence of drug resistant microorganisms such as those caused by pathogenic fungi and bacteria has risen to a significant concern [1]. This increase in resistance to antifungal drugs is a significant and growing problem. A review by Oriel and Kolter [2] describes the research efforts to develop and implement such drugs in the clinical trials of antifungal agents, providing a mechanism for the rational design of drug molecules.

The main problem of resistant fungi to antifungal drugs is due to the fact that the available antifungal agents are limited and do not present a sufficient level of bioavailability. Thus, the treatment of fungal infections has been limited to the point where the available antifungal agents are limited to a limited extent [3]. This limitation is due to the fact that many fungal species can cause death in humans. The main fungal pathogens are Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans, which are the most common cause of fungal meningoencephalitis and account for over 80% of fungal infections in the world [4,5]. Although C. albicans is the most common causative agent of human fungal infections [6], it is also present in the environment and may cause a clinical challenge in hospital settings. Thus, the main reason for the limited and still significant treatment of fungal infections is related to the presence of these fungi.


## Methods
Expression levels of PRK 1 were calculated using the formula: <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1, <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1, <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1, <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1 and <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK. The expression values of PRK1 were calculated using the formula: <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1, <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1, <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1 and <U+0394>PRK1-calcd for PRK1.

4.5. Construction of PDC-derived HBMECs
The C. albicans strain expressing the PRK1 gene was used as a wild-type control in the experiments. In the experiments, the C. albicans strain expressing the PRK1 gene was used as a phagocytosed control in the experiments. The pDC-derived HBMECs were constructed according to the protocol described by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) [41]. Briefly, pDC-derived HBMECs were generated by plating 2 × 10^6 cells from overnight grown C. albicans cells in DMEM medium. The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO_2. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of PBS. The cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h. The cells were lysed by sonication and the number of viable cells was counted. The pDC-derived HBMECs were expressed in J774A.1 macrophages. The cells were cultured in a 96-well plate at 37 °C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h.


## Results
To study the expression of these virulence factors, we performed confocal microscopy (CLM) to observe the distribution of the fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm of Trypanosoma cruzi and the WT and mutant strains (Fig 2A and B. We found that the double mutant exhibited a significant increase in the expression of the cytoplasmic protein of the F. graminearum virulence factor FK506 (Fig 2A). The increase in the expression of the FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig 2C). The FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA is an important member of the PKA pathway, which can be activated by the activation of the PKA/MAPK pathway (28). We next investigated the expression of FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA and the FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA in the double mutant. We found that the double mutant exhibited increased expression of the FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA, compared to the wild type, in comparison to the WT and mutant strains (Fig 2D). In the presence of the FK506 inhibitor FK506-G, we found that the expression of FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA increased in the WT and mutant strains, compared to the WT and mutant strains (Fig 2D). In contrast, in the absence of FK506 inhibitor, the expression of FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA decreased, compared to the WT and mutant strains, in the WT and mutant strains (Fig 2D). These results suggest that the FK506-binding enzyme FK506-FKGA may be involved in the expression of FKg, FKg-FKGA, FKg-MAPK and FKg-MAPK in F. graminearum.


## Discussion

The major genomic regions in the Trichomonas vaginalis genome include ITS1, LSU, and TEF1, the nuclear localization of Trichomonas vaginalis genes are similar to the nuclear localization of the yeast TEF1 gene of the yeast Ustilago maydis, and the nuclear localization of the putative . cruzi genes is similar to the putative T. brucei gene of the rice blast fungus S. cerevisiae [17]. In addition, the T. cruzi genome contains a large number of genes encoding a variety of peptides and proteins. The T. cruzi genome contains a large number of genes encoding proteins for nucleic acid and cell surface penetration and cytokines, among others. The T. cruzi genome has a total of 921 genes, representing 1.5% of the T. cruzi genome. This genome size and diversity of the T. cruzi genome make it an attractive target for the development of new antifungal drugs.

The T. cruzi genome encodes 387 genes (Table 1), of which the average of 921 genes is 4.6% (Table S1). This is slightly lower than that found for the fungal genome [15], but still comparable to that reported for fungi in the fungal kingdom [17]. The T. cruzi genome also contains genes involved in metabolic pathways, including respiration, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and cell wall degradation. These genes were up-regulated during the development of the T. cruzi genome, while genes involved in the production of metabolites were down-regulated.

The T. cruzi genome encodes 12 genes involved in secondary metabolism. The total number of genes encoding these genes was 1,820, representing 1.3% of the T. cruzi genome. This is slightly lower than that found for the fungal genome, which encodes about 0.8% of the T. cruzi genome. The T. cruzi genome also contains a gene encoding a glycerol-cysteine-threonine-peptidase (GE6B6), which is involved in glycerol biosynthesis and the biosynthesis of cell wall glycerol [17]. The T.
