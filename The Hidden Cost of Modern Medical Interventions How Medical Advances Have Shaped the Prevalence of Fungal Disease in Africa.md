## Abstract
We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Cryptococcus in two urban wards in Kenya. We collected specimens of yeast and tested for cryptococcal antigenemia using a lateral flow immunodeficient (LFI) broth microdissection sample, which was then analyzed by a conventional analytical method. We also compared yeast and C. neoformans isolates in the same patient population. A total of 182 isolates were obtained from blood, 148 from skin, 173 from the respiratory tract, 58 from the vaginal tract, 71 from the gastrointestinal tract, and 17 from the CNS. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated mainly from the CNS, mainly from the lungs, mainly from the liver, and most commonly from the hands and the liver transplantation site (PKI). The commonest isolation was from the hands and the liver transplantation site (PKI), where the median time interval (T6) for the most common C. neoformans isolates was 49 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11-131 days). The proportion of cryptococcal antigenemia was significantly higher in the hands and the liver (27% vs. 22%, p < 0.0001).

Cryptococcus neoformans was more common in hands of immunocompetent patients (28% vs. 27%, p = 0.0184) and from the hands of immunocompromised patients (27% vs. 20%, p = 0.0192). Higher proportions of cryptococcal antigenemia were obtained in the hands of immunocompromised patients compared to the elderly (63% vs. 22%, p = 0.0051). The prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia was higher in the hands of the CNS (60% vs. 20%, p = 0.0111) and liver (50% vs. 19%, p = 0.0174) in patients with cryptococcal antigenemia. These findings support the concept that the prevalence of cryptococcal infection in the CNS is associated with the age and sex of the infecting organism and can be mediated by a variety of underlying diseases.


## Introduction
 (PLOS Genetics)
With the U.S. in the grips with the Ebola pandemic, there is a compelling medical need to harness the power and untapped potential of advanced technologies in the clinical setting to improve care. The Ebola response in Africa has been studied from the point of view of how Ebola impacts on the immune system and the role of the immune system in its response. The current state of knowledge of Ebola in Africa is staggering, but we are only beginning to understand how this disease emerged as a human disease. The diseases that have emerged in the wake of the African continent's dispersion include Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and zoonotic encephalitis (ZEN) [3-6]. Herpes Simplex Virus is a heterogeneous virus that infects both humans and animals, most often in the form of zoonoses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis, respectively [7]. Herpes Simplex Virus was first identified in 1969 as a potential human disease, later named Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) in 1976 [8]. Later that year, a case was reported in Uganda [9]. Since then, a series of highly contagious, highly contagious and highly infectious diseases, including the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in the Americas [10], the Ebola virus disease in Nigeria, and the recent outbreak in West Africa [11], have become increasingly prevalent. The Herpes Simplex Virus is not only a human disease, but it has been associated with a wide range of diseases, including neuro-ophthalmic pulmonary virus (PNPV), toxoplasmic encephalitis, primary pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (KS) encephalitis, and polycythemia vera (PV) encephalitis [12].

The clinical manifestations of Ebola virus disease include fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, and it is often associated with the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well as cranial nerves. The clinical manifestations of Ebola virus disease depend on many factors, including the infectious organism, the patient’s age, the duration of the illness, and the CNS as well as the patient’s viral infection [13-15]. The central nervous system (CNS) is an important organ that has a central role in the normal immune function of the brain.


## Methods
We estimated the actual number of cases (out of a total of 534,000) from the actual case definitio. We used a proportion of cases that are the same size as the actual case. We calculated the cumulative number of cases per year in each country. For each year, we calculated the cumulative number of cases per year in the four countries in each country. We calculated the cumulative number of cases per year in the five countries in each country. We calculated the cumulative number of cases per year in the five countries in each country. The total number of cases per year in the four countries in each country is given in Table 1. We calculated the cumulative number of cases per year in the five countries in each country by dividing the cumulative number of cases per year in the four countries by the total number of total cases.

The total number of cases per year in the four countries in each country is given in Table 2. We used a non-linear approach to estimate the prevalence of fungi in Africa. We assumed that the prevalence of fungi in Africa is not affected by the availability of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based interventions. We used a non-linear regression model to estimate the prevalence of fungi in Africa. We used a non-linear regression model to estimate the post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for fungi and the post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotics-based treatments. We estimated the post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments for fungi based on the following assumptions: (1) pre-treatment effectiveness of antibiotic-based treatments would be affected by availability of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments; (2) post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments would be affected by the availability of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments; and (3) post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotics and antibiotics-based treatments would be affected by the availability of antibiotics and antibiotics-based treatments. We assumed that the prevalence of fungi in Africa would be similar to the prevalence of fungi in Africa. We used a non-linear regression model to estimate the post-treatment effectiveness of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments in Africa. We used a non-linear regression model to estimate the post-treatment efficacy of antibiotics and/or antibiotics-based treatments in Africa.

xpas.org/cgi-bin/show_links_all.cgi?id=1eK4YAAQ&f=1eKN0I0) (27). The prevalence of F. culmorum has been estimated at between 0.3 and 2.4% (4) and 2.6 to 3.6% (5) in Africa and elsewhere, respectively (4). In addition, the prevalence of F. intestinalis has been estimated at between 0.5 and 1.8% (4) and 1.6 to 2.7% (5) in Asia (4). The cost of F. intestinalis has been estimated at between 10 to 40 years of cost per life in Africa (4). Fungal diseases are associated with morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including AIDS (1, 3). Thus, for all countries, immunizations with F. intestinalis have been recommended as the first line of defense against F. intestinalis-induced fungal infections.

Cost-effectiveness of F. intestinalis vaccine
In addition to the cost-effectiveness of F. intestinalis vaccine, the efficacy of F. intestinalis vaccine in the setting of F. intestinalis infection was evaluated in developing countries. The F. intestinalis vaccine was given as an adjuvant (n = 50) and the regimen was initiated as part of an ongoing clinical study in 8 patients. The average annual cost of the F. intestinalis vaccine was 2.5 U/year. The cumulative costs for the combined efficacy and cost of the F. intestinalis vaccine were 1.3 to 2.2 U/year. The cumulative annual cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis was 2.2 U/year. The overall cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis was 0.44 U/year (Table 3). The cumulative cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis was 2.2 U/year. All efficacy and cost-effectiveness data are summarized in Table 4. The cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis vaccine was 0.44 U/year. The cumulative cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis was 1.4 U/year. The overall cost-effectiveness of the combined regimen for F. intestinalis vaccine was 1.1 U/year.


## Discussion
In this study, we examined the costs of interventions to improve the quality of life for patients living with Fungal diseases in the countr. The results showed that the cost-effectiveness of interventions was higher for patients living with Fungal diseases. This finding is in agreement with the results of a recent study in Sub-Saharan Africa [25]. In our study, the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve the quality of life was higher than those of antibiotics, fungicides, antifungal drugs, and vaccines. The cost-effectiveness of interventions has been reported in other studies, as well as in some other studies in sub-Saharan Africa [25, 26]. The results of our study show that the cost-effectiveness of interventions is higher than those reported in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where the costs of interventions are higher. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of interventions is higher than those reported in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results also showed that the cost-effectiveness of interventions is higher than those reported in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where the costs of interventions are higher. The findings suggest that the cost-effectiveness of interventions in the developing countries may be greater than those reported in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. This finding is in agreement with the findings of a recent study in Sub-Saharan Africa [25].

In the current study, the prevalence of Fungal disease was highest in patients living with HIV/AIDS, followed by non-HIV patients living with HIV, and by patients living with HIV-associated opportunistic infections. Fungal diseases were also prevalent in our study, which may be related to the more severe immunosuppressive condition in the patients living with HIV. This finding is in agreement with the results of a recent study in Sub-Saharan Africa [25]. In our study, the prevalence of Fungal disease was higher in non-HIV patients living with HIV, than in HIV patients living with HIV. This finding is in agreement with the results of a recent study in Sub-Saharan Africa [25].
