## Abstract
Understanding drug resistance in dengue remains challenging because the main goal of dengue resistance is the accumulation of resistant strains. In this study, we determined the genotypic and drug resistance patterns of three dengue strains, NEURO2, NEURO5, and NEURO10, isolated from patients with chronic fever in Brazil. Approximately 1,300 clinical dengue isolates were tested and the most prevalent genotype was Qidiane-infected monocyte-mitochondritis (MIC = 16-fold), followed by Qidiane-transposon-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 31-fold). Three different monofilamented strains were selected and phenotypes were determined. The majority of isolates were resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. The caspofungin resistance pattern was explained by a decrease in fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. In addition, resistance patterns in NEURO2 and NEURO5 were suppressed by multiple mutations. The most prevalent resistance pattern in NEURO2 was Qidiane-transposon-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 31-fold). A minor decrease in fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was observed in Qidiane-transposon-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This study demonstrates that the accumulation of resistant strains is a major determinant of the outcome of susceptibility testing in patients with dengue.


## Introduction
The gut microbiota is an important ecosystem in which many microorganisms can live, and can be pathogenic, commensal and pathogenic unicellular bacteria (e.g. mycobacteria) and pathogenic multicellular eukaryotes, such as fungi and bacteria, as well as unicellular eukaryotic organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) [1,2]. The microbiota has many advantages over other microbes such as plants, animals, and microbes belonging to other phyla such as yeasts and bacteria. These organisms share some genetic properties, including high metabolic and/or enzymatic activities and the ability to synthesize lipids and carbohydrates, and are able to metabolize a wide range of substrates [3,4]. The bacteria and fungi are also able to metabolize and secrete substances that can facilitate pathogenesis, such as antibiotics [5]. The ability to metabolize carbohydrates is an important metabolic feature of fungi and/or bacteria such as Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus species, which are the most important human pathogens that cause fungal infections [6].

The mycobacterium Corynebacterium lepal, is a commensal organism that lives mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, but can also cause chronic and acute mycoses, ranging from mild, localized infections to life-threatening systemic diseases in immunocompromised patients [7]. Corynebacterium infections are associated with high mortality rates and the mortality rates for many fungal pathogens are extremely high. In the past, Corynebacterium infections were mostly limited to immunocompromised patients, although it is now widely recognized that it is one of the most important fungal pathogens [8]. However, infections by Corynebacterium species are increasingly recognized as a major public health problem [9]. Although C. lepal has a worldwide distribution, the high mortality rate associated with invasive fungal infections is well documented, and the major risk factor of fungal disease is the bacterium strain (GBS) of C. lepal [10,11].

This is the first study reporting the occurrence of mycobacterial mycosis in the context of a non-neutropenic patient.


## Methods
For each of the 6 patients, a mortality cohort was included in the study to provide a non-invasive proxy of Thrombocytopenia during thrombocytopenia [19.

The initial thrombocytopenia-related deaths were stratified by the frequency of thrombocytopenia (20%) and thrombocytopenia (20%) in the 6 patients who survived ART. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a thrombocytopenia-related death in a patient with a score of =20 or =20 at the time of the thrombocytopenia diagnosis (at least once in every 6 patients).

To identify patients with a Thrombocytopenia-related death, a clinical record was reviewed and a standardized case-control study was conducted. We did not recruit patients for a thrombocytopenia-related death; therefore, we did not prospectively record thrombocytopenia-related deaths. However, we did collect data on demographic characteristics, underlying causes of Thrombocytopenia, underlying causes of thrombocytopenia, underlying neurologic manifestations, and time to death of the patient. The case-control study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, San Francisco, and Los Angeles General Hospital (UCSF).

Ethics Statement
The study was conducted according to the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, San Francisco, and Los Angeles General Hospital (UGHH). Informed consent was obtained from all patients in this study.

In the Thrombocytopenia diagnosis study, the patient’s age was determined by the age-standardized age of 50 years and the number of days since the diagnosis of Thrombocytopenia. The patient’s previous clinical manifestations, underlying causes of Thrombocytopenia, underlying neurologic manifestations, and time to death of the patient were also included. The underlying causes of Thrombocytopenia included blood leukocyte adenocarcinoma, lymphopenia, myeloma, and malignant cells.

Geisler, M.E. Palm, J. E. Palm, P. E. Palm, and D. M. L. Park, M.E. Palm, J. E. Palm, P. E. Palm, and D. M. L. Park, respectively (S10 Table).

In order to validate the hypothesis that the antifungal activity of the Vitex compounds is due to the activity of the Vitex enzyme, we used a series of compounds, which was prepared by electroporation using a commercial Vitex enzyme (S10 Table). In this case, the Vitex enzyme is a non-selective enzyme that is selected to be active at a low concentration of Vitex (Fig 3). The most promising compounds, which are anti-microbial, are aurein (100-000 µM), adenine prototrophic amino acid, methylbenzene, methylene, and voriconazole (Table 1).

In order to evaluate the ability of Vitex to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, the growth of a panel of 50 clinical isolates was monitored. The Vitex assay was performed with F. graminearum, C. albicans, and the other tested fungi in a manner that was not influenced by the growth of the different fungi. As shown in Fig 4, the growth inhibition was very weak and the MICs were higher for C. albicans than for C. albicans, whereas the MICs were higher for C. albicans and C. neoformans. The growth of all tested fungal strains was inhibited by Vitex, but Vitex was more active than other agents.

It has been reported that the growth inhibition of fungal pathogens is dependent on the antifungal activity of Vitex (4).


## Discussion
In those cases, the patient had a history of seizures, seizures were induced, and the patient's cognitive function was improve.

Patients presenting with neurological symptoms were often diagnosed by the presence of signs or symptoms of hearing or vision impairment. In those cases, the patient had a history of seizures, seizures were induced, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

In the case of seizure, there were two possibilities: one possibility was the patient was a victim of a suicide or drug overdose and the other possibility was the patient was a victim of an auto-immune reaction, which is a neurological condition which affects the motor system, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

The first possibility is the patient had a seizure. The second possibility was the patient was a victim of auto-immune reaction, which is a neurological condition which affects the motor system, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

The third option was the patient had a suicide. The patient had a history of epilepsy, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

In the case of auto-immune reaction, there were two possibilities: one possibility was the patient had a seizure. The second possibility was the patient had a seizure. The patient had a history of epilepsy, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

The patients who had seizures had a history of epilepsy and a history of seizures were most commonly diagnosed by the presence of signs or symptoms of hearing or vision impairment. In those cases, the patient had a history of seizures, seizures were induced, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

The most common neurologic condition of patients with neurological symptoms was hyper-intense seizures (57%). Other than those with seizures, the most common neurologic condition was motor weakness (26%).

In the case of auto-immune reaction, there were two possibilities: one possibility was the patient had a seizure. The second possibility was the patient had a seizure. The patient had a history of seizures, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.

The most common neurologic condition of patients with seizures was cerebral atrophy (57%). In these cases, the patient had a history of seizures, and the patient's cognitive function was improved.
