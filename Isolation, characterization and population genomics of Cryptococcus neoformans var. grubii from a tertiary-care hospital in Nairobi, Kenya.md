## Abstract
We present a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a 21-year-old HIV-infected man with severe asthma, which rapidly evolved to become chronic obstructive disease and chronic diarrhea. He presented with chest pain and abdominal distention. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from the sonar and skin of two days' observation. We determined clinical, microbiological and immunological characteristics of the isolates. In addition, we characterized the susceptibility of the isolates to antifungal agents. The isolates are reported as belonging to different Aspergillus and Fusarium species. We also discussed the possible pathogenesis of the cryptococcosis. Our patient had a full-course course and no chest pain and abdominal pain. Chest pain was the only symptom that interfered with his aerated state and was the only one that interfered with his complete remission of the colonization in the bronchiolar lavage. The patient was able to work because he was treated aggressively with antifungal agents. We conclude that cryptococcosis can infect people with HIV and that antifungal treatment should be intensified to decrease the mortality rate of this disease.


## Introduction
Fungi are abundant in nature and can produce a wide range of bioactive compounds, which may contribute to the overall beneficial effects of plant-based products and/or natural products [1-3]. Among the plant-derived bioactive compounds, flavonoids and their derivatives are commonly found in various plant species and can be synthesized in vitro and/or in vivo using various microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, or yeasts [4,5].

Candida spp. are important opportunistic human pathogens, especially in the immunocompromised and immunocompromised, that cause life-threatening infections of the central nervous system and brain. Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidiasis, especially in the intensive care unit, but can also cause infection in immunocompromised patients, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, or burn. The increasing number of C. albicans infections in the world is also a reflection of the increasing number of people susceptible to these infections [6,7]. In fact, C. albicans is the most common cause of candidiasis in humans, accounting for more than 1.5 million new infections each year and representing the third most common cause of life-threatening infections in AIDS patients [7].

Candida spp. have a broad spectrum of cell types, such as those that are clinically and therapeutically relevant, such as mucocutically susceptible strains, such as those with hematological malignancies, and non-hematogenic strains that can be associated with a wide spectrum of infections, including those caused by species belonging to the Candida clade [8]. Candida spp. are also found in association with human skin diseases, such as atopic eczema (ABD), and folliculitis, which is a major cause of in-hospital otitis media and associated with high mortality rates.

The discovery of new compounds from natural sources that are effective against Candida spp. and other non-Candida spp. has been recently reported [9-11].


## Methods
grubii from the blood of a tertiary-care hospital in Nairobi, Keny. This method was validated and performed in a previous study [3]. We selected a total of ~20 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from a clinical sample collection of a tertiary-care hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of ~60 Cryptococcus neoformans strains were isolated from the sample collected at the Nairobi Nihon Hospital by the local laboratory staff, including two Cryptococcus neoformans strains (CNS strain 8C2, a virulent strain of Cryptococcus neoformans and FLC strain KN99a) and one yeast-like strain of Cryptococcus neoformans (CNS strain 9B11, a virulent strain of Cryptococcus neoformans and FLC strain CNA1, a fungal strain of Cryptococcus neoformans).

The CNA1 strain was isolated from a patient with myocardial infarction in Kenya, which was initially identified by the Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21 (Avanti), and was subsequently identified by the Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21 (Avanti). The CNA1 strain was also isolated from the patient and identified by the Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21 (Avanti) [20], as we previously reported. The BCRD1 strain was isolated from a patient with systemic myocardial infarction in Uganda and was subsequently identified by the Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21 (Avanti) as previously described [11].

Genotyping of C. neoformans strains
We used a previously described method to identify C. neoformans strains [4]. We selected 15 C. neoformans strains, obtained from the NCBI GenBank database, from the clinical samples collection from a tertiary-care hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. We also selected 5 C. neoformans strains from a collection of blood and urine samples from a tertiary-care hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. These were obtained from a collection of blood and urine samples from patients and laboratory personnel from both the tertiary-care hospitals and the tertiary-care hospitals of Nairobi, Kenya.


## Results
grubii were isolated from a tertiary-care hospital in Nairobi, Keny. The isolates were tested for virulence in a dose-dependent manner by using the IC_50 of the single drug, Fluconazole (50 µg/ml), fluconazole (25 µg/ml), and fluconazole (125 µg/ml). The MICs of fluconazole (25 µg/ml) were similar to that of fluconazole (125 µg/ml), with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.26 to 0.78 µg/ml. Fluconazole was also effective against Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, with MIC_50 values of 0.46 µg/ml, and a median MIC of 5 µg/ml. Fluconazole was also effective against C. neoformans var. grubii, with MIC_50 values of 2.1 µg/ml and a median MIC of 6 µg/ml. However, it was not effective against C. neoformans var. grubii, with MIC_50 values of 1.6 µg/ml and a median MIC of 4 µg/ml.

Serum posaconazole was effective against a large number of isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.06 µg/ml to 0.32 µg/ml. posaconazole was also effective against a large number of isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii, with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.06 µg/ml to 0.32 µg/ml. The MIC_50 values of posaconazole were higher than that of fluconazole (0.46 µg/ml), with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.06 µg/ml to 0.32 µg/ml. The MIC_50 values of posaconazole against C. neoformans var. grubii were higher than those of fluconazole (0.46 µg/ml), with MIC_50 values ranging from 0.06 µg/ml to 0.32 µg/ml.

## Discussion
The incidence of tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected individuals is increasing. Although most patients with HIV infection have a history of exposure to HIV, the incidence of this disease is still much higher than in the general population [14]. Given the prevalence of TB in patients with HIV, the number of TB cases is expected to increase in the next decade. In addition to the TB epidemic, the development of new antiretroviral drugs is expected to increase the incidence of TB.
