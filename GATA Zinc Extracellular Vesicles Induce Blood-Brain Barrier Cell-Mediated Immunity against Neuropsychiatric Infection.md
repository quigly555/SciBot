## Abstract
In this study, we investigate the potential effects of a single dose on lipid accumulation in a novel rat model of cryptococcosis. Two doses of saline or saline pulse infusion through injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) each daily for 7 days each induced the proliferation of Cryptococcus neoformans. The dose-responsive, non-protective effect of LPS treatment was demonstrated in a murine model of systemic cryptococcosis. LPS treatment reduced cryptococcal disease burdens in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the dose-independent, non-protective effect of this drug was reversed after 7 days of treatment. These data suggest that single doses of LPS might be useful for treating cryptococcosis and highlight the potential use of lipid products for prevention and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) patients.


## Introduction

NPSI is a systemic inflammatory reaction of the central nervous system caused by pathogens such as . crassa, S. aureus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii [12,13]. NPSI is a spectrum of nonspecific reactions that can be divided into nonspecific and specific nonspecific reactions. The spectrum of nonspecific reactions is highly specific, and depends on the type of pathogen. The type of the causative organism, the pathogen’s stimulus, the stage of the inflammatory response, and the outcome of the disease are not completely determined in the scientific literature. The level of specificity is determined by the severity of the response. The severity of NPSI is mainly defined by the number of nonspecific blood vessels and the number of infiltration of lymphocytes in the CNS.

NPSI is a nonspecific reaction that can be caused by either pathogens or the host immune response. The most common pathogen is N. crassa, but other pathogens including S. aureus, T. cruzi, and Pneumocystis jirovecii have been reported [12,14,15]. Most cases of NPSI are due to environmental contamination. Exposure to the infectious agent usually leads to the formation of infectious microorganism-colonizing structures (colonies) on the surface of the host. Infection of the host by the pathogen results in necrotizing granuloma or mycoplasma-like structures (m<U+03D5>/m<U+03D5>). The pathogen usually disseminates to the brain, causing meningoencephalitis. An early diagnosis is early administration of antibiotics to treat the infection.

NPSI is an autoimmune disease caused by multiple intracellular pathogens. The most common intracellular pathogens are Streptococcus pneumonia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and their intracellular parasites, including Clostridium perfringens, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma cruzi. NPSI is an autoimmune disease that is usually detected in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or patients with malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or on immunosuppressive drugs.


## Methods
albicans were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (ATCC 10231, USA) and are listed in Supplementary Table S. Sera were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and then processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Infection of serum and CSF
The primary antifungal agent used in the present study was caspofungin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as previously reported (16). For the secondary antifungal study, 20 µg/mL caspofungin was used in combination with fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for a minimum of 7 days, respectively. After 7 days of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO_2, a cell suspension of C. albicans was inoculated in CSF and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO_2. A cell suspension of S. cerevisiae was prepared in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 0.2% trypan blue.

For the laminarin assay, CSF was collected from healthy blood, washed, and then inoculated in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 0.2% trypan blue. Subsequently, 2 µL of the CSF suspension was added to 2 mL of PBS (pH 7.0). After the addition of 2 µL of 1% agarose, a volume of 20 µL of the suspension was added to 2 mL of RPMI-1640. Then, 2 µL of 1% agarose was added to 2 mL of PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO_2. Then, a cell suspension of Candida albicans was prepared in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 0.2% trypan blue. The cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO_2. A cell suspension of S. cerevisiae was prepared in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 0.2% trypan blue. The cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO_2. A cell suspension of C.


## Results
A. fumigatus-specific gene expression changes in mycelia and necrotic lesions
The transcripts of genes involved in the regulation of the fungal morphogenesis and the conidiation process were detected in mycelia of A.


## Discussion
restricta opsonized with FGF-ß stimulated the blood-brain barrier cell-mediated immunity against . neoformans. The latter process is a major determinant of the development of immunity against C. neoformans infection. This report indicates that FGF-ß is a potent inhibitor of blood-brain barrier cell-mediated immunity, and that the C.
