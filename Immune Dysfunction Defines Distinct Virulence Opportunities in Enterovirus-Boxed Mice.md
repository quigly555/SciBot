## Abstract
The emergence of Candida auris as a major human pathogen triggering severe fever and cysts in immunocompromised patients is a challenge for public health and one that must be addressed. In this study, the antifungal effects of three caspofungin derivatives, fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole, were evaluated against two C. auris strains and three environmental isolates. In vitro antifungal activity was evaluated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum effective concentration (MICs) of amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole at 50 µg/mL. The MICs of amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole were 1.5 µg/mL for C. auris, 1.5 µg/mL for C. auris-infected isolates and 4 µg/mL for C. auris-infected isolates. Fluconazole caused transient loss of consciousness in susceptible mice. In vivo experiments showed that amphotericin B affected key steps of the infection process in C. auris. C. auris isolates were highly resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole at concentrations as low as 0.002 ng/mL. The MICs of amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole were 1.5 µg/mL for C. auris and 1.5 µg/mL for C. auris-infected isolates. Fluconazole was fungicidal against all three isolates. Voriconazole was fungicidal against all three isolates.


## Introduction
The gut microbiota is an organelle that is capable of breaking down numerous molecules into small molecules and metabolites, such as lactic acid and peptide-derived metabolites, which may be toxic for cells and host cell. These molecules are secreted by the gut microbiota and enter into the circulation through different routes. These routes include the gastrointestinal tract, the digestive tract, the skin, and the respiratory tract. The most prevalent route of release of molecules is the respiratory tract. This route includes small molecules released into the system by the circulatory system and systemic routes, such as direct inhalation of small molecules from the respiratory tract. There are many reports of the route of release of small molecules in the systemic system, and these molecules can enter the bloodstream and reach the central nervous system. The circulating molecule in the bloodstream may be highly toxic for cells and hosts, which may induce a severe immune response.

HIV-1 virus (HCMV) is a human retrovirus and its RNA can be secreted into the extracellular environment through the respiratory tract. The respiratory tract is the main site of release of the viral RNA. The secreted virus can enter the cells via the respiratory system or enter the cells by crossing the blood-brain barrier. The main types of virus in the respiratory tract include respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza related viruses, and pneumococci. The type of respiratory virus can be subdivided into two types: latent viruses and non- latent viruses. The latent virus can cause a single infection or a number of infections. The non- latent virus can infect multiple organs or organs can spread throughout the body and cause multiple infections. The non- latent virus can cause a range of different diseases. It can be a commensal or an infective agent. The respiratory tract is the main site of viral entry into the bloodstream. It is the major site of viral replication and the major site of viral replication in the brain. Viral particles can be inhaled into the brain and then pass through the alveolar macrophage. The brain microvascular endothelial cells are responsible for viral entry. There are a few other sites of viral infection in the brain. There are a few cases of respiratory viruses, but there are no reported cases of respiratory viruses in the literature.

There are different types of virus.


## Methods

The mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis was followed according to the protocol by a previous study published in the review of Wiens et a. [5] which showed that the pathogen was far more virulent in mice infected with C. albicans and C. glabrata than in the control group. Mice were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg on days -3 and -1) and received a cortisone acetate/ketoconazole (100 mg/kg on days -3 and -1) intraperitoneally on day -1 and day -2. The mice received either a Meningitis Vaccine (SV) or a Galleria Vaccine (GV) for the following periods of time: (1) 4 days before infection; (2) 6 days after infection; (3) 6 days after infection; (4) 7 days after infection. Mice were weighed daily. The average weight of the mice was calculated by measuring the radius of the base of the affected area from the point of infection to the point of no pain.

The animals used in this study were 8- to 12-week-old male BALB/c mice. The animals were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions and fed ad libitum. Animal husbandry was performed in accordance with the principles of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Malawi (Permit Number: A-522-739).

Ethics Statement
The animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the IACUC at the University of Malawi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Groups of 8- to 12-week-old male BALB/c mice were used in the current study. The animals were bred in a specific pathogen-free environment and used in the current study in compliance with the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions and fed ad libitum.


## Results
albicans in immunocompetent mice and their 10-week mortality at week 12 postinfection (Figure 6. This cohort of mice was generated from a previously reported infection model in which mice were injected with an adjuvant containing a cell-based fluconazole resistance capsule (ZCF) capsule. We observed that mice infected with C. albicans had significantly less viable BALF, an indicator of fungal burden, compared to the BALF of mice infected with wild-type or C. albicans strains (Figure 6). The median age of mice infected with wild-type C. albicans was 42 days (range, 5-62) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 70 days (range, 3-85) (p = 0.007). The median age of mice infected with C. albicans was 58 days (range, 9-62) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 73 days (range, 8-72) (p = 0.04). The median age of mice infected with C. albicans was 41 days (range, 14-64) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 69 days (range, 14-69) (p < 0.0001). The median age of mice infected with C. albicans was 51 days (range, 12-59) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 64 days (range, 10-73) (p < 0.0001). The median age of mice infected with C. albicans was 61 days (range, 12-60) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 70 days (range, 11-79) (p = 0.05). The median age of mice infected with C. albicans was 51 days (range, 12-61) and that of mice infected with C. albicans was 71 days (range, 10-71) (p < 0.0001).

Mice Infected with C. albicans Have Lower Survival Rates in the First 10 weeks
We next assessed the virulence of C. albicans in immunocompetent mice. In the first 10 weeks postinfection, we observed that C. albicans infected mice had a significantly higher fungal burden than C.


## Discussion
We showed that CD4^+ T cells expressed CD4^+ T cell-derived IL-10, which was previously observed in humans, was increased in infected CD4^+ T cells in the later stages of infection (Figure 3A. In contrast, in infected CD4^+ T cells, IL-10 was not expressed (Figure 3A), which may reflect a different immune response to the infection (Figure 3B) or an increased susceptibility to infection (Figure 3C).

In addition to CD4^+ T cells, CD4^+ T cells in CD4^+ T cells also expressed IL-10 and IL-23 (Figure 3C). In this study, we demonstrated that CD4^+ T cells express IL-23 and that IL-23 is expressed in CD4^+ T cells (Figure 3D). In contrast, CD4^+ T cells express IL-10 (Figure 3D). IL-23 is produced in response to stimulation with MHC-II and MHC-II. IL-23 is synthesized by CD4^+ T cells and then released by T cells into the cytosol. IL-23 then binds to CD4^+ T cells and can be internalized to the cytosol [14]. T cell-derived IL-23 is then phagocytosed by T cells. IL-23 is then produced in response to stimulation by MHC-II, IL-23^-/T cell, and T cell-derived IL-33 [15]. CD4^+ T cells express IL-23 and release IL-23^-/T cell [16]. IL-23 is released by T cells through CD8^+ T cells, which are activated by CD4^+ T cell-derived IL-23. In addition, IL-23 is secreted by CD4^+ T cells, which are activated by CD4^+ T cell-derived IL-23 [17]. IL-23 plays an essential role in T cell activation [18]. In this study, we found that CD4^+ T cells express IL-23 and that CD4^+ T cells are phagocytosed by CD4^+ T cells (Figure 4).
