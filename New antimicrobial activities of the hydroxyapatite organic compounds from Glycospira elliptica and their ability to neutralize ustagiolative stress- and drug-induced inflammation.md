## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that infects immunocompetent hosts, causing ~150,000 cases of cryptococcosis in ~200 countries around the world each year. Currently, the majority of infections occur in people with Down syndrome, which is the primary immunocompromised population. The predominant fungi species of C. gattii infect in immunocompetent hosts is the xylosmium rotavirus species, which is also immunocompromised. This study aims to compare the clinical and laboratory features of the clinical and laboratory features of C. gattii clinical isolates from patients with Down syndrome and non-dermatophytic non-dermatophytic fungi.

A total of 348 C. gattii clinical isolates were obtained. Clinical features were similar in terms of age, gender, sex, and geographic region. Of the patients with Down syndrome, 53.3% had at least one adverse outcome. The clinical features of the clinical features were similar in terms of age, gender, and sex. No differences were found in terms of clinical triazole titre and the percentage of positive blood cultures were similar in terms of geometric mean and percentage, respectively.

This study revealed the clinical and laboratory features of clinical C. gattii isolates from a diverse population in a rural area of Brazil. The clinical features of the C. gattii isolates were similar to those of other Cryptococcus species, with the difference being a decrease in the percentage of positive blood cultures. This may be the first report on the clinical features of C. gattii in a non-dermatophytic non-dermatophytic fungal population in Brazil.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are an increasing threat to human health and are increasing in frequency due to the increasing population of immunosuppressed patients [1,2]. The term “emerging candidiasis” encompasses a wide range of syndromes, including mycetoma, pulmonary aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and invasive mucormycosis, and may be misused or inappropriately used [3,4]. The most common opportunistic fungal infections are aspergillosis and candidiasis, and the most commonly occurring intracellular pathogens include Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus [5].

The incidence of invasive fungal infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy or undergoing immune therapy is increasing [6]. Candida infections can cause life-threatening systemic infections, such as life-threatening invasive candidiasis, in immunocompromised patients [7,8]. The management of invasive candidiasis is challenging, and the use of empiric antifungal treatment is associated with mortality rates as high as 40%, even with treatment that does not involve fungicidal drugs [8,9]. The available antifungal agents are limited, however, and the emergence of new fungal species and the emergence of drug-resistant fungi are limiting [10,11]. In recent years, the emergence of fungal species has been observed in diverse clinical settings [12,13].


## Methods
In this study, a total of 200-400 mg of hydrocortisone and of hydrocortisone hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) was added to 200 ml of sterile distilled water, and the solution was incubated at 28 °. The end point of the experiment was obtained by incubation of the lysate with 200 µl of fresh RPMI 1640 medium, and the influence of drug treatment was also evaluated by adding 200 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The results were expressed as percentage of inhibition relative to the control.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activity of the Hydroxyapatite Organic Compounds
The antimicrobial activity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds (HOPEC 1) from Glycospira elliptica and the lower fraction of Ustagiolium were compared with the antimicrobial activity of the same hydroxyapatite organic compound (UPR 1). The concentrations of the two compounds ranged from 1 to 4 mg/ml.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activity of the Hydroxyapatite Organic Compounds (HOPEC 1) From Glycospira elliptica and Ustagiolium
The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds from Glycospira elliptica and Ustagiolium were compared using the method described by Sánchez-Costas et al. [20] with the addition of 100 mg of hydroxyapatite per liter of sterile distilled water. A suspension of the fungi was prepared by inoculating a loopful of the mycelium with 100 µl of a suspension of an equal volume of the different compounds. The mycelium was cultured at 28 °C for 24 h under aerobic conditions. Mycelia were washed three times with sterile distilled water, and the concentration of the compounds was adjusted to the desired concentration.

The concentrations of the two compounds ranged from 1 to 4 mg/ml.


## Results
The M. tuberculosis bacterium E. coli K1 Pbs
The M. tuberculosis bacterium E. coli K1 Pbs, belonging to the family of Staphylococcal K1, has been characterized previously (Kang et al., 2005; Kang et al., 2008; Kang et al., 2010). The bacteria are also known to have a higher bactericidal activity than their nonpathogenic, bactericidal counterparts (Kang et al., 2005; Kang et al., 2008). Therefore, it was hypothesized that E. coli K1 Pbs could inhibit M. tuberculosis K1 Pbs.


## Discussion

The use of CPM is a very important choice to study the effects of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds, as the reaction with the host can significantly change the molecular composition and composition of the complex, resulting in the toxic effects of compound. The toxicity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds was examined to determine their antimicrobial activity. The results of the antimicrobial activity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds are summarized in Table 2. The hydroxyapatite organic compounds exhibited the most potent activity, which was due to their ability to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The hydroxyapatite organic compounds also displayed a strong antibacterial activity, which was responsible for the killing of C. albicans. The antibacterial activity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds was also shown in Figure 2.

The antimicrobial activity of the hydroxyapatite organic compounds was also confirmed by their cytotoxicity against the human T cell line. The hydroxyapatite organic compounds were active against T cell and bacterial cell line.
