## Abstract
A 24-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with complaints of chest pain, hemoptysis and hemoparemia for a week. A chest X-ray showed extensive lymphoid infiltrates on the right lung wall. Chest X-ray showed infiltration of epidermis in both lower extremities. Computed tomography showed extensive infiltrates on both lungs. Lymphoid infiltrates were also observed on the right lung wall. Lymphoid tissue was removed from both lungs simultaneously. No other nodules were observed on the chest X-ray machine. Blood cultures were negative. He was treated with chemotherapy and then left with residual chest pain. On day 6, the lymph node cultures showed evidence of fungal infection, but he had no chest pain and had no hemoparesis. On day 7, he had no chest pain, but the lymph node cultures had signs of microbial infection. He was treated with amphotericin B and then left with residual chest pain.

Severe chest pain in leukemia patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a unique characteristic of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). The chest X-ray machine reported here was not available to perform chest imaging. The rarity of this report and the absence of any hemoparection or lymphoid tissue involvement in the two examinations make this examination less relevant.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an important fungal disease affecting mainly immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplant, and solid-organ-surveillance patients, and its etiology remains obscure. The infection is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which is part of the normal human microbiota. Infection with the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans results in acute pulmonary disease, followed by a progressive disseminated disease that is often fatal. In immunocompromised hosts, Cryptococcus neoformans is more frequently isolated from patients with other immunocompromising conditions, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), organ transplant recipients, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disease. There are currently two recognized species of the pathogenic yeast: Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) and Cryptococcus gattii (serotype D). The serotype A species is responsible for approximately 90% of clinical cryptococcosis in AIDS patients. Cryptococcus gattii is most commonly isolated from bird droppings from pigeon nests and decaying wood, and from plants in soil and decaying wood, whereas C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) and C.


## Methods

The analysis of the antimicrobial properties of these four phytochemical compounds were performed using the standard method of Azor and Rozal (2011) [23. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Life and Health Sciences of São Paulo State University, in accordance with the regulations of the Federal University of São Paulo. In brief, the microbial growth was evaluated using the Agilent 96-well microplates (Sorvall Corporation, USA) in a growth factor (G) concentration of 0.02%. The inoculated fungal broth was mixed with 10 µL of each antimicrobial compound and incubated at 37°C. The plates were then examined under the microscope (Olympus SZX-100, Japan). The inhibition zones (mm) were calculated using the standard microplate method [24]. The antimicrobial activity was expressed as percent inhibition of growth over the control. The results were compared with the control group.

3.3. Screening of Antimicrobial Activities Against Vitis Media
The antimicrobial activity of the four phytochemical compounds against Vitis media was performed using the broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008) [25] in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008) [26]. The fungal biomass was quantified by using a dilution series of the fungal inoculum (10^3 to 10^6 CFU/mL in RPMI 1640 medium) with pH adjusted to 6.0. The assay was performed in duplicate. One milliliter of each compound was added to the vials of the microplates and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Then, the fungal suspension was collected, centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The final concentration of the tested compounds was 1.0 × 10^3 and 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/mL, respectively. The experiments were performed in duplicate, and the results were recorded.

3.4. Screening of Antimicrobial Activities Against Fungal Isolates
The antimicrobial activity of the four phytochemical compounds against fungi was performed using the inoculum method according to the CLSI (2008) [27].


## Results
fermentans is one of the most promising mushrooms and represents a promising source of polyols in terms of anti-microbial activity [7, 20. To investigate the possible effect of non-native polyols in T. fermentans on T. fermentans fruit and seedlings, the presence of polyols in the fruit pulp and roots was investigated. No significant effect was found on the polyols contents (Fig 1). The high concentrations of polyols in the fruit pulp and roots (Fig 1A) and the high concentrations of polyols in the fruits (Fig 1B) may be responsible for the inhibitory effect on the fruit growth and fruit development. The polyols contents of the fruit pulp and roots were not significantly different between the two groups (F_3,23 = 0.928, P = 0.42 and P = 0.67, respectively). A similar effect was found in the fruit pulp and roots (F_3,24 = 0.873, P = 0.3). A similar effect was found in the seedlings (F_3,24 = 0.878, P = 0.4).

The effects of polyols in the fruit pulp and roots were also investigated using the polyol suspension method (Fig 1C). The concentrations of polyols in the fruit pulp and roots (Fig 1C) were found to be significantly higher than that in the seedlings. On the other hand, the polyols contents in the fruit pulp and roots were found to be lower than that in the seedlings (Fig 1C), which might be due to the toxicity of polyols in fruits.

Effects of Polyols on Fatty Acid, Oxidative and Amino Acid Composition of the Fruits
The levels of total fatty acids in the fruit were found to be higher than those in the seedlings, suggesting that polyols in the fruit are less toxic to the human. The results of the fatty acid composition of the Fruits are shown in Table 1. The results indicated that, in the three samples from the seedlings, there was a significant difference in the amounts of total saturated fatty acids (PUFA), which was found to be higher than that in the fruit (Table 1). The results indicated that polyols in the Fruits may have different effects on the fatty acid composition of the fruit. The results indicated that polyols in the fruit may have different effects on the fatty acid composition of the fruit.


## Discussion
Four key findings were revealed from the result.

Firstly, the microorganisms within the fermentation environment were differentially regulated in a highly polyol-rich environment. In the water and the fermentation medium, the active-site interactions were significantly different in the two strains. The concentration of oil in the water was higher than that in the fermentation medium. The fungal strains also differed in their growth and activity in the fermentation medium. They were not significantly differentially regulated in terms of their activity. The growth of the fungal strains was significantly lower in the fermentation medium than that in the water. It might be the consequence of the competition between the microorganisms and the fermentation medium, which in turn might be the consequence of the competition between the yeast and the fermentation medium. These results indicated that microorganisms had an active-site interaction with the fermentor.

Secondly, the fungal species were significantly differentially regulated in terms of their activity in the fermentation medium and in the water. It might be the consequence of the competition between the microorganisms and the fermentation medium, which in turn might be the consequence of the competition between the yeast and the fermentation medium. These results indicated that the microorganisms had an active-site interaction with the fermentor.

Thirdly, the non-obvious interactions between the microorganisms in the fermentation environment, and the interaction of the yeast and the fermentor, were significantly different. It might be the consequence of the competition between the yeast and the fermentor.
