## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis with a global distribution. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of PCM are poorly understood. We sought to determine the in vitro and in vivo responses to prolonged exposure to fungal keratin in vitro and in vivo.

We treated immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice with a fungicidal, high-dose exposure to 1 × 107 keratin agents/m3 of mycobacterium (Fungi: 107 keratin agents/m3). The immunodominant compound in the keratin treatment regimen was 0.074-0.156 mg/kg/d (determined by the enzyme activity at concentration and Ki of 95% and checkerboard tests). The experimental designs were optimized using a mouse model and we performed immunoprotection in the absence of fungicides.


## Introduction
Moreover, the failure of current antifungal drugs to effectively treat . glabrata infections is increasing, with mortality rates from invasive candidiasis in the United States and the European Union of Greece similar to those in other regions, with up to 30% of candidiasis cases in the United States as of 2016 (1).

The first azole was introduced in the 1940s (2) and it was not until the 1970s that the azole market was on the rise (3). Fluconazole is the first azole to be FDA-approved for clinical use (4). Fluconazole is a second-generation triazole with a broad-spectrum of mechanisms of action, including inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and activity against azole-resistant strains (5). Fluconazole is a second-generation triazole with a broad-spectrum of mechanisms of action, including inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including ergosterol biosynthesis (6).

Infection with the human host begins by inhalation of fungal cells or spores. The respiratory tract is colonized by a diversity of fungal species that initiate the cycle of the respiratory tract. The respiratory tract is divided into two stages: the first stage is the phagolysosome and the second the extracellular space (7). In the first stage, the yeast cells enter the phagolysosome, where they produce conidia, which are then released into the extracellular space. The phagolysosome is composed of many types of organelles, including lysosomes, intracellular storage proteins, and cytosolic vesicles (8). Among the numerous types of vesicles, the extracellular storage proteins are plasma membrane proteins, such as lysosomes, cytosolic vesicles, and vesicles of endocytic origin (9, 10). In addition to these vesicles, vesicles of diverse origin are also secreted by host cells. These vesicles are also secreted in the phagolysosome and are important in the process of host defense against fungal pathogens (11).

As the yeast cell is the main site of infection by Candida species, the immune response of the host is critical.


## Methods
The mammalian covalent liposome was characterized by a ribosome analysis of the covalent bonds of the covalent compounds at the .5-cm intervals, the third position of the covalent bonds was the homology between the anionic and nonionic complex. The assays were conducted in triplicate and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the three experiments.

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening and interaction assays
Y2H binding of the covalent compounds to the vector pBluescript SK (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was examined using a SYBR-green fluorescent dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a single-color assay. The reaction mixture (1 ml) consisted of 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.1 µM of each dNTP and 10 mM MgCl_2. The reaction was started by mixing the cell lysate with 1 ml of cell suspension. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 1X PBS. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol. The reaction was revealed by an isopropanol gradient of 40% to 50% of 4°C, from 40% to 65% of 4°C. The intensity of the reaction was recorded by an Olympus BX-51 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 20× objective. The program was set as follows: Cell lysate: 30% (v/v) (t/v), 50% (v/v) (v/v), 65% (v/v), and 100% (v/v) (v/v). After the separation of the cells, the analysis was terminated by adding 1 ml of 0.1% SDS. The cell lysate was mixed with 1 ml of 1X PBS and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was collected.


## Results
Of the 5,333 patients who had a normal CSF opening pressure of less than 30 cm, 4,032 were excluded from this study. Of the 4,328 patients with CMV infection, 6,852 were male; 5,849 were a male; and 2,182 were a male (Table 1).

Of the 4,328 patients who were infected with CMV, 4,216 were male; 6,405 were a male; and 2,851 were a male (Table 1).

The median age at the time of CSF opening pressure was 37 years (IQR 30-43), and the median CSF WBC was 1,064/mm^3. The median CSF white blood cell counts at presentation were 2,265/mm^3. All patients had a baseline CSF opening pressure of less than 30 cm.

When considering the frequency of CMV-related death, the likelihood ratio of death was 1.53 (95%CI 1.00-2.57). The mean mortality rate in the first year of life was 30.4% (95%CI 21.7-40.9).

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the likelihood ratio of death was 0.79 (95%CI 0.


## Discussion
Here, we described a case of an HIV-uninfected man with a previously undiagnosed granulomatous disease and who was successfully treated for the syndrome. The patient had a history of diabetes and no symptoms.
