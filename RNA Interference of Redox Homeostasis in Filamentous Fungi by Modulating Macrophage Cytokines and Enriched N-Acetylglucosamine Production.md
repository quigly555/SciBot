## Abstract
The human fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii cause life-threatening disease in susceptible hosts, causing life-threatening meningitis and organ failure. The innate immune response of the host to these pathogens presents a target against which the immune cells can activate against which they can focus their adaptive molecular responses. Cryptococcus neoformans has the ability to invade, thrive in, and survive host macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to its survival and proliferation within the host. The ability of Cryptococcus to modulate macrophage responses and the subsequent destruction of Cryptococcus biofilms therefore determine a role for this critical human pathogen in the host immune response. Here we review how C. neoformans and Cryptococcus engage host innate immune cells to modulate the responses of innate immune cells to these major fungal pathogens. We also consider the impact of the Cryptococcus-host interaction in the host on the development of protective immune responses.


## Introduction
The genus Candida contains more than 20 species in the human body and a growing number of opportunistic pathogenic yeasts, including the thermally-dimorphic Candida glabrata, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis [1]. The genus Candida causes superficial mucosal and skin infections [2]. However, an increasing number of infections involving the central nervous system, central nervous system abscess and invasive fungal diseases are observed [3]. Candida glabrata is the most common species in the human body, and it causes superficial infections ranging from thrush and superficial to deep and deep seated infections [4,5].


## Methods
oxysporum strain H99 was grown in liquid minimal medium (MM) for 16 h at 37 °. This cell suspension was then subjected to the addition of RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% 2-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1% gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. After this period, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium, to a concentration of 1 × 10^7 cells/ml. The cells were then incubated with 1 µg/ml of chitosanase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the presence or absence of 0.01% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 37 °C in order to induce chitosanosis. After this period, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium, to a concentration of 1 × 10^7 cells/ml. This suspension was then incubated with 1 µg/ml of rhodamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in the presence or absence of 0.01% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 37 °C in order to induce chitosanosis. After this period, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium, to a concentration of 1 × 10^7 cells/ml.

To assess the effect of macrophages on the growth of F. oxysporum, the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were treated with macrophages at different concentrations (0.01-0.1 × 10^5 cells/ml). The cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 µg/ml of chitosanase, to induce chitosanosis.

## Discussion
cerevisiae as a model to assess macrophage activation and inflammation following infection with . neoformans (Fig 5). We also used a murine macrophage model to evaluate the effect of C. neoformans on macrophages. We did not observe any difference in macrophage activation following infection with C. neoformans. In contrast, we observed significant differences in macrophage cell activation and inflammation following infection with C. neoformans. We also observed that C. neoformans treated with C. neoformans-based macrophages showed significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and a higher level of proinflammatory cytokines compared to C. albicans-treated macrophages. In addition, we observed significant differences in C-fucose expression and release of transcription factors, such as GATA and TATA, in C. neoformans-treated macrophages. We also observed that C. neoformans-derived GATA and TATA-associated genes are upregulated in C. neoformans-treated macrophages.

C. neoformans causes disease in a number of different mammals. For example, C. neoformans can cause cryptococcosis in humans, and the infection is primarily acquired by inhalation of the yeast [62]. In addition, C. neoformans can cause pulmonary cryptococcosis in humans, and the infection is mostly acquired through inhalation of the fungus [63]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a member of the Ascomycetes. Although C. neoformans is the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, C. albicans is not recognized as a common cause of human disease in immunocompromised individuals [64]. C. neoformans is a rare fungal pathogen that can cause infections in humans and non-human primates [65]. C. neoformans is a ubiquitous fungal pathogen, and it can be acquired by inhalation of a single strain of C. albicans, which is an emerging fungus [66]. The human infection of C. neoformans has been reported to occur in immunocompromised individuals [67]. The C. neoformans strains have been isolated in association with the respiratory tract of individuals with a history of immunosuppression [67].
