## Abstract
Olea africana leaves, known locally as “loa” or “rice”, are widely used as a healthy alternative to bread and raw meat in many countries around the world. However, as the world population ages, so does the availability of these edible resources. Fungi are a very promising source of bioactive compounds, which have applications in many fields of medicine, agriculture and pest management. Therefore, it is essential to explore other potential uses for fungal-derived fungal compounds. In this review, we summarize various studies on the biotechnological exploitation of fungal metabolites by humans as potential antifungal or antibacterial agents. The most promising studies are those focused on the antifungal activity of fungal phenols, flavonoids, and secondary metabolites. The active principles (FIPs) of most of the tested antifungal compounds are promising for the treatment of fungal infections, either directly or indirectly, by the fungus. In addition, a large number of studies on the antifungal activity of the compounds are also presented. Finally, there is a need to explore other possible antifungal or antibacterial uses of fungal phenols. We reviewed the different research areas that have been the focus of this review and summarized the main results of the various studies. Finally, we highlighted the main study on fungal phenols that has been conducted and summarized the main findings on the structural characteristics, bioactivities, and mode of action of the fungal phenols.


## Introduction
Amoebae have been recovered from soil, freshwater, and surface waters in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. However, the sources of Amoeba in the environment remain poorly characterized [10,11]. Although aquatic amoeba are abundant in the freshwater environment, their primary habitat is freshwater, with only few reported cases in the marine environment [12,13]. There are three known species of freshwater amoebae (Achoea, Arphellenia, and Anaeba) but their primary habitat is sea water [14,15]. A. cholerae is a morphologically more diverse, non-mammalian, and more basal amoeba type, which can cause different clinical presentations depending on environmental conditions [16,17,18]. A. cholerae is found in freshwater, saltern, and sand in the temperate zone of North America and Europe [14,16,19]. The clinical symptoms of A. cholerae are characterized by fever, headache, vomiting, lethargy, malaise, and fever without otitis media. Acute febrile illness is often fatal, and death is frequently associated with the occurrence of hypothermia. Acute febrile illness is often caused by a combination of several etiological agents, including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. nidulans [20]. It is difficult to determine the etiological agents of acute febrile illness due to the variation in the disease forms of A. cholerae.

We have previously reported the isolation of an A. niger strain from soil in the northeastern United States with clinical symptoms similar to that of A. cholerae. However, our previous report that a species of Amoeba, N. cholerae, was isolated from soil in the same location and identified as N. cholerae suggested that it may be a new species of N. cholerae. We previously reported that A. niger strain K-3 was isolated from soil in the southeast United States, but the environmental conditions in the location were different from that of A. cholerae. However, our previous studies that reported the isolation of N.


## Methods
pyogenes (. parthenosae) was identified as a type isolate of S. pyogenes [7]. The isolate was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 25°C for three weeks. The isolate was subcultured on LB agar (LB) plates and incubated at 25°C for three days. Colonies were picked and resuspended in sterile saline. The inoculated plate was covered and then placed in a freezer at 4°C for three days. A volume of 200 µl of fungal suspension was then spread on SDA (SDA+5% agar) plates. Plates were incubated at 25°C for four days.

Isolation and Screening of the Isolates
The isolate was isolated and purified using the Columbia method. The isolation of the S. pyogenes type strain was performed using the Columbia method. The isolate was subcultured on SDA plates at 25°C for three days. The isolates were then subcultured on LB agar for three days. The cultures were then transferred to SDA and incubated at 25°C for three days. Fungal colonies were picked and resuspended in sterile saline. The fungal colony number was counted and the isolate was subcultured on LB agar for three days.

Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the S. pyogenes isolates was assessed by the broth microdilution method. The inoculated plates were incubated at 25°C for three days. The mycelia were harvested by filtration and the number of CFU per ml was determined. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that completely inhibited growth of the fungus [6].

Bacterial Strains
The S. pyogenes strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured on SDA at 25°C for 24 h. The bacteria were then used as the control in the experiment. The inoculated plates were incubated at 25°C for 24 h. The inoculated bacterial colonies were then washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS+0.01% Tween 80) at 25°C for 24 h.


## Results
Thus, the newly developed amoebae were studied and their virulence potential was determine. The results are shown in Table 2. The incidence of GXM increased from 10 to 100 g/m^2 in the case of GXM of 10% to 100 g/m^2 in the case of GXM of 25%. The incidence of GXM of 10% to 100 g/m^2 was the highest in the case of GXM of 10%, and the incidence of GXM of 25% was the highest in the case of GXM of 25%. The incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%, and the incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%.

Effect of GXM on Pseudomonas sp.
The effect of GXM on the development of Pseudomonas sp. is shown in Table 3. The incidence of GXM of 10% increased from 10 to 100 g/m^2 in the case of GXM of 10%, and the incidence of GXM of 10% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%. The incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%, and the incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%. The incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%, and the incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%. The incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25%, and the incidence of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10% in the case of GXM of 25% increased from 5 to 10%.
