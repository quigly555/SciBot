## Abstract
Microbial cells have been used in many processes including cleaning up after pests, to design bio-based systems to maintain food webs, to create protective bio-based medical devices, to perform biopesticidal tests, to perform immunological tests, to perform infectious disease diagnostics, to generate new biosignatures, to use the term synonym of a genome-wide bio-genetic analysis. These technologies have given rise to many groups of organisms, from bacteria to fungi, to animals to humans. The present review briefly surveys the various technologies used for the purpose of cleaning up after pests and for the purpose of applying biopesticidal tests, and focuses on the applications of these technologies in the field of plant disease control, pest management, and immunology, highlighting the use of these technologies in the promotion of crops and their benefits to maintain agricultural production and human health, as well as their effects on human health and the environment.

This review briefly examines the benefits and disadvantages of these technologies, their applications in the field of plant disease control, pest management, and environmental ecology, and their negative effects on human health and the environment, with a particular focus on the use of biopesticidal tests.

This paper provides a brief introduction on the uses of microorganisms in pest-control applications, and on the technical and the environmental problems associated with the use of these microorganisms in the field of plant disease control, which can be helpful for plant-oriented plant-based organizations that have no isolation of pests from the use of animals in the field.


## Introduction
The SM are highly diversified in terms of their function and function, but are also composed of high-energy metabolite producers that produce secondary metabolites that protect against toxic effects and other organism. Therefore, they are among the most important and prevalent of the plant defense systems. The SM are the most abundant and diversified component of the plant’s defense systems and are responsible for maintaining nutrition, transport, and transmission of biological and chemical substances.

The SM are also known as secondary metabolite producers, producing metabolites with diverse applications and in many cases products. The metabolite production of the SM is crucial for plant growth and reproduction. The SM are abundant in plants, and they are of great interest as they can be used as signal molecules or as defense compounds against pathogens (5,6). The SM are also involved in the protection against microbial contamination by the production of secondary metabolites and antibiotics (7,8). For instance, the SM are involved in the defense against the pathogens that are difficult to treat (9). The production of secondary metabolites, including polyketides, antifungal agents, antibiotics, and toxins are produced by the SM and are well-studied in plants.

There are reports on the antioxidant enzyme system in plants (10,11). The enzyme system consists of several oxidation products that are divided into four groups. The first group is catalase, which is a multi-domain enzyme that catalyses the catalase catalysed by catalase catalysed by two catalase enzymes (chalase and catalase) (12). The second group is glutathione reductase, which is a modified form of catalase enzyme that catalyses the glutathione peroxidase (GSH) catalysed by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-C). The third group is thiol peroxidase, which is an enzymatic peroxidase that catalyses with thiol groups in the glutathione (GSH-G) group of the enzymes (13). The fourth group is peroxiredoxin, which is a class of enzymes that catalyses the peroxiredoxin system, a complex system that includes all four groups of the enzyme system. The antioxidant enzyme system is found in the most diverse plant groups and is very widespread in plants (14).


## Methods
lindochlorinum
Plant material was harvested from different soil and water settings (pH .0, 32 °C, and aerated at 60 °C for 15 min), and filtered using Millipore membrane filters (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) prior to use in this study. The same filter was used for the subsequent cultivation of C. lindochlorinum at 30 °C. C. lindochlorinum was maintained in liquid nitrogen, and the biomass was obtained from the culture of overnight grown cultures at 37 °C. The pH of the culture was determined by measuring the pH of the culture broth by a pH meter (USB, Wilmington, DE, USA). C. lindochlorinum was cultivated at 28 °C and was harvested from the soil and water settings (pH 7.0, 32 °C, and aerated at 60 °C for 30 min). The total C. lindochlorinum biomass was determined by determination of the pH of the culture broth by a pH meter (USB, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Plant materials (C. lindochlorinum) were surface sterilized with 0.1% Tween 20 in order to remove the visible microbial biomass. Then, the surface of the fungal culture was collected by filtration and filtration. The collected material was transferred to fresh, clean glass containers. The glass containers were maintained at room temperature for at least 24 h, and the quantity of fungal material was determined using a microbroth micro-reader (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA).

Extraction of chlorophyll
The fungal fungal material was extracted with ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and chlorophyll was obtained by autoclaving (95 °C, 60 s) of the fungal biomass. The chlorophyll extract was obtained by adding 1.5 mL of chlorophyll solution (30% v/v) into a sterile 0.85% NaCl solution. The obtained fungal material was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min and the organic layer was washed with 70% EtOH and the obtained supernatant (0.7 mL) was used for the subsequent analysis (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA).


## Results
reesei was restricted to its fungal derivative. The fungus was isolated from the soil and hot spring of Cornelia sp. [8] and was subsequently shown to be resistant to fluconazole [6,10,12]. In the clinical study of S. cerevisiae, susceptibility to fluconazole (MIC = 62 µg/ml) was found for the three isolates, while susceptibility to flucytosine (MIC = 4 µg/ml) was found for one of the isolates (R. flucytosine). The clinical results of these isolates are shown in Table 2.

Antifungal Activity
The fungicidal activity of the three T. reesei isolates is shown in Table 3. The MIC values for fluconazole were 0.48 µg/ml for R. flucytosine and 0.42 µg/ml for R. reesei sp. It was previously reported that fluconazole fungicidal activity of the three isolates was statistically significant when the MIC values were pooled (p<0.001). In the present study, the MIC values of fluconazole for R. reesei and R. reesei sp. were 0.27 µg/ml and 0.08 µg/ml, respectively.

Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the three isolates is shown in Table 4. The MIC values of fluconazole were 0.38 µg/ml for R. reesei and 0.36 µg/ml for R. reesei sp. The MIC values of fluconazole for R. reesei and R. reesei sp. were 0.07 µg/ml and 0.08 µg/ml, respectively.

Antifungal Activity
The MIC values of fluconazole for R. reesei and R. reesei sp. were 0.38 µg/ml and 0.36 µg/ml, respectively.

Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the three T. reesei isolates is shown in Table 5. The MIC values of fluconazole were 0.62 µg/ml for R. reesei and 0.65 µg/ml for R. reesei sp.
