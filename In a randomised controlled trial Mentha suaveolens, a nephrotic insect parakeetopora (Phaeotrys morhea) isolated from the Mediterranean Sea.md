## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an etiologic agent of cryptococcosis, a global fungal disease with a global distribution that affects humans, mice, and P. gillis into which caps of C. gattii are a predominant population. The ability of C. gattii to survive phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils makes this microbe a useful model for studying host-pathogen interactions. As an opportunistic fungus, C. gattii has spread globally, it has been reported that this fungus could be a useful opportunistic pathogen for the treatment of human diseases caused by C. gatti. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of C. gattii to survive phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils using a murine model of C. gattii. Although we observed significant survival of phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils in immunosuppressed mice, we found no evidence of survival by these cells in the absence of antifungal treatment. Furthermore, we found that phagocytosis of C. gattii by macrophages was dependent on the Rab GTPase CgG2. Finally, we found that the CD14-deficient mutant of C.


## Introduction
The results showed that Mentha suaveolens had direct and negligible doses of snakebite vaccine, however, it had serious side effect. Mentha suaveolens was more effective than the other antivenine drugs, such as naringetine, which is a triazole antimony that has the same level of side effects as pentamidine, and much higher dose of pentamidine than piperidine. Mentha suaveolens was able to reduce the bite of both dogs and humans. The pharmacokinetic properties of Mentha suaveolens against snake bites are well described in a few other papers (Mylan and Bergmann, 1994; Coppin and Waterham, 1996; Coppin and Waterham, 1998; Coppin and Waterham, 1998; Coppin and Waterham, 1998; Coppin and Waterham, 1998). For example, Mentha suaveolens was able to reduce the dose of pentamidine, naringetine and piperidine to 90 mg/kg; it had no significant side effects (Coppin and Waterham, 1998). The safety of the Mentha suaveolens is not known, but it is commonly used as a treatment for snake bites. Mentha suaveolens has been used in the treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections (Kombe and Sperber, 2003). It is also used in the treatment of osteomyelitis, mastitis and as an anti-inflammatory drug (Morton and Keller, 2005). In addition, the monoterpenes are active against bacterial and fungal infections. It is used in the treatment of skin infections (e.g. as a skin suppository) (VanZanten et al., 2006) and it is used in the treatment of systemic infections (e.g. urinary tract infection) (Nishimura et al., 1994; Brown and Keller, 1995). The application of Mentha suaveolens in the treatment of acute snakebite has been studied. The dose of it is 100 mg/kg; it has a median time to first blood meal and is effective against 40% of the bites (VanZanten et al., 2006). It has been shown that Mentha suaveolens is active against 70% of the bites (Nishimura et al., 1994).


## Methods
suaveolens, a leaf beetle parakeetora (Phaeotryzaetes) isolated from the temperate Mediterranean island of Sicily, were used as the control grou. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the experimental design was similar to those described in the literature [20,41]. The analyses were performed in triplicate for each condition tested.

The structure of the compounds was based on the above method.

The terpenoids were prepared according to the general procedure.

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified by PCR using ITS1 (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGAGGAAGTAA-3) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3) primers [42]. The products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and detected by denaturing at 98°C for 30 min. The DNA bands of the extracts were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The sequences of the purified PCR products were verified with the Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

The PCR products of the two strains were purified by the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The DNA bands of the purified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and detected by denaturing at 98°C for 30 min. The band of the DNA bands was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The obtained DNA bands were further subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and detected by the Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The DNA bands were purified by the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and detected by the Big Dye Terminator v. 3.


## Results

The effects of different cargoes on the growth of . parva
The growth of C. parva was examined at various time intervals, during the observation period of four weeks in the same experimental site. The growth of C. parva was evaluated in a separate study where all the cargoes were used in the same experimental setup. As shown in Table 4, the growth of C. parva was significantly inhibited at 6.9, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, which is in line with the fact that C. parva is sensitive to the cargoes used for the experimental setup. At 6 hpi, C. parva was still able to grow in the same experimental setup as the control, while at 24 hpi, the growth of C. parva was inhibited at all the experimental conditions, although the results are in line with the fact that the wild type C. parva growth was not inhibited (Table 4).

Effects of different cargoes on the growth of C. parva
The growth of C. parva was tested in different experimental conditions by inoculating the fungus in the presence of various concentrations of antifungal compounds, and the results are presented in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the growth of C. parva was inhibited at concentrations of the antifungal compound used (1 µg/ml), as well as at the concentrations of the antifungal compound used to the same experiment, but the growth was still inhibited at the concentrations used to the same experiment.

Effects of different cargoes on the growth of C. parva
The growth of C. parva was investigated in a randomised controlled trial of 1,3-DAMPH in a range of concentrations, and the results are presented in Table 5. The growth of C. parva was inhibited at 1 µg/ml, as well as at concentrations of the antifungal compound used, in the range of 1 µg/ml to 0.5 µg/ml. At 1 µg/ml and above, the growth of C. parva was inhibited at 1 µg/ml, while at concentrations of the antifungal compound used, the growth was inhibited at concentrations of the antifungal compound used. The results showed that the growth of C.


## Discussion
It was also noted that Parakeetopus queens show no improvement in brain lesion in the brain lesio. [14]

The present study has also demonstrated that the brain lesions in Parakeetopus queens are more severe than those in other insects. [15] The Parakeetopus queens are characterized by the presence of nasal mucosa, while other insects are not. [14] This indicates that Parakeetopus queens show severe neurological deficits. The lesions in Parakeetopus queens are severe, in comparison to other insects. [14] This may be due to the difference in the duration of the parakeetopora infection.

The present study was limited by the small sample size and there was no culture of Parakeetopus queens in this study. Other studies have reported that these insects are less susceptible to insecticides than these other insects. [16] These insects are less susceptible to insecticides and therefore would not be studied here. The results of this study support the hypothesis that Parakeetopus queens are less susceptible to insecticides.

In the present study, the studied Parakeetopus queens were mostly from Spain. In the study of Oliveira et al. (2009), they showed a reduction in the lesion size. The lesion diameter in this study was 20 mm and it was 30 mm in diameter, which was similar to the size of the lesion in Oliveira et al. (2009). [17] The lesion size in Parakeetopus queens was also 20 mm, which was similar to the size of the lesion in Oliveira et al. (2009).

The present study also showed that the oral lesions in Parakeetopus queens are more severe than those in other insects. The oral lesions in Parakeetopus queens were more severe than those in other insects. [14]

The present study was limited by the small sample size and no culture of Parakeetopus queens in this study. However, this study has shown that Parakeetopus queens show neurological deficits and may be more susceptible to insecticides than other insects. [14]

In this study, the Penicillium species were isolated from marine mammals. Penicillium larici-populina, known as P. larici-populina, is a human-like fungus that is found in the environment, especially in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.
