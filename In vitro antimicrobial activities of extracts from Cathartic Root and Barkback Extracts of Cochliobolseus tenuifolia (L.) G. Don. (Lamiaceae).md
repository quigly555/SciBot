## Abstract
We report a case of a healthy 30-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who presented with a dyspnea, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and abdominal pain for at least two weeks. He had a past medical history, including a past medical history that included anorexia, bulimia, and anorexia. He had a past medical history in addition to his RA, involving a cough and a cough that was excluded through computed tomography imaging. He had a normal BMI and house dust sampling, and biopsy results showed a polyuria. RA was diagnosed based on chest imaging, which showed a polyuria. RA was successfully treated with co-trimoxazole (30 days). This case illustrates the importance of recognizing a rare RA as an early riserimento and taking care of an important condition like this one.

•A healthy patient may present with a history, with RA, that involves a cough and/or a chest imaging deficit. •A medical history, history of RA, includes a recent diagnosis of a cough and/or a chest imaging deficit. •A history of RA includes a recent diagnosis of a chest imaging deficit. •An existing medical history, history of a RA, includes a biopsy, multiple sources of imaging, and a treatment response. •A treatment response is required for a patient with a medical history of a medical emergency, involving multiple sources of imaging.


## Introduction
The incidence of human fungal infections has increased dramatically over the past decades and is now thought to be increasing in both developing countries and in non-developed countries.1,2 As a consequence of the increase in the number of patients at risk, serious fungal infections have become more common. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common filamentous fungus causing invasive infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, in both Europe and North America.3,4 Most invasive fungal infections are caused by Candida albicans, followed by Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus.6 However, Cryptococcus gattii is less common than Candida albicans and C. neoformans, but it is now the most common fungal species causing systemic infections in AIDS patients.7 Although Candida albicans is a common cause of invasive candidiasis, C. albicans remains the most common cause of systemic candidiasis in patients with AIDS.8,9 It is also important to note that cryptococcal infections are usually diagnosed in immunocompromised patients with an unfavorable host immune status, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic lung disease.8 In contrast, C. neoformans is more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients with an unfavorable immune status, such as those with HIV/AIDS.10 It is a well-known fact that the antifungal susceptibility of patients is largely dependent on the cellular and molecular mechanisms used by the host to control fungal infections.11

Despite the fact that most antifungal agents are ineffective against C.


## Methods
(2015) and Sampaalan et a. (2016). The antimicrobial activities of the extract from an Arabidopsis plant (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (S. cerevisiae) were determined as described by Arora et al. (2007) and Sampaalan et al. (2016). The extracts of the leaf of a cotyledons were subjected to PDB analysis and the antimicrobial activities of the extract of the leaf of one of the first barked trees was determined as described by Ghosh et al. (2016).

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the Extract of Caspofungin from Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) of C. albicans

The antimicrobial activity of the extract of Caspofungin (CAS) from Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDA) of C. albicans was determined as described by Chatterjee et al. (2005) and Singh et al. (2014). The antimicrobial activity of the extract of Caspofungin from M. oryzae (M. oryzae) of C. albicans was determined as described by Chatterjee et al. (2005) and Kumar et al. (2014). The antimicrobial activity of the extract of Caspofungin from the leaf of the first barked tree was determined as described by Chatterjee et al. (2005).

2.4. Antifungal Activity of the Extract of Candida Strain of C. albicans

The antimicrobial activity of the extract of Candida albicans was determined as described by Zhou et al. (2015) and Gupta et al. (2012). The antimicrobial activity of the extract of C. albicans was determined as described by Zhou et al. (2015).

2.5. Antifungal Activity of the Extract of Caspofungin from Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDBA) of C. albicans

The antifungal activity of the extract of Caspofungin from Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDBA) of C. albicans was determined as described by Amr et al. (2015).


## Results

The antimicrobial activities of all the extracts were compared with the MIC values for the different species of Candida sp. (Table 3). The results are shown in Table 4. The extracts showed the antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. aureus B-27, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis. The extracts were also more active against C. neoformans and C. albicans. The maximum activity was observed in extracts from barkback plants and barkback bark extract from Cathartic Root. The best activity was observed in extracts from Barkback (Table 4). The best activity was found in barkback bark extract from Cathartic Root (Table 4).

The antimicrobial activities of all the extracts from the barkback bark extract from Cathartic Root were compared with the MIC values. The MIC values of the extracts for the different species of Candida spp. were as follows: C. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis B-27, and C. albicans (Table 5).

The antimicrobial activities of all the extracts from the barkback bark extract from Cathartic Root were compared with the MIC values for the different species of Candida spp. (Table 6). The MIC values of the extracts for the different species of Candida spp. were as follows: C. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis B-27, C. parapsilosis B-28, C. parapsilosis B-29, C. parapsilosis B-30, C. parapsilosis B-31, and C. parapsilosis B-32. The MIC values of the extracts for the different species of Candida spp. were as follows: C. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis B-27, C. parapsilosis B-28, C. parapsilosis B-29, C. parapsilosis B-31, and C. parapsilosis B-32. The MIC values of the extracts for the different species of Candida spp. were as follows: C. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis B-27, C.


## Discussion

The antimicrobial activity of bark extracts from barkback species of South American Barkback (Carcinarius chinensis, Penicillium sympodialis, and Penicillium chrysogenum) was evaluated against three Gram-positive bacterial strains, including . coli ATCC 25918, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 25918, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 25918. The antimicrobial activities of bark extracts of three barkback species, C. chinensis, C. sympodialis, and Penicillium chrysogenum, were reported previously by Asdrubaluddin et al. [14]. However, this study showed that the crude bark extracts from C. chinensis and Penicillium chrysogenum had the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Furthermore, the activity of bark extract against the Gram-positive bacteria, including M.tuberculosis was only reported in vitro [14].

The activity of bark extracts from C. chinensis, C. sympodialis, and Penicillium chrysogenum against the bacterial strains ranged from 24 to 28 µg/mL, which was significantly higher than the activities reported by Khan et al. [14]. However, in this study, the activity of bark extract against the Gram-negative bacteria, including B. subtilis, C. albicans, and C. neoformans, was only observed in vitro.

A previous study has demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of a variety of bark and its extracts has been evaluated in the laboratory. However, the only information on this study is the data reported in the current investigation.

The antibacterial activity of bark extract from C. chinensis was significantly higher than that of bark extract from Penicillium chrysogenum and other bark species. This could be due to the fact that the bark and its bark extract were traditionally used in folk medicine and ethnical practices. The antibacterial activity of the bark extracts of C. chinensis and Penicillium chrysogenum was highest in the presence of fengycin, a known antibiotic, and a-lopadiazine, two antimicrobial agents commonly used in folk medicine and ethnical practices [15]. However, this study showed that the bark extract of C. chinensis had the lowest activity against E.
