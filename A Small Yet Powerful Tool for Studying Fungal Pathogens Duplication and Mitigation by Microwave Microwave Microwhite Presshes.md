## Abstract
Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible to infections caused by Candida albicans, an important fungal pathogen in humans. Although Candida is the second most common cause of liver disease in Japan, there is limited data on the prevalence and incidence of infections caused by this fungus.

A retrospective chart review of patients with liver cirrhosis admitted to the Hospital of Aityi Mineito from March 2012 to April 2016 at the National Key Laboratory of Laboratorio Sanitario of Mineito were included. Data on the prevalence of infections caused by C. albicans and C. glabrata were collected and analyzed. Differences in the prevalence of infections among the groups were analyzed.


## Introduction
Biofilm is a complex microbial community consisting of a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM) and a non-self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) (1). Biofilm formation is one of the major pathogenic processes of microbial pathogens. Biofilm formation is associated with increased rates of hospitalization, decreased survival rates, increased costs for patient care, and increased length of hospital stays (2). The increased cost of hospitalization and treatment, increased risk of serious adverse events, and increased length of hospital stays, together drive up costs for various treatments (3, 4). The ability of microbial cells to form biofilms often leads to an increase in antibiotic usage (5). Efficient and continuous biofilm formation can reduce antibiotic usage and, in turn, antibiotic resistance (6).

There are few studies investigating the structure of biofilms in vivo. In vitro biofilm formation is mainly influenced by the availability of nutrients and by the immune status of the host (7). The characteristics and mechanisms of biofilm formation are largely unknown in vivo, but the discovery of such mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic strategies for infection and antibiotic resistance. In addition, biofilm formation is only an initial step in the process, and the biofilm formation process can have long-term consequences (8, 9).


## Methods
The technique was first applied to marine cultures of the fungi of the genus Ascomycetes and the species of the species Pestalotiomycetes (Table 1. For this purpose, the microwaves were inoculated with a sterile water suspension of the fungi of the genus Pestalotiomycetes and the inoculated with a sterile water suspension of Pestalotiomycetes. The method of the composition of the microwaves is described in Table 1. The method of preparation of the inoculum was described in Table 1.


## Results
The microwave radiation was estimated to be a combination of microwave radiation, microwave irradiation, UV irradiation, UV-A, UV-B, UV-C, and microwave radiation (Figure 3. In order to understand the contribution of microwave radiation to the host infection, we used a model in which the host was either a pre-formed tree (Figure 4), or a cut-off of radiation (Figure 4). The cut-off cut-off for the analysis of the effect of microwave radiation on the plant was set at 0.5 µM (Figure 4). The experiment was repeated for 100,000 generations of the rice cultivar in which the plant had been used as a host. The plant was infected with an average of 21.8 × 10^6 yeast cells per gram of root tissue per day (average diameter of mycelium of 4.3 × 10^5 µm) and was killed by approximately 70% (data not shown). However, a total of 35,000 yeast cells were detected per gram of root tissue per day (average diameter of mycelium of 4.9 × 10^5 µm). The average diameter of the root tissue was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the plant (average diameter of 5.3 × 10^3 µm). This suggests that the microwave radiation may have a large impact on the plant virulence. The plant was infected with an average of 30.7 × 10^3 yeast cells per gram of root tissue per day (average diameter of mycelium of 4.6 × 10^5 µm), while the average diameter of the root tissue was significantly lower (p<0.05) than that of the plant (average diameter of 5.3 × 10^3 µm). This suggests that microwave radiation may have a large impact on the plant virulence.

To determine the effect of the microwave radiation on the plant, a synthetic aqueous medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose, pH 7.5) was used for the generation of the plants. The irradiation was set at 0.5 µM and the plant was killed by approximately 70% (data not shown). The average diameter of the plant was significantly lower (p<0.


## Discussion
2 MB.

The majority of available fungal pathogenome data is derived from a single strain collection, and only few strains are capable of producing melanin. In contrast, the only studies that provide information about the biology of a fungal pathogen are from two strains of the same fungus. For the first time, we were able to compare the fungal species represented by a single strain collection, namely the DSS. We found that the melanin production of the mutant is similar to that of a strain isolated from a commercial DSS and the strain isolated from a patient with sepsis. We were able to demonstrate that melanin production is required for virulence in a murine systemic infection model. The mutant does not produce any of the tested phenolic compounds, such as phenolic hydroxyl and flavanoids, which are produced by Mucor circinelloides, a fungus known to produce melanin [52].

We were able to predict which of the three strains from the same patient were virulent and to compare them with the clinical isolates of other fungi. The melanin production of the mutant was comparable to that of a strain isolated from a patient with sepsis, which produced a compound called melanin-1. This compound is produced by A. bisporus, the cause of systemic candidiasis in humans and the cause of systemic candidiasis in mice [53]. The mutant produced higher levels of pigmentation than that of the mutant isolated from a patient with sepsis, and the mutant produced higher levels of melanin than that of the mutant isolated from a patient with sepsis.

The production of melanin by the mutant isolated from the same patient was similar to that of a strain isolated from a patient with sepsis. The mutant produced higher levels of pigmentation than that of the mutant isolated from a patient with sepsis. This compound was also produced by A. bisporus, the cause of systemic candidiasis in humans and the cause of systemic candidiasis in mice [54]. In addition, a strain isolated from a patient with sepsis produced a compound called melanin-2. This compound was produced by A. bisporus, the cause of systemic candidiasis in humans and the cause of systemic candidiasis in mice [55].

We found that the mutant produced higher levels of melanin than the strains isolated from different patients. This compound was produced by A.
