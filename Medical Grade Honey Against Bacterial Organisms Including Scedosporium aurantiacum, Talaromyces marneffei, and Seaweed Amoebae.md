## Abstract
The ability of microorganisms to colonise and develop resistance to their antibiotics is a prerequisite for development of new and more effective antibiotics. The chemotactic activity of the potent antibiotics produced by microorganisms is of great interest for the development of antibiotic drugs. The present review discusses the potential of microorganisms to produce antibiotics that are both broad-spectrum and potent enough to fight microbial infections and to explore the mechanisms behind their potent antimicrobial activity. With this in mind, this review focuses on the chemical constituents of the most potent antibiotic produced by the fungal kingdom. The antimicrobial activity of this chemical group is considered for the first time for the synthesis of the potent antibiotic penicillin.


## Introduction
Progressive degeneration of the optic nerve has been described in different studies. Dyskinesia, loss of function and loss of sight, loss of ocular ocular contact, and loss of neuronal motility are the major symptoms of progressive degeneration of the optic nerve. The major pathological presentation of the optic neuritis (ON) is the optic parenchyma and loss of sight. The optic neuritis (ON) is a diffuse progressive progressive myopia [1]. In the literature, no studies have focused on the differential diagnosis and treatment of ON. In general, the optic neuropathy (ON) is classified as optic neuropathy of the optic disc. Ophthalmological manifestations of ON include myopia, discoloration, and chorioretinal degeneration [2].

There are no studies on the optic neuropathy (ON) in the context of optic neuropathy. In this study, the optic neuropathy (ON) of the optic disc is included. The diagnosis of ON is based on clinical findings and the data of neuroimaging studies.


## Methods
All samples were stored at room temperature for 24 h and then stored at 4 °C for further us.

Honey samples (1 mL) were diluted with 1 mL of sterile distilled water and homogenized in sterile water for 15 min. The homogenate was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was then added to 2 mL of distilled water. The samples were centrifuged and washed with 1 mL of distilled water before adding the final 1 mL of 0.9% NaOH solution. The samples were again vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was then added to 2 mL of chloroform/methanol (10:1) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged and washed with 1 mL of distilled water before adding the final 1 mL of chloroform/methanol. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was then transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. The resulting supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. The resulting supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. Finally, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. The resulting supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. Finally, the sample was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. The resulting supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. Finally, the sample was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution. Finally, the sample was then transferred to a new tube and then to a new tube containing 0.9% NaOH solution.


## Results
grandiflorus, . parvum, E. kreisii, E. osmophila, and E. vietnami showed the strongest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, the dermatophytes, and the bacteria, in comparison with the honey of the other honey (Table 1). In particular, the honey of E. parvum showed the strongest antibacterial activity against the dermatophytes, and the honey of E. kreisii showed the weakest antibacterial activity against S. aureus.

In addition, the honey of E. parvum and E. parvum + E. kreisii showed the strongest antibacterial activity against the bacteria, in particular, against E. dermatophytes, and the honey of E. kreisii showed the weakest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, and the honey of E. kreisii showed the weakest antibacterial activity against E. vietnami. However, the honey of E. kreisii showed the strongest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, and the honey of E. parvum showed the weakest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, which was more pronounced than that of the other honey.

The honey of E. grandiflorus and E. parvum + E. kreisii showed the strongest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, the dermatophytes, and the bacteria, in comparison with the honey of the other honey.

In addition, the honey of E. parvum and E. kreisii showed the strongest antibacterial activity against the bacteria, in particular, against the S. aureus, and the honey of E. parvum + E. kreisii showed the weakest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, and the honey of E. parvum + E. kreisii showed the strongest antibacterial activity against S. aureus, which was more pronounced than that of the other honey.

## Discussion
It was reported that honey was more effective against Pseudomonas syringae and Staphylococcus epidermidis than Salmonella typhimurium [29.

While the results of the other studies are presented in Figure 3, we found that the honey was more effective against C. neoformans and C. gattii than against C. albicans. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. albicans than against C. neoformans [30].

We found that honey was more effective against C. albicans than against C. gattii. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. gattii than against C. neoformans [31].

In the present study, we found that honey was more effective against C. neoformans than C. albicans. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. albicans than C. neoformans [32]. In addition, we found that honey was more effective against Scedosporium aurantiacum than against Scedosporium higginsianum. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against Scedosporium species than against C. albicans.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that honey could be more effective against C. albicans than against Scedosporium aurantiacum.

In previous studies, honey was more effective against C. albicans than against C. deuterogattii [33]. However, it was reported that honey was more effective against C. deuterogattii than against C. deuterogattii. Our study showed that honey was more effective against C. deuterogattii than against C. deuterogattii.

We found that the honey showed better antifungal activity against C. neoformans and C. gattii than against C. albicans. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. neoformans than against C. albicans.

In the present study, we found that honey was more effective against C. neoformans than against C. albicans. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. albicans than against C. albicans. In the previous studies, honey was more effective against C. albicans than C.
