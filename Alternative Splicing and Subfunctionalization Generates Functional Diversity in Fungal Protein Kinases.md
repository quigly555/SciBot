## Abstract
The fungal kingdom contains a diversity of symbiotic and antagonistic fungi that are part of a widespread symbiotic biota. Both symbiotic and antagonistic fungi utilize unique mechanisms to avoid host immunity. The high level of sequence similarity between the A. fumigatus genome and the respective subfamilies of fungi highlights the antagonistic symbiotic biota that is one of the most diverse groups of eukaryotes known to date. We examined the occurrence and the evolution of the symbiotic symbiosis during the evolution of symbiotic algae and fungi. We have identified the main factors that contributed to the occurrence of antagonistic symbiotic algae and fungi in the evolution of the A. fumigatus genome. The results provide the context for future studies on the symbiotic biota and we propose the evolutionary relationships between symbiotic algae and fungi.


## Introduction
They were first characterized from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans PTK1 (also called PTK2) [6], [7] and were recently described from mammals and plants [8. Compared to other fungi, the PTK class has been found only from bacteria and yeasts [9]. Compared to their animal counterparts, they have been found in fungi and protists, e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans, and their role is to disrupt the integrity of cell membranes. In contrast to their animal counterparts, the fungal PTK are active in bacteria [10], [11], [12] and plants [13] and have been found in fungi, e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans, and E. coli. In addition, the PTK family is involved in fungi-specific processes such as cell cycle progression, cell division, and cell death [14]. The presence of fungal PTKs is also associated with their ability to generate membrane-enclosed ‘hybrid’ cells with altered gene expression [15].

In the case of PTKs, they play important roles in diverse processes such as cell cycle control, signal transduction, and cell morphology regulation [16], [17]. In addition to their role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, the ability of fungi to generate ‘hybrid’ cells with altered gene expression is also associated with their ability to regulate the expression of different transcription factors such as TSLP. TSLP is a large glycoprotein (also called a-mannan) that is secreted as part of the fungal cell membrane. When bound to the fungal cell wall, TSLP binds to the conserved fungal-specific protein kinase (Bck1) and activates the downstream signaling cascades, such as Rim101, Rim16, Rim9, and Cph1 [18]. This regulatory activity is also mediated by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (Hda1 and Hda2) [19], [20]. HAT has two primary functions. First, HAT activates the transcriptional response through histone deacetylase (HDAC) and acetyltransferase (EC2) [21].


## Methods

Functional enrichment analysis of microtubules in . pedrosoi in vitro
The microtubules of F. pedrosoi (F. vulgare) were cultured in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at 28 °C in a shaker incubator (200 rpm) in the dark. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS to remove the medium, and then resuspended in the appropriate medium to obtain a final volume of 2 × 10^4 cells/ml. For each strain, 50 µl of cell suspension was plated on PDA and incubated for 48 h at 28 °C. Cells were then collected and washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were cultivated in a C-99 medium (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol at 37 °C. The microtubules were then harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. After cell lysis by the addition of ice-cold methanol, the cells were resuspended in PBS and the number of colony forming units (CFU) was determined.

For the microtubules in F. graminearum, the microtubules were cultured in MGY-T liquid medium at 28 °C for 24 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. Then, the cells were resuspended in PBS and the number of CFU was determined.

## Results
oxysporum genome encodes a number of fungal protein kinases (NCKs) and genes involved in cell cycle, cell polarity, mating, virulence, and pathogenicit. In this study, we used the F. oxysporum genome sequence and functional analysis to address the potential role of the Fusarium fungal protein kinase (FpKm1) in cell cycle, cell polarity, mating, virulence, and pathogenicity.

The FpKm1 gene was found to be syntenic to a number of F. graminearum and F. oxysporum protein kinase genes (Figure 4). The FpKm1 protein was composed of two cysteine-rich domains, and it contained four serine-rich domains (Figure 4A). The FpKm1 protein was highly conserved in all three fungal species. The number of FpKm1 protein kinases in F. graminearum was higher than that in F. oxysporum. FpKm1 protein kinases were also found to be more highly conserved in the two basidiomycete species, but the distribution of FpKm1 protein kinases was slightly different (Figure 4B). The FpKm1 protein kinase sequence is found to be more highly conserved in the three basidiomycetes than in the other three basidiomycetes. It was found to be most similar to the fungal protein kinases from basidiomycete fungi, but it was not found to be highly conserved in the other three basidiomycete species.

## Discussion
This is particularly important when BLASTX is applied to proteins of interest for the analysis of other protein. For this reason, we have employed BLASTX to search for functional groups in the Fungal Protein Kinase (FPK) database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi? searchType=FPK+). Functional analysis was performed using BLASTX using S. cerevisiae as the query. The results showed that the FK paralogs of S. cerevisiae contain the conserved domain FKBP-2 (Fig 7). BLASTX searches showed that only FKBP-2 is present in the Fungal Protein Kinase (FPK) database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi? searchType=FPK+). However, FKBP-2 protein kinase was not found in any of the other proteins analyzed. However, the proteins of the FK paralogs, FKBP-2 and FKBP-3, were not found in the Fungal Protein Kinase (FPK) database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi? searchType=FPK+). The FK paralogs are highly conserved and contain the conserved domain FKBP-1-like (FKBP-1,FKBP-3,FKBP-4,FKBP-5,FKBP-6,FKBP-7,FKBP-8 and FKBP-9-like (FKBP-10-like) domains). They are therefore highly conserved and thus they are candidates for functional analysis in fungi.

Phylogenetic analysis of the protein kinases in Fungal Protein Kinase
The fungal kinases contain a large number of conserved domains and a large number of functional groups. The Fungal Protein Kinase (FPK) database contains more than 20,000 protein-coding genes (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi? searchType=FPK+).
