## Abstract
The impact of diet on immunity has been traditionally estimated to be in the range of 0.25% to 0.25%. Although the exact number of individuals affected has yet to be fully determined, one individual in particular has raised the question of whether a diet rich in different animal proteins is a risk factor for developing a pathogenic infection. To determine this individual’s knowledge, we performed a retrospective study and compared the incidence, outcome, and associations between dietary animal protein and immune status in 50 individuals with AIDS or other common immunodeficiency states. The AIDS-associated immune status was determined by the use of a validated virological method, such as direct virological testing or biopsy, or by using the Cryptococcus gattii panel, a non-invasive, multiplexed immunodeficiency assay, used to identify individuals with a diagnosis of the infection. The primary and secondary outcomes were determined, and associations between dietary animal protein and the following evaluated, were compared between individuals.

Among the 489 individuals with a diagnosis of infection, we identified 163 (61%) as being immunodeficient; 169 (65%) had an A/H IgG antibody response and 97 (38%) had a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/mm3. In the adjusted odds ratio analysis, we found that the presence of a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 100 cells/mm3 was associated with an 8% (95%CI: 1.7-100) and 27% (95%CI: 2.6-81) increased risk for developing a pathogenic infection. In the Cox regression analysis, we found no association between the presence of a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 100 cells/mm3 and a higher risk of developing a pathogenic infection.


## Introduction
During the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the development of new antifungal agents with low toxicity and biological activity against fungal cells. These agents have the ability to inhibit many different classes of fungal cells, including the classes of hyphal, mycelium, and yeast cells, and are also considered to be potential therapeutic targets [1]. In this regard, several new antifungal compounds have been developed with novel mechanisms of action. Thus, in this review, the most common antifungal agents are reviewed, the mechanisms of action are discussed, and the potential for development of novel antifungal agents are discussed.


## Methods
. Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for sub-MIC, MIC1 and MIC2 were determined as previously described (11). In brief, the MICs of each tested compound were compared with that of the growth control.

2.2. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
The GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-MS-Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a 5.0 µm ID, 1.3 µm id, and 4.8 µm id detector (Shimadzu, Japan).


## Results
musculus murine fumarinin . The results shown in Fig 1B indicate that the FHA and AMP interactions are not evident in the presence of FHA and AMP, respectively. However, the FHA and AMP interactions can be observed in the presence of the FHA and AMP, and are evident in the presence of the M. musculus murine fumarinin A. The FHA and AMP interactions were also observed in the presence of FHA and AMP. These data suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions may be crucial for the M. musculus fumarinin A.

The FHA and AMP interactions were also observed in the presence of FHA and AMP, and were also observed in the presence of the M. musculus murine fumarinin A. These data suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions are critical for the F. graminearum Fusarium virulence and fungal growth.

The FHA and AMP interactions were also observed in the presence of the M. musculus murine fumarinin A. These data suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions may be critical for the fungal growth.

The FHA and AMP interactions are also observed in the presence of the M. musculus murine fumarinin A. These data suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions may be critical for the fungal growth.

The FHA and AMP interactions were also observed in the presence of the M. musculus murine fumarinin A. These data suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions are critical for the fungal growth.

These results suggest that the FHA and AMP interactions may be critical for the fungal growth.

In the FFA of the F. graminearum Fusarium virulence assay, the fungal biomass was determined by using the checkerboard assay, the assay was performed in the presence of the fluconazole, the assay was performed in the presence of FFA and the assays were repeated.


## Discussion
 2014. The role of these two enzymes in the myriocin pathway has been investigated in several myriocin-producing genera, including Malassezia, M. fijiensis, and P. brasiliensis (Ocahun et al., 2012; Hayashi and Nakase, 2013; Takahashi and Nakase, 2013; Bandara et al., 2015; Wijayawardene et al., 2015; & Sathya et al., 2017). Furthermore, this study revealed that the M. restricta myriocin gene family underwent an expansion in the M. fijiensis genome compared to the M. sympodialis genome. These results are consistent with the phylogenetic relationships of the M. sympodialis genes (Fig 5). The M. sympodialis myriocin is a flavus-specific gene family that encodes two isoforms, a catalytic and a non-canonical protein-protein interaction domain and a PKS-like protein domain (Vega et al., 2013). The first isoform, named as Mg_0022, is present in most M. sympodialis strains and has been shown to be functionally similar to the PKS-like protein domain of T. rubrum (Rousk et al., 2003). The second isoform, named as Mg_0023, is present in a few other M. sympodialis strains and has been shown to be involved in pathogenic functions in the insect pathogenic M. sympodialis, M. gypseum, and M. restricta (Sathya et al., 2017). This suggests that Mg_0023 might be a novel gene family in M. sympodialis.

To date, a few examples of gene family expansions in the myriocin pathway have been reported, including the Dgl-mediated sugar-reduction protein Cpk1-like protein (MtCBP1), a dsRNA-dependent gene family in M. sympodialis, and the Dgl-associated protein Dgl1-like gene (Dgl2). These results suggest that the Dgl-mediated sugar-reduction pathway might be conserved in M. sympodialis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report gene family expansion in the myriocin pathway of M. sympodialis.
