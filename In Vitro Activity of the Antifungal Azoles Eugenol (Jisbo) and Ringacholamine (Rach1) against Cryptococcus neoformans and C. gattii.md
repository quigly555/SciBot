## Abstract
Ascotricha is a soil-born fungus, but the mycobiota is also important in its survival and pathogenesis. Soil is an abundant environmental fungal organelle, with a high level of genetic diversity. However, the mechanisms of mycotoxin biosynthesis in soil are poorly understood.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of mycosis affecting mainly people working in agriculture and forestry. The main etiological agents are Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, two major species of the genus Cryptococcus. Cryptococcosis is mainly caused by inhalation of the yeast form into the lungs from which it is usually acquired by inhalation of desiccated yeasts or spores. The initial stages of infection in humans are usually asymptomatic and usually cause mild or even no symptoms. However, if the organism becomes immunocompromised, the disease can progress to primary meningoencephalitis and life-threatening meningoencephalitis.

The major agents of cryptococcal meningitis are Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, two major species of the genus Cryptococcus. Cryptococcus neoformans, a saprophytic yeast, is more common than Cryptococcus gattii in blood culture results and is responsible for more than 90% of cases. The main etiological agents of cryptococcosis are Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, two major species of the genus Cryptococcus. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans are two closely related species of the genus Cryptococcus. C. neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii are most commonly isolated from pigeon droppings and decaying wood. Cryptococcus neoformans is most commonly isolated from the skin of pigeons and decaying wood. C. gattii is most commonly isolated from the lung of dogs and cats and is responsible for more than 70% of cases. The other major species of the genus Cryptococcus include C. gattii, C. neoformans, and C. deneoformans. C. gattii causes cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and is responsible for 15-20% of cases in AIDS patients. C. deneoformans is rare but is the most prevalent species, with a worldwide distribution, which has been reported from India, China, and the United States. Cryptococcal deneoformans was first identified in Japan in 1940 and was first isolated from Dutchmanne Chevaux in 1943.


## Methods
The results showed that the anti-cryptococcus activity of the ringacholamine and azole-ringacholamine compounds, respectively, was increased by 20% compared to the control compound, which was considered as the more potent control compoun. The results showed that the azoles and ringacholamine compounds are effective against C. gattii.

C. gattii strain H99 was used as a control for its antifungal activity. The test compounds were prepared in DMSO (diluted with d_3-d_4) and serially diluted in the ratio of 10:1 (diluted with PBS) of the compound stock. The antifungal activity of the compounds were determined according to the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [27]. The results showed that the compounds were effective against C. gattii.

Antifungal activity of a solution of the azoles and ringacholamine was tested in a solution of phosphate buffer (PBS), a pure compound prepared in DMSO, which is usually used in the treatment of fungi [28]. The test compound was dissolved in PBS, and the result was observed as a white foam. The results showed that the solution was effective in the treatment of C. gattii.

The antifungal activity of the compounds were tested in a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (diluted with DMSO), a mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate and SDS, and a solution of sodium hydroxide (SOH) (diluted with DMSO). The test compound was dissolved in DMSO, and the result was observed as a white foam. The results showed that the solution was effective in the treatment of C. gattii.

C. gattii strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (ATCC^® CRL-32^® ATTC^®) and the reference strain of C. gattii ATCC 25923. The strains were cultured at 35°C in Vogel’s medium (1% glucose, 0.


## Results
neoformans and . gattii is summarized in Table 3. The results showed that the antifungal activity of the azoles Eugenol (Jisbo) and Ringacholamine (Rach1) against Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii was lower than the efficacy of the antifungal agents against C. neoformans and C. gattii, respectively. The antifungal activity of the azoles Eugenol (Jisbo) and Ringacholamine (Rach1) against C. neoformans was higher than the efficacy of the antifungal agents against C. gattii, which was not statistically significant.

Comparative Study of Antifungal Activity of the Antifungal Agents Against C. gattii
In order to compare the antifungal activity of the three azoles, we compared the results of the MIC values and MIC_50 values for the three azoles against C. gattii. The results showed that the MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 1.08 µg/ml, 1.24 µg/ml and 1.12 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 0.69 µg/ml, 0.99 µg/ml and 0.71 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 0.94 µg/ml, 0.97 µg/ml and 0.99 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 0.69 µg/ml, 0.99 µg/ml and 0.76 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 0.62 µg/ml, 0.67 µg/ml and 0.66 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 values of the three azoles against C. gattii were 0.62 µg/ml, 0.67 µg/ml and 0.66 µg/ml, respectively.


## Discussion
T. cruzi infection is the most common in the lung of infected individuals. T. cruzi infection is considered a nosocomial infection, and thus the mortality is also high [1]. In this study, we reported the survival of T. cruzi infected mice. In mice, T. cruzi-infected mice displayed increased mortality and increased resistance to the infection. The survival of T. cruzi-infected mice in mice infected with T. cruzi was significantly lower than that of mice infected with C. neoformans alone, which was in contrast to the survival in mice infected with C. neoformans and A. fumigatus alone. These results suggest that the innate immune response against T. cruzi infection is complex and not controlled by the infection itself.
