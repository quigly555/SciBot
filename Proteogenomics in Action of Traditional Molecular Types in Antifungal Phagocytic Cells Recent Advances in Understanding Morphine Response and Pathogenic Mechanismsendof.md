## Abstract
The purpose of the current study was to investigate the possible effects of tigecycline on the antifungal activity of two different drugs (incline and flucytosine) in the antifungal activity assay (AFISA) for the yeast strains A5-1 and A5-2. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of tigecycline were determined. The lowest concentration of 64 µg/mL was obtained for the drug A5-4 at 0.04 µg/mL. The lowest concentration of 128 µg/mL was obtained for the drug A5-5 at 0.12 µg/mL. The drug was inactive against the tested yeast strains. The lowest concentration of 64 µg/mL was obtained for the drug A5-4 at 0.04 µg/mL.


## Introduction
The development of immunotherapies and/or vaccines directed at a specific immune-related pathway is a relatively recent development and still important subjec. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that immunotherapies with defined targets may exhibit protection against invasive fungal infections and that they may also protect against other fungal infections. Such approaches are relevant to the development of anti-fungal vaccines.

Candida albicans is a member of the normal flora of humans and the mucosal microbiome. It is a major opportunistic human pathogen and causes deep infections in immunologically intact patients. While the mortality of deep infections is low, the mortality rate from invasive candidiasis was reported to be as high as 80% in developed countries. Although no vaccine is currently available to prevent candidiasis, antifungal drugs such as flucytosine, voriconazole, and amphotericin B, have been used for decades [1].

The World Health Organization has listed Candida albicans as an emerging opportunistic fungal pathogen and makes it a “Tier 1” priority. Antibiotic therapy for systemic candidiasis is mainly done through the use of triazoles, which inhibit ergosterol and cholesterol synthesis. Other antifungal agents include the echinocandins, the azoles, and the pyrimidine analogues [2]. However, these agents are often toxic and have a low bioavailability [3]. Moreover, azole resistance is increasing and echinocandins are used as a second line therapy. The recent progress in antifungal therapy and the increasing resistance of azole-resistant Candida species to these agents have been linked to the use of echinocandins in the current therapy.

Among these agents, the echinocandins are one of the most used in the treatment of superficial and invasive fungal infections. They are small polysaccharides with a relatively long half-life, which can inhibit both the growth and the synthesis of ergosterol [4].


## Methods
neoformans strains and media are listed in Table . C. neoformans strains and media used in this study were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 30°C for 7 days.

Microscopic observation
Fungal structures were observed under a Nikon SMZ1500 dissecting microscope with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 instrument. Staining with DAPI (1% in PBS, 1% in ethanol) was used as a fluorescent stain for the microscopy.

RNA extraction and RNA purification
Total RNA was extracted from fungal cells using a modified CTAB method [28]. The size distribution of the total RNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The quantity and quality of total RNA was analyzed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Western blot
Cell-free supernatants of C. neoformans strains and media were collected, and proteins were isolated using the RiboPure™ Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method [29].

To determine the levels of phospholipase activity, supernatants of C. neoformans strains and media were harvested, washed twice with HBSS and then boiled in NaCl buffer (20 mM Na_2HPO_4, 10 mM KH_2PO_4, pH 7.4) at a ratio of 10:1. The supernatant was transferred to a 50 mM nitrate-buffered solution (pH 5.5) and then loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were blocked with 5% skim milk/1% Tween 20 (SDS) for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to observe the bands of phospholipase activity. The bands were excised from the gel and blotted using the NucleoSpin Gel for Western Blotting (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

## Discussion
neoformans sp. and S. cerevisiae in vitro, the results we observed were in contrast to previous studies that have reported that HapX does not affect the expression of putative genes encoding the main virulence factors of C. neoformans (Stackebrandt et al., 2014; Pfeiffer and Hamer, 2014). The difference in the two studies is that we did not examine the ability of HapX to directly activate a specific transcription factor to produce S. cerevisiae spp., which is consistent with previous findings that HapX specifically regulates the expression of genes encoding spp. in C. neoformans (Stackebrandt et al., 2014). Our study confirmed the importance of HapX in the pathogenic potential of C. neoformans. It also indicated that the induction of S. cerevisiae spp. is dependent on HapX in the presence of HapX and that this is not the case for C. neoformans.

In contrast to the impact of HapX deletion on C. neoformans spp. and S. cerevisiae spp. expression, the deletion of HapX did not significantly change the transcription of C. neoformans spp. However, the expression of the genes encoding the major virulence factors of C. neoformans is impaired in S. cerevisiae, consistent with a role for HapX in this pathway (Liu et al., 2016). In addition, the difference in the expression of genes encoding the major virulence factors of C. neoformans is similar to previous reports that show HapX plays a role in the pathogenic potential of C. neoformans (Liu et al., 2016). Thus, our results suggest that HapX is required for the induction of S. cerevisiae spp. and S. cerevisiae spp. expression in addition to the major virulence factors of C. neoformans.

Despite the fact that C. neoformans is a heterothallic species, several studies have shown that sexual reproduction has a positive correlation with virulence in this species (Ganagone et al., 2010). In contrast, S.
