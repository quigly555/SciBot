## Abstract
In the past decade, fungal infections have been increasing worldwide. Current antifungal therapies have included multiplex liposomal amphotericin and voriconazole, which are approved for treating a broad range of uncommon or recalcitrant infections. The efficacy of these agents has steadily increased over the past decade, and is recommended as an option for regaining or modifying medications that are failing in treating these fungal infections. However, the use of animal models of treatment of invasive fungal infections is rare and relatively unknown.

We prospectively enrolled adult and pediatric patients with fever and severe sinusitis who had undergone computed tomography (CT) of the head and/or neck at different time of treatment in a tertiary referral hospital. For each patient, we performed in vitro culture and in vivo antifungal assays.

We enrolled in the study a total of 54 subjects with fever and severe sinusitis who underwent in vitro CT. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years, they were all receiving amphotericin and voriconazole (total time 12 years, median therapy 5.0 years), with a favorable effect on elimination of fungi. After a median follow-up of 3.


## Introduction
Similar to the fungal cell wall, the fungal cell wall is composed of two interconnected layers: a layer composed of chitin and glucans and a layer composed of chitin and chitosan [23,24. In fact, fungal cell walls are usually considered as a foundation for the biopolymer properties of their substrates [20,25]. This is because of the presence of a chitin-binding protein (CBP) in their cell wall. This protein is called chitinase and is secreted to the extracellular space, where it forms a dimer [26,27].

Chitinases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a specific number of amino acids to the N-terminal glycine residue of target proteins [28,29,30]. These enzymes are also referred to as chitinases or glucanases [31,32,33]. Depending on the enzyme, they can be divided into both linear and monomeric enzymes [34]. Monomeric enzymes, such as chitinase, chitinaseII and chitinaseIII, are highly conserved [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. According to the most recent estimates, chitinase I and II belong to the same family as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans. Chitinase III, meanwhile, is in a monomer with chitinase gene [41]. Both enzymes are secreted to the extracellular space and after binding to the chitin-binding protein (CBP) chitin and glucan binding protein (CBP-CBP) in the extracellular space, they are transported to the extracellular space [43]. In fungi, chitinases are also secreted from the plasma membrane to the extracellular space [44]. In the cell wall, chitinase-encoding fungi share several common characteristics. For example, chitin is covalently attached to the cell wall and is sequentially released upon binding with ß-glucans [45].

This review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics of chitinase activity and chitosan production by the three main chitinases in fungi. The latter enzyme share functions in the cell wall, and their production is associated with some secreted enzymes.


## Methods
The soil organic matter (SOM) contents were calculated using the soil fractional carbon (SFF) (Chernoff and Miller, 2004) metho.

2.3. Study of Bacterial Diversity
To evaluate bacterial diversity, we collected samples from three tomato plants (Basidiomycetes, Phyllosphere, and Soil) that were susceptible to the different pathogens. The plant samples were divided into three parts (n = 2) and were surface sterilized with 0.85% NaCl to remove plant debris. The soil samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min and were air-dried in a moisture chamber. The bacterial cultures were harvested by lysis using a FastPrep-24 apparatus (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). The lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was removed. The bacterial pellet was washed with 0.85% NaCl and then diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The bacterial pellet was then vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 0.85% NaCl. The diluted bacterial pellet was further vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the lysate was collected again. The bacterial pellet was washed with 0.85% NaCl and then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 0.85% NaCl. The concentrated supernatant was then collected and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 0.85% NaCl. The supernatant was then collected and stored at -20°C until use.


## Results
Species richness (R^2) of plant microhabitats was higher in the phyllosphere than in the soil functional zone (p < .01). The fungal community in the phyllosphere is highly diverse with a higher diversity in the phyllosphere than in the soil functional zone. The fungal community in the soil functional zone was dominated by Fusarium verticilliodora (R^2 = 0.95, p = 0.0027) and Penicillum ellipsoideum (R^2 = 0.83, p < 0.01) (Fig 2). Fusarium verticilliodora was the only species of Fusarium known to be associated with the phyllosphere of tomato plants. The Penicillum ellipsoideum was found only in the phyllosphere and only in the soil functional zone. The highest richness of the fungal community in the phyllosphere and the highest richness in the soil functional zone was found in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone. The fungal community in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone was dominated by Aspergillus niger and Penicillum ellipsoideum, respectively. Aspergillus niger was isolated from the phyllosphere of tomato plants, while Penicillum ellipsoideum was isolated from the soil functional zone. Aspergillus niger was found in the phyllosphere of tomato plants and was the only species of Penicillum known to be associated with the soil of tomato plants. The highest richness of the fungal community in the phyllosphere and the highest richness in the soil functional zone was found in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone. The highest richness of the fungal community in the phyllosphere and the highest richness in the soil functional zone was found in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone. The highest richness of the fungal community in the phyllosphere and the highest richness in the soil functional zone was found in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone. The highest richness of the fungal community in the phyllosphere and the highest richness in the soil functional zone was found in the phyllosphere and the soil functional zone.


## Discussion
 2013. Our results showed that only bacteria and fungi were detected in soil after the initial composting of the plant tissue, but not after the initial application of the soil-derived organic carbon. Our results indicated that the soil-derived organic carbon was higher than the plant-derived organic carbon, which is consistent with previous results that showed the soil-derived organic carbon was higher than the plant-derived organic carbon (Cao et al., 2015).

During the initial composting, the total amount of carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon are different, which led us to speculate that the soil-derived organic carbon was higher than the plant-derived organic carbon. However, the amount of carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon remained similar. We found that the total amount of carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were similar, which suggests that the soil-derived organic carbon was lower than the plant-derived organic carbon. The difference in total organic carbon between the two soil-derived organic carbon and the plant-derived organic carbon were even larger. The amount of total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were 7.7 and 7.2% higher than the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon, respectively. The total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were 8.3 and 10.0% higher than the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon.

The total amount of carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were slightly different, which led us to speculate that the soil-derived organic carbon was lower than the plant-derived organic carbon. However, the amount of total carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were slightly lower than the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon. The difference in total carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon and the total organic carbon released from the soil-derived organic carbon were 8.6 and 8.
