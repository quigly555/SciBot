## Abstract
In addition to their capability to grow and develop in complex cultures, fungal species have also been important in mediating plant resistance to various plant-based phytochemical agents, including azoles, chromones, naphthacin, and pyridoxal. Among these classes of compounds, centrolidines, which are synthesized mainly by centroloside biosynthesis, have been reported for their ability to protect fungal pathogens against various biocontrol agents, including the fungus Candida albicans. However, their usage as biocontrol agents for fungal diseases has not been reported so far. In this study, we showed that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces centrolidines by growing under conditions of elevated temperature. The growth of the fungus was partially inhibited by the eugenol-rich media treated with centrolidines. Centrolid production was diminished in the presence of the exclusion of other stressors. Furthermore, the ergosterol concentration was increased in the presence of the exclusion of other stressors, and the inhibition of the activity of the enzyme was decreased in the presence of the centromere X-Pin system. These results suggest that centrolides are a promising biocontrol agent for yeast diseases caused by C. albicans.


## Introduction
The human respiratory tract contains a rich collection of antifungal drug targets including the leading echinocandins, azoles, and echinocandin. At a minimum, two major antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), and voriconazole (VRC), are limited by their fungistatic effects on the respiratory pathway and on many pathogenic fungi [15]. The antifungal drugs are not well characterized yet in terms of their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics [16]. Some molecules such as itraconazole, flucytosine, voriconazole, and posaconazole are able to inhibit the pathogen’s spores, fungi, and also the mycelial phase of the infection process [16], [17]. The drug targets the fungal cell wall and is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. However, the drug is not well characterized yet because of the involvement of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19 [16].

The goal of this work was to determine the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B (AMB) against fungal spores and fungi. AMB is a small central benzene imidazole derivative with an extended half-life of 15 to 20 h. It is well tolerated, and it is highly bioavailable. AMB is well absorbed and easily absorbed by the human host. AMB has low cytotoxicity and high absorption rate, and it is highly bioavailable, readily absorbed, and readily available. AMB is an excellent drug candidate because it has many pharmacological properties, including antifungal, antifungalism, antifungalism against, and antifungal against many microorganisms [18]. AMB has two modes of action: the cyclophilin E and the lysine-oxidase enzyme Cyrpilin [19]. Cyclophilins are membrane-bound enzymes that are mainly involved in the synthesis of membrane lipids and proteins, and the storage and excretion of these substances [20]. Cyclophilins have a low membrane-binding affinity and high lipid-binding affinity, making them useful drug targets. AMB has many inhibitors that can reduce its antifungal activities. The AMB has been extensively studied because of its great pharmacological properties.


## Methods
% NaCl at the beginning of the experimen. The mycelium was ground with a mortar and pestle, and the powder was extracted with 0.1% MeOH at the end of the experiment.

## Results
The concentration of organic compounds in soil is relatively high (less than 10^-3 g/L) as compared to the incidence of human disease [34], and for the majority of the industrial application of spraying techniques, cultivation facilities are controlled by the Agri-Carbohydrate Plant Development Administration (ICA) [35. The presence of bioactive compounds in the soil is considered beneficial for the crop development of A. terreus [36]. The levels of the microbial bioactive compounds in the soil are also considered desirable by the Muhannad Medical Center [37] and the Muhannad Agricultural Research Institute [38].

According to the results of the chemical analysis of the soil-derived metabolites, the compounds with the most significant chemical shifts were all the major compounds, namely, the diterpene aminotransferase (EC_50) (0.862, 7.934), diterpene esterase (EC_50), the dihydroxybenzene and diterpene esterase (EC_50) (0.927, 5.617), the ketone and 2,6-dimethoxyphenolone (KDP) (0.939, 4.972), and the pyroptide aminotransferase (EC_50) (0.941, 2.758). The most significant chemical shifts were found to be diterpene esterase (EC_50), ketone (0.939, 3.442), and pyroptide (EC_50) in the diterpene esterase and diterpene esterase compounds (0.919, 2.924), diterpene esterase (EC_50) in the pyroptide aminotransferase compounds (0.921, 1.689), diterpene esterase (EC_50) in the ketone and 2,6-dimethoxyphenolone (KDP) in the pyroptide aminotransferase compounds (0.


## Discussion
Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare disease in humans. Although rare, it is still a very serious condition, affecting up to 1 in 20 patients [1].
