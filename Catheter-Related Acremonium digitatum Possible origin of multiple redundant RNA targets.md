## Abstract
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening fungal infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. The fungal cell walls are deployed to protect the host from A. fumigatus infection. The cell walls are also deployed to protect A. fumigatus from the hostâ€™s immune system during invasive fungal infections. The cell wall-protecting effect of A. fumigatus on immune response to A. fumigatus was assessed. The serum albumin was determined by ELISA.


## Introduction
The genus Phylloporus includes more than 8000 species. Many of these have been described from the tropics, tropical, and subtropical regions worldwide [1]. Phylloporus was established by Eriksson and Petersen in 1963 for a phylloplane fungus, P. wickerhamii. Eriksson and Petersen regarded Phylloporus as a member of the closely related subfamilies Phylloplaca, Phylloporus, and Phylloplaca [2]. After the publication of the first epitype for Phylloporus in 1894, approximately 30 Phylloporus species were described from the United States [3]. In the early 1980s, Phylloporus species were recorded from various countries in the world.

In the last few years, many new records of Phylloporus from temperate regions and regions in the Northern Hemisphere have been reported, including five new records from Brazil, one from Colombia, one from Iran, one from Thailand, and one from Thailand [4-7]. The first Phylloporus record in Australia was described in 1894 from the same host country in Brazil. Eriksson and Petersen [8] concluded that the species were not yet accepted in Phylloporus, and transferred the type to Phyllosticta [4]. Since then, many Phylloporus records have been recorded in other hosts, e.g., from the states of Turkey, Iran, and China.

The genus Phylloporus was introduced by Eriksson and Petersen [2] for a spore forming fungus, P. wickerhamii.


## Methods
This approach uses a set of 4,000,000 orthologs, each of which has been assigned to the gene group of interest by a member of the corresponding grou. The alignment of these 4,000,000 orthologs is then used to align the 4,000,000 genome sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) and to the non-redundant protein database of the N. crassa genome sequence. The alignment is then used to query the non-redundant protein database by a BLAST search of the protein sequence with the reciprocal best BLAST hit. The resulting query sequences are then used to align the genome sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database and to the non-redundant protein database of the N. crassa genome sequence. The alignment of the two sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database is then used to align the genome sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database and to the non-redundant protein database of the N. crassa genome sequence. The resulting alignment of the two sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database is then used to search the non-redundant protein database of the N. crassa genome sequence. The resulting alignment of the two sequences of the selected orthologs to the non-redundant protein database is then used to search the non-redundant protein database of the N. crassa genome sequence.

Prediction of orthologs in the N. crassa genome
The orthologs found in the N. crassa genome were analyzed using a combination of BLAST and TBLASTN against the corresponding genome sequences (Supplementary Figure S2). The resulting alignments were then used to determine whether the proteins found in the N. crassa genome were present in at least one of the orthologous genes. The best orthologs from the selected orthologs in the N.

1.2. Biotyper Expression Pattern
In S. cerevisiae, B. bassiana does not contain a bifunctional RNA synthesis machinery, which could explain the lack of B. bassiana-specific B-type RNA synthesis in the cell. Therefore, we constructed two strains of B. bassiana (NKR-N10-B) that lack the bifunctional bifunctional RNA synthesis machinery (Fig 2A,B). B. bassiana is a closely related species and both encode the same B-type RNA synthesis machinery (CnTH1, see below).


## Discussion
As we have previously demonstrated, the RNA polymerase complex is involved in diverse cellular processes, such as DNA replication and repair, protein stability, protein trafficking and cell signaling [46], [47. Similarly, the RNA polymerase complex is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as the repair of damaged proteins and cell differentiation [48], [49]. The existence of multiple subunits of the RNA polymerase complex also suggests that this complex plays a role in many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, proliferation, and apoptosis [50].

The gene expression of the M. sympodialis genome was analyzed, and the genes coding for proteins involved in DNA replication and the repair of damaged DNA were induced and induced in the presence of RNA polymerase complex inhibitors. In contrast, the gene encoding a protein-protein interactions protein was only induced when RNA polymerase complex inhibitors were present in the fungus. This suggests that the RNA polymerase complex has a role in a variety of cellular processes.

Furthermore, the M. sympodialis genome is highly similar to the genomes of other fungal species [49]. The genome is composed of six transposable elements, which are typically present in the core fungal genome, and one large transposable element, which is usually present in the subunits of the RNA polymerase complex [49]. Transposable elements are often found in the genomes of species of Ascomycetes, Basidiomycota, and Saccharomycetales [51], [52], and this transposable element is one of the most common motifs in both Aspergillus and Saccharomycetales. However, the sequence of the transposable elements in M. sympodialis has been reported to be highly divergent, and it is possible that it has been lost or duplicated in some cases [53].

The data presented here provides additional evidence for the existence of multiple redundant genes in M. sympodialis, which are related to multiple essential cellular processes, including DNA replication and repair, in addition to the RNA polymerase complex.
