## Abstract
The emergence of antibiotic resistance in the antibiotic-sensitive (A2) and non-A2-resistant (UR) bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus prompted the identification of novel compounds that increase their antimicrobial activity against this bacterium. These compounds were tested in vitro and in vivo for activity against S. aureus and a biofilm grown on glucose, copper, and zinc. In vitro, these compounds reduced the bacterial growth and therefore increased the survival of biofilm cells against infection with the antibiotic-resistant strain. These results are relevant to understand the potential of compounds with antibacterial and antifungal activities.

The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were evaluated against bacteria and fungi using biofilm assays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tests. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against S. aureus, S. solitary, and three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results indicated that these compounds were active against these biofilms. The antibacterial activity was not observed when the compounds were grown in a medium with glucose, copper, and zinc.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased over the past decade, particularly among immunocompromised patients (Majewski et al., 2004; Delhaes et al., 2009). The most common fungal species involved in IFIs in this group are Candida albicans (60%), Cryptococcus neoformans (20%), and Aspergillus fumigatus (3%). Candida glabrata and Aspergillus fumigatus account for more than 90% of the patients with IFIs, although these species may also cause other IFIs, including Cryptococcus and other non-albicans species (Majewski et al., 2004; Delhaes et al., 2009; Meczorek et al., 2011).

One of the most significant challenges in the management of patients with IFIs is to identify the optimal antifungal therapy and to establish a good clinical outcome. The most common antifungal used is the azoles, but some other antifungal agents have been found to be effective in some cases, but not in others (Brown et al., 1999; Pfaller and Diekema, 2006). Azoles are active against most fungi and are widely used in the clinic due to the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs (Kroll et al., 2002). Azoles are used in the treatment of patients with IFIs because of their potential to prolong the life of patients and the effectiveness of their antifungal agents.


## Methods
Fungal strains, culture conditions, and growth media
C. albicans SC5314 (ATCC 208821) and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25 °C for 7 days. The yeast was collected and the mycelia were extracted with 10% (w/w) methanol and then washed with sterile distilled water to remove the medium. The mycelia were then ground into a fine powder and subjected to liquid nitrogen extraction using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C for 15 min.


## Results
The lungs of the Encephalitis-infected mice were dissected at days 3 and 6 post-infection and cultured for histolog. The control mice had normal histopathology (Figure 4A), consistent with the results of the neutrophil chemoattractant assay. In contrast, a significantly increased number of neutrophils was observed in the lungs of the Encephalitis-infected mice (Figure 4B). The lung of the Encephalitis-infected mice was highly induced (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), as indicated by the increased number of macrophages in the lungs (Figure 4D). In addition, the Encephalitis-infected mice displayed a significantly reduced number of the CD4^+ T-cell-associated neutrophils (Figure 4E). These results suggest that PD-1 plays a significant role in the control of IL-12-TXC-induced pathology in the lungs.

IL-12-TXC-stimulated T lymphocytes and CD4^+ T-cell-associated neutrophils in Encephalitis Etiologies
T-cell-mediated immune responses are induced in the lungs and lungs of patients with acute pulmonary diseases [10, 11]. To examine whether PD-1 plays a role in the control of T-cell activation, we performed antigen-specific T-cell activation assays. The results showed that the antigen-specific T-cell activation assay (Figure 5) showed that PD-1-stimulated T lymphocytes and CD4^+ T-cell-associated neutrophils were highly activated in the lungs of Encephalitis-infected mice, indicating that PD-1 is a potential source of T-cell activation in the lungs.

In addition, PD-1-stimulated T lymphocytes and CD4^+ T-cell-associated neutrophils were also highly activated in the lungs of Encephalitis-infected mice (Figure 5). These results indicated that PD-1 plays a role in the control of T-cell activation in the lungs.

We also evaluated the Th1 cytokine response by the Th2 cytokine assay.


## Discussion
In this study, we identified, functionally annotated and functionally characterized the major components of the P. ostreatus cell wall. In addition, we showed that Ssa1-like genes can be regulated by a P. ostreatus PbsA and PbsA-like signaling pathways, which are related to P. ostreatus-host interactions. Our data indicate that PbsA and PbsA-like signaling are functionally redundant, and PbsA and PbsA-like signaling may regulate the PbsA-PbsA-HphA pathway.

PbsA and PbsA-like signaling pathways are essential for the pathogenicity and virulence of P. ostreatus

The PbsA and PbsA-like signaling pathways are essential for the pathogenicity and virulence of P. ostreatus, and they are required for the P. ostreatus-host interactions. PbsA and PbsA-like signaling may have direct effect on the pathogenicity of P.
