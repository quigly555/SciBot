## Abstract
The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro activity and cytotoxicity effects of thymol and aqueous extracts against eight clinically diagnosed and treated fungal and bacterial pathogens.

Thymol extract was prepared using dry sea salt solution. Its in vitro activity against amphotericin B 0.5% and 0.5% e.g. Salmonella Typhi and Mycobacterium Cholera was determined using broth microdilution method. The cytotoxicity of extracts extract against Aspergillus F5, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei was evaluated using the MTT assay and the scavenging assay.

The in vitro activities of extracts were dose-dependent and in synergism with amphotericin B 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5% and 1.5% (pI 2.4-7.4) extracts respectively. The in vivo activities of extracts were dose-dependent and in synergy with amphotericin B 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5% and 1.5% extracts respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity of extracts against Mucorales was evaluated using the MTT assay and the scavenging assay.

## Introduction
The presence of different species of yeast in the genus Cryptococcus is a major concern due to the fact that these yeasts can cause life-threatening diseases [1,2]. C. neoformans and C. krusei are the most common species, which are frequently found in association with bird droppings, water from the Baltic Sea, and decaying wood [3,4]. They are also found in association with other birds, including birds that are exposed to climate extremes such as hot and cold periods, and those that are healthy in the laboratory environment, but not healthy in humans [5].

C. neoformans and C. krusei are two of the most common and common fungal species found in association with humans, both within and outside of the health care setting [6]. The respiratory tract is the major site of infection, but the most common sites for Cryptococcal meningitis are the lungs [7]. Human cryptococcal infection typically presents as pulmonary infection, meningoencephalitis, and brain abscess, but with some dissemination can occur in other sites of the disease, such as the skin, lymph nodes, bones, or urinary tract [8,9]. Although there is an increased incidence of brain abscesses in AIDS patients and other immunocompromised patients, the most common sites are the lungs [10].

C. neoformans and C. krusei are commonly found in association with bird droppings and decaying wood [1,3,5,11,12]. Cryptococcosis is an AIDS-defining opportunistic fungal infection, which is associated with an estimated 300,000 deaths annually [13].


## Methods
The Chloroglucan-A inhibitor cocktail is composed of a mixture of a mixture of n-hexane (.1%) and 1.0% (v/v) chloroglucan. The chaperone (0.5 mg/mL) was administered to the cider plants by oral gavage. After the addition of chaperone, the treatment was continued for 5 days, and then the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove the chaperone. The chaperone-containing cider plants were cultivated for 5 days in the dark at 25°C. The cider plants were inoculated with 100 µL of the chaperone-containing cider plants with a cell count of 100 cells/mL in 100 mL of PBS. The results were recorded on a ruler. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

For the screening of the Chloroglucan-A chaperone-sensitive hybridization, the cells were cultivated in the dark at 25°C for 5 days. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with Chloroglucan-A (0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h. The Chloroglucan-A inhibitors were added at concentrations of 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 8 mg/mL, 16 mg/mL, and 24 mg/mL, respectively. The cells were cultivated in the dark at 25°C for 5 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with Chloroglucan-A (0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and stained with 0.2% (v/v) crystal violet and observed with a fluorescent microscope. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

For the screening of the Chloroglucan-A chaperone-resistant hybridization, the cells were cultivated in the dark at 25°C for 5 days. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with Chloroglucan-A (0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h.


## Results
albicans lipids on fungal cells is also a complex with multiple lipids, which may be important for cell viability [52], [53], [54. It was recently shown that C. albicans lipids are capable of inhibiting the growth of plant cells by interfering with the cell membrane integrity [55], [56]. The lipids of the plant pathogen Candida albicans are found in both a high amount and a low amount (Table 1). The majority of plant lipids, however, are rich in fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pentacyclic, acyl ester and non-acyclic fatty acids [57], [58]. The fatty acid profile of C. albicans is highly diverse. From the fatty acids, polyunsaturated and acyl ester, pentacyclic and non-acyclic fatty acids were identified, some were linolenic acid (L-tyrosine), linolenic acid (L-sorbitol), stearic acid (sorbitol), and oleic acid (oleic acid) [59]. In addition, some of the acyl ester, pentacyclic and non-acyclic fatty acids are found in both plant and fungal cell lipids [57], [59].

Effects of Lipids from Plants-a Key Role for Chloroglucan Inhibitors
The effects of C. albicans lipids on fungal cells are very diverse. For example, C. albicans is known to be a plant pathogen and is known to produce a high amount of cell wall lipids, including palmitic acid, linolenic acid, linolenic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid [60]. C. albicans is also known to produce a high amount of lipids, including palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, and linolenic acid [60]. In addition, C. albicans can produce various amounts of lipids, including palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid [61].


## Discussion
In this study, we addressed the role of lipids in mitochondrial respiratio. As reported previously by Kunitzky and Lynch [25], lipids from plants can serve as a rich source of energy for mitochondria. These lipids are not only rich in carbohydrates but also contain several amino acids, sterols, and alanine residues that are essential for the growth of plants. Amino acids are vital for the metabolism of simple sugars and many enzymes involved in the synthesis of these sugars are involved in the production of secondary metabolites such as enzymes and oxidants, which are crucial for plant growth and development [26]. The results of our study indicate that lipids from plants can be directly associated with genes involved in the biosynthesis of the enzymes and products of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of complex substrates.

In addition, lipids from plants can serve as a source of energy for the metabolism of complex substrates, such as the fatty acid catabolic enzymes and fatty acid synthases, which are important for the synthesis of some plant and animal lipid species [27]. An essential role for lipids in the utilization of complex substrates is suggested by the ability of plants to produce lipids with great amounts of sugar in the medium [28]. Lipids from plants can be identified as polyols, carbon monoxide, nitrosative, and free radicals in the cell wall, as well as as as flavones, in the cell membrane, and as in the breakdown products of the cell wall components [29]. Nitrosative has been reported to be involved in the degradation of cell wall components, including fatty acids and proteins, and in the degradation of lipids, such as lipopolysaccharides and lipids of other complex lipids [30]. The presence of polar lipids and related compounds can also be observed in cell wall materials of plants [31]. The biological activities of lipids are also related to their ability to form complex with the complex substrates of plant cells, including carotenoids, fatty acids, and oxalic acid [32]. The major components of the lipids found in the cell wall are of two types: lipids and lipoproteins [33]. The present study found that the presence of lipids in plant cell wall could be correlated with the growth rate of plants.
