## Abstract
HIV-associated macrophages play a central role in the immune response to infection. HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a well-known complication of care and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The inflammatory response of these cells is often interrupted by other complications, e.g., malignancy, or during the progression of other conditions. The complication of IRIS is the loss of control of the inflammatory response and the inability to effectively implement treatment. The initiation of antituberculosis therapy in HIV-associated IRIS can be complicated by the difficulty in initiating antifungal therapy once the immune reconstitution effect has abated. In this review, we discuss the impact of the antifungal therapy and the difficulty of initiating antifungal therapy once the immune reconstitution effect has abented.


## Introduction
The global burden of fungal infections is increasing year by year, and it is estimated that between 20 and 30% of the estimated ~300,000 life-threatening fungal diseases are caused by yeasts1. The major virulence factors of yeasts are generally specific for their growth in nutrient-poor conditions, which in turn have a profound impact on the host’s immune defense and outcome in fungal pathogens. Such key virulence factors that are readily identified and largely unknown, are the ability to form biofilms, which are defined as a complex network of extracellular structures that form enclosed microdomains, surrounded by a network of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)3.

The biosynthetic pathway of EPS in yeasts is initiated by two main steps: (i) synthesis of polysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)4, which are the most abundant and most diverse of the major classes of polysaccharides5,6. The production of GAGs by most yeasts, for example, A. alternata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is initiated by the formation of a barrel-shaped structure called a laccase7. The Laccase enzyme catalyzes the first reaction of the laccase complex8, the formation of a polymer and a glycosaminoglycans outer shell9. The outer shell is surrounded by a glycoprotein core and the outer polysaccharide layer is essential for its enzymatic activity and has been characterized as a protective barrier to the action of toxins10. The polysaccharides, which are the major EPS components, are digested by the Laccase enzyme in the first step, and the outer polysaccharide layer is enriched with abundant glycosaminoglycans1112.


## Methods
In order to avoid any possible impact of the environment on Trypanosoma triticus populations, we analyzed the study area in order to avoid any potential effects from the presence of low nutrient. The soil and soil samples were collected in July 2010 from the site of a natural forest in Kisku Island (Table 1) at the south-western tip of the island. The soil samples were collected at the end of May 2011. Three sampling plots were used for the analysis. In the first plot, the soil was collected from the middle of the field, with the soil sample collected from the middle of the field. The soil samples were collected from the right side of the field, with the soil sample collected from the left side. In the second plot, the soil was collected from the left side of the field, with the soil sample collected from the right side. The soil samples were collected from the right side of the field, with the soil sample collected from the right side. In the third plot, the soil was collected from the left side of the field, with the soil sample collected from the right side.

## Results
In our study, a variety of host-related species were found and the maximum number of isolates was found in . luteola, which has a dry to wet substrate environment and a higher biomass than other plant species. This species was also found to be the most common species in the Muriformes (Sampaio et al. 2014).

The fungus was found to be more abundant in the NGR on the upper than in the lower parts of the forest (Figure 3). The majority of the isolates were found to belong to the Malassezia clade (Figure 3). However, the diversity of Malassezia species was not as high as the Malassezia bifurcatione (Mal. bifurcata), which is found in both subgenomes of M. bifurcata.

The isolate from M. triticina (Figure 3) was found to belong to the Fusarium clade (Figure 3). The diversity of the isolate was not found in other isolates of the Malassezia clade. The isolates of Fusarium species were found to belong to the Malassezia clade (Figure 3). The isolates of Fusarium species were found to belong to the Malassezia clade (Figure 3). The isolates of Malassezia bifurcata were found to belong to the Fusarium clade (Figure 3).

The isolate from M. luteola (Figure 3) was found to belong to the Dothideales (Figure 3). The diversity of the isolate was not found in other isolates of the Dothideales. The isolate of M. luteola was found to belong to the Dothideales (Figure 3). The isolates of M. bifurcata were found to belong to the Dothideales (Figure 3).

The isolates of M. triticina were found to belong to the Dothideales (Figure 3). The diversity of the isolate was not found in other isolates of the Dothideales. The isolates of M. triticina were found to belong to the Dothideales (Figure 3).

## Discussion
. elegans is an easy host for this species in the soil. Thus, the soil conditions in the ecosystem are conducive to the occurrence of this species in the soil.

The soil microhabitats of T. elegans are rich in plant material and nutrients, which are important for growth and survival in the environment. Some species of T. elegans are able to colonize different habitats, such as wood, plant, soil and air. It is also possible that the soil environment in T. elegans is not the same as that in other species of T. elegans. Thus, the soil microhabitats of T. elegans should not be used as a natural habitat for the species. These species should be introduced and studied.

Etymology: The genus T. elegans is distinguished from other species of T. elegans by its euseptate conidial morphology and its ability to grow at elevated temperatures.

Sexual reproduction is only possible in T. elegans in which a mating-type locus is located in the central part of the conidiophore. A recombinant T. elegans strain expressing a mating-type locus is generated and the conidium is then sequenced. The resulting genome sequence of T. elegans is compared with the genome of T. rhodozyma and T. bacillaris. The resulting recombinant genome is assembled and the resulting gene set is named T. romanii. The resulting gene is named T. hilairei.
