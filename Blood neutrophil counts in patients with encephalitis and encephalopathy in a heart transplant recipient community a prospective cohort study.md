# Blood neutrophil counts in patients with encephalitis and encephalopathy in a heart transplant recipient community: a prospective cohort study
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract

Among the 566 recipients, 566 (89%) had a history of hospital admission and were older than 65 years (median age of 64 years, IQR 39-75. Their heart valves were opening more often in recipients with heart failure. Lung histology was available in 84% of recipients, and a diagnosis of encephalitis predominated in 86% of recipients. The percentage of recipients who had a confirmed bacterial infection was significantly higher than that in the control cohort (56% vs 23%, p=0.006). The percentage of recipients who had a confirmed cryptococcal infection was higher than that in the control cohort (22% vs 10%, p=0.0015). A history of hospital admission was associated with higher likelihood of a positive bacterial culture in recipients (OR=0.03, 95% CI= .01-0.04, p=0.0002).

A history of hospital admission was associated with a significantly higher probability of a positive bacterial culture in recipients. The importance of bacterial culture for a diagnosis of encephalitis was high.

Uncontrolled high-dose beta-lactamase therapy in a stroke patient was shown in a 24-year-old patient who developed central vestibular syndrome during her rehabilitation. She developed an encephalopathy and died 5 months after the start of the next episode. Untreated high-dose beta-lactamase therapy with systemic lupus erythematosus (SS) improved significantly in the restoration phase of her left ventricular ejection fraction (VEF) despite a steady increase in the proportion of neutrophils in the VEF of the patient with a confirmed bacterial infection.

In a case control study, control of a suspected case of encephalitis, we administered a second-level nested case-control comparison. We found no differences in follow-up between the nested and control groups, even when the VEF was >100% VEF. This suggests that the nested comparison is more useful in the prevention of encephalitis.

In a cohort of stroke patients, we observed that a patient with a suspected stroke without a confirmed stroke is more likely to develop a new stroke.

We found that stroke is a common condition in HIV-infected patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. Whether risk of stroke is driven by HIV status or a result of immunosuppression or a contributing risk factor for HIV transmission is unclear.


## Introduction
Similarly, we found no association between neutrophil counts and gadolinium lesions in a cohort of patients with acute myelogenousleukaemia in a university hospita. The authors argue that neutrophil counts are too low for a clinically significant infection, and that they should be used for other types of leishmaniasis. This raises the question of whether gadolinium lesions are the most common type of lesion in patients with acute myelogenousleukaemia.

2) On page 171, the authors state “However, the study” but do not refer to the study. The study was conducted in a university hospital. In fact, the authors refer to the hospital as a “safe haven” for the study's ethical approval. However, the study was conducted in a university hospital and the ethical approval for its use was not obtained.

3) The subsection “Gadolinium dextrorambunctis is a rare disease” has been moved to “Degradity associated with gadolinium occlusion”. The authors should link to this reference in the guidelines.

We have revised this paragraph to clarify the location of the study and the statement “The present study”.

We thank the reviewer for their comments. We are grateful for the suggestion. We have strengthened our explanations of the manuscript and revised the title to reflect the findings of this study.

We agree and look forward to reading the paper.

## Methods
Ex-neutropenic patients with altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, or neurologic abnormalities were exclude. We conducted a comparison of encephalopathy among patients with different medical conditions in patients with encephalitis and encephalopathy in a cohort of 56,880 patients. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in patients with focal neurologic abnormalities or focal neurologic abnormalities in a cohort of 66,000 patients with encephalitis, encephalopathy, or encephalopathy in a cohort of 4,148 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalitis in a cohort of 42,026 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 2,447 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 2,145 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalitis in a cohort of 1,026 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 2,389 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 1,066 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 1,107 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 2,168 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community. We compared encephalopathy among patients with encephalopathy in a cohort of 2,151 patients with encephalopathy in a transplant community.

Prospective patients were excluded from the study because of limited resource availability in the study.


## Results
. Mixtures of Fungicide and Fungicide-Controlling Agents Compound
The antifungal activity of Fungicide agents was evaluated against nine Candida species and five Cryptococcus species. The antifungal activity of Fungicide agents was inhibited with either fluconazole (0.


## Discussion

No risk factors for death in our cohort of patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis were identifie. However, the presence of genetic defects, including gene mutations, is associated with high mortality in patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis. In addition, a large proportion of patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) infection [20]. There are no reports of severe neurologic morbidity or mortality in patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis.

Our study has limitations. First, we did not examine the effect of immunosuppressive therapy. Second, we did not examine the effect of immunosuppressive therapy. Third, we did not examine the effect of antiretroviral therapy on mortality. Finally, we did not assess the impact of corticosteroid therapy.

In addition, we did not measure neurological morbidity or mortality in patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis. However, a previous study did [19] and did not report neurological morbidity or mortality in patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis. Thus, we did not determine the prevalence of neuroinvasive encephalitis. We did not examine the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in our cohort of patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis.

Our study had limitations. First, we did not examine the effect of immunosuppressive therapy. Second, we did not examine the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in our cohort of patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis. Thus, we did not determine the prevalence of neuroinvasive encephalitis.

Our study has some limitations. First, we did not assess whether patients with encephalitis were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Second, we did not examine whether patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Third, we did not examine whether patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, we did not determine the prevalence of neuroinvasive encephalitis in patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis.

In conclusion, our study has shown that neuroinvasive encephalitis is a rare disease that occurs more frequently in HIV-infected patients. Patients with neuroinvasive encephalitis are less likely to have a history of neuroinvasive encephalitis.
