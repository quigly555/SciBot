## Abstract
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans readily acquires resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs including amphotericin B and itraconazole. We investigated the influence of two drug resistance factors, HvyA and DprT, in C. albicans isolates with and without drug resistance. HvyA encodes a transporter highly enriched for ergosterol, and DprT encodes a transporter enriched for fluconazole. HvyA or DprT treatment resulted in reduced expression of genes for ergosterol synthesis and erg10, suggesting that ergosterol synthesis is not gained by ergosterol-rich cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, gene expression of genes for ergosterol synthesis, a key virulence factor, were decreased in C. albicans isolates treated with HvyA or DprT. Although some of the ergosterol synthesis and a novel HvyA transporter were detected, we did not detect any other functional differences among the C. albicans isolates treated with either drug. Taken together, our data suggest that drug resistance might be a relevant feature of drug resistance in this important human fungal pathogen.

## Introduction
These studies revealed that Fungi are equipped with the biochemical machinery and cellular machinery that is involved in the metabolism of diverse substrates, including sugars, amino acids, and wate. Hence, these substrates are used for the transport of information from one to the other.

The utilization of sugars as substrates is of great importance because, in the fungi, glucose serves as a carboxyl group that is linked to water. Thus, in the system, glucose is linked to the water molecule via the 3',5',6',7',8',9' glycine/glycine linkage. Fungi exhibit a very extensive uptake of glucose by the blood and intestine [17]. The central role of glucose metabolism in the fungi is well-known, however, little is known about the use of yeast cells as substrates by other fungi. The expression of genes involved in the glycolysis of fatty acids and of proteins involved in the lipid metabolism in fungi and yeast was investigated in the yeast Penicillium chrysosporium [18]. The expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes in the glucose metabolism was also investigated in the human pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum [19]. In the fungi C. albicans and C. neoformans, glucose was found to be present as a substrate in the production of glucose-starved cells [20], while C. glabrata cells lack glucose and are unable to utilize it [21]. In the yeast pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, glucose was found to be present as a substrate in the production of sucrose and glucose derivatives [22]. In addition, in Ustilago maydis and Candida albicans, glucose was found to be present as a substrate and glucose was considered to be the major substrate [23]. In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the importance of glucose was demonstrated [24]. In the Fusarium oxysporum, the main pathogen of blood shed glycoconjugates and blood-borne pathogens of humans, glucose was found to be present as a substrate [25]. In the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, the major pathogen of skin lesions, glucose was found to be present as a substrate [26].


## Methods
The rDNA content was analysed using the Rfam [25] version .4.0. The primers (Additional file 1: Table S1) for Fungi: 5’-CGATCCGACGGACGAACGGT-3’ (Fungi: 5’-CTACCCACGGAGACCCGGAG-3’) were designed using the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/blast/Blast.cgi) mRNA and protein databases. The primers for Fungi: 5’-CTCGGTCCCTCCGCTTTCTC-3’ (Fungi: 5’-CTCTAGCAGGCCGCCCTCCCTC-3’) and 5’-CTCCCCAGCCCCAGCCAAACACG-3’ (Fungi: 5’-CCGCCCCACGTCAGACACG-3’) were designed to amplify the RNA of F. graminearum R265-Fusarium (Fungi: 5’-CCATCCACGCCAGCCCCCTACG-3’) and F. graminearum R272 (Fungi: 5’-ACGCCTCAATCCATCTGCC-3’) in order to target the T_gRNA gene in F. graminearum. The primers for Fungi: 5’-CCTCCCCCTCACCTGCAGC-3’ and 5’-ACGCCCCCCTCAAGACATGC-3’ were designed to amplify the RNA of F. graminearum R265-Fusarium. The primers for Fungi: 5’-CACCCAGCCATCCCTGCC-3’ and 5’-CCCTCACCTGCCGCCCTC-3’ were designed to amplify the RNA of F. graminearum R272-Fusarium in order to target the T_gRNA gene.


## Results
The G0 pathway is one of the most important pathways in fungal metabolism, and thus, it is important for the metabolism of the fungal cell membrane and for the accumulation of ROS and other cellular stress agent. During the pathway, ROS is released from the cell membrane and the ROS-derived compounds are produced by the glyoxylate cycle to produce ATP and generate ATP-citrate. The G1 pathway is important for the activation of the glyoxylate cycle, which generates the ATP-citrate, and the G2 pathway is important for the activation of the glyoxylate cycle, which generates the ATP-citrate, and the ATP-citrate is formed from the glyoxylate cycle. During the pathway, the glyoxylate cycle generates the ATP-citrate and the glyoxylate cycle generates the ATP-citrate. The two pathways are connected by the G0 and G1 pathways, as well as the G2 pathway, which is important for the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle. In addition, the two pathways are connected by the G1 and G2 pathways, which are important for the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle, and the metabolism of the metabolites produced during the biosynthesis of the metabolites in the G2 pathway.

The biosynthetic pathways of Fungal Metabolism
Fungal metabolic pathways were examined by using DTA-Atrophy for the analyses of pathways and metabolites that are involved in fungal growth, including the G0 and G1 pathways and the G0/G2 pathways. DTA-Atrophy was used to evaluate the accuracy of DTA-Atrophy estimates for fungal growth. The DTA-Atrophy estimates are a means of estimation of the accuracy of DTA-Atrophy estimates based on a cut-off value of 0.5 for DTA-Atrophy estimates based on the cut-off values from the nonredundant DTA-Atrophy estimates, which are not based on DTA-Atrophy estimates.


## Discussion
lusitaniae with the citrus, fruit, and insect gut microbe. The regulation of the metabolic pathways we analyzed in detail with the fungi, including the fungal pathogens, may be derived from a combination of two key factors: the C. lusitaniae genome and the metabolic flux from the gut microbes. We discovered that the fungus has a unique molecular interaction with the citrus gut microbes, which has been observed in other microorganisms [42, 43]. In our study, we found that the gut microbes in citrus serve as a source of energy for the growth of Citrus (Fig 3), and this is further supported by the fact that this interaction occurs in all the fungi studied.

The fungal symbiont H. capsulatum is a key component of the gut microbiota in citrus [46, 47]. The H. capsulatum-F. culmorum complex is the main metabolic transport system for fungi and their biodegraders [48, 49]. We found that H. capsulatum is able to assimilate glucose, and that the fungus may also use glucans, which are the major carbon sources for fungal cells [50]. The association of the H. capsulatum-F. culmorum complex with the citrus gut microbes is one of the main metabolic and biodegradative pathways for fungal cells in citrus [51]. We also found that the fungal symbiont H. capsulatum has a highly efficient in vitro glycerol reductase (GRS) pathway, which is involved in the transfer of glycerol from glucose to fructose, the major component in the fungal diet [51]. These results provide an explanation for the presence of the H. capsulatum-F. culmorum complex in citrus.

We also identified a family of glycoside hydrolases, which are commonly found in the gut microbes of fungi [52, 53]. This family of hydrolases is also involved in the cell wall formation in citrus [54]. We found that the fungus responds to the presence of glycoside hydrolases from the insect gut microbes by producing enzymes that cleave the hydroxyl group of glycosides (Fig 3). The fungal symbiont H.
