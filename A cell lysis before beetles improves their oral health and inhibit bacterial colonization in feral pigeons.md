## Abstract
The majority of global health has been shaped and reshaped by the events leading up to the emergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic is thus an inseparable part of the complex global epidemiology that is unfolding in our midst. In fact, many aspects of the HIV pandemic that were previously thought largely uneventful are now thought to have been affected by events that followed the natural progression of the immune response in humans. The nature of the responses and immune responses following the natural progression of the immune response in humans, as well as the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the immune response in the context of the HIV pandemic itself, are discussed.


## Introduction
The genus Plectosphaerella (Pers.: Fr.) Lam, typified by Plectosphaerella striiformis, is an ascomycete and a member of the order Capnodiales. Plectosphaerella s.l. is a cosmopolitan and widespread genus, which was described from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in 1894 [1]. The genus is well known for the production of sticky plectosmalions on the skin, nails and hair [2,3]. However, the application of these substances on the inflamed skin has not been well described, and no conclusive results are available.

In the study of Plectosphaerella, the presence of plectosmalion on the inflamed skin is suggested as being caused by the presence of fungi present on the skin. The skin is inhabited by phaeohyphomycetous fungi that are unable to germinate, and there are cases of infection caused by Plectosphaerella and Hyposphoascus [4,5]. In the present work, the skin of a male patient with suspected folliculitis was treated with plectosmalion and fungal cultures obtained from the patient's scalp. The results obtained in vitro indicated that the fungi were present on the skin of the patient's scalp, but were not present in the cultures.


## Methods

The analysis of microorganisms
After feeding on the eggs, the eggs were removed and washed in PB. The surface of the eggs was washed in PBS three times. The eggs were then washed twice in PBS and incubated in the dark for 1 h. Then, the eggs were transferred to a glass tube containing 3 ml of PBS and 200 µl of each culture was spotted on the surface of the medium. The number of bacteria was recorded. The numbers of fungi were counted with a scale of one (5) to 10 (10). The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h, and the number of fungi was recorded. The numbers of bacteria were counted with a scale of two (5) to five (5) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of fungi was counted with a scale of five (5) to seven (5) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of bacteria was counted with a scale of seven (5) to nine (9) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of bacteria was counted with a scale of nine (9) to eleven (11) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of fungi was counted with a scale of eleven (11) to fifteen (15) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of fungi was counted with a scale of fifteen (15) to twenty (20) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of bacteria was counted with a scale of twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After this time, the colonies were counted. The number of fungi was counted with a scale of thirty (30) to forty (45) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The number of bacteria was counted with a scale of forty (45) to fifty (50) and then the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h.


## Results
Fungal and fungal community composition
A total of 124,638 sequences were generated for the fungal and bacterial communities of the rice leaves and the fruit of the same cultivar (Table 1). The fungal community was dominated by the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Rozellomycota, whereas the bacterial community was dominated by the Ascomycota.


## Discussion
The current study was designed to determine the exact prevalence of HIV infection among patients with HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV infection was low in the HIV infected patients. In the patients with HIV infection, the prevalence was high. The prevalence was higher in patients with advanced HIV disease, compared to the other groups. We observed that HIV infection was associated with a lower CD4 cell count. HIV infection was associated with a higher HIV viral load. The association between HIV infection and HIV infection was similar between HIV infection and CD4 cell count. The HIV infection was associated with a higher CD4 cell count.

The prevalence of HIV infection among patients with HIV infection was higher in the HIV infected patients. The prevalence was higher in patients with advanced HIV disease, compared to the other groups. The prevalence was higher in patients with advanced HIV disease.
