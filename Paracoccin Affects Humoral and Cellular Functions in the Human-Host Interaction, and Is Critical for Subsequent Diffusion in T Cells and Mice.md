## Abstract
The taxonomy of cosmopolitan fungi has undergone dramatic revision in the last decade. The genus Puccinia is nowadays recognized as one of the most diverse and morphologically diverse genera of Puccinia. Although its cosmopolitan life-style is characterised by a single phylogenetic species, P. arrhizus sp. nov., P. carinii (isognamoides) and P. fluorescens (isognamoides/hymenogaster) (two new species), P. fluorescens has received the generic status of the genus Puccinotrichum, while P. carinii has been assigned to P. arrhizus. In the current paper, we firstly introduce the genus Puccinotrichum and then describe some of the characters that have changed in the taxonomy of P. arrhizus. The present paper deals with the characterisation of the genera P. arrhizus and P. carinii, and we even present pictures of some of the morphological characters that have been transferred to the new sections, P. flavus sp. nov., and P. carinii. The identification of the two fungal species is of particular importance and needs further revision. In the genus Puccinotrichum, P. arrhizus and P. carinii are treated in this paper as independent taxa, and the generic type species P. arrhizus is emended. Furthermore, we discuss the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of P. carinii and P. arrhizus.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans and animals worldwide. The organism is commonly isolated from the respiratory tract and disseminated in the central nervous system, especially in immunocompromised individuals [1,2]. C. neoformans is found ubiquitously throughout the environment and its ability to grow at 37 Â°C is responsible for its pathogenicity [3].

C. neoformans is capable of undergoing morphological transitions during the course of its life cycle. This fungus can be found in soil, pigeon droppings, decaying wood, and pigeon excreta. It has been associated with other environmental niches such as water, air, or even on skin [4-6]. Environmental cues including temperature, desiccation, UV radiation, nutrient availability, and light, as well as immune status of the host, affect the environmental population of C. neoformans.

C. neoformans is found in the soil and is found primarily in pigeon droppings, decaying wood, and pigeon excreta [4,7,8]. In healthy individuals, C. neoformans can be contained in a relatively moderate to hypoxic environment that is associated with high humidity, low oxygen, and high organic matter content [7,9]. Environmental cues such as temperature, moisture, and UV radiation, as well as environmental stressors such as desiccation, hypoxia, and hypoxemia, as well as nutritional status, such as salt and sugar, have an influence on the ability of C. neoformans to survive in such conditions [7,9,10]. However, in immunocompromised hosts such as those with hematological malignancies or in intensive care units (ICUs), such as those with neutropenia, the fungus can be found within the healthy host as a harmless commensal of its natural environment [11,12].

## Results
. Chemical Composition
The SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude extract showed that the highest amount of the N-glycosylated carbohydrate was composed of starch and glycerol (Figure 1). The carbohydrate content was 40.3% and 62.7% for the L-amino-glycans, glycerol and N-glycosylated polysaccharides, respectively. The glycerol content was 5.7% and 9.4% for the L-amino-glycans and N-glycosylated polysaccharides, respectively. The N-glycosylated carbohydrate was enriched with monoglycans (GlcNAc) and monosaccharides (Mg^2+) in the crude extract, which was also the most abundant (Table 1).

3.2. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of crude extract was evaluated against two Cryptococcus strains (Figure 2). The most active compound was the crude extract, which was more effective than fluconazole and amphotericin B, but less effective than fluconazole and amphotericin B. The most active compounds were L-amino-glcNAc and N-glycosylated polysaccharides, which were less active than amphotericin B and L-amino-glcNAc (Figure 2).


## Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of the nad1<U+0394> mutant, a highly conserved gene in human pathogenesis, in order to determine its gene expression and its putative role in C. neoformans virulence.

The nad1<U+0394> mutant had a greater number of genes that are essential for the survival of C.
