## Abstract
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections. Its ability to adapt to various environment, such as unfavorable nutrient conditions, microbial stresses, and host nutritional status, has given C. albicans broad ecological significance. However, the environmental conditions that regulate the development of this pathogen are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the importance of environmental factors (humidity, temperature, and nutrient availability) in the adaptation of C. albicans to various host niches, such as in vitro growth, in vivo infection, and the role of host nutritional status in this adaptation. A total of 29 environmental variables were analyzed, including pH, pH5, nutrient availability, and the amount of oleic acid in a 1:1 host-pathogen relationship. In addition, the effects of different environmental conditions on the adaptation of C. albicans to different host niches were analyzed by determining the changes in transcriptional profiles of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, the growth of a low-humidity host, such as a Mediterranean mangrove (Menth.), was associated with reduced transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Conversely, a high-humidity host, such as a tropical mangrove (Menth.) or an Indian species of M. rhizosus, was associated with increased transcription of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Importantly, the adaptation of C. albicans to different host niches was associated with changes in genes involved in the inflammatory response, cellular proliferation, and activation of key immune cell functions, such as the tumor growth and the immune reconstitution inflammatory effector T-IRIS 1 gene 1. In addition, genes involved in various metabolic functions, such as the amino acid biosynthesis pathway, were also found to be significantly regulated by the adaptation of C. albicans to the different host niches examined. Our results suggest that the adaptation of C. albicans to various host niches, such as in vitro growth in host mangrove forests, in vitro infection in mangrove-encrusted tissues, and in vivo infection by various types of fungi, is strongly affected by a variety of environmental factors and is thus an important host-pathogen interaction factor.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an important fungal disease of humans and animals that affects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The disease is most commonly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) and C. gattii. C. gattii is primarily a skin disease, occurring predominantly in tropical and subtropical climates, but it is also found in a wider range of other environmental niches including soil, air, water, and birds (Eckhardt, 1976; Steinkraus et al., 2013). C. gattii is also found mainly in pigeon droppings and decaying wood (Seyedmousavi et al., 2010).

The ecological niche of C. neoformans is primarily restricted to the environment of trees such as Diaporthe, Populus, and Solanaceae (Bjelland, 2007; Kulkarni and Stach, 2009; Sobel, 2011; Tappe and Bajpai, 2012). Environmental niches of C. neoformans include soil, air, and birds (Eckhardt, 1976; Steinkraus et al., 2013). The clinical course of this pathogen is dependent on several factors, including its virulence, antifungal susceptibility, and environmental conditions (Jensen and Poot, 2002; Steinkraus et al., 2013).


## Methods
rubrum against Trichophyton rubrum, . coli, E. coli, S. pombe, E. coli, P. lindemuthianum and other fungi was assessed using the two-compartment microbroth method and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay was performed in triplicate using 10 µl of 1× Tween 80 solution in 50 µl of Eppendorf tubes. The reaction was monitored using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The levels of S. rubrum, E. coli, S. pombe and E. coli were determined using standard curves. The assay was performed in triplicate using 10 µl of 1× Tween 80 solution in 50 µl of Eppendorf tubes. The reaction was monitored using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wavelength of 590 nm.

4.2. In Vivo Activity of Tryptophan
The in vitro activity of Tryptophan was performed with the following six standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) medium: glucose-yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), (0.2 mM) of each of the reagents at 30°C, or synthetic medium containing different concentrations of these reagents. The bacterial strains were cultured in liquid YPD medium at 37°C for 24 h. The culture broth was centrifuged and washed with deionized water. The supernatant was used as the substrate for the assays. The optical density of the medium was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wavelength of 600 nm.

4.3. In Vivo Activity of Tryptophan in Mycelium
The in vitro activity of Tryptophan in mycelium was performed in 10 ml of Tryptophan medium (1%) at 37°C.


## Results
rubrum is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients [5. The clinical features of the disease are well established [4], and the MICs of Ruthenium(II) complex complex drugs were determined against the clinical strain of Trichophyton rubrum. The MICs of Ruthenium(II) complex drugs were in the range of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum [5], with MICs of 0.3 to 1.0 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum [4], and MICs of 0.3 to 2.5 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum [4]. We found no difference in the susceptibility of the human Trichophyton rubrum to Ruthenium(II) complex drugs, except for the susceptibility of T. rubrum to 1 mg/mL Ruthenium(II) complex drugs.

In Vivo Antibiotics Activity of Ruthenium(II) Complex Drugs against Trichophyton rubrum
To investigate the in vivo susceptibility of Trichophyton rubrum to Ruthenium(II) complex drugs, we evaluated the in vitro antifungal activity of Ruthenium(II) complex drugs against Trichophyton rubrum using the in vitro antifungal activity assay. The MICs of Ruthenium(II) complex drugs were in the range of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum, with MICs of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum and 1 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum, respectively. A MIC of 0.5 mg/mL was used in this assay to inhibit the growth of Trichophyton rubrum in the presence of Ruthenium(II) complex drugs.

A significant difference in in vitro antifungal activity was observed between the MICs of Ruthenium(II) complex drugs against Trichophyton rubrum and those against Trichophyton rubrum in Vivo and in Vivo activities assays (Figure 4). In Vivo activities assays, Ruthenium(II) complex drugs had a MIC_50 value of 0.5 mg/mL against Trichophyton rubrum, with MIC_50 values of 0.
