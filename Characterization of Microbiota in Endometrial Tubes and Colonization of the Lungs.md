## Abstract
Nosocomial infections caused by Candida spp. have become increasingly important as a cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased use of multidrug-resistant (MDR) antibiotics. Antibiotics that work by inhibiting the growth of the MDR bacteria are attractive strategies to treat invasive fungal infections. Here we describe the development of a novel strategy to prevent and treat fungal infections caused by Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis. The technology was developed using a yeast-assisted process, which is mainly based on the use of glucose-regulated endocytosis, and is adapted for use in treating other neglected fungal diseases. The process was completed using a standard yeast-assisted process that mimics that of the acellular assay.


## Introduction
Chromoblastomycosis is a non-invasive fungal infection caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus Chromobacter. It is caused by a single species of the genus Chromobacter, which is transmitted by the inhalation of conidia. Upon reaching the mucous membrane of the lung, the pathogen invades the alveoli and spreads to other organs and tissues, leading to the development of chronic pulmonary disease [1]. The most common sites for infection are the alveoli, soft tissues and the skin [2,3]. A large number of species in the genus are not cleared by the immune system and reactivated as fungi that are found in the extracellular fluid such as blood, urine, feces and tears. Among the various causes of fungal infections, Candida and Cryptococcus are the most frequently isolated and are associated with the highest mortality rates [4]. The other three species, Aspergillus, Micrococcus and Cryptococcus, are rarely observed [5]. The most frequent C. albicans associated with cutaneous and subcutaneous infections is C. albicans, but the high mortality rate has not been clearly established [6].

The diagnosis of fungal infection relies on the presence of an intact, round yeast, but the term “pseudohyphal infection” is used less commonly [7]. Pseudohyphomycosis is defined as an infection that occurs due to the hyphal growth of an infectious microorganism within the alveoli of a healthy host. It is usually described as a hematogenous infection caused by a yeast, but the term “seudohyphal infection” is used more generally [8]. It is often caused by fungi of the genera Cryptococcus, Malassezia, and other species, but it is also found in other species of Candida, Fusarium and other genera of non-albicans Candida [9].

In the current study, a specific clinical isolate of C.


## Methods
 (EMS) platform (Mediatech, In., New York, USA) (Table 1) to identify polymicrobial and microbe-associated endometrial polyps. Endometrial endometrial endometrial endometrial endometrial polyps (ends) were collected from the pulmonary and fecal samples of HIV-negative patients in our cohort.


## Results
The results indicated that the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were the predominant population. The number of CD4+ T cells was the highest in the bronchial blood (9.0%), and the percentage of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the lungs of patients with Meningitis. In addition, the proportion of total CD4+ T cells was highest in the airways of patients with Meningitis. In the spleen, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. In the brain, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. The proportion of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. The microbiota analysis also revealed that the CD4+ T cells in the spleen were the predominant population, especially in the airways. The proportion of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the airways of patients with Meningitis. In the spleen, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. In the brain, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis.

Microbiota of Endometrial Tubes and Colonization of the Lungs of Patients with Meningitis
The results of the microbiota analysis and the quantitative PCR analysis were summarized in Table 3. The results indicated that the number of CD4+ T cells was the highest in the airways of patients with Meningitis. In the spleen, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. The proportion of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. In the brain, the number of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. The proportion of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis. The microbiota analysis also revealed that the CD4+ T cells in the spleen were the predominant population, especially in the airways. The proportion of total CD4+ T cells was the highest in the patients with Meningitis.


## Discussion
pylori
In our study, we found that . pylori secreted a large number of MVs, which were not abundant in the lungs of infected mice. These MVs may play a role in the development of H. pylori-induced lung diseases.

The presence of MVs in the lungs of infected mice suggests that H. pylori induces a specific subset of MVs in the lung tissue. In addition, the presence of MVs in the lungs of H. pylori-infected mice may be associated with the development of H. pylori-induced lung diseases.

H. pylori secretes proteins that are found in the blood and intestine of humans and other mammals (reviewed in [9]). In addition to the H. pylori-specific MVs, other H. pylori-specific proteins have been identified in human tissue. Among them, we identified two proteins, cathepsin B and heme-3, that are present in the human and mouse blood but absent from the human lungs (Figure S3). The cathepsin B protein is involved in the production of cathepsin B and in the induction of MVs in human and mouse tissue (Figure 2). We also identified a cathepsin-3 protein that is present in the human lungs but absent from the mouse lung (Figure S3). We observed that the cathepsin-3 protein was absent from the lungs of infected mice but present in the infected mice when they were infected with H. pylori (Figure S3). We found that the cathepsin-3 protein is present in the lungs of infected mice and that it was absent from the lungs of infected mice when they were infected with H. pylori (Figure S3). The cathepsin-3 protein is also present in the mouse lung but absent in the mouse lungs when infected with H. pylori (Figure S3). Although the cathepsin-3 protein is not found in the mouse lung, it is present in the mouse lung and is present in the infected mice when infected with H. pylori (Figure S3). The cathepsin-3 protein was also found in the lung of H. pylori-infected mice, but absent when the infected mice were infected with H. pylori (Figure S3). These results suggest that H.
