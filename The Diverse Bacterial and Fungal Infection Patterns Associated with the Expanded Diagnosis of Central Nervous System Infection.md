## Abstract
Lymphocytic hypothalamitis (LG) is a common clinical finding in lymphoid patients.


## Introduction
The genus Thermus quinquefasciatus is a large and morphologically diverse group of saprotrophic fungi. The genus consists of more than 8000 species, of which only a few are saprobic.


## Methods
Among the patients with CM, 3 patients (MD and RB, 1 TNS, 1 VL, 1 APC, 1 heart/heart puncture, 1 CNS/brain puncture, 1 SLE, and 1 foot/head incision) were included in the stud. Among these, patients were classified as “healthy” and “severe”. The main outcome of this study was the diagnosis of central Nervous System Infection (CNSIS-VNI) in this study.

In order to obtain a complete picture of the clinical picture, the microbiology, immunology, and blood cultures were performed. The tests were performed at the hospital laboratory, and the results were recorded with a reference-plate reader (BCH-340, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). The results were evaluated by the clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as the blood culture results.

All tests were carried out in a first-class medical grade (G grade) laboratory, in accordance with the guidelines of the National College of Diagnosis and the ethics committee. The CSF results were reported at the hospital laboratory. The microbiological results were reported after a period of 24 h, after which blood cultures were performed by the first-class hospital laboratory. The clinical and laboratory results were the final report.

2.2. Sample Collection
All patients with CM who received blood culture positive blood cultures, the culture showing positive result of CSF or CSF culture, and blood culture negative blood culture, were included in this study. The samples were collected at the first-class hospital laboratory. The blood cultures were performed by the first-class laboratory of the first-class hospital laboratory, according to the procedures and protocol of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (CLSI document M27-A-3, January 2008) and the clinical characteristics were evaluated by the study nurses. The samples were divided into two groups: one was treated with RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and the other with RPMI-1640 medium plus 0.5% sodium azide solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).

## Results
In the blood samples, the different groups were identical (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3. For the HIV infected groups, the average bacterial load in the blood samples was 3.7 × 10^5 cells/ml (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S4). The mean number of fungal colonies was 6.6 × 10^5 (median 4.7 × 10^6) in the HIV infected group, and 3.7 × 10^5 (median 4.4 × 10^5) in the HIV infected group. However, the overall numbers of different fungal colonies were higher in the HIV infected group (median 6.7 × 10^6) than in the HIV infected group (median 3.7 × 10^5). For the fungal infections in the blood samples, the HIV infected group had a significantly higher fungal load than the HIV infected group (median 1.7 × 10^3), whereas the HIV infected group had a lower fungal load than the HIV infected group (median 1.4 × 10^3).

Mortality of HIV Infected Individuals in the HIV-Associated Infections
The mortality of HIV infected individuals in the HIV-associated infections was found to be higher than those of the HIV infected individuals in the blood samples (Figure 6). The mortality was significantly higher in the HIV infected group (median 29.1 per 100,000 persons) than in the HIV infected group (median 35.8 per 100,000 persons). The HIV-associated mortality was significantly higher in the HIV infected group (median 29.1 per 100,000 persons) than in the HIV infected group (median 36.5 per 100,000 persons) (Figure 7).

Impact of HIV Infection on Mortality
The effects of HIV infection on mortality were evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the HIV-associated and HIV-infected groups were significantly different (p = 0.001) (Figure 8). HIV infection significantly reduced the mortality in the HIV-associated and HIV-infected individuals compared to those of the HIV-infected group (p < 0.05) (Figure 8).


## Discussion
Although the total number of infections is still not known, the incidence of infection with viruses is increasin. This increase is also being recognized by the World Health Organization [13] who recently declared the HIV epidemic as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV/AIDS patients worldwide [14]. The HIV epidemic in this country has caused serious problems in public health care in Tanzania. The number of AIDS cases in this province has increased from a population of 5.5% in 2011 to 15% in 2016 [15]. There is also a significant increase in the number of cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA), the leading cause of invasive aspergillosis in the United States [16]. This cause was previously described by previous authors.

A high incidence of IA and other fungal infections has been previously reported by other authors [17, 18]. Although the incidence of IA was not reported in this study, the increased incidence of IFI has been reported in the past several years [19]. This increased incidence has been attributed to the increase of ARV infection and other opportunistic infections, which has resulted in the increased incidence of other opportunistic infections [20, 21]. In this study, the number of IFI cases were significantly increased from 10.6% in 2011 to 62.2% in 2016. This increase is significantly higher than the incidence reported in other studies. However, the numbers of IFI cases were smaller in the previous study (7.1%) [21]. The number of IFI cases in our study was smaller than the one reported in the United States (1.2%) [22]. It is possible that the increase in incidence of IFI may be related to the high incidence of ARV infection.

In this study, the incidence of IFI was significantly increased from 17.6% in 2011 to 20.9% in 2016. This increase is significantly higher than the incidence reported in other studies. However, the incidence of IFI in this study was significantly decreased from 6.1% in 2011 to 12.1% in 2016. This decrease may be related to the increased number of ARV infection cases.

The incidence of ARV infection was significantly decreased from 4.2% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2016. This decrease may be related to the increased number of ARV infection cases.
