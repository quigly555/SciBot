## Abstract
The human oral cavity is a very common site of inflammation, injury and death. The oral microbiome is well-established to be an important contributor to health and disease, and the identification of novel microbial strains has been a priority in the search for new antibiotics. In this study, we profiled the oral microbiome of 50 Australian adult patients, and found that the majority of the patients had a single oral microbiome, and these included oral fungi, endogonas, and pathogenic bacteria. Our study revealed that the oral microbiome was variable in composition, structure and diversity, and the oral cavity represented by the majority of the patients had a low number of microbial taxa. The frequency of Candida species was highest in the oral cavity of patients with chronic and steroid-resistant oral diseases, and this was associated with dysbiotic changes such as dysbiotic-stomach ache, dysbiotic flares of stomach cancer, dysbiotic consolidation, and abnormal enlargement of abscesses. The diversity of the endogonas, Bacteroidetes, and Escherichia-Shigella species that were identified in the oral microbiome were significantly decreased in these patients, and the abundance of these fungi was also decreased. The endogonas and Bacteroidetes diversity was significantly decreased in patients with chronic and steroid-resistant oral diseases, and the abundance of these species was also decreased in patients with steroid-resistant conditions. Our results suggest that the oral microbiome of patients with chronic and steroid-resistant oral diseases may be a potential source of novel antibiotics, and oral therapeutics with broad-spectrum activity against many human pathogenic microorganisms, including pathogenic yeasts, bacteria and fungi.

## Introduction
2006; Chitin-rich peptides: new insights) (1. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of recombinant peptide peptide-protein coupled virtual (PCVS) systems (2) as tools to improve the identification of peptides from environmental and clinical samples.

Biofilms consist of a complex network of cells, embedded in extracellular matrix, embedded in exoskeleton (3, 4). Biofilm formation is initiated by several factors including cell membrane and the “skeleton” itself, immune cells, and immune recognition and regulation (5, 6). The cell surface is covered with a complex network of extracellular proteins and other cells, which may serve as a reservoir for these peptides. The presence of protein-protein interactions and extracellular matrix proteins in the cell surface facilitates biofilm formation (7). The presence of soluble proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the cell surface can facilitate biofilm formation (8). The use of CSPs for peptide identification has been shown to improve the affinity of peptides to antifungal drug targets and to provide a broader antifungal strategy (9).

CSPs have been used to identify peptides from environmental and clinical samples. For example, CSPs were used to identify two antifungal peptides, baculovirus B and CSP-6 (10). Baculovirus B was identified as a highly virulent strain of CSP-6 that exhibited an increased susceptibility to azole drugs (11). However, this strain did not exhibit significant virulence, and the CSP-6 strain showed reduced susceptibility to the caspofungin, fluconazole, and itrampicin (12). The Hsp90 peptide, also known as Hsp90-40, was the first peptide identified as a potential CSP based on analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal RNA gene (13). However, Hsp90-40 was not synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it was not present in the majority of CSPs. Therefore, the structure of the peptide was not determined.


## Methods
The Chitin synthetases of . albicans were obtained from the National Stock Center (INTC, Mumbai, India). Chitin synthetases from C. albicans were obtained from the Institute of Pharmacy, Kolkata, India. Chitinase gene sequences of C. albicans were obtained from the European Collection of Chitinases (ECCH, Strasbourg, France).

PCR and sequencing of Chitinase gene sequences was carried out using an ABI Prism 7300 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Chitinase gene sequences were analyzed by using a BLAST search of the Ensembl website (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) to determine the presence of Chitinases, which were used as the search criteria for the Chitinase analysis.

Chitinase gene sequence alignment
The genomic sequences of C. albicans (BALB/c) and C. tropicalis (BALB/c) were downloaded from Ensembl (www.ensembl.org/index.html) and aligned using the program Clustal X 2.0a (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustal/) and the software package MEGA 6 (Tamura et al. 2011). The alignment was then manually edited by using the program T-Coffee (Bolger et al. 2011). Chitinases were defined as those putatively involved in the synthesis of chitosan or chitosan-dependent chitinases from C. albicans and C.


## Results
The biofilm was cocultured with chitin and selected for the synthesis of two chitin synthases: chsA (green) and chsB (red) for primary metabolism, and chsD (blue) and chsE (green) for secondary metabolism (Fig 1A. The chsA and chsB catalytic enzymes were separated and used to generate recombinant strains with the addition of an extra ß-1,6-linked chitin. The recombinant strains were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The obtained results were shown in Fig 1B. No peaks were detected in the MALDI-TOF MS data and no peaks were not detected in the NMR data. A high level of chitin was found in all the recombinant strains and no peaks were detected in the NMR data. However, the recombinant strains had no major changes in their enzymatic activities.

The recombinant strain has a single gene, chsA, which encodes for a putative chitin synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of chitin in the extracellular medium and in the extracellular medium. The chsA gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with a high level of sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S. cerevisiae, chsB, and chsD (Fig 1C). The chsA gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with high sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S. cerevisiae, chsB, and chsD (Fig 1C). The chsA gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with high sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S. cerevisiae, chsB, and chsD (Fig 1C). The chsE gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with high sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S. cerevisiae, chsB, and chsD (Fig 1C). The chsD gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with high sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S. cerevisiae, chsB, and chsD (Fig 1C). In addition, the chsE gene encodes a putative ABC transporter with high sequence identity with the ABC transporter of S.


## Discussion
The mannitol synthesis pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotes and remains to be elucidated in these fungi. It is involved in the synthesis of mannitol and the secondary metabolism of mannitol from fructose (Figure 1A). Mannitol biosynthesis was first discovered in yeast and the mannitol-oxidation pathway has been studied extensively in fungi such as A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, Candida albicans, and A. parasiticus (Liu et al.
