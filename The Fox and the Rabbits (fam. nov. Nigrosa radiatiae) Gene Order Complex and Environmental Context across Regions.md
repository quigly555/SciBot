## Introduction
In addition, many of the species, such as . graminearum and F. verticillioides, were reported to produce secondary metabolites, including toxins, which are important in vivo for disease resistance [27]. Other species, such as F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum, have also been reported to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases and peroxidases, that play an important role in the growth and pathogenicity of most microbes [28].

The general taxonomic composition of the F. graminearum species complex is highly conserved within and among closely related fungi, but the degree of specialization of the F. graminearum species is poorly characterized. It was suggested that the diversity of the F. graminearum species is due to genetic diversity rather than to ecological niches [29], [30]. The natural habitat of F. graminearum is not very diverse, and species of the above-mentioned genera tend to be saprobic and/or host specific. Fungi that are saprobic/host specific include F. graminearum, Aspergillus nidulans, and Cryptococcus neoformans [31], [32]. It was recently reported that a few species of the above-mentioned genera could be saprobic, such as F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, and F. proliferatum can be saprobic and/or host specific, as well as some species can be host specific, such as F. graminearum [31], [33]. However, few studies have investigated the species diversity of the F. graminearum species complex in the context of their pathogenic potential.

In this study, we investigated the diversity of the F. graminearum species complex in the field, and compared the diversity of their molecular types and their host-specific gene regions. In addition, we investigated the distribution of species among the F. graminearum species complex, including their substrate, yeast strains, and the occurrence of secondary metabolites. We hypothesized that the diversity of the F. graminearum species complex in the field is due to genetic and environmental factors, and that there is a relationship between the genetic and environmental variables that are associated with this type of diversity.


## Methods
. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed using a series of column chromatograms and filters, as previously described (Wang et al., 2015). Briefly, 50 µL of 0.2% TMS solution (0.25-1.0 M NaCl, 1 M KCl, 1 mM K_2HPO_4, pH 6.5) was applied to the column, which was held in the oven at 60°C for 15 min, then the chromatograms were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and the injection volume was 0.25 µl. The analysis was carried out in positive ion mode, with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 0.25 µl. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and the injection volume was 0.25 µl. The chromatogram was detected at 282 nm.

2.2. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% acetic acid (phase A) in water and 0.


## Results
no. Nigrosa radiatiae) gene order complex (Fig 4) revealed the presence of three major clades of gene order complexes. The first clade of Fox and Rabbits (fam. nov. Nigrosa radiatiae) contained a gene order complex comprising the genes of three QMHC genes (Q1 (gen. QMHC), Q2 (gen. QMHC), Q3 (gen. QMHC), Q4 (gen. QMHC)) (Fig 5). The second clade of Fox and Rabbits (fam. nov. Nigrosa radiatiae) contained a gene order complex comprising genes of three QMHC genes (Q1 (gen. QMHC), Q2 (gen. QMHC), Q3 (gen. QMHC), Q4 (gen. QMHC), Q5 (gen. QMHC), Q6 (gen. QMHC), Q7 (gen. QMHC), Q8 (gen. QMHC) and Q9 (gen. QMHC) (Fig 5). The third clade of Fox and Rabbits (fam. nov. Nigrosa radiatiae) contained a gene order complex comprising the genes of three QMHC genes (Q1 (gen. QMHC), Q2 (gen. QMHC), Q3 (gen. QMHC), Q4 (gen. QMHC) and Q5 (gen. QMHC)), which were not found in the previous study. The fourth clade of Fox and Rabbits (fam. nov. Nigrosa radiatiae) contained a gene order complex comprised of genes of three QMHC genes (Q1 (gen. QMHC), Q2 (gen. QMHC), Q3 (gen. QMHC), Q4 (gen. QMHC)), which were not found in the previous study.

Fox and Rabbits are related species of the family Phoma, which is maintained in soil for at least 400 years [40]. Both Fox and Rabbits have no homologs in the GenBank or other databases. The three QMHC genes in the family Phoma (q1, q2, q3) are located in the same gene cluster.


## Discussion
arachidis was comparable to the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “mushroom” mushroom . dictyopus (Bouveny et al. 2007). In the present study, we identified a total of 4,072 fox and 7,637 rabbit genes, which is comparable to the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “mushroom” mushroom P. dictyopus (Bouveny et al. 2007). The number of fox and rabbit genes was also higher in the “wild-caught” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). Therefore, the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “wild-caught” mushroom P. americana is higher than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “mushroom” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). The number of fox and rabbit genes in the “wild-caught” mushroom P. americana was lower than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “mushroom” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). Additionally, the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “mushroom” mushroom P. americana was higher than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). The number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana was lower than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007).

The number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana was higher than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). The number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana was higher than the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P. americana (Bouveny et al. 2007). Additionally, the number of fox and rabbit genes in the “muffle” mushroom P.
