## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that can cause fatal meningitis in immune compromised individuals. This opportunistic pathogen has high propensity for colonisation of the immunocompetent host, and the ability to persist in the immune compromised host is a prerequisite for dissemination. During in vitro and in vivo growth of C. neoformans, a nutrient-limited environment is required to sustain infection. We used an immunoproteomic approach to specifically analyze the zinc scavenger zinc finger proteins (ZrfZp) to gain insight into the zinc homeostasis and the role of ZrfZp during infection. ZrfZp are a family of proteins that are important for stress response and growth and are important for C. neoformans to gain dominance in in vitro and in vivo models. We firstly found that ZrfZp are essential for the development of ZrtA/ZrtB-induced pluricellular growth restriction (PrR) and growth restriction (SlR). Further analysis using molecular analysis of individual ZrfZp protein subfamilies revealed that the number of ZrfZp protein subfamilies is highly correlated with ZrfA transcription. Further analysis of the zinc homeostasis and the ZrfZp family members ZrF, Zrt, and ZrtS revealed that ZrtZp are essential for the formation of prionoid cells, the maintenance of pathogenic growth restriction, and the ability to invade and disseminate the fungus. Finally, the role of ZrfZp during infection of human epithelium in vitro and in vivo was also highlighted. These results provide the first evidence of a high zinc homeostasis role in C. neoformans and demonstrate that ZrfZp are essential to the development of this fungus.

Reviews the zinc homeostasis is essential to the survival of C. neoformans during infection of human epithelium. ZrfZp are a family of proteins that are essential for stress response and growth restriction in Cryptococcus.


## Introduction
It is also not clear if the authors mean that the phage collection contains a collection of phage clone. In fact, they only mention one collection of phage clones, and only mention the collection of bacteria. The authors then state that, “These are common bacteria that colonize the airway and can cause a respiratory illness, but they are not clearly distinguished from other bacteria”. However, in their list, they mention only a few common bacteria, and only one of them, implying that they are typing phage clones. How can they type phage clones? This list should be published in full, and it should be updated to reflect the overall list of common bacteria.

Author response: We agree that the word “common” is important, and we added the following paragraph in the Discussion: “We believe that the identification of common bacteria can be improved by adding additional samples, which will facilitate typing studies to identify common bacteria.”

We have removed the paragraph from our revised version, and re-described the point that the concepts presented in the revised version are important. We have changed the title to “Metagenomics of the respiratory tract and the contribution of respiratory epithelial cells to the shaping of bacterial species”.

Author response: We have now replaced the title to “Metagenomics of the respiratory tract and the contribution of respiratory epithelial cells to the shaping of bacterial species”.

The phrase “metagenomics” is now “metabomics”.

Author response: Metagenomics was corrected as “metab”, and the sentence was edited to “metab”.

We have changed the title to “Metagenomics of the respiratory tract and the contribution of respiratory epithelial cells to the shaping of bacterial species”.

The sentence was corrected and replaced with the sentence: Metagenomics of the respiratory tract and the contribution of respiratory epithelial cells to the shaping of bacterial species.

The sentence was also edited to “metab”: “metab” is now “metab”.


## Methods

But, because of the divergence between the two species, we cannot afford to write the remaining 8-10 nucleotides of the 5' and 3' UTR or of the .5' UTR. As it stands, these nucleotides are outside the complete range of the species and are not important in molecular biology (it is not possible to write the 2' UTR).

So, the species and species of the secondary metabolite of the side chain were swapped, and we chose the “2” UTR for use in the second metabolite of the chain. The ursolic acid-l-isopropyl alcohol analogs of the second metabolite were used as internal references, to denote the final products of the chain. It was in this sense that we defined the end product of the chain as the end product of the second metabolite (R) and the starting product of the second metabolite (S).

The substitution rate, the rate of substitutions, and the rate of recombination are computed in the model parameters, and are estimated by the non-linear regression of the model parameters, using the program MrModeltest^® (version 3.2.3, PAML 3.8.0, http://www.paml.org/).

Combining the model parameters with the free energy, the energy dispersive (FE) of the model parameters, and the free energy of the model parameters, we obtained the same model parameters for the end product of the chain.

The initial conditions of the model parameters were the rate of evolution, the rate of evolution of the model parameters, and the rate of recombination.

## Results
In the course of our work, we have observed that many of the cellulase genes are involved in the degradation of cell wall. The degradation process is a complex process and we have identified several protein families with the highest levels of activity in proteases and proteoglycan production (Table 1). Several proteoglycan biosynthesis and degradation proteins are reported to be expressed during cell wall degradation. A functional degradation protein, SMG_07960, is expressed at very low levels during cell wall degradation [16]. Other genes involved in cell wall remodeling have been reported to be up-regulated in response to cellulase-mediated degradation [28].

We identified several novel cellulase-encoding genes in our set of 18-gene gene deletion mutants. A total of 438, 832, and 919 of these genes were expressed at least two-fold (Table 1). The gene deletion mutant was more sensitive to the cAMP-induced cell wall damage and cellulase-mediated cell wall damage treatments compared to the control control group (P < 0.05; Fig 2). However, these genes were also up-regulated in the <U+0394>gmi deletion mutant (Fig 2). The reasons for the significant differences in gene expression in these genes are not yet clear. It has to be possible that the effect of C. albicans infection is mediated by the stress response or other specific mechanisms. It is also possible that the mutant is sensitive to the cell wall stressor, which might be associated with the cell wall degradation. It has to be possible that the gene deletion results in the loss of activity of cell wall degrading enzymes during the cell wall degradation.

Identification of cellulase-encoding genes
Several enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell walls are known to be involved in cell wall degradation [8-10]. Many of the cellulase genes have been identified in the literature and in the current study. However, no single cellulase-encoding gene was consistently found in all the deletion mutants. The most common cellulase gene is the 1,3-beta-glucan synthase (GST1) (Table 1). This gene was up-regulated in the <U+0394>gmi deletion mutant, while it was up-regulated in the control group.


## Discussion
gattii mutant strains are not normal for the mammalian hos. They are also not normal for the cells in which they are present, and they are not in fact normal for the cells in which they are present. This is because C. gattii, as a homologue, is not able to grow in the presence of either the mammalian or the fungal immune system. The cell wall of C. gattii is comprised of a monoclonal network of highly expressed polysaccharides that are present in diverse species. In addition, C. gattii is able to form a complex with the mammalian immune system through the interaction of a small number of different antigens (Vogel et al., 2011). These interactions are common in human infection (Boch and Gerstein, 2009), and occur in both mammalian and insect infections. In this way, C. gattii is able to interact with both the mammalian and the fungal immune systems (Vogel et al., 2011). However, these interactions are limited to the cell wall of C. gattii.

The second most important aspect of C. gattii pathogenesis is its ability to disseminate to various body sites in vivo. The most frequent route of infection by C. gattii is inhalation. This route is most commonly established by inhalation of C. gattii strains through the respiratory tract, but it has been discovered in association with the lungs of many patients (Singh et al., 2000). It has been also demonstrated that C. gattii can disseminate from the respiratory tract to the brain, where it can disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS) where it can disseminate to the brain (Zhang et al., 2015). The fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Blastomyces dermatidis are the most frequent pathogens in the CNS, but there is also a C. gattii strain isolated in one study (Singh et al., 2000). Furthermore, C. gattii can also be isolated from the brain of infected mice (Zhang et al., 2015). However, a lack of established virulence mechanisms against this pathogen has been observed in vivo (Singh et al., 2000). In this way, C. gattii can be considered as a potential agent that could be used for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in humans.
