## Abstract
The Toxoplasma gondii infection model of immunocompetent humans has been adapted in recent years to live-battersea, microbial infections. The human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii has been widely used to study the host response to microbial infection. This model organism provides a high-resolution view of the transcriptional response of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that the Toxoplasma disruptans complex has a strong microbicidal activity against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms and is also highly virulent to a variety of invertebrates. The antifungal activity of the complex is relatively low, but it strongly activates the specific Toxoplasma toxins responsible for virulence. This model organism provides an excellent model system for studying the complex’s response to host-associated pathologies and fungal infection. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the host response to T. gondii infection.


## Introduction
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a human fungal pathogen, which has been found to cause life-threatening invasive pulmonary disease in immunocompromised hosts [1]. The infection is usually caused by inhaled mucociliary precuret and localized to the lung. K. sarcoma infection is also acquired from environmental sources such as bird droppings, soil, decaying wood, and bird droppings [2].

The pathogen is a member of the phylum of the fungal genus, Aspergillus. The pathogen causes IA, or allergic reaction, in the immunocompromised host. K. sarcoma is a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen, which causes IA in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts [3], [4]. The incidence of IA caused by K. sarcoma has been increasing worldwide in recent decades, but K. sarcoma is an opportunistic fungal pathogen. However, despite its clinical and economic importance, little is known about the fungal biology of this pathogen.

Aspergillus spp. are among the most common etiologic agents of IA [5], [6]. It is a soil-borne, filamentous, opportunistic fungal pathogen, which causes a wide spectrum of disease including IA in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts [7]. In addition to severe infections and immunocompromise disorders, the incidence of immunocompromised patients has increased over the past decades due to the widespread use of immunosuppressive chemotherapy, organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the use of corticosteroids [8]. Furthermore, A. fumigatus is the most common A. nidulans species found in blood cultures. The fungus can cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. In immunocompromised hosts, the disease can lead to severe respiratory, central nervous system, skin, central vascular, and pulmonary manifestations [9], [10]. Recently, it was suggested that A. nidulans might be a suitable model for monitoring human IA [11].

In our laboratory, we first identified and characterized A.


## Methods
BEPT-E is a non-destructive, semi-conventional BEPT method that incorporates an oil wastewater treatment syste.

BEPT-E is based on a modified method of BEPT-E [34] using a modified oil wastewater treatment system. The BEPT-E consists of two stages: a water treatment (wet state) and a water treatment (cool state). The treatment system used for BEPT-E depends on the operation temperature and the oil wastewater treatment. The water treatment is performed by shaker (700 rpm, 25°C, 28°C) with the following steps: The water treatment is performed in a water bath (90°C) for 5 min, followed by a shaker (70°C) for 90 min. The water treatment is carried out for 5 min at a ratio of 20:1:1:0.5 (wet to cool). The treatment system is operated in continuous water flow (2 min/flow rate) with a flow rate of 1 L/min. The temperature (52°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C) is maintained at a constant temperature of 35°C/min. The oil wastewater treatment is carried out in a water bath (90°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C). The oil wastewater treatment system has a maximum flow rate of 3 L/min. The treatment system is operated by a shaker (70°C) for 5 min, followed by a shaker (70°C) for 90 min. The temperature (52°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C) is maintained at a constant temperature of 35°C/min. The wastewater treatment is carried out in a water bath (90°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C). The oil wastewater treatment system is operated by a shaker (70°C) for 5 min, followed by a shaker (70°C) for 90 min.


## Results
However, it has been reported that the degradation of wastewater or of components of wastewater treatment process is a cost-effective approach for wastewater engineering project. This fact may be attributed to the large and complex nature of the wastewater treatment process and its consequent slow degradation process. The present study on the efficiency of wastewater treatment is in agreement with previous studies on wastewater treatment for biodiesel production by increasing the production of sterols by microbial biomass and the increase in the production of sterols by the microbial community [12,14]. The report also indicated that the wastewater treatment process could be also used to develop wastewater treatment technologies. The use of wastewater treatment process for biodiesel production has been shown to be labor-intensive and costly due to the limited taxonomic diversity of wastewater degradation process in China. Therefore, the present study provided a good evidence that wastewater treatment process could be an efficient approach for the development of biodiesel production by enhancing the quality of wastewater by enhancing the production of sterols by the microbial community and improving the quality of wastewater treatment process for biodiesel production by enhancing the production of sterols by the microbial community in the industrial and environmental industries.

In addition, the study demonstrated that the wastewater treatment process could be also used for biodiesel production by enhancing the biodiesel production by enhancing the performance of the industrial wastewater by enhancing the production of sterol ester. Further, the study showed that the wastewater treatment process could be also used for biofuel production by enhancing the performance of biodiesel production by enhancing the production of sterol ester by the microbial community. The study also indicated that the wastewater treatment process could be also used to develop biodiesel production by enhancing the production of sterol ester by the microbial community by enhancing the production of sterol ester by the microbial community and improving the quality of wastewater treatment process for biodiesel production by enhancing the production of sterol ester by the microbial community.

3.2. Assessment of the Effect of wastewater treatment on the FAME Production by the Microbial Community
The FAME production by the microorganism was evaluated by increasing the concentration of crude water by adding 1% to the wastewater treatment process, followed by the release of the dry biomass by the addition of the reducing agent sodium nitrite (0.2%) (Figure 1).


## Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of FK506 on the growth of P. expansum. In this study, two strategies were employed to achieve the same effect: 1) FK506-treated and untreated P. expansum cells were grown on the same medium for 1 h and 2) FK506-treated and untreated P. expansum cells were cultivated in a minimal medium for 1, 4, 6 h. Both strategies resulted in growth of the fungus in a minimal medium at 100 µg/mL.

In the first step, in vitro experiments on the yeast-to-fungus conversion were conducted using TEM in combination with a fungistatic medium. The results of the fungicidal effect of FK506 on P. expansum growth were in agreement with those obtained by other studies (43, 44). The results of the in vitro experiments were in agreement with those obtained in the experiments presented herein.
