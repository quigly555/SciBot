## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis with drug resistance in many endemic regions of Latin America. The rapid emergence of resistance coupled with the development of a growing diphenocarcinoma epidemic in this subtype of fungal disease has highlighted the need for a more accurate and fast diagnosis of PCM. We developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection and differentiation of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) isolates from peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The assay was performed on the cochlea and CSF of Pb isolates. The limit of detection (LoRa) for both the LAMP assay and the Pb-specific Pb-specific assay were determined at 200 µg/mL. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the Pb-specific assay were 70 and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (P+), and negative predictive value of the Pb-specific assay were 100%, and 0.


## Introduction
Over the past two decades, the number of opportunistic fungal pathogens causing infections of the central nervous system (CNS) increased significantly, particularly in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients.1,2 Most CNS infections are caused by Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum.3-7 This group is also comprised of Cryptococcus gattii, which is the predominant species in the CNS of immunocompromised patients, and Histoplasma capsulatum, which causes skin infections in immunocompromised patients.8-11 In the context of HIV infection, the CNS of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.12,13

Invasive fungal disease (IFD) in the SLE is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by progressive multifocal leukocytosis, deficits in granuloma formation, and loss of both photoreceptor (PREM) and B cell-derived effector function.14-16 The pathogenesis of the disease is dependent on the function of the immune system, including the ability to destroy host cells by cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and phagocytosis. In the CNS, IFDs are mainly caused by Candida albicans, which is capable of causing serious fungal infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) of patients. Although the epidemiology of the infections is rather poorly documented, Candida albicans is the leading causative agent. This fungus can cause various CNS diseases in the SLE, ranging from meningitis to encephalitis, and it is also associated with CNS infection with severe neurological sequelae.


## Methods
Briefly, fresh mycelial plugs of . aeruginosa were inoculated onto the surface of the cellophane and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 days in 100% ethanol. The MICs were read using a microplate reader (Tecan MICs, Switzerland). The plates were read on an automated microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HT, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The assay mixture was inoculated on the surface of the cellophane, incubated at 37 °C for 2 days, and the growth inhibition zones were measured.

Analysis of extracellular fluconazole resistance by ELISA
To determine the effect of extracellular fluconazole on the growth of P. aeruginosa, the assays were performed as previously described (13, 34, 69). Briefly, P. aeruginosa was cultured overnight in YPD medium at 30 °C and 200 rpm. Next, the mycelium were washed three times with PBS, and then 1 mL of 1 M ammonium chloride was added. The mycelia were then gently agitated with a sterile pipette, and the suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 M ammonium chloride, and then 0.5 mL of 0.05% Tween 20 was added to the resuspended mycelia. The suspension was then gently agitated again and the upper layer was removed. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HT, Winooski, VT, USA). The degree of extracellular fluconazole resistance was defined as the ratio between the absorbance of the upper layer and the absorbance of the upper layer of the suspension.

Statistical analysis
Data were analysed by using SPSS software (version 20.0). Differences were considered statistically significant at a p-value of less than 0.05. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons and Student’s t-test for categorical data. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and a Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons.


## Results
However, the ability of IMGRA to mediate disease in the mouse model is still a challenge for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis [16. We performed a model of systemic candidiasis in which the AMB dose is increased to 100 mg/kg/day for 10 weeks and mice are then challenged with 10^5 yeast cells. After 10 weeks, the mice are sacrificed, and the brains are extracted and plated. The results are summarized in Table 1. The survival rate is evaluated after 10 weeks. We used a strategy based on the Survival and Survival curves for the study of systemic candidiasis. The mouse model is depicted in Fig 1A. The survival curves for the AMB-treated mice were comparable to the survival curves for the control mice. The overall survival rates of the AMB-treated mice are also in line with the survival curves obtained from the mice treated with the AMB alone.

We observed a trend toward a higher susceptibility of the mice to AMB compared with the control group (Fig 1B). The susceptibility of the mice was higher in the AMB-treated group than the control group (Fig 1B). The drug-treated mice were also less sensitive to AMB compared with the control group (Fig 1B). We observed a trend toward a decrease in susceptibility to AMB compared with the control group (Fig 1C). In addition, the drug-treated mice showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to AMB compared with the control group (Fig 1C).

3.5. AMB-Induced Oxidative Stress
The oxidative stress response of the blood is a major mechanism of systemic candidiasis. However, the physiological response of the mouse to AMB is largely dependent on the stress state of the host. The metabolism of ROS is essential for the pathogenicity of C. albicans and C. neoformans [24,25]. C. albicans is a natural product of the blood, and the damage of the blood is one of the most critical steps in the pathogenesis of systemic candidiasis [26]. We have previously demonstrated that the oxidative stress response of the blood is crucial for the pathogenesis of C. albicans and C. neoformans [27].


## Discussion
fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA strain and increased in . fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA wild-type, and that the expression of IFN-gamma is increased in A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA wild-type and <U+0394>cpsA mutant strains [33]. Although the observed increase in the expression of IFN-gamma was not observed in A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA wild-type, its increase in A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA mutant strain, which were resistant to the azole class of drugs, could indicate the involvement of IFN-gamma in the azole-resistant phenotypes.

A significant increase in intracellular IFN-gamma was also observed in A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA wild-type, which were susceptible to the azole class of drugs, and whose expression was increased in the A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA wild-type strain, which were resistant to the azole class of drugs. The increased IFN-gamma expression in the A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA mutant strain could be due to the interaction between the fungal cell wall and the azole-susceptible phenotypes of the A. fumigatus <U+0394>cpsA mutant strains. However, the role of IFN-gamma is not known.
