## Abstract
We present a rare case of lymphadenopathy in an immunocompetent adult. He was a male who was diagnosed to have an advanced form renal failure and was treated with high-dose steroids. Within one week of starting the steroid therapy, cytological cultures grew FgDTH1. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone, and after one week had normal size ring surrounding cells. He was treated with an oral fluticasone and was started on maintenance therapy with a slight improvement in his renal function. However, within two weeks had enlarged cells surrounding the globe. Cytological cultures of brain and bone marrow biopsy were all negative. He was started on antitubercular treatment with a good response. However, he deteriorated and died of emergent organ failure. Our family and all our colleagues at the Hospital Luis Vernaza did an outstanding medical and surgical service to this very sick individual.


## Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the immune system of animals, which are found in humans and many other mammals. They are part of the immune system of humans and animals and are involved in the development of a number of inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases, solid tumors, and cancer. [1] They are also involved in the development of immunological disorders such as several infectious diseases. [2] NK cells are distinct from CD4 and CD8 cells in many aspects, such as their cytotoxicity towards tumor cells and the ability to bind to the plasma membrane and trigger cytokines release T cells in the extracellular milieu, which are essential for the development of adaptive immunity. [3]

The immune system of animals is different from those of humans, and it has evolved in a multi-layered network. [4] In the immune system, NK cells are activated by several stimuli, such as viral, bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. [5] NK cells express several receptors, such as CD56, CD16, and CD43, which mediate their activities against pathogens. [6] CD56 is a key mediator of the innate immune response, and its accumulation is a signature of the activation of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung. [7] The expression of CD56 is highly regulated, and its accumulation is a signature of the activation of NK cells in the lung and in the spleen. [8], [9] In addition, NK cells also express several receptors, such as NK receptor (KL) and NK receptor 2 (NKR2), which mediate the activities of NK cell-mediated immunity against pathogens, as well as against cancer cells. [10]

The two major cell types, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are present in the bone marrow and in the periphery of tumor cells. However, they are not always present. Their role is to inhibit tumor growth. [11] A key role is to identify, differentiate, and kill tumor cells.


## Methods
All of the patients were treated by the pathologist of the Hospital for Infectious Diseases at the University of São Paulo (UFPSP. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo and the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (CEUA-UFRPSP).

In this study, we applied the principles described by the Declaration of Helsinki, in which all patients with proven or probable hematological malignancies were considered as participants, and the ethical principles of the Helsinki and the Declaration of Helsinki in which all patients were considered as patients.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo and the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (CEUA-UFRPSP). The procedure for data collection was approved by the ethics committee of the Federal University of São Paulo.

Isolation and purification of recombinant plasmid
The recombinant plasmid pBKH-mCherry-TOPO was generated as described previously [48]. Briefly, the pBKH-mCherry-TOPO plasmid was linearized with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli OP50 cells. The transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) media containing ampicillin and kanamycin. Plasmid pBKH-mCherry-TOPO-mCherry was purified with pYES-easy purification kit (Invitrogen). The purified pBKH-mCherry-TOPO-mCherry was used as a positive control for the recombinant plasmid preparation. The reaction mixture containing 20 mM L^-1 agarose (Invitrogen) was used as a blank control. The purified pBKH-mCherry-TOPO-mCherry was used as a negative control for the amplification of plasmid pBKH-mCherry-TOPO-mCherry.


## Results
cb.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the databases (BlastDB, JASPER and NCBI) using the nucleotide sequences of the predicted proteins in each gene. The results of the search for proteins with N-terminal trimming are shown in Table 1. A total of 835,767 protein-coding sequences were identified using the GAT algorithm, which is available as a public online database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BlastDB). Of these, 87,684 (22%) proteins were identified in at least one of the four gene models. The majority of the predicted proteins of the four genes (96,484) were also identified in at least one of the four gene models. The three main proteins (PC1, PC2, and PC3) are involved in various functions, such as protein fate and metabolism, transmembrane transport, and defense against pathogens. The genes in the five most commonly identified proteins are the two most conserved proteins in each of the four gene models, HapX and S. pneumoniae. The predicted proteins from the three most commonly identified proteins are the two most widely conserved proteins in each of the four gene models, HapX and S. pneumoniae, which are encoded by three different genes in each of the four gene models.

The number of predicted proteins identified by GAT is lower than those obtained using BLASTP (Table 1). The average GAT score for the eight most commonly identified proteins was 0.0041 (Table 1). The average GAT score for the nine most commonly identified proteins was 0.004 (Table 1). The average GAT score for the nine most commonly identified proteins was 0.02 (Table 1). The BLASTP analysis revealed that the GAT score for the five most commonly identified proteins was lower than that of the average BLASTP score for the five most commonly identified proteins (Table 1). The highest score for the most commonly identified proteins was 0.07 (Table 1). The lowest GAT score for the most commonly identified proteins was 0.01 (Table 1).


## Discussion
Our previous study demonstrated that primary PCNS is common in the USA and the majority of patients are HIV-positive [8]. However, patients with primary PCNS have a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and thus PCNS is a major health risk to the general population. Patients who have primary PCNS have a higher proportion of immunocompetent hosts, have shorter duration of illness and poorer prognosis. The majority of patients with primary PCNS are younger than 60 years [8]. Therefore, the proportion of patients with primary PCNS is likely to be underestimated.

Our study revealed that patients with PCNS had higher CD4 T-cell counts, higher neutrophil counts, higher cell counts, and increased mortality. However, other studies have shown that patients with primary PCNS have a higher proportion of CD4 T-cell counts, neutrophil counts, and higher cell counts [9-13].
