## Abstract
Background. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is the most common type of pulmonary disease in adults. Patients present with typical symptoms and factors predisposing to disease. We sought to determine whether granulomas form on immune suppressive treatments and whether neutrophil responses play a role in their development. Methods. We describe a patient with CGD who presented with multiple lesions and severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having lymph node metastatic malignancy. Results. He received immune suppressive treatment for one month followed by debridement and immunosuppression for two months. In the follow-up ultrasound and laboratory examination he has demonstrated the presence of lymph node metastases with a full-fledged coccoidial lesion and none with tumefaciens. Conclusion. The patient had advanced stage IV leukemia with a normal immune response. He responded well to immunosuppression and debridement. One month after the initial presentation he had abdominal pain and abdominal pain turned to individuation and abdominal distention. The skin lesions gradually diminished in size. Two weeks after the initial presentation the patient suddenly stopped breathing and had difficulty swallowing. Computed tomography images showed lymph node metastasis. The tumor was removed and the patient had a good visual and angiographic prognosis. The patient's history included chemotherapy, transplantation, HIV, and chemotherapy-related illnesses.


## Introduction
The synthesis of DNA sequences by multidrug resistant organisms has been the focus of much attention from the scientific community over the past few decades. The potential of many bacterial pathogens to infect humans has led to several attempts to develop the first drugs against bacterial infections, some of which failed [1-3]. Some of the most successful approaches have included the use of antibiotics, nucleic acid, and/or protein delivery systems, or were designed to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria [4,5]. The most commonly used antimicrobial drugs are designed to destroy bacterial DNA, mainly by disrupting the enzyme that catalyzes the DNA synthesis [6]. Other successful approaches involve the use of nucleic acid delivery systems that allow the bacteria to evade the host’s immune system and avoid the host’s immune system attack and inhibit the host’s growth. The DNA-based antibiotics are known to have a high degree of selectivity, are relatively small, and are highly toxic to bacterial cells [7,8]. Therefore, the development of new antimicrobial drugs against bacterial infections is a very urgent task. In addition, a lot of efforts have been made to find a way to produce new antimicrobial compounds. The progress of antimicrobial drug development is based on the realization that there is still much to learn, and that the development of new antimicrobial drug concepts is mainly based on empirical data and on the evaluation of existing drugs [9,10]. In this regard, some authors have made a very important contribution to the field of antimicrobial drug development [11].


## Methods

The identification of the . albicans strain used in this study is based on the comparison of the strains and morphotypes of C. albicans strains isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients with candidiasis and confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analyses. C. albicans is a species isolated from the nasal epithelium of tropical plants. The isolate was isolated from the nasal cavity of a patient with candidiasis.

## Results
We have shown here that the majority of fungi isolated from human blood are resistant to the antimicrobial drugs and the two most common fungi isolated in this study are . neoformans (Fig 1A) and C. albicans (Fig 1B).

Among the 16 fungal isolates tested, Candida species were more frequently isolated from blood than from CSF (Table 2). Four of the five Candida species were isolated from blood, with a higher rate in blood than CSF (Table 2). A higher rate of blood-associated Candida species was seen in CSF than in blood (Table 2). Two of the six Candida species were isolated from CSF, with a higher rate in CSF than in blood (Table 2).

To further assess whether the majority of fungal isolates isolated from blood had invasive fungal infections, the fungal isolates from blood were inoculated into human skin and blood culture. The fungal isolates from blood were also tested for fungal keratitis, pharyngeal candidiasis, and mycoplasma hyphal infections, and in all three cases the fungal isolates were isolated from blood (Table 3). Among the tested isolates, seven were in the genus Candida (Table 3). The other eight fungal isolates were isolated from CSF and blood culture, including two C. neoformans (Table 3).

In addition to the sensitivity and the specificity of the identified fungal isolates to fluconazole, we found that the fungal isolates were susceptible to several antifungal drugs and tested for sensitivity to other agents, including terbinafine, voriconazole, and caspofungin. We also tested for sensitivity to fluconazole and fungicidal activity of the two other agents, caspofungin and flucytosin, both of which were used in the present study. We also tested the antifungal activity of the caspofungin-1,3-a-demethylase inhibitor (EC_50 = 0.4 µM) and the hygromycin antibiotic (EC_50 = 0.5 µM).

We also found that the isolates were more sensitive to fluconazole than the control strain.


## Discussion
. neoformans and C. gattii are the most frequent pathogens of humans. C. neoformans is also the most prevalent in African patients with HIV, while C. gattii infection is rare in patients with HIV [5, 6]. C. gattii is the most common human fungal infection [5, 6]. In this study, the prevalence of C. gattii among HIV patients was 17.7%. This is consistent with other studies [4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 19].

There were two main findings. The first was the higher prevalence of C. gattii among HIV patients in the HIV/AIDS patients, which was higher than the prevalence of C. neoformans among HIV patients in other studies [7, 8]. Second, the patients with HIV infection were also more susceptible to Cryptococcus infection than those with HIV infection. In the HIV patients, there was a significantly higher risk of cryptococcosis compared with other infections. This result could be related to the high incidence of C. gattii in HIV patients, which could explain the higher incidence of cryptococcosis among HIV patients in this study.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal infection in HIV patients, with a global prevalence of 5.7%. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common human fungal infection, accounting for 60% of all invasive fungal infections [20]. Cryptococcus neoformans is usually diagnosed in the respiratory tract or in the skin, but can also be present in the setting of solid organ transplantation, such as the subcutaneous or the mucosal skin [20, 21]. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most frequent fungus in the setting of transplantation [22]. Cryptococcus neoformans is the second most common human fungal infection after Candida albicans and is responsible for approximately 20% of all invasive fungal infections [23]. Cryptococcus gattii is the most frequent human fungal infection in the setting of transplantation, and is also responsible for approximately 50% of invasive fungal infections [24].

The prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii among the HIV patients was 36.3%, which was lower than the prevalence of 29.6% among HIV patients from other studies [7, 8, 9, 15, 21]. The second main finding was the higher prevalence of C.
