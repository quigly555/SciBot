## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the etiological agent of cryptococcosis, an important fungal infection that mainly affects people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Its pathogenicity has also been subject to the interpretation of the disease and, in recent years, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the otherwise deadly disease have highlighted the need for new agents. In this context, the recent surge in antifungal drugs promises an alternative to the current paradigms for cryptococcosis diagnosis. Cryptococcus polyomannans, the sole agent of Cryptococcus, is the most prevalent causative agent of fungal meningitis in the world. The drug class used for diagnosis of Cryptococcus is divided into three arms; the fluconazole-based induction regimens, the flucytosine-based therapy and the amphotericin-based treatment. We recently reported that the combination of fluconazole and amphotericin B resulted in a 50% reduction in mortality from cryptococcosis. Here, we review the clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and pharmacological aspects of the antifungal armamentarium of antifungal drugs against C. gattii.

Clinical features and laboratory data of fatal patients with cryptococcosis who underwent combined antifungal therapy.

C. gattii molecular typing shows that the major molecular typing species (MSC/FLP-family) include C. neoformans, C. gattii strains isolated from clinical specimens, and C. deneoformans in association with other fungi.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is a commensal and human colonizer of both healthy and immunocompromised individuals [1]. This yeast is able to colonize and invade various body sites, and to cause disease in patients with immune system defects [2]. Although C. albicans is generally well-known for its ability to grow at body temperature, it has been found to grow at 37 °C and at 37 °C in the human host, which is not very different from other fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida glabrata, which can grow at body temperature [3]. In addition, C. albicans can also cause systemic infections, such as candidemia [4].

C. albicans can cause a wide range of clinical presentations depending on the patient's immune status and the immune defect of the host. When C. albicans is in the clinical state of infection, it is possible that it may be related to malignancy, diabetes, immune dysfunction, malign neoplasms, or both [5]. In fact, some C. albicans clinical isolates were identified as clinically different from human samples, indicating that these species may be closely related [6]. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between the pathogen and host is essential to implement appropriate clinical treatment.

Fungal pathogens usually live asymptomatically within their hosts, but some species can cause diseases ranging from asymptomatic colonization of environmental niches such as soil and water to invasive infections such as candidiasis [7]. When Candida spp. are isolated from the environment, they can germinate and cause infection, called biofilm formation. Biofilms are aggregated cells that are formed in the external milieu of the microorganism. Candida spp. can also cause infections in the healthy body, but they can cause infections in immunocompromised patients. For example, in immunocompromised patients, C.


## Methods
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of the Guizhou Medical Universit. All study participants provided written informed consent and were given ethical clearance.

Design and Setting
We conducted a cohort study, based on a prospective, observational study of pulmonary exudate-derived exudate-derived exudate therapy (PES, which is provided by the PES Organization [23]) in hospital-acquired-transplantation facilities, located in Guizhou Medical University. We assessed all patients with a CT scan within the first 24 hours after admission, and then treated them at the hospital-acquired-transplantation facility. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of the Guizhou Medical University.

Patients were divided into two groups: (i) patients with pulmonary exudate-derived exudate therapy without CT diagnosis, and (ii) patients with CT diagnosis that revealed pulmonary exudate-derived exudate therapy. CT diagnosis was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008) and after extensive review, we agreed to a CT diagnosis based on the guidelines. The CT diagnosis was confirmed by using the corresponding digital tomography (CT) tomography (DAS) (2010, revised 2010). CT tomography includes 2-dimensional field of view images with a spectral excitation wavelength of 600 nm and a wavelength of 495 nm, with a maximum depth of 5 cm. The CT tomography was performed on a digital scanning laser CT (CTLA-SFLT, BMG Labtech, Germany) operating at a scanning interval of 0.25 µm. The CT images were processed using the software Image J version 1.31.0 (Molecular Research Laboratory, Japan). We used the following parameters: peak duration of 1 min, beam length of 20 s, illumination and contrast ratio of 60%, peak brightness of 4500 to 5000 µm, and the spatial resolution of 2-layer stage and spectral width of 1.

Data Analysis
We considered a central CT spot as a CT point if the spot had a CT scan and CT score higher than 100 points. We also considered CT spots with CT analyzer settings that were used in all the CT scans performed by the PES Organization, which were chosen for this study. For CT spots that were not identified as a CT point, the CT analyzer used in all the CT scans was used.

## Discussion
We sought to evaluate the potential use of transgenic transgenic microorganisms for evaluating the role of specific transgene variants in disseminated diseas.

The transgenic microorganisms in this study are representative of the core genes of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a classic example of a gene model that can be used to assess the role of transgene expression and its relationships to the virulence of a particular species (4). Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast species that causes meningoencephalitis and disseminates globally. The fungus can also cause meningoencephalitis in humans and animals (5). Cryptococcus neoformans is known to cause an overwhelming infection in individuals with impaired renal function (6). Additionally, Cryptococcus neoformans can also cause disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts (7). We used transgenic microorganisms in the transgenic microorganisms for the evaluation of their potential use in the evaluation of disseminated disease. We found that transgene variants associated with mutations in key genes involved in the virulence and immune response of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gondii are highly enriched in the transgenic microorganisms. The transgenic microorganisms also displayed significant differences in their amino acid composition. In this regard, Toxoplasma gondii was the most abundant species in the transgenic microorganisms, with an amino acid composition comparable to that of Toxoplasma gondii. In contrast, C. neoformans and C. gattii were represented by only one species in the transgenic microorganisms. Thus, we believe that the transgenic microorganisms used in this study can be an excellent tool to evaluate the role of transgene expression and its relationships to the virulence of specific species.

In this study, we showed that transgene expression in Cryptococcus neoformans was significantly increased by transgene mutations in the genes TEXB, TPHB, and TPSB. Transgene mutations in the TEXB gene are required for a high level of Toxoplasma gondii virulence in humans and animals (8).
