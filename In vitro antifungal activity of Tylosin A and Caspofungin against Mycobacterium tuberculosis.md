## Abstract
C. elegans infection is an important factor in mediating host resistance and virulence in other eukaryotes. Cryptococcus neoformans is a commensal yeast that is found in the environment and in the gut of mammals, where it can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis. Our research group recently introduced C. neoformans strains with new serotypes, R265 and R272, based on genome sequencing of the strain. Comparative genomics analysis showed that these two strains carry a unique genomic DNA sequence that diverged between R265 and R272 and diverged between R265 and R272. The R265 strain showed a higher level of genome stability and had a lower level of repetitive sequences. The R272 strain carries a different genomic DNA sequence, which is not found in the corresponding R265 strain. Genome sequence comparisons with closely related strains showed that the R272 has a reduced pathogenicity that was suppressed by overexpressing the GATA-exonuclease gene in the R272 strain. In contrast, the R272 has a increased pathogenicity that was suppressed by overexpression of the GATA-exonuclease gene in the R272 strain.


## Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped single-gene variant virus that infects both humans and animals. It is found in the nasopharyngeal tract, in the gastrodermal barrier, the bloodstream, and in the interstitium of the lung. While most individuals are protected from the virus by the immune system, many individuals succumb to the infection. Although HCV infection is not an immediate clinical entity, it is known to occur in patients with chronic diseases, including AIDS and cancer. The disease can cause devastating long-term morbidity and mortality. In fact, it has been estimated that there are over 200 million HCV infections worldwide each year, with approximately 600,000 new cases diagnosed every year worldwide, resulting in over 620,000 deaths annually (1). It is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes inflammation of the skin and mucous membrane, which may lead to seeding of the central nervous system and subsequent development of chronic inflammatory diseases.

HCV infection has a complex interplay with various immune cells, which may include polymorphic (referred to as polymorphism) and heterogeneous (referred to as heterogeneity). The heterogeneity may be due to differences in the cytokines and pattern of cytokines secreted into the infected tissue, but also to other underlying factors, such as the host immune status, host immunodeficiency, or specific cytokines (2, 3).

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is usually initiated by viral infection, and it can be transmitted to the mammalian host by the inhalation of infectious particles. Inhalation of the virus results in the formation of the infectious particles in the lungs and leads to the progressive development of acute respiratory disease, which is usually fatal within 2-4 weeks after the virus has been cleared from the host. Once the virus has been cleared, the infectious particles in the lungs can spread to the central nervous system. In most individuals, the infection progresses without clinical symptoms, and the virus can spread to the brain, skin, liver, and other tissues (4).


## Methods
MTT assay method was used for the MTT assay, which is the best indicator for the antibacterial activity of the compoun. MTT assay solution (20 mg/mL stock in DMSO) was added to the freshly prepared mycelial samples and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MTT assay solution (10 mg/mL stock in DMSO) was then added to the freshly prepared mycelial samples and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured by the Michaelis-Menton method [21]. The efficiency of the MTT assay was calculated by the following equation:where i is the absorbance of the untreated mycelial samples, ii is the absorbance of the MTT assay with the treated samples, and iii is the absorbance of the untreated mycelial samples in the assay with the treated samples.

Methylcellulose (MFC) activity was determined by using MFC assay in vitro. MFC assay solution (20 mg/mL stock in DMSO) was added to the freshly prepared mycelial samples and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MFC assay solution (10 mg/mL stock in DMSO) was then added to the freshly prepared mycelial samples and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MFC assay solution (20 mg/mL stock in DMSO) was then added to the freshly prepared mycelial samples and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured by the Michaelis-Menton method [21].

## Results
Tylosin A has been shown to be effective in controlling the fungal burden in patients [25. Tylosin A is also used to treat tuberculosis infections [26]. In our study, we found that Tylosin A was more effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis than against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Table 1). The Tylosin A-treated cells were found to be more sensitive than the untreated cells to the antifungal drugs (Table 1). This result indicates that Tylosin A inhibits fungal growth and killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Tylosin A inhibits the growth and viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

We observed that Tylosin A-treated cells were more sensitive to the antifungal drug antifungal agents than the untreated cells. To further explore the biological mechanism of the antifungal activity, we performed an in vitro antifungal assay. In this assay, Mycobacterium tuberculosis were treated with Tylosin A for 1 h before the addition of either drug or the cells were treated with Tylosin A for 24 h before addition of the drug (Figure 2). Our results showed that Mycobacterium tuberculosis were more sensitive than Tylosin A-treated cells (Figure 2). The difference was significant (P < 0.05) when the Mycobacterium tuberculosis was treated with Tylosin A for 1 h before adding the drug. When the Mycobacterium tuberculosis was treated with Tylosin A for 1 h before adding the drug, the growth and viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited. These results indicate that Tylosin A inhibits the growth and viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

In order to elucidate the mechanism of the antifungal activity of Tylosin A against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we performed a western blotting assay. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells were treated with Tylosin A for 1 h before adding the drug or with the cells were treated with Tylosin A for 1 h before adding the drug.


## Discussion
tuberculosis) is in agreement with the findings of the present study (Figure 3), and it is in line with the earlier study of Gresham et a. (2015), who showed that Caspofungin inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, in vitro (Gresham et al. 2015).

The MICs of the compounds were determined by two independent tests, and they varied from 0.5 to 16 mg/mL. The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 128.3 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis, a very sensitive and potent antifungal agent (Gresham et al. 2015). The MIC_50 of the compounds was determined by the in vitro assay of the activity of the compounds against M. tuberculosis. The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 1.0 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis.

The MIC_50 values of the compounds against M. tuberculosis were 128.3 µg/mL and 16.6 µg/mL, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of the compounds against M. pachydermatis were 5.0 µg/mL and 2.0 µg/mL, respectively (Gresham et al. 2015).

The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 512.3 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis, a very sensitive antifungal agent (Gresham et al. 2015). The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 64.3 µg/mL against M. pachydermatis.

The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 100.0 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis, a very sensitive and potent antifungal agent (Gresham et al. 2015). The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 128.3 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis, a very sensitive and potent antifungal agent (Gresham et al. 2015).

The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 2.0 µg/mL against M. tuberculosis, a very sensitive antifungal agent (Gresham et al. 2015). The results showed that the compounds exhibited a MIC_50 of 2.0 µg/mL against M. pachydermatis.
