## Abstract
Two new species in the genera Frankiella and Microdochium (F. lucidum and F. hyaloceridiella) are introduced, both morphologically and ecologically, as well as from a single distant plant host, the rare Frankiella species, and two known undescribed species, Microdochiella sp. nov. and Microdochiella sp. nov. in the informal Fabaceae (Fungi not enumerated here as Frankiella or Microdochium). Microdochiella sp. nov. is recorded in Frankiella, while Microdochiella sp. nov. in the Fabaceae is reported from Frankiella. Microdochiella sp. nov. is also reported from the generic Fabaurealum. Frankiella species are distinguished based on host specificity and a number of host-specific features. Frankiella sp. nov.


## Introduction
Neuropsychiatric disorders are among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. CNS infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with various neurological disorders. The occurrence of neurological complications in patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders ranges from asymptomatic to invasive. This includes infections due to fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as well as non-neurodegenerative diseases. We present the case of a 31-year-old female with suspected CNS fungal infection and her reaction to the use of topical corticosteroids. Despite the frequent use of corticosteroids, there are no approved drug candidates for the treatment of CNS fungal infections in patients with CNS disorders. We also discuss the potential risk of drug-resistance and the therapeutic options.


## Methods
albicans and . capsulatum, respectively.

The specificity of the thioredoxin assay to Zymosan, a chemically active dimethyl sulfoxide scavenger, was evaluated by using Zymosan assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Plant extracts and enzyme extractions
The extracts of L. interdigitale (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were obtained by preparing the extracts from fungal mycelium of the Fusarium verticillioides, L. interdigitale, and L. infestans (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).

The extracts of S. cerevisiae were obtained from the culture of the F. solani CBS73589 strain (CBS-KNAW) at the Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Würzburg, Germany.

## Results
This interaction might be due to the unique nature of the two proteins, in particular, the presence of a strong structural motif, such as that found in the 3' end of histidine, which is also found in the 3' end of zinc trisaccer [9, 24, 30.

To investigate whether the interaction of thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer with histidine biosynthesis is essential for the inhibition of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, we investigated whether the inhibition of histidine biosynthesis requires the presence of the 3' end of histidine. As shown in Fig 4, thioredoxin is unable to inhibit the enzyme, whereas the zinc trisaccer inhibited histidine biosynthesis, although the activity of thioredoxin was not completely inhibited. The activity of the thioredoxin was also enhanced by the addition of the tertiary nitrogen. The addition of the tertiary nitrogen also enhanced the activity of the thioredoxin. The addition of the tertiary nitrogen also enhanced the activity of the zinc trisaccer. These data suggest that the inhibition of histidine biosynthesis is not required for the inhibition of zinc trisaccer. The addition of tertiary nitrogen to the medium also enhanced the activity of the thioredoxin. Taken together, these data suggest that the inhibition of histidine biosynthesis requires the presence of the 3' end of histidine, which is also present in the 3' end of the zinc trisaccer.

The inhibition of histidine biosynthesis requires the presence of the 3' end of histidine
The results of the hybridization assay revealed that the combination of thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer increased the activity of thioredoxin against the histidine biosynthesis enzyme. This activity might be due to the specific nature of the proteins, such as the 3' end of the protein, in particular, the presence of a strong structural motif, such as that found in the 3' end of histidine, which is also found in the 3' end of the protein [9, 24, 30].

The activity of thioredoxin in the catalytic domain of histidine was analyzed by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis [31].


## Discussion
We were able to demonstrate that the thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer are not only toxic but also inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine and lanostero. The inhibitory effect of thioredoxin was demonstrated in vitro by both thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer. We also showed that thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer are required for the successful fungicidal activity of thioredoxin and zinc trisaccer in vitro.

In the present study, the antifungal compounds are able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine. In a previous study by Ma and coworkers, the results showed that the compound C10H10 is able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine, and the inhibitory effect was observed in vitro. The results also showed that C10H10 is highly efficient in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine. In a previous study by Li, S., W. and C. Li in vitro demonstrated that C10H10 is able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine, and the inhibitory effect was observed in vitro.

A recent study by Filippicou et al. in vitro showed that C10H10 was able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine. The results also showed that C10H10 is highly efficient in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine. This study showed that C10H10 is highly effective in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine. In a previous study by Diaghran et al. in vitro, C10H10 was able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine. In a previous study by Lam et al. in vitro, the results showed that C10H10 was able to inhibit the biosynthesis of histidine. This study demonstrated that C10H10 is highly efficient in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine.

The present study confirmed that C10H10 is highly effective in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine. The results also showed that C10H10 is highly efficient in inhibiting the biosynthesis of histidine.
