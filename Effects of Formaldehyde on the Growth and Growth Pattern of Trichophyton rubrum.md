## Abstract
The basidiomycete fungus Alternaria alternata is an important fungal pathogen that causes destructive white rot diseases on a wide variety of crop plants. The different forms of Alternaria alternata mycangia are distributed worldwide, but their differences with the B. alternata mycangia mycangia population structure are not known. We sequenced the transcriptomes of the mycangia, A. alternata, and related taxa and compared the transcriptomes of the mycangia and other isolates based on the clustering of the fungal genomes. In addition, we used next generation sequencing technology to identify fungal genes that encode proteins that may play a role in antifungal resistance, virulence, or formation of mycotoxins. The genes were further divided into functional categories to capture the genomic features that determine the pathogenicity of the fungus.

The fungal transcriptome was shown to be similar among the isolates, but differentially expressed genes were enriched in genes involved in biosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and especially, the melanization pathway. These genes were also involved in secondary metabolism and virulence. A large number of the expressed genes were also differentially expressed, which may contribute to the pathogenicity of A. alternata.


## Introduction
2013) as well as the application of DMSO in the production of vitamin K (Yuan et a. 2013) (Fig 1).

Formaldehyde is a component of the formaldehyde produced by human sweat and sweat products, and in the formaldehyde production can be induced by many forms of culture, including plant and animal skin products (Wang et al. 2013). The production of formaldehyde in the formaldehyde from plants is one of the most important processes that can influence human health (Wang et al. 2013).

## Results
The growth characteristics of the fungal species are comparable and the structure of the fungal tissue is similar, except for the fungus can form a ne. The fungal tissue is comprised of several layers of tissue and sometimes the fungal tissue becomes aggregated and lumped together. The fungal tissue forms a compact and porous tissue and is composed of more than 100 hyphal cells (Figure 1B). Hyphal cells and hyphal aggregates are found in all the fungal species and they are most often found on the surface of the host plant. Hyphal cells are mostly globose or subglobose, or cylindrical, or ellipsoidal or filiform, usually with several spherical cells or cylindrical or cylindrical-fusiform cells, as shown by the shape and size of the cells (Figure 1B). On the other hand, the fungal cell wall is very thin and contains a few multiguttulate hyphae, as shown by the pseudohyphae of the hyphae, budding, and cell wall chlamydoconidia that are found in the walls of the hyphae (Figure 1B).

Pseudohypha were well characterized and have been shown to be the most successful phytopathogens of plants. They are the most important fungi in terms of their ability to modify the host environment and to establish and maintain a healthy lifestyle. They are also very effective in protecting plants against plant pathogenic fungi, which can cause serious disease. They are able to colonize, develop and invade plants and especially fungal cells and they are also important in the colonization of plant tissues and other living material. The pathogen can cause a wide range of disease symptoms in plants. The fungus can cause extensive necrosis and die. The damage to the plant tissues can be the main cause of disease. The pathogen can also cause some infections. However, the fungus can also cause permanent damage to the host tissue by causing the necrosis or die, and the pathogen can also cause damage to the host tissues by causing the death of plant cells and the end of the host plant. The fungal cell wall is composed of several layers, and it is highly important for the plant cell wall of the plant. The fungal cell wall is composed of several layers, and it is also highly important for the fungal cell wall of the host cell.


## Discussion
In this work, the strains were grown in the presence of HCl, acetone and methano. The growth curves were compared in Figure 2. The growth curves of the strains (Figures 2A,B and 2C) were obtained on the basis of the following analysis: in the case of the strains, the growth pattern was followed. The growth was observed for the first 24 hours after exposure to HCl, acetone and methanol, and the remaining 24 hours, when the strains were grown in the presence of HCl and acetone. The results are summarized in Figure 2.

The results showed that the strains were able to grow at high temperature and medium temperature. However, the growth of the strains was slower than those of the other strains. In the case of the strains, the growth was slower than those of the other strains. The results also showed that the strains were not able to grow at low temperature and medium temperature. The strains were able to grow at high temperature and medium temperature. In the case of the strains, the growth was slower than that of the other strains.

Therefore, the results indicated that the growth of the strains was slow and that the strains could not grow at low temperature and medium temperature. The results also indicated that the strains could not grow at low temperature and medium temperature. The strains were unable to grow at high temperature and medium temperature.

The results indicated that the strains were able to grow in the presence of acetone and methanol. The results also showed that the strains could not grow in the presence of HCl, acetone and methanol. The results also indicated that the strains could not grow in the presence of acetone and methanol.
