## Abstract
It has long been appreciated that the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei has a great potential for biotechnology applications. The complete genome of a previously sequenced Trichoderma reesei strain has been revealed in a previous study [1]. Using this genome, we reesei is now a member of the T. reesei/Sakai subgenome cluster and its genome can be divided into two clusters, each containing approximately 30% less than the whole genome. Compared to other phylogenomic analyses, we have found that the T. reesei/Sakai subgenome cluster contains a greater number of genes that are differentially regulated, and these differentially regulate important traits of Trichoderma. This results in a skewed view of Trichoderma evolutionary history, and presents a skewed view of the genome content that is related to the genetic basis of cellulose breakdown and ubiquitination processes. The new genome provides us with insights into the genome organization, genome content, and genes that are differentially regulated in T. reesei and other model filamentous fungi, offering new insights into the genetic basis of cellulose breakdown and plant cell wall remodeling processes.

The new genome and comparative genomic analysis provide us with new insights into the genome structure and gene expression of T. reesei and other filamentous fungi.

## Introduction
Fungal pathogens have developed new strategies for survival in the host and to escape from the host immune responses. This includes the secretion of virulence factors into the extracellular space [1], [2], [3]. On the other hand, there has been an increased use of host cells for the colonization of fungi [4], [5]. The role of host cells in fungal virulence has been well-described. However, there has been a decrease in the number of these cells and their associated proteins in the fungal cell membrane. Thus, fungi have evolved multiple strategies for evasion from the host immune response [6], [7]. The host immune response is an important factor that affects the establishment and maintenance of this barrier between the host and pathogen.

Although the host immune response can act as a gatekeeper for many virulence factors [8], the mechanisms by which fungi escape the host immune response are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms by which fungi evade the host immune response are not fully understood.

In fungi, there are four main cell types that are specialized for interaction with the fungus. Within the basidiomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, there are two types of cell type. Type I host cells secrete proteins that are recognized by the intracellular pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans and are recognized by a type II cell, which is secreted by the host cells. Type II host cells secrete protein secretion by the fungus in order to evade the host immune response [9]. Type I host cells secrete secretion factors that are important for the survival of the fungus in the environment and its survival inside macrophages.


## Methods
emenii, and . coli, we identified all of the examined proteins, which were confirmed by protein sequences. Further, the PFAM format of the predicted proteins was prepared and the average molecular weights were calculated. The absence of a single PAM motif was verified by using the motif-based BLAST algorithm [43]. Using these two databases, we found the genes with a probability of having a PAM domain in at least one of the cases.

## Results
The largest protein-protein interaction domain of phosphorylated proteins in the HOG pathway was defined as the C-terminal domain (Fig 2C. The majority of phosphorylated proteins contained both an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal C-terminal domain (Fig 2D). The C-terminal C-terminal domain is found in phosphorylated proteins with homology to chaperones. The C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins has been described previously as the G-protein domain of phosphorylated proteins [31]. We compared the C-terminal C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins with the C-terminal C-terminal domain of homologous proteins. As shown in Fig 2E, phosphorylated proteins were phosphorylated to some extent. In addition, phosphorylated proteins were phosphorylated to the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins. The C-terminal C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins contains the conserved C-terminal domain and the C-terminal C-terminal domain of homologous proteins (Fig 2E). In our analysis, the C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins was similar to that of homologous proteins (Fig 2E). To analyze the protein phosphorylation profiles, phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by an anti-phospho-phospho Bafilomycin B. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with anti-PKA antibody. The results indicated that the C-terminal C-terminal domain of phosphorylated proteins is similar to that of homologous proteins (Fig 2F).

A. fumigatus Tc1a is a key enzyme for degradation of P. aeruginosa and degradation of P. aeruginosa carbon [32]. The activity of Tc1a in P. aeruginosa has been shown to be more than 10-fold higher than that of P. aeruginosa a-PKA [33]. Therefore, we investigated whether Tc1a is a key enzyme in P. aeruginosa degradation. To assess the activity of Tc1a, we generated the Tc1a mutant.


## Discussion
We found that the proportion of phosphorylated proteins was at least in part controlled by the phosphorylation status of the upstream facto. The proportion of phosphorylated proteins that were regulated by upstream factors (P) varied from 30% (BALG_00760) to 50% (P) in yeast and human respectively (Table S3). This proportion varied depending on the phosphorylation status of the downstream factor P (BALG_00480) and the upstream factor C (BALG_01650) (Figure 1, 2, 3). In yeast, approximately 50% of phosphorylated proteins were regulated by the upstream factor P and approximately 40% by the upstream factor C (Figure 1, 2, 3). These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of the downstream factor P and the upstream factor C influence the proportion of phosphorylated proteins that were regulated by the phosphorylation status of the downstream factor P. The same pattern was observed in the microarray experiments where there was a higher proportion of phosphorylated proteins regulated by upstream factors P and C (Figure 1, 2, 3). This pattern is consistent with previous studies where the proportion of phosphorylated proteins regulated by the upstream factor P and the downstream factor C varied between 70% and 100%.

Protein-protein interactions
The fact that the phosphorylated proteins in the microarray experiments were induced by the upstream factor P and the downstream factor C means that the phosphorylation status of the downstream factor P and the upstream factor C were important for the transcriptional regulation of the gene expression of the genes (Figure 3). This is in agreement with the previously published microarray experiments (Table S3).

The phosphorylation status of the upstream factor P and the downstream factor C did not influence the transcriptional response of the genes (Figure 3).

Protein-protein interactions
The phosphorylation status of the upstream factor P and the downstream factor C did not affect the transcriptional response of the genes (Figure 3).
