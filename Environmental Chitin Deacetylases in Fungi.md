## Abstract
Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that causes severe and often fatal infections in susceptible patients. The ability of the fungus to thrive within multiple niches in mammalian hosts and to establish a persistent infection in a single host is a key feature that facilitates its intracellular persistence is referred to as the biofilm structure. Biofilms are structures that allow the fungus to live in and survive inside cells, and studies with C. albicans have revealed that the biofilm structure is essential for its survival within this host environment. A recent report suggested that the fungal pathogen may have developed a new biofilm strategy to cope with the increasing human burden of the disease, by infecting new hosts. Here we report the first genomic characterization of a C. albicans microbe, and we review the existing genome sequences of clinically important fungal species, as well as the sequence of the genetic material that lies contiguous to these species. We also discuss the importance of the C. albicans microbe, as well as the differences between C. albicans and other medically important fungal species, in understanding the evolution of the human pathogen.


## Introduction
2016. The Fungi and their symbiotic microbes are considered to be the most important sources of chitin deacetylases in fungi, with chitin and chitosan being the most common compounds found in fungi (O’Brien et al. 2014). The fungi that inhabit the marine environment are responsible for the majority of the fungal chitin deacetylases (Di Domenico et al. 2016). Their symbiotic microbes are found in deep and sub-semi-semi-aquatic niches and are capable of degrading chitin (Di Domenico et al. 2016). The fungi are capable of degrading chitin, chitosan, and chitosan because the enzymes are produced by the symbiotic microbes (Díez-Lozano et al. 2017).

The mechanisms of chitin deacetylases in fungi and their role in degradation of chitin are still unclear. The chitin deacetylase complex is a superfamily of enzymes that have the unique characteristic of being deacetylases at a specific catalytic site in fungi (Di Domenico et al. 2016). Deacetylation of chitin in fungi requires the presence of three enzymes: chitin deacetylases (CDEs), chitin deacetylases (CDEs) and chitin-binding proteins (CHBPs). CDEs and CDEs share similar catalytic site but different sequences and catalytic sites in fungi (Di Domenico et al. 2016). The three enzymes in the chitin deacetylase complex are catalytic enzymes of the Fungi and Mycorrhizal Chitin Deacetylases in Fungi (Di Domenico et al. 2016). Fungi are known for their use of fungi as sources of chitin deacetylases (FungiChi) (O’Brien et al. 2014). Fungi have been used as source of chitin deacetylases and for the degradation of chitin in fungi (Di Domenico et al. 2016).


## Methods
The next day, the cell culture was diluted to an OD_600 of .2 in 0.1 M sucrose and grown for 16 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the pellets were resuspended in PBS to a final OD_600 of 0.2. The pellets were disrupted in a cell disruptor (Sartorius Transduction Reagent, Thermo Scientific) and resuspended in 0.1 M sucrose. Then, 10 µl of the cell suspension was dropped onto an SDC agar plate and the plate was incubated at 30°C for 24 h, after which the plates were washed three times with PBS to remove residual cells.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0.

Sterile water-ice cream commercial detergents (Sakura Finet) were used for the production of detergents, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO_2, unless otherwise stated. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.

For the development of detergents, Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for the production of detergents. The Vectashield system consists of two water bottles, each containing six different detergents. The detergent-production system is similar to a conventional detergent dilution method [17]. The Vectashield method was employed to minimize the amount of detergent present in the water bottle, but with an increase in the amount of detergents.

Chemical Compounds in the Detergent Extraction
All compounds in the detergent extraction were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO was an environmentally friendly method for the extraction of detergents. Dried detergents were immediately dissolved in distilled water and stored in a freezer at -20°C.

The detergents were dissolved in ethanol at a final concentration of 5% (v/v) for the extraction of compounds. The solution of the detergent-extraction was prepared by a method similar to the DMSO method, except that the DMSO was added to the solution at a final concentration of 100% (v/v).


## Results
graminearum [17. In this study, the catA gene (catA-catA) was inserted into the wild-type strain with the overexpression of the FgCatA gene. As shown in Fig 4A, the catA gene was expressed in a strain carrying the catA-catA gene. In contrast, in the <U+0394>catA strain, the catA gene was expressed in a strain carrying the catA-catA gene. In addition, we used the catA-catA strain carrying the catA-catA gene to construct the <U+0394>catA strain. The catA-catA strain was transformed with the empty vector, and the transformed strain transformed with the catA-catA gene (Fig 4B). The <U+0394>catA strain transformed with catA-catA gene exhibited wild-type levels of catalase activity when grown on glucose-containing media (Fig 4C). This strain was also able to grow in the presence of the catA gene. The <U+0394>catA strain was able to produce catalase activity when grown on glucose medium. The catA-catA strain was also able to grow in the presence of the catA gene. These results demonstrated that the catA gene is required for catalase activity in F. graminearum.

Identification of the FgCatA CatA Deletion Genes
To identify the FgCatA CatA genes, we performed a homology search of the FgCatA protein sequence against the F. graminearum genome. The FgCatA protein sequence was obtained by an analysis of the FgCatA protein sequence (FgCatA protein sequence, http://fgpA.jp/fgpA.


## Discussion
cerevisiae and . albicans, and that melanin is required for cell survival and virulence in an infection model. The extensive production of melanin was associated with the extracellular matrix of the fungus. Further, the extracellular matrix was shown to play a role in fungal virulence and pathogenicity, but did not support cell survival and fungal clearance in the lung [24].

We confirmed that C. albicans cells can survive and proliferate in the extracellular fraction of the fungus, but were not able to suppress the filamentous growth in vitro. This finding suggests that cell survival and proliferation requires the release of melanin, and that melanin is required for cell viability and fungal clearance. The fact that C. albicans cells can suppress the growth of filamentous growth in vitro and survive in the extracellular fraction of the fungus suggests that melanin production is a more important virulence trait of C. albicans.

The ability of filamentous fungi to induce the growth of a broad range of bacteria and yeasts is also dependent on melanin biosynthesis [22]. Our results revealed that melanin production was positively regulated in C. albicans by glucose, a substrate that can trigger melanin biosynthesis. In contrast, the ability of yeast to synthesize melanin was negatively regulated by glucose. These results suggest that melanin biosynthesis is regulated in different ways in different yeast species.

To further evaluate the relationship between melanin production and virulence, we studied the ability of C. albicans to induce cell death by killing macrophages in a murine model of cryptococcosis. C. albicans is a fungus that is able to kill host cells by attacking their cell wall and colonizing the macrophage. During the initial stages of the infection, C. albicans cells can establish a low initial phagocytic index (COPI) of approximately 100,000 CFU/mL, which is significantly lower than the initial C. albicans MICs of about 400,000 CFU/mL [30]. During the initial stages of infection, the initial C.
