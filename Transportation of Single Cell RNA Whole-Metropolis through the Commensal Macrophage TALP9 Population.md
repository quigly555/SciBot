## Abstract
Mucoromycotina is the largest genus of the fungal mycobiota. Mucorales are usually found living in infected plants, shrubs, or at least partially submerged in the sea. Some Mucorales have been shown to infect amphibians (e.g., Cross River frog), reptiles (e.g., boar), and mammals (e.g., dog and rabbit), and some have been suggested as obligately acquired lineages. Mucorales can be divided into two broad clades, the latter comprising amphibians and Mucorales. The genus Mucorales has been continuously revised and expanded. In the present revision, three different subgroups are reported: the brown and black genera are defined; the genus Mucorales is emended and sections added; and the former are emended. A new genus, Mucorina is proposed.


## Introduction
The C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family of cytokines is composed of eight members, CCLR1-4, CCLR3-5, and CCLR11-13, with CCLR1-4 and CCLR11-13 being the most abundant in the CNS, followed by CCLR10 and CCLR7, as reviewed in [1]. The CCLR family is comprised of seven members, CCLR1-4, CCLR3-5, CCLR11-13, CCLR10 and CCLR10-11. The CCLR family has important functions in immune responses to various infectious conditions, including autoimmune disorders, and is associated with a variety of immune responses.


## Methods
cerevisiae WT and <U+0394>mnrp9 were cultured in 100 ml of fresh liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) at 28°C for 2 day. After centrifugation (3000×g, 5 min), the supernatant was transferred to new 1 ml screw cap tubes and stored at -20°C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (3000×g, 5 min), washed twice with 1 ml of sterile distilled water and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen. For RNA extraction, cells were lysed in liquid nitrogen and the RNA content was quantified using the RNA Nano 6000 Nano 6000 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from WT and <U+0394>mnrp9 WT cells using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, CA, USA). First-strand cDNA was amplified using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Primer sequences for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S1.

Construction of S. cerevisiae strains
The WT and <U+0394>mnrp9 strains were used for cloning purposes. For the <U+0394>mnrp9-0 and <U+0394>mnrp9-1 strains, a ura3::umrp9-2 gene was amplified using primers omg1 and omg2. The hygromycin resistance marker was amplified using primers omg1 and omg2. The WT and <U+0394>mnrp9-1 strains were used for transformation.

The <U+0394>mnrp9-1 strain was used for cloning purposes. The ura3::umrp9-2 gene was amplified using primers omg1 and omg2. The hygromycin resistance marker was amplified using primers omg1 and omg2. The <U+0394>mnrp9-1 strain was used for transformation.


## Results
We then quantified the mRNA and protein levels of TALP9 and the qRT-PCR results are shown in Fig . When the RNA was used to create RNA-seq libraries, the total mRNA amount was not significantly different between the cells transformed with a vector and those transformed with RNA-seq libraries (Fig 2A). After incubation for 3 h, we found that the total RNA amount was increased by 24% compared to that of the RNA-susceptible cells (Fig 2B). In addition, the total protein amount in the transformed cells was also increased by 20%, as indicated by the overall decrease in the protein content of the RNA-susceptible cells (Fig 2C).

To further confirm the results from RNA-seq, we then quantified the total mRNA and protein levels in the transfected cells. As shown in Fig 3A, there were no significant differences in the mRNA and protein levels between the transfected and the RNA-susceptible cells. However, the protein content was significantly reduced by 14%, which suggests that the transfected cells are less efficient at overcoming the cellular barrier.

Transfection of FLC-Dependent Macrophage Transfections With FLC-Dependent Transfections
In order to identify the cells that are more susceptible to FLC-D-mediated cell death, we generated transfected FLC-D dependent transfections with a vector of RNA or the RNA-susceptible vector. We then analyzed the mRNA and protein levels in the transfected and RNA-susceptible cells. As shown in Fig 4A and B, the mRNA amount in the transfected cells was significantly reduced by 23%, which indicates that the FLC-D dependent transfection is more efficient than the RNA-susceptible cells. In addition, the protein content was significantly reduced by 37% in the transfected cells and this reduction was also reflected in the protein content of the transfected cells (Fig 4C). We also observed that the transfected cells were more efficient in overcoming the cellular barrier than the RNA-susceptible cells.

We further tested the effect of FLC-D-dependent Transfection on the level of IL-1ß.


## Discussion
oryzae MpSY1^T cells (Figure 3) to examine the effects of RNA-RNA hybridization on MpSY1^T transcriptio. RNA-RNA hybridization was performed by the use of the MpSY1^T RNA-DNA fusion library. The MpSY1^T cells were grown for 15 minutes in the presence of iron-depleted medium. The cells were then transferred into the M. oryzae MpSY1^T cells and subsequently transferred into the MpSY1^T cells carrying the cell-specific RNA-RNA hybridization library. The MpSY1^T cells were then transferred into the M. oryzae MpSY1^T cells expressing the RNA-RNA hybridization library.

Previous studies demonstrated that MpSY1^T cells expressed RNA-RNA hybridization in an iron-depleted medium [27], [29], [30]. This study showed that RNA-RNA hybridization induced MpSY1^T cells to express the MpSY1^T gene. RNA-RNA hybridization induced MpSY1^T cells to express the MpSY1^T gene, and to express the MpSY1^T gene. The expression of MpSY1^T was induced by the iron-depleted medium. The results demonstrated that the RNA-RNA hybridization was induced by the expression of the MpSY1^T gene and the MpSY1^T gene, and by the expression of the MpSY1^T gene and the MpSY1^T gene, respectively. The MpSY1^T gene expression was induced by the expression of the MpSY1^T gene, and by the expression of the MpSY1^T gene. The MpSY1^T gene was expressed in the MpSY1^T cells. The MpSY1^T gene was expressed in the MpSY1^T cells. However, the MpSY1^T gene was expressed in the MpSY1^T cells. MpSY1^T was expressed in the MpSY1^T cells.
