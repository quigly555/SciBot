## Abstract
The comparison of the microg concentrations of trace element in soil and adjacent air was carried ou.

The prevalence of fungal species in the soil was 3.3% (95%CI: 2.3-5.6%) in comparison with the non- soil soil soil environment of 1.3% (95%CI: 0.9-2.3%) and 1.2% (95%CI: 0.8-2.7%). The abundances of several fungal taxa were higher than in the non- soil soil soil environment (P < 0.01). The prevalence of Aspergillus (14.8%), Cladosporium (12.1%), and Fusarium (7.4%), were more common in the soil environment than in the non- soil environment (P < 0.01). The species richness of soil fungi were higher than the soil environment of Fusarium and Aspergillus (P < 0.01). The yeast and ascomycete richness were higher in the soil environment of Cladosporium than in the non- soil environment (P < 0.01).

The abundance of fungal taxa in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium. This could explain the higher prevalence of Aspergillus and Cladosporium in the soil environment than that of Fusarium (P < 0.01).

The prevalence of different fungal taxa in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium. This could explain the higher prevalence of Aspergillus and Cladosporium in the soil environment than that of Fusarium (P < 0.01).

The abundance of Mycosphaerella in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium (P < 0.01).

The prevalence of various fungal taxa in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium (P < 0.01).

The abundance of Mycosphaerella in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium (P < 0.01).

The prevalence of different fungal taxa in the soil environment of Fusarium was higher than that of the soil environment of Fusarium (P < 0.


## Introduction
Candida glabrata is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is typically found in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, urinary tract, and pulmonary tract (Boh et al., 2016). It has been implicated as a causative agent of infections in humans (Sánchez-Mó et al., 2015) and in the lower respiratory tract (Eggnover et al., 2017), particularly in patients undergoing respiratory or other systemic therapy (Márquez-Aguilar et al., 2017). However, in contrast to other yeast- and mould-like fungi, C. glabrata can cause superficial infections, in which it can disseminate to virtually any anatomical site and can be lethal (Eggnover et al., 2017). On the other hand, C.


## Methods
One was a pure soil sample (CDW) and the other was a non-sulfur sample (NSS) which was also a soil sampl. The samples were stored in sterile, air-tight boxes.

After sampling the soil sample, we placed the samples in a 2.0 ml screw-cap tube and sealed with a laminarose filter. The tube was then transported to the laboratory in the Research Station of the University of Kaohsiung in Korea. The samples were stored in an air-tight container at 4 °C. All samples were sent to the laboratory for further investigation.

In the laboratory, we used the method described by Bahara et al. [18]. Briefly, the soil was divided into two subsamples (CDW and NSS) and a microgram of each sample was transferred to a screw-cap tube. The samples were then transferred to a dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 min. Subsequently, we applied a sterile water to the sample and extracted the extract by using a rotavapor. The mixture was then subjected to vacuum extraction with hexane and ethyl acetate. The extracts were then extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethyl acetate and subsequently dried with a rotavapor. After vacuum extraction, the dried extracts were finally suspended in 70% ethanol and were stored in the dark at 4 °C.

Subsequently, we transferred the dried extracts to a clean tube for further analysis. We then extracted the material with chloroform:methanol (3:1 v/v). The tubes were centrifuged for 5 min and the organic layer was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again. The organic layer was again transferred to a new tube. We extracted the material with dichloromethane:chloroform (3:1 v/v) for another 5 min. Finally, the organic layer was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again. The upper layer was transferred to a new tube and transferred to a new, fresh tube. The mixture was then subjected to vacuum extraction with hexane and ethyl acetate. The tubes were then centrifuged for 5 min and the material was finally transferred to a new tube. The organic layer was then transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again. The lower layer was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again.


## Results
In total, 12,973 sequences were identified and a total of 6,073 sequences were detected with a calculated sequencing depth of 1,034 nucleotide. Sequences were classified into 14 functional categories based on GC-based classification (Figure 6). Functional categories included “metabolism” (64.0%), “transport of wastes” (19.5%), “defense from diseases” (5.7%), “nitrogen and nitrogen source” (8.2%), “defense from heat and cold” (4.6%), “metabolism” (9.0%), “organism, transport, and absorption” (4.1%), and “signaling, localization, signaling, and signaling function” (4.9%). From these, 27 species were identified by genome-wide sequencing and quantification of sequence reads. Eighteen species were identified by the combined analysis of sequence reads and individual microg rRNA-seq reads (Table 3). For all species, a total of 3,724,036 unique sequences were identified, of which 2,417,411 were unique to the M17/EU30 hybrid system and 5,901,049 unique to the 5-gLP-extraction system. Among species with the highest sequence similarity (>70%) to other sequenced species (Table 3), four species with the highest sequence similarity (>70%) to other sequenced species were included in the analysis (Table 3).

Identification of relevant species
Of the 61 species that shared more than 2% sequence similarity to other sequenced species, 16 were previously described as belonging to the phylum Ascomycota (Table 1) (Figure 1). Among these species, 19 species were previously described as belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota (Table 1), including three new species, Candida glabrata (G.phaeriaeae) from the Mycosphaerellaceae family and Candida spp.


## Discussion
We investigated the extent of microgammiellosis in different species of tree. We found that microgammiellosis was prevalent among European tree species in different habitats. The most frequent tree species were Figiopsis periaceum, Neocallimastix minima and Poaceae orientalis, and among the Poaceae in the Netherlands (Figure 4). However, the number of microgammies were rare in Poaceae in the Netherlands and it was also rare in other European countries. This is in line with the findings of other studies, where microgammies were found in other European countries [41], [42].

The distribution of microgammies in Europe is mainly determined by the level of genetic diversity in the trees and their relative abundances [43]. A population genetics study of the European Poaceae in 2011 (Hondens et al. 2011) found that the microgammies and the clone libraries belonged to different clades and there was a high degree of genetic diversity within the Poaceae in each country. However, the population genetics study only included taxa from the Poaceae in a European country and not in another. This could be due to the difference in the geographical distribution of the Poaceae in different countries. This could also be due to differences in the genetic makeup of the species.

The frequency of microgammies was higher in Poaceae than in other European Poaceae species. Poaceae species were firstly recorded from tropical and temperate regions in the past [6], [7], [8]. They were also present in several African Poaceae species, including Poaceae spp. and Poaceae orientalis, but they were not the most frequent Poaceae species in Europe [7]. The genetic diversity of the Poaceae in Europe is higher than in other countries, such as the Netherlands and France [6], [7], [8]. This could be due to the lower genetic diversity of the species in Europe compared to other countries, such as the Netherlands and France [6]. Poaceae spp. are also present in many African Poaceae species [6], [7].
