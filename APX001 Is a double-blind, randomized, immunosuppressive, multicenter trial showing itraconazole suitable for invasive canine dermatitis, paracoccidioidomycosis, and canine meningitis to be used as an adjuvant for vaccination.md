## Abstract
To study the roles played by fungal communities in soils, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize the composition of the fungal communities associated with leaves and stems of two azotyrosine plants grown in the native forests of Kusumya, a small forest region of Central India.


## Introduction
Protein phospholipase C (Plc) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the reversible addition of phospholipids to proteins by converting the N-acyl carrier protein PLC to PLB. The catalytic triad is a conserved family of cysteine residues present in many eukaryotic proteins, including the phospholipase C 1 (PL1) family, phospholipase C 2 (PL2) family, and the phospholipase C 3 (PL3) family. PL3s are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and are among the most important enzymes in the synthesis and trafficking of proteins [1-3]. PLB proteins are the members of the phospholipase C family, and they form a core family of phospholipases that catalyze the reversible addition of phospholipids to proteins by the active site [4, 5]. In contrast to PL1, PLB proteins are among the most abundant eukaryotic phospholipases in the cell [6].

The PLB family consists of a total of approximately 100 different phospholipases, of which PLB1 is the most abundant [7, 8]. PLB1 is the most abundant phospholipase in animals and plants, and is responsible for a broad range of cellular activities, including nitrogen metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism [8]. In contrast to mammals, however, the majority of plants and animals synthesize phospholipids from proteins rather than PLB1 [9-11].


## Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branc. All animals were handled according to the guidelines and laws of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Texas Health Science University-Houston (HSSP-Houston). All animal studies were conducted in compliance with the United States Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 98-198) and the Texas Tech University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

All animal studies were approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and all animals were handled in accordance with guidelines and laws that have been described previously [14]. The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and laws of the Texas Tech University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and all animal studies were conducted in compliance with the United States Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 98-198). The Texas Tech University IACUC approved the animal studies.

Bacterial culture and bacterial growth
Infection was performed as previously described [14], with the following modifications: (i) the following groups of animals were inoculated with: A. baumannii (a group with normal bacterial load, without any bacterial pathogen); (ii) A. fumigatus (a group with normal bacterial load, without any pathogen); (iii) A. fumigatus (a group with normal bacterial load, without any pathogen); (iv) A. fumigatus (a group with normal bacterial load, without any pathogen); (v) A.


## Results
The study was initiated in 2011 in a member of the National Committee on Systematic Immunology (NSCI) [25. The study results indicate that the dosage of DHC-2 in the vaccine is better than the recommended schedule for azole therapy. The results also suggest that the DHC-2 formulation may be more effective in the treatment of disease caused by candidiasis than that caused by mycetoma caused by candidiasis [26]. The DHC-2 formulation was evaluated in a cohort of 659 neonates at the time of the study and in a double blind, randomized, immunosuppressive, multicenter study in a routine veterinary clinic in the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands. The doses of DHC-2 in the vaccine were in the range of 1.50-7.50 mg/kg/day for candidiasis and 8.50-18.50 mg/kg/day for mycetoma [27]. The DHC-2 formulation was effective in a cohort of 692 neonates in a routine veterinary clinic in the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands [28]. The study results suggest that the dose of DHC-2 in the vaccine is superior than the recommended schedule for azole therapy in the presence of a second diphtheria toxin [29]. The results also suggest that the DHC-2 formulation may be more effective in the treatment of candidiasis than that caused by mycetoma caused by candidiasis [30].

From the findings, the efficacy of the DHC-2 formulation was evaluated in a panel of 38 patients with multiple sclerosis with a median follow-up of 13.5 years and a median duration of 36.5 years (Table 1). The efficacy of the DHC-2 formulation was assessed in a panel of 43 patients with multiple sclerosis with a median follow-up of 11.8 years and a median duration of 39.5 years (Table 1). The DHC-2 formulation was effective in a cohort of 664 patients with multiple sclerosis with a median follow-up of 20.8 years and a median duration of 36.5 years (Table 1). The efficacy of the DHC-2 formulation was evaluated in a panel of 17 patients with multiple sclerosis with a median follow-up of 16.5 years and a median duration of 42.5 years (Table 1).


## Discussion
The results presented here show that C. albicans is highly virulent in a murine infection model, as previously reported [4, 15]. The high virulence of C. albicans in mice and C. neoformans in humans is in stark contrast to the virulence reported in the yeast form of C. neoformans [25, 26]. We have shown that in vitro virulence of C. albicans varies in the different mouse strains, from being the dominant yeast form in one mouse strain to being the dominant yeast form in a different mouse strain [2, 25, 27]. The discrepancy in virulence of C. albicans is likely due to differences in the murine host, the medium, and the infection route. The degree of host immune response to C. albicans is dependent on the different strains of the same strain. Furthermore, a limited amount of available CD4+ T cell response is required to activate C. albicans and C. neoformans in vivo, and these cells are impaired in their ability to clear the infection [2, 25]. In addition, studies have shown that different fungal species and strains can cause differences in the immune response to the same strain of the same species [28, 29].

Previous studies in mice have shown that C. albicans is a very virulent pathogen in mice and that the lung is one of the most important sites of infection [6, 28, 30, 31]. A number of studies have also shown that C. albicans is a virulent fungus in mice [3, 4, 28, 32]. Our results show that C. albicans is a very virulent pathogen in mice and that it is a virulent fungus in humans. Similar results were also reported in the yeast form of C. neoformans [25, 27].
