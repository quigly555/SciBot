## Abstract
Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of invasive fungal disease (IFD) even when their immunosuppressive medications are not effective. IFD, especially IFD-like anemia (ILD), is seen in up to 50% of patients with cryptococcosis. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of IFD-like anemia in a cohort of HIV-infected and immunocompromised patients in order to determine the optimal management of this condition.

A randomised, double-blinded, international, open-label, multi-center, international, observational cohort of HIV-infected and immunocompetent patients from July 2016 to September 2017, in Lhasa, Egypt, using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods. Clinical data, as well as serum samples, were collected at the end of the study. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment, and the patient was followed-up until June 2018, when the final results of the patient were recorded.

The 95 patients included in this study were divided into 2 arms; IFD-like anemia (ICD) and HIV-like anemia (HIV-like anemia). The ICD group was characterized by a high incidences of cryptococcal infection, and the HIV-like anemia was characterized by the high number of cryptococcal infections among patients with HIV-like anemia.


## Introduction
The organism is often left behind by the microbiota as they grow and survive in the environment. This is evident when the microbiota is exposed to human diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease caused by polymorphonuclear leukocytosis (PML). SLE is characterized by low-density and diverse tissue tropism of the bone marrow. The infection can be asymptomatic or progressive or progressive and can be associated with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes. SLE can also be triggered by other immunosuppressive agents, such as hepatitis B and C, and is associated with immunosuppressive drug use that can be triggered by the presence of microbial components, including exopolysaccharides (EPS) and immunoglobulins (IgGs) [1].

In the case of SLE, a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the development of the disease. The causative microbes can be found in the environment, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea [2], [3]. In these cases, the pathogen is able to survive in the host and disseminate to the brain and spinal cord [4]. In addition, it can be observed in the environment, such as in soil, which could be a possible source of the disease [5]. The lungs are the most vulnerable site of infection, with high concentrations of bacteria and fungi in the air and other parts of the body [6], [7].

In this study, we investigated the role of PSs in the development of SLE, and the role of PSs in the pathogenesis. We investigated the role of PSs in the development of SLE by using the whole-lung model of SLE. The model is a fungal infection model, and the findings were compared with that of human disease and animals.


## Methods
The five most abundant secondary metabolites, from which we identified other fungi, were used as the main metabolites in this stud.

To evaluate the effect of the inhibitors of the two main metabolic processes on the fungi, as well as the fungi in the genus Ascomycetes, we used the cell wall (C-terminal cysteine) as a marker of their structural stability in a cell wall of 10 mg/ml. The inhibitor FK506 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as the negative control. The cell wall was stained with Hoechst 33258, a chitin-binding antimycorticosterol (C-TAP; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for the presence of chitin. The chitin-binding ability of the fungi was analyzed by the accumulation of the band of the inhibitor on the inhibition zone of the cell wall.

4.4. Polymorphic Activity of the GFP and GFP-FITC
The affinity of the polymorphic species of the fungi with the GFP and the GFP-FITC was investigated by an in vitro method. The GFP-FITC (Peprotech, USA) was used as an inhibitor, and the GFP-FITC was used as a control. The isolated compounds were dissolved in DMSO (4%) and added to the cell wall. The agar-insoluble fraction was washed with water, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then the samples were washed again with water. The dried cell wall fraction was dissolved in DMSO (4%) and added to the cell wall. The DMSO solution was mixed with a solution of the compounds, and then the absorbance was measured at 540 nm, using a spectrophotometer (Spectramax, USA). The affinity of the GFP-FITC and the GFP-FITC was analyzed by an in vitro method. The isolated compounds were dissolved in DMSO (4%) and added to the cell wall.


## Results
In contrast to the known enzymes, most of the enzymes have a low affinity for organic solvents, indicating that they are not active, and their enzymatic activity is lo.

One of the main differences in the composition of the fungal biomasses is the hydrolysis of the organic solvent. The amino acid residues in the amino acid residues in the spacer region of some enzymes are substituted by an alternative residue, and the amino acid residues in the amino acid residues in the amino acid residues in the solvents are replaced by a new residue. These residues are replaced by a new monomeric acid residue, which is located in the same position as the RCA site, and subsequently the other residue is substituted with an aromatic amino acid, and then the other amino acid residue is replaced by a new monomeric acid residue. The ammonia backbone is replaced by the additional residue from the solvent, and finally the solvent is evaporated into the water molecule. It is interesting that some fungal enzymes are still able to hydrolyze organic solvent, but that the enzyme activity is much lower than in the other fungi. The activity of some fungal enzymes may be related to the presence of the amino acid residues in the amino acid residues in the solvents, which are not present in the other fungal enzymes. However, the activity of some fungal enzymes may be related to the presence of the amino acid residues in the solvents, which are not present in the other fungal enzymes.

2.3. Biotrophic Activity of Antibiotic-resistant Microorganism
Efficacy of several antibiotic resistant microorganisms isolated from natural sources and clinical samples, including M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, S. sclerotiorum, B. cereus, C. neoformans, and P. aeruginosa, was evaluated using a drug resistance assay. Antibiotics were prepared in aqueous broth, adjusted to pH 5.0, and left to dry overnight. The bacterial activity was compared with that of the fungi by using an inverse microdilution assay. The activity of the M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa was evaluated in aqueous broth and left to dry overnight. The bacterial activity was evaluated using the assay described in the Materials and Methods. The bacterial activity was evaluated in aqueous broth, and left to dry overnight. The activity of the M. tuberculosis, S.


## Discussion
 2017. The aforementioned studies demonstrate the importance of studying fungal communities in natural environments, as the study of the genus, Aspergillus, provides valuable information about the chemical and biological activities of this phytopathogen.

Evaluation of the diversity of the genus Aspergillus in the total phytopathogen community
All the phytopathogenic fungi from the above studied study were identified based on the sequences of the ITS1 and RPB2 regions, and the phylogram corresponding to their phylogenetic relationships, e.g., BLASTp (Table 2). However, a clear discrepancy was observed between the sequences of the ITS1 and RPB2 regions of Aspergillus species. The ITS1 region was the most abundant in the phytopathogenic fungi, with the highest number of sequences of the phylogram. This observation was supported by the fact that the ITS1 region of Aspergillus species was the second most abundant phylogram. The phylogram showed the occurrence of few sequences of the phylogram in the phytopathogen community and corresponded to the phylogram corresponding to the ITS2 region of A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus. The phylogram of A. terreus was also high in the phytopathogenic fungi, but it was not the phylogram of the phytopathogenic fungi, as the species were grouped into subgroup 5.

The ITS1 region of A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus was the most abundant phylogram in the phytopathogen community, with the highest number of sequences. This observation was supported by the fact that the ITS1 region of A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus was the most abundant phylogram. This observation was also supported by the fact that the ITS1 region of A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus was the most abundant phylogram. The phylogram corresponding to the ITS1 region of A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus was also high in the phytopathogenic fungi, but it was not the phylogram of the phytopathogenic fungi, as the species were grouped into subgroup 5.
