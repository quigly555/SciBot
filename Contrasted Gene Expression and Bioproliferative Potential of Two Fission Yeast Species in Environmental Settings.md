## Abstract
Molecular phylogenetic analyses of a combined dataset of ITS, LSU and tef1 were conducted to understand the possible distributions and evolutionary relationships of the species. A total of 127 phylogenomic profiles were generated. The majority of the taxa were distributed into different order and suborder depending on their cultivation. The most common taxa were Betapeliaceae, Chlorophyta, Phyla, and Stachymyrmaceae. Betapeliaceae were the most common, followed by Chlorophyta and Stachymyrmaceae. The comparison of our results with related taxa highlighted that these two species represent a clear division among the Taphrinophyta species. The Betapeliaceae possess the largest phylogenomic distribution, being 108 species in this study. Our results confirmed that the phylogenomic distributions of the species are not homogeneous and could not be resolved based on the phylogeny of the Taphrinophyta and Taphrinophyta. The main differences between the species were the presence of “particular” nymphal placements in most of the cases, the differential distribution of Betapeliaceae over the course of the two species, the occurrence of placements in “particular” the placements between the two species, the different distributions of placements and nymphal placements between the two species, and the presence of placements in “particular” the placements between the two species. Furthermore, the distribution of placements and nymphal placements was significantly influenced by their cultivation. Our results indicated that the Betapeliaceae possess a substantial and broad distribution. Although the Betapeliaceae are phylogenomic, they have very different distributions in the Taphrinophyta and Taphrinophyta.


## Introduction
Most attempts to achieve this have been based on the identification of many genes that encode for enzymes that are not required for the zygomycete growth, such as the hypha-specific transporter Ftr1 in yeast and the sucrose-specific transporter Eu1 in mammal. However, although FTR1 is often implicated in zygomycete growth, the mechanisms that regulate its expression and the types of proteins that control its expression and distribution are not well understood. In particular, although FTR1 is induced in response to hypoxic conditions and is thus regulated at the transcriptional level, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control its transcriptional output.

Although FTR1 is not the only mechanism through which zygomycetes adapt to environmental changes, recent evidence suggests that other other transcription factors play important, yet unidentified, roles in environmental stress responses. For example, Ftr1 expression is regulated in response to oxygen tension, temperature, and osmotic stress, and it has been shown to be important in the response to oxidative stress, when the yeast cell wall is damaged or in response to stress by extracellular enzymes such as those from the extracellular signal oxidoreductase (ER) and NADPH oxidase (Sakamoto et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2014; Wibick et al., 2016). In this sense, FTR1 is a good model to study how environmental cues such as osmotic stress affect the expression and regulatory processes of genes involved in oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and the response to osmotic shock (Muller et al., 2007; Kirkpatrick et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2012).

In this work, we show that FTR1 is involved in the response to osmotic stress by regulating both the expression of its promoter regions and its control through the ER and NADPH oxidase genes, as well as other genes involved in osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and osmotic shock. This is the first study to demonstrate that FTR1 is a key regulator of osmo-regulation in zygomycetes. We demonstrate that FTR1 is crucial for the response to osmotic and oxidative stress in a zygomycete-fused heterozygote.


## Methods
graminearu. The mycelium of F. graminearum was harvested from a 2-week-old culture grown at 25°C, and the mycelium was harvested from a 2-week-old culture grown at 25°C, using a plastic pestle. The mycelium was homogenized with a glass homogeniser. The supernatant from each sample was diluted with distilled water and then plated on solid potato dextrose medium (PDA) agar. The selected cultivation model was a commercial commercial laboratory, where the raw material was grown on PDA plates. The agar was then inoculated with a 1.5-ml mycelial plug of each of the F. graminearum cultivars. The plugs were incubated for 3 days at 25°C.

The mycelium of F. graminearum was inoculated into a 10-ml culture bottle with a sterile cotton swab and the contents were mixed gently and the solution was poured on the surface of a PDA agar. The mycelium of F. graminearum was incubated for 3 days at 25°C and the mycelium was inoculated into a 10-ml culture bottle with a sterile cotton swab. The culture was shaken for 15 min at 25°C and the mycelium was collected by filtering the mycelium through sterile cheesecloth. The mycelium was then dried with a rotary evaporator at 40°C. The dried mycelium was stored at -20°C. The mycelium was then ground using a mortar and pestle to a fine powder, and the total powder was dissolved in 1 ml of sterile water. The ground powder was then transferred to a clean PDA plate, and the plates were incubated at 25°C.

After incubation, the mycelium of each cultivar was collected from a 2-week-old culture grown at 25°C. The mycelium of each of the four F. graminearum cultivars was then transferred into a 10-ml culture bottle and the contents were mixed gently and the solution was poured on the surface of a PDA agar. The culture was shaken for 15 min at 25°C and the mycelium was collected by filtering the mycelium through sterile cheesecloth.


## Results
The highest expression levels were observed in the PVs from the four Fission species (Table 2. The highest expression level was observed in the PVs from the wild type strain (Table 2). In contrast, the expression of enzymes involved in endocytosis, biosynthesis of peptides, and amino acid biosynthesis were higher in the PVs from the wild type strain (Table 2).

Identification of Fission Yeast Genes Involved in Endocytosis
The expression levels of genes involved in the endocytosis process were evaluated by RNA-Seq. A total of 715 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between the wild type and Fission yeast strains, including 1128 transcripts with a PVs-specific expression profile and 590 transcripts with a PVs-specific expression profile (Table 3). Of these, 3177 transcripts (17.9%) were located on the PVs in the wild type strain, 807 transcripts (15.1%) were located on the PVs in the Fission yeast species, and 397 transcripts (30.2%) were located on the PVs in the Fission species. The majority of the transcripts located on the PVs in the wild type strain were enriched for proteins involved in endocytosis (Table 3). The analysis of these transcripts revealed that most of them had a low expression level in the PVs from the Fission species (Table 3). Interestingly, PVs from the Fission species contained transcripts associated with the endocytic pathway (Table 3).

In order to determine whether the expression of a particular gene is involved in the endocytic pathway, the transcript abundance of the identified enzymes was also evaluated. The transcript abundance of the identified enzymes was higher in the PVs from the Fission species (Table 3). The expression of the identified enzymes was significantly higher in the PVs from the Fission species than in the Fission species (Table 3). The highest expression level was found in the PVs from the Fission species (Table 3). The transcript abundance of the identified enzymes was significantly higher in the PVs from the Fission species than in the Fission species (Table 3).


## Discussion
spiralis and . atrovirens, the hypothesis of a specific host-pathogen relationship was established. In that sense, the two species were thought to be closely related to each other, but the mutualism of these species was also suggested by the fact that the two species were genetically distinct. In the present study, the genetic potential of these species was investigated in an environmental settings.

In the T. spiralis and T. atrovirens species, the expression of genes encoding secondary metabolite transporters and ABC transporters was generally higher in the T. spiralis species compared to T. atrovirens. The ABC transporter gene cluster involved in the transport of various transporters in plants was mainly composed of genes encoding ABC transporters.
