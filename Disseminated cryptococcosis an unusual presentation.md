## Abstract
Starch is a very abundant and renewable nutrient that has immense medicinal and aromatic applications. Algal growth and carbon source utilization are tightly regulated, and a critical step in algal growth and metabolism is the interconversion of the organic intermediate-oleaginous and oligosaccharide sugars, respectively. In addition to carbon sources, oxygen sources can play an important role in cell growth, differentiation, and development. The control of carbon source utilization, on the other hand, is very complex and can be surprisingly easily observed. The focus of the present study was to analyze the influence of different carbon sources on yeast phenology and virulence potential of the common yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Microsclerotia were collected from the carnivorous fungus Phaffia raimondii and the anatomical and physiological characteristics were evaluated. Growth and virulence of yeast isolates were investigated by employing different growth methods, as well as the comparative transcriptome analysis among growth media. Yeast isolates were more virulent in C. raimondii than S.


## Introduction
The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical features of a novel infection in a highly immunocompromised patient.


## Methods

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments of the NIAID (Protocol number: 08/2018. The work was performed according to the guidelines of the European Community Directive 2010/63/EEC, and the results of the studies were reported to the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of São Paulo.

Animals
Female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of NIAID. Mice were handled according to the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (Protocol number: 08/2018). Mice were housed in sterile cages and fed ad libitum and used in accordance with the principles of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation.

Infection of macrophages
For the phagocytosis assay, the mDCs were detached from the macrophages by adding sterile saline (0.1%) and incubated with RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C for 5 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and plated on FBS-containing media. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After this period, the number of phagocytosed macrophages was determined and scored as the percent phagocytosis, and the number of macrophages was counted using a Neubauer chamber.

Quantitative phagocytosis
Macrophages were treated with DMSO (100 µl) for 24 h. Then, the phagocytosis index (PI) was determined using the following formula:where N(1/4) is the number of macrophages per well of macrophage treated with DMSO, and N(2/4) is the number of macrophages treated with FBS.

Quantitative phagocytosis
The phagocytosis index (PI) was defined as the ratio of the number of phagocytosed macrophages in a macrophage to the number of macrophages in a macrophage without DMSO (P = 0.05).


## Results
M. tuberculosis meningitis leads to marked changes in the biofilm morphology
To gain insight into the differences between M. tuberculosis meningitis and non-M. tuberculosis meningitis, we compared the morphological characteristics of the two groups of susceptible and susceptible bacteria. Microscopic evaluation of the biofilm revealed that M. tuberculosis meningitis led to a marked reduction in the biofilm formation rate (Figure 1).


## Discussion
In HIV-uninfected individuals, the median CD4 count in patients with CD4 counts of <200 cells/µl is .6 (range: 1.3-4.2) [3]. The median CD4 count in patients with CD4 counts of >200 cells/µl is 2.7 (range: 1.4-4.3) [4]. The median CD4 count in patients with CD4 counts of <200 cells/µl is 3.7 (range: 2.3-4.6) [5].

Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common fungal pathogen in patients with CD4 counts of <200 cells/µl. Cryptococcus neoformans is the predominant cause of disseminated disease in HIV-infected individuals, with a mortality rate of 25%-50% [6]. However, the risk of death for patients with Cryptococcus neoformans infection is lower than for those with cryptococcosis [7]. There are a few studies that have linked the risk of death for cryptococcosis to the degree of CD4 counts, and to the presence of multiple CD4 T cell lymphomas and other lymphomas [8-10]. However, these studies did not identify patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl who had disseminated disease, including Cryptococcus neoformans [8]. We speculate that the increased risk of death in patients with CD4 counts of <200 cells/µl who had CD4 counts of >200 cells/µl may be the result of multiple lymphomas. We have previously observed that patients with a CD4 count of >200 cells/µl who had disseminated disease were more likely to have disseminated disease [7].

CD4 T cell lymphomas are more frequent in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl than those with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl [11]. They typically occur in patients with disseminated disease or those with altered mental status [12].
