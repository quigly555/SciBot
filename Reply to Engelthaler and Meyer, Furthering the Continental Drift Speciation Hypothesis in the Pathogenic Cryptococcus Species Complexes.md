## Abstract
It is possible that Cdc11 was acquired from a hybrid (virulence) type C9 with a C9-C10 backgroun. Cdc11 is a small, NAD+-dependent protein with a size range of 296-385 nm. It contains four exons and is conserved with some variant of a two-base tandem repeat structure. To understand the molecular mechanism of the putative virulence type CSCS, we first predict that Cdc11 is required for its growth in a culture condition. We also provide a de novo spacer-binding assay (FB-S) assembly that indicates the presence of Cdc11 in the genome of the virulence type strain. We further demonstrate that Cdc11 was recruited into the Csc5-C7 region of the cell wall of the virulence type when the cell was grown in culture medium supplemented with iron (iron)-fortified SDA (iron-deficient) or in SDA-deficient (sulfur-replete) Fe(III) supplemented Fe2+ (sFe2+) while in other conditions the Cdc11 was not present. To test the virulence hypothesis, we constructed an in vivo toxoplasmic cell growth model in which the virulence model was manipulated to reveal the presence of a previously unknown Cdc11 exon. Deletion of Cdc11 caused a dose-dependent reduction in the size of the fungal cell and caused a leakage of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The data generated here provide evidence that the CSCS was recruited to the Cdc9-C10 region of the cell wall and that the Cdc11 exon could be recruited to the Cdc1-Csc4 complex in the absence of iron. We also establish that Cdc11 was recruited to the Csc1-Csc4 complex in the absence of a tRNA-like transcription factor. Our results suggest that Csc1-Csc4 complex formation was recruited to the Cdc11 exon-rich cell membrane and that the absence of tRNA induced an autophagic defect in the absence of Csc1. The data thus provides evidence for the presence of a cDNA-based exon-rich cell membrane complex and further evidence for a novel intracellular vacuolar membrane system for Cryptococcus.


## Introduction
However, they do suggest that species with more than 50% prevalence should be considered when examining their phylogenetic analyse.

The authors state that, “While species with more than 50% prevalence are often considered common saprobes, they can also be associates of saprobes. […] Common associates of saprobes are likely to be common among several Cryptococcus species.”, but the authors do not provide evidence for this.

The authors state, “In our study, we compared cryptococcal species distribution data from a region with a high prevalence of saprobes and from a region with a low prevalence of saprobes.”, but they fail to mention the fact that the authors estimate the prevalence of these saprobes to be 50-60%. The authors themselves claim, “We expected to find very high prevalence of common saprobes in the region”, but this doesn’t make sense to me.

The authors state, “We used an enrichment model with enrichment selected model that included the total number of genes that were tested and tested only in the presence and in absence of treatment. […] This model had a maximum likelihood of bootstrap support (fraction of the test cases) and was validated by the qPCR experiment.”, but this doesn’t make sense to me.

The authors state, “We have reanalyzed the saprobe enrichment model and reanalyzed the phylogenetic relationships among the isolates to estimate the relationships of the pathogen to its host. […] However, this analysis only considered the effect of the saprobe enrichment model on the observed phylogenetic relationships, which does not include the phylogenetic relationships between the isolates. […] Additional analysis of the saprobe enrichment model reveals that the host-pathogen relationships in this study are at least partially explained by the saprobe enrichment model.”, but this analysis cannot be validated. The authors then state that the model they have just applied should consider several additional aspects, such as the possibility of sample-based control, as well as sample-based control, to ensure that the results they have obtained are representative of the entire study.


## Methods
Using these three criteria, we could estimate the evolutionary history of the major gene families of the . cerevisiae and S. suis species complexes [27]. In order to obtain a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the major gene families, we used the results of the BLAST analysis. In order to identify the most probable species complex based on the sequence of the selected evolutionary system, we used the best-known families of S. cerevisiae and S. suis [28]. In addition, we used the families of S. cerevisiae and S. suis of S. cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. The species complex of S. pombe was estimated using the sequence of the selected evolutionary system and the position of the SSU, and the species complex of S. pombe was estimated using the sequence of the SSU and the position of the ß-tubulin gene. Furthermore, to identify the evolution of the major gene families, we used the best-known families of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae.

Multiple sequence alignment of the SSU, the ß-tubulin and the major gene families
The multiple sequence alignments of the SSU, the ß-tubulin and the major gene families were performed using the program MUSCLE [29]. In order to check the compatibility between the two phylogenetic trees, the phylogenetic analyses were performed using the program MEGA7 [30].

A neighbor-joining analysis was performed using MEGA7. The analysis included the Kimura-2 linkage method. The bootstrap values were determined with 1000 replicates.

Phylogenetic analysis
We followed the evolutionary history of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae using a neighbor-joining tree method. In order to identify the evolutionary history of the major gene families, we used the best-known families of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. In order to identify the evolutionary history of the major gene families, we used the best-known families of S.


## Results
However, our analysis does not support this hypothesi. Our analysis of the spread of this pathogen species (Fig 4) places it in a clade composed of the Cryptococcus neoformans, the S. cerevisiae and the D. melanogaster species complex. This is in line with the expansion of the D. melanogaster species complex and the emergence of the S. cerevisiae species complex in the last two supercontigs. The expansion of the S. cerevisiae species complex in the last supercontig is supported by the highly significant expansion of the D. melanogaster species complex in the last three supercontigs. In addition, the expansion of the S. cerevisiae species complex in the last three supercontigs is supported by the significant expansion of the D. melanogaster species complex in the last three supercontigs (Fig 5).

Our analysis of the spread of the disease agent Cryptococcus neoformans in humans and the human pathogen H99, shows that our results suggest that the spread of Cryptococcus neoformans is caused by a complex of pathogen species. The two most frequently cited “probable origin” of Cryptococcus neoformans are the spread of Cryptococcus neoformans and the spread of H99 (Fig 4). Our analysis of the spread of this pathogen species shows that the most commonly cited “probable origin” of Cryptococcus neoformans is the spread of H99 (Fig 5).

In a multivariate analysis of the time course of cryptococcal virulence in the mouse model, the most frequently cited “probable origin” of Cryptococcus neoformans was the spread of H99 in the course of a 48 h infection with C. neoformans, and the most commonly cited “probable origin” of Cryptococcus neoformans was the spread of H99 in the course of a 48 h infection with C. neoformans.
