## Abstract
The genus Colletotrichum includes a number of important plant pathogens, most of which are currently restricted to Europe. However, a number of other plant pathogens can be associated with the Melanohaleicosphaeriaceae family, including the oomycete tribe Phytophthora (Ptophanohaleaceae) and the phytopathogenic fungus Melanohaleae. In this study, we focused on the type genus (Vipericum or Melanohaleae) of Colletotrichum and determined the phylogenetic relationships among them. A comparison of the sequences of the 26S rDNA and the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit (LSU) regions revealed that all three Phytophthora species belong to V. or Melanohaleae, the type genus is restricted to Melanohaleicosphaeriaceae, and there is substantial divergence among the Melanohaleicosphaeriaceae clades. This is the first study to use a phylogeny of rDNA sequences for the type genus of a relevant fungal genus, and to test the utility of this result in identifying species in the genera of two of the main plant pathogens Melanohaleae species complexes. Our study provides a taxonomic key to the three main plant pathogens of the Melanohalea plant species complexes, and a key factor that determines their placement in the genera of the three species and their species complexes.


## Introduction
The genus Hypocrea was first proposed by Conrad Wibreder in 1880, based on the shape of the flask (Wibreder, 1882). This fungus is found in soil, in water, in organic matter, and in human tissues (Singer, 1884; Singer and Conrad, 1888). It is a small, multilayered, rod-shaped fungus. Ascomata are spherical, and usually globose, and globose, and usually containing two large ascospores (A and B). The ascospores are usually dimorphic, and a single nucleus is usually formed.


## Methods
Ethics Statement
No specific permits were required for the described field studies. The research was carried out in a research approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (approval number A0040/2016). The field studies were conducted in a university-accredited research institute, Mahidol University, Thailand, and are not considered experimental or commercial in any sense.

Sampling
Sampling was performed on a regular basis at Sarma Kaap site, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand (29°39'23.8<U+2033> N, 14°39'20.3<U+2033> E), a sandy loam-dune forest that is in the National Natural Reserve of Thailand (NRTH). Samples were collected in the humid and semi-arid part of the site from November-December 2015. Samples were collected and kept in sterile plastic containers, wrapped in aluminum foil and kept in a temperature-controlled cooler. The soil samples were collected in the semi-arid area (18 °C, ~7 °C) of the NRTH, and the air-dried soil samples (0-5 cm) were collected in the semi-arid (20 °C, ~10 °C) section. Samples were dried in a laminar flow hood and then ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at -20 °C for further processing.

DNA Extraction
The soil samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and the powder was then extracted from the ground powder by using a glass mortar. The extracted DNA samples were stored at -20 °C for further processing.


## Results
To determine if both the PLB1 and PLB2 domains of F. graminearum are involved in the pathogenesis of the fungi, we first examined the role of both the CWI and the RNAi pathways in F. graminearum growth and conidiation.

We first established that the CWI and the RNAi pathways are required for fungal growth in F. graminearum.


## Discussion
cerevisiae (Schoch et a., 2006). We have reported that the Vp509 kinase in C. albicans is involved in hyphal formation in C. neoformans and in virulence in a murine model (Pal et al., 2006). The Vp509 kinase is also involved in the early stages of the fungal virulence in the human fungal pathogens C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii (Pal et al., 2006). Moreover, the C. neoformans Vp509 kinase is involved in biofilm formation in the murine brain (Pal et al., 2006). Our results showed that Vp509 plays a critical role in biofilm formation in C. neoformans. This suggests that Vp509 might play a role in the virulence of C. neoformans.

We also demonstrated that the Vp509 kinase plays a key role in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans. Vp509 kinase was detected in the fungal cell wall, which showed an increased content of Trp, Asn, and Co, which are important cell wall components. Asn is a major sterol intermediate and the main sterol of glucans. Trp and Asn are important for normal cell wall assembly and maintenance of cell membrane integrity (Richards et al., 2000). Trp and Asn are important for cell wall integrity in fungi and also for cell wall formation (Langer et al., 2003). C. albicans Vp509 kinase plays an important role in the cell wall remodeling in this fungus (Rolke et al., 2001). Vp509 was present in the cell wall of C. neoformans and C. gattii and was also found to be involved in cell wall remodeling in C. albicans (Pal et al., 2006). The Vp509 kinase plays an important role in the cell wall remodeling in C. neoformans. The cell wall is the main target of fungi and they are the main target of antifungal drugs (Feng et al., 2002). The cell wall of C. neoformans is the main target of antifungal drugs because it is a structural component of the cell membrane and includes many essential and conserved proteins and is important for cell wall remodeling (González-García et al.
