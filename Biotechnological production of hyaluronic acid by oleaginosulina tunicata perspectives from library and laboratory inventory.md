## Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) malignant syndrome is a significant complication in patients with AIDS and other immunodeficiency conditions. In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors and mortality of CNS patients with AIDS and other immunodeficiency conditions.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery of the University of Padova, over the winter of 2015-2017, using MEDLINE, Research Gate, EMBASE and CINHAL. Patients with HIV/AIDS were included in this study. Patients with CNS lesions had higher CD4+ count (CD4+ cells:CD4+ cells)/mL/1, a higher BMI (BMI), and angiogenesis compared with the general population. In multivariate analysis, logistic regression model adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, angiogenesis, age, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer stage, CD4+ cell count, BMI, and angiogenesis, the HR 0.58 was estimated as a robust linear mixed effect with increasing higher a priori.

Among the 637 patients, 39 had CD4+ cell count (CD4+ cells/mL/1) and 3 had BMI (kg/kg/yr) and lower a prior infection time (P-value). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer stage, and P-value, P-value was 0.49 for HR 0.59 for mortality and P-value 0.33 for HR 0.56 for the hazard ratio of mortality (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74; P-value: 0.038) and P-value: 0.038 for HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73; P-value: 0.038).

Among the 637 patients, 36 (61%) had CD4+ cell counts (CD4+ cells/mL/1). Most patients presented with AIDS and hypothyroidism, and in 18 (34%), 29 (55%) malignant malignant syndromes were suspected.


## Introduction
The anaerobic microbial communities of living organisms represent a large and complex community of communities with a strong role in the production of organic acids, hydrocarbons and pigments. Anaerobic bacteria in the genus Aeromonas are known to produce a wide range of natural products including amides, fatty acids, fatty acids-derived metabolites, glycosides, peptides, and acids [1]. A. benhamiae is a member of the Aeromonas genus that is commonly isolated from aquatic and terrestrial environments. It has been extensively studied in recent years for its high structural diversity, high economic relevance, and robust industrial applications [2]. The genus is widespread in the Mediterranean basin, and it has been isolated from a variety of substrates including aquatic, sea water, brackish water, and wastewater [3]. It is also present in various habitats in soil, sediments, and sediments, as well as water, soil, plants, and marine and freshwater sources [4]. The genus is also known to produce a wide variety of bioactive compounds, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, enzymes, polymers, enzymes, hyaluronidases, and enzymes with bioactivities [5,6].

The genus Aeromonas contains many species that have been reported to be active members of the mycoflora of many marine and freshwater sources [7]. There is a great variety of species with a wide range of applications in the chemical, medical, and industrial fields [8]. These species are known to produce secondary metabolites and are associated with toxic compounds, such as alkenes, ozonads, and many others [9]. Several research groups have investigated the mycoflora of various substrates [10,11]. These compounds are potential new and potential candidates to be used in the future as natural antioxidants and antioxidants [12,13]. The genus also contains a wide range of chemical compounds with a variety of biological activities such as anticoagulant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities [14]. The genus Aeromonas is mainly found in the marine environment. The genus is divided into three groups: Aeromonas alpinum, Aeromonas kratochvilovae, and Aeromonas novophaesiacus [15].


## Methods

(ii) . tropicalis. Plant tissue was collected in September 2009 from the coastal bay of S찾o Paulo state. Plant materials were used for the preparation of the sample of medicinal plant extracts.

(iii) Fungal material was obtained from the waste management facilities in S찾o Paulo state and was used as the basis for extraction of the plant components.

(iv) The extracts were concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 100 째C and the extract content was determined by the method described by the microextraction method [11].

(v) The concentrated extracts were stored in a desiccator at room temperature and the residual extract concentration was adjusted to 0.5 g/L.

(vi) The isolated hyaluronic acid was purified by using an alkaline dialysis method [22]. The fraction obtained was concentrated to 10 g/L.

2.3. Samples and Methods
The samples were tested in terms of the extraction of the phytochemical compounds, which were prepared by adding a methanol of the alkaloid phase of the extract. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 48 h, and the crude extract was used as the standard. The total amount of phytochemical compounds in the phytochemical compounds was calculated using the standard method according to the following formula:

2.4. Extraction of Microorganisms
The samples were subjected to phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) and then subjected to chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v/v) and then subjected to methanol:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v/v) and then subjected to aqueous phase extraction (v/v) with aqueous phases (v/v) was added. The extracts were kept in a desiccator at room temperature for 24 h and then the residual extract concentration was adjusted to 0.5 g/L. The pure phytochemical compounds were maintained at 4 째C.

2.5. Physical Analysis of Phytochemical Compounds
The physical characteristics of the phytochemical compounds were recorded using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 550 nm. The absorption spectra of the compounds were recorded in the range from 60 to 550 nm.

## Results
The primary enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of large molecules (glucose, galactose, sucrose, trehalose, succinate, and ethanol) is the exoglucanase (SOG), which is responsible for the hydrolysis of glucose by a glucose-2-phosphate cycle (GGC) that converts fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) to glucose-1,6-phosphate (G1P. To study the enzymatic activity of Oleaginous yeasts, we compared their ability to hydrolyze glucose, fructose, and sucrose sugars, as well as the ability to hydrolyze glucose-1,6-phosphate (G1P), as well as the ability to hydrolyze the fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) cycle, and the ability to convert these sugars to glucose-1,6-phosphate (G1P).

The ability of Oleaginous yeasts to hydrolyze G1P was determined by using aqueous phase and water to deactivate both G1P and G2P, respectively, and was much lower than that of other yeasts. The ability of the yeast to convert fructose-1,6-biphosphate to glucose-1,6-phosphate was much lower than that of other yeasts (Table 3). The ability to convert fructose-1,6-biphosphate to glucose-1,6-phosphate was also lower than that of other yeasts. The results demonstrated that Oleaginous yeasts produced a significant amount of G1P at the end of the fermentation. In contrast, the ability of other yeasts to hydrolyze glucose-1,6-phosphate was lower than that of other yeasts.

The addition of fructose-1,6-biphosphate to the oleaginous biomass did not affect the enzyme activity of the enzyme activity assay (Table 3).


## Discussion
The oleate component of OLEF was previously reported in other species of OLEF (Table 1), but in contrast to OLEF, oleate was absent in the other specie. Our studies showed that the other essential oil components were generally lower than OLEF. Thus, the oleate component in OLEF was less valuable than that in other species of OLEF.

The present study did not address the performance of OLEF against C. neoformans. In our previous studies, the main inhibitory effect was that of oleate on C. neoformans, but in this study, the major inhibitory effect was that of oleate (Table 1). The oleate is produced as a result of OLEF, which is a catechol fatty acid, and was previously reported as a potential anticryptococcal agent [22]. In this study, the major inhibitory effect was that of oleate on C. neoformans.

The major components of OLEF are oleate, glycerol, and sterols. The main inhibitory effect of OLEF against C. neoformans is that of oleate, which is produced as a result of OLEF. The present study showed that the OLEF of C. neoformans was the main component of the essential oil of C. neoformans.

The OLEF of C. neoformans was a mixture of oleate, glycerol, and sterols. The present study showed that the OLEF of C. neoformans was the main component of the essential oil of C. neoformans.

The OLEF of C. neoformans was a mixture of oleate, glycerol, and sterols. The present study showed that the OLEF of C. neoformans was the main component of the essential oil of C. neoformans.

The OLEF of C. neoformans was a mixture of oleate, glycerol, and sterols. The present study showed that the OLEF of C. neoformans was the main component of the essential oil of C. neoformans.
