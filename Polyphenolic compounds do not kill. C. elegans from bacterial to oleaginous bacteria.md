## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus gattii, which has reached epidemic proportions in the West. In the West, the most common agent is caused by the sibling species Cryptococcus neoformans. However, the epidemiology and clinical features are varied in the Americas by different geographical areas. C. gattii typically infects and eventually kills immunocompetent patients, and it can also infect and eventually infect immunocompromized patients. The clinical features of cryptococcosis vary widely from asymptomatic to fatal, and are characterized by pleocytosis, pleocytosis, and encephalitis. The current options for treatment are limited, and the only available curative is the use of antifungal agents. The purpose of this article is to present the current options for treatment of cryptococcosis and its treatment strategies in the Americas.


## Introduction
Previous studies have shown that the polyphenolic compounds found in . elegans are not toxic to the animals but can cause pathological and pathological gastrointestinal disorders, including gastrointestinal disorders such as colitis, colitis b noncontrastimously, colitis dextrancus and colitis megninii. Moreover, polyphenols can inhibit or activate bacterial growth, and increase susceptibility to host defense mechanisms. Moreover, polyphenols have antimicrobial and antiinflammatory activities [10,11,12,13,14]. In addition, C. elegans also contains melanin, the pigment that is formed by the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds, that may interact with bacterial cells and be harmful to them [15]. In addition, C. elegans has a polyphenolic diet, which is characterized by high antioxidant activity, and also contains two metabolites, phenolic anhydrase (PPH_1 and PPH_2) and phenolic esterase (PEC_1 and PPH_2), which are both found in the polyphenolic group [16,17].

S. cerevisiae is a highly polymorphic fungus [18,19], and there are at least two varieties of S. cerevisiae: S. cerevisiae gen. grubii and S. cerevisiae gen. placenta, which are genetically homogeneous [20,21]. S. cerevisiae is an opportunistic pathogen that causes the human fungal infection meningitis, a disease characterized by desmosome-like inflammation and death [22,23]. The immune response of the host is also influenced by C. elegans, and immune cells can influence the pathogenesis of C. elegans infection. In this context, it is important to understand the biological regulation of host-pathogen interaction. In the past two decades, a number of studies have reported that the host response to C. elegans infection is primarily controlled by the immune system [24,25,26,27,28,29]. The ability of C. elegans to escape the immune system is a major mechanism for its survival in the gastrointestinal tract and persistence in the environment. However, whether the immune response of C. elegans is to survive or not remains unknown.

Besides the host immune response, C.


## Methods
coli and . coli. The bacteria used to determine the susceptibility of C. elegans and E. coli were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. E. coli: from Bacillus subtilis [30] was used to determine the presence of the compound at the final concentrations of 1, 50, 100, 1000, and 1000 µg/mL. The bacteria used to determine the susceptibility of E. coli were cultured in LB broth. E. coli: from Bacillus subtilis [31] was used to determine the presence of the compound at the final concentrations of 1, 50, 100, 1000, and 1000 µg/mL. The bacteria used to determine the susceptibility of E. coli were cultured in LB broth. E. coli: from Bacillus subtilis [32] was used to determine the presence of the compound at the final concentrations of 1, 50, 100, 1000, and 1000 µg/mL. The bacteria used to determine the susceptibility of E. coli were cultured in LB broth.

The inhibition of bacterial growth in presence of the compounds
To determine the inhibition of bacterial growth in presence of the compounds in E. coli, the E. coli strains were cultured in LB broth for 24 h at 37 °C, and then diluted to OD_600 = 0.1 in LB broth with or without the compounds. The experiments were performed using two different methods. The first method involved the reaction of the bacteria with the compounds and then the treatment with the bacteria. The first method was done by the addition of 10% FBS, and the second was done by the addition of 10% BSA. The experiment was performed with three replicates. The total activity of the compounds in the assay was determined by measuring the inhibition of the growth of the bacteria. The activity of the compounds in the assay was calculated by the following equation:

A = (A-A_50)/(A_50-A_100) + (A_50-A_100) + (A_100-A_50) + (A_50-A_100)

All other chemicals and reagents used in the assays were of analytical grade.

## Discussion
Determination of the NHEJ homologs in C. neoformans
In order to obtain a sufficient number of homologs for the GATA factor, the <U+03B3>dGATA transcription factor is encoded in the same region as the GATA factor ortholog in C. neoformans. The <U+03B3>dGATA transcription factor is able to directly interact with the expression of the <U+03B3>dGATA gene, allowing the expression of the gene by the host. The <U+03B3>dGATA transcription factor was first identified in C. neoformans, where it is required for the synthesis of a set of 10 GATA factor homologs in the genome [40]. In the current study, we have characterized the transcription factor of the <U+03B3>dGATA gene in C. neoformans, and the two most significant GATA factor homologs are GATA1 and GATA2. Our results suggest that the <U+03B3>dGATA gene is expressed in the same manner as in C. neoformans, which is consistent with the observation that <U+03B3>dGATA is expressed in the same way as in C. albicans. In addition, we have reported that the GATA1 homolog is expressed in the same manner as in C. neoformans, but it is expressed differently in C. albicans and C. glabrata.
