## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. An unusual case in point is the case of a patient with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis who presented to the laboratory with an apparent ophthalmoplegic oismic (OP) oismolysis, and was found to have multiple sclerosis.

The case report describes a 45-year old gentleman with AIDS presenting with the ophthalmoplegic oismic (OP) oismolysis.

After a period of investigation for several months, the patient was confirmed as having multiple sclerosis. The patient was treated with a combination of voriconazole and lopinavir/sulbactamides. The patient's OI and subsequent OI with voriconazole were stopped and his OI refractory.

A follow-up OI was performed in the interim between voriconazole and lopinavir/sulbactamides.

A diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made after a positive India ink staining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for Cryptococcus spp. India ink staining was negative.


## Introduction
The human body is inhabited by diverse microorganisms and fungi. In fact, there are approximately two-thirds of the human population that are able to infect and cause infection. The main opportunistic fungi are Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis (1, 2). However, the most frequently occurring fungi are members of the genus Histoplasma, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus (3, 4). The most prevalent of the Histoplasma species is responsible for a variety of infections. C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis are responsible for most superficial and invasive infections (5, 6).

The first described species of C. albicans was described in 1948 (7). The species was later divided into five major subspecies: C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C.


## Methods
pedrosoi strain ATCC 6258 was use. The cells were incubated with F. pedrosoi cell monolayer for 3 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. Then, the monolayer was fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, then washed with PBS. The monolayer was stained with 5% uranyl acetate for 15 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS to remove unbound cells. The fixed cells were stained with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (eBioscience, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) as described in [27]. The cells were then observed with an A-E fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Caspase-1 expression and purification
Caspase-1 expression was measured by flow cytometry using a BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested, centrifuged, washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS at the concentration of 5×10^6 cells/ml. The cell suspension was incubated for 45 min at 4°C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 45 min at 4°C in the presence of 10% normal goat serum in the presence of an equal volume of 20 µM PBS. The cell suspension was then incubated with 1% non-essential amino acids in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. The percentage of cell death was calculated by comparing the total number of cells with and without F. pedrosoi cells.

Cytotoxicity assay
Caspase-1 activity was measured using the ELISA kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated with F. pedrosoi cell monolayer for 3 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. Then, the monolayer was washed with PBS and incubated with the assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2.


## Results
histolytica-induced model of systemic A. This model is also a promising alternative to the traditional model of AD due to the lower incidence of stroke and the fast progression of the disease. Here we used the E. histolytica-induced model to investigate the role of T-cell determinants in mediating T cell activation in the brain.

The E. histolytica-induced model of AD requires efficient T-cell depletion to achieve efficient T-cell depletion in the brain (Figure 6). Using the WBC-injected mice, we depleted these cells by employing a dose of 10^7 cells/mouse and then depleted the cells by using an intravenous injection of 10^5 cells/mouse per mice. This resulted in a 6.7-fold reduction in brain WBC levels, whereas the brain T-cell depletion resulted in a reduction in brain T-cell counts of 1.6-2.1-fold (Figure 6A). To determine whether depletion of the brain T-cell population requires T cells, we depleted brain T-cell populations by employing a dose of 20^3 cells/mouse and then depleted brain T-cell populations by using an intravenous injection of 20^3 cells/mouse per mouse. This resulted in a 1.5-fold reduction in brain T-cell counts in the brain, whereas the brain T-cell depletion resulted in a reduction in brain T-cell counts of 2.1-2.1-fold (Figure 6B). These results demonstrate that depletion of brain T-cell populations requires efficient T-cell depletion.

This resulted in a 1.6-fold reduction in brain T-cell counts, whereas the brain T-cell depletion resulted in a 1.9-fold reduction in brain T-cell counts of 1.5-2.1-fold (Figure 6C). These results demonstrate that the depletion of the brain T-cell population requires efficient T-cell depletion.


## Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the K-bonds of CgCnCnCnCn and the CnCn complex are conserved in eukaryotes, with respect to their function and the mechanisms involved in their differentiation. These results are consistent with previous results which showed that in the human pathogenic fungus, the M. oryzae complex was evolutionarily conserved with the MSC1-like CnCn complex, which is essential for the differentiation and maintenance of the fungal cell and is necessary for the survival in hostile conditions [8]. A recent study of the Fusarium graminearum complex showed that the CnCn complex has evolved multiple genes involved in virulence, including a homologue of the MAPK genes of M. oryzae [23]. In addition, the CnCn complex has been linked to the transcriptional and metabolic activity of CnB, a virulence factor of the plant pathogenic fungus, M.
