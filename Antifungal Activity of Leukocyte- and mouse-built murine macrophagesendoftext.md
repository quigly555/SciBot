## Abstract
The antifungal activity of the essential oils from Thyrograviride, Triterracoinol, and Cymbopogon, were evaluated against Candida species and three Candida species (two clinical isolates, Vero cells and HeLa cells, and one isolate, Haemaphthysporum donovani). Cymbopogon was characterized as the most effective antifungal against these yeasts. T. rabiei showed a significant antifungal activity against all Candida species, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 20 µg/mL. Triterracin showed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of all Candida species and significantly reduced the biofilm formation of Haemaphthysporum sp. and the clinical fungal count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when compared to the control.


## Introduction
Vitamin D is a by-product of metabolism and is important in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1-3]. In these diseases, dietary sources of vitamin D, as well as inadequate amounts of its precursor, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are essential for optimal metabolic activities. In particular, the subacute inhalation of EPA and D-carotene (carotene) accumulate in the lung, resulting in the deposition of these metabolites into the extracellular space, which triggers the inflammatory response [4].

Studies of the effects of vitamin D deficiency on immune cell function have demonstrated that impairment of the activity of innate immunity is the main mechanism of the immunopathology of several IBD. Immune cells, particularly macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are involved in the development of the host response to infection. In this review, we will focus on the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the development of immune cells and their associated factors.


## Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chiang Mai University Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailan. Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. All the clinical investigations and follow-up were conducted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [15] and the Declaration of Helsinki. All the patients were followed up for the duration of their hospital stay.

Definitions
Patients were classified according to the classification in the case of clinical signs and symptoms (including fever, abdominal stinging, altered mental status, confusion, lethargy, and shock) or the presence of a specific syndrome (polyps). For the purpose of the study, the following conditions were defined:

1. Microbial infection, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [16]

2. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow cytometric (FC) count, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [17]

3. Oral infection, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [18]

4. Digestive fluid, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [19]

5. Pulmonary infection, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [20]

6. Kidney infection, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [21]

7. Kidney acid-fast staining (K-AFST) as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [22]

8. Penicilliosis, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [23]

9. Histoplasmosis, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [24]

10. Leukocytosis, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [25]

11. Pulmonary inflammatory infiltrate, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [26]

12. Kidney-associated pneumonia, as defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [27]

## Results
The growth and viability of . dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence and absence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis. As shown in Figure 1, the concentrations of B. dermatitidis and S. pneumoniae in the presence and absence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis were significantly higher than those in the presence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis. The significant difference in the concentrations of Lactate and B. protease in the presence and absence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis was further demonstrated by the significant difference in the concentration of C. albicans in the presence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis. In addition, the significant difference in the concentrations of B. amazonensis in the presence and absence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis was also demonstrated by the significant difference in the concentration of C. albicans in the presence and absence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis.

Bacterial Bacterial Growth, Lactate, and Lactate on B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis
The relative abundance of C. albicans and B. amazonensis was quantified by enumerating the number of CFU. As shown in Figure 2, the relative abundance of C. albicans and B. amazonensis were significantly higher than those of the B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis. The concentration of B. amazonensis in the presence of 10 µl/ml of B. dermatitidis, S. pneumoniae, and L. amazonensis was significantly higher than that in the presence of 10 µl/ml of B.


## Discussion
The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is increasing. Cryptococcosis is most commonly seen in immunocompetent patients, but may also be seen in HIV-infected individuals.
