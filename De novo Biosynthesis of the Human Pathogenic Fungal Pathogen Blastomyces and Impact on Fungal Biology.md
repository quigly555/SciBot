## Introduction
The increasing number of patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, cancer, and several types of tumors, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (MS), is a major cause of the morbidity and mortality of patients with fungal infection.

Recently, the discovery of novel antifungal agents and drugs against fungal infections has attracted great attention. Several classes of antifungals have been approved for clinical use, and in the last decade, new classes of antifungals for use in the treatment of fungal infections have been added to the market. ^3-7

The triazole antifungals flucytosine, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin were approved for prophylaxis against cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients. The echinocandins are antifungals for the treatment of patients with low birth weight and patients receiving organ transplants. There are currently no antifungals approved for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in the clinic. For instance, itraconazole is the first new antifungal to be approved for treatment of invasive aspergillosis; posaconazole is the first new antifungal to be approved for the treatment of PCM; and voriconazole is a second-generation caspofungin approved for treatment of PCM. The caspofungin-fluconazole (VFC) combination therapy has been effective against the clinically relevant species of Candida, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. However, C. glabrata is an emerging pathogen and accounts for an increasing number of infections in HIV-positive patients, accounting for nearly 1.5 million new cases and >600 thousand deaths annually. ^8 As a consequence, C. glabrata continues to be one of the most prevalent and common causes of candidemia and invasive fungal infections. Furthermore, the incidence of C. glabrata infections is increasing.


## Methods
In order to determine the assay results for yeasts and moulds, the agar plates were inoculated with a suspension of .0 × 10^6 CFU/mL of yeast or a control suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of mould, which was prepared by culturing the fungus at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. After the incubation period, the plate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The plates were then washed three times with sterile distilled water and then dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The result of the assay was expressed as percentage of fungi that were induced to grow by the treatment with ethanol.

In order to evaluate the effect of the method on the fungal growth, the growth of yeasts and moulds was examined on the plates after incubation for 3-7 days at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. The fungus was incubated at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for 4-6 days. The test was performed in triplicate and the growth of fungi was measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. The percentage of the fungal growth was calculated as % inhibition compared to control growth.

The effects of the method on the fungi growth were also evaluated on the fungus-free plates. The fungus-free plates were prepared by inoculating the fungus with a suspension of 10^6 to 10^6 CFU/mL of yeast or a control suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of mould. The fungus was incubated at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. After the incubation period, the plates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. The supernatant was then discarded and the pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The pellets were then ground in liquid nitrogen.

The results of the assays were compared with those of the control assay, which was performed by inoculating 10^6 CFU/mL of yeast or a control suspension of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL of mould.


## Results
verticillioides was firstly tested in order to evaluate its potential to kill rice plant. F. verticillioides was firstly tested in the assays described in the Methods section and then transferred to the rice plants. The results showed that the relative inhibition of F. verticillioides was observed in the assays described in the Methods section. The relative inhibition of F. verticillioides on F. verticillioides was in the range of 2.4 to 4.9 fold (Table 3). A significant difference was observed between the assays involving the control and the rice plants. The assays with the rice plants showed a higher relative inhibition of F. verticillioides than the assays with the control plants (Table 3). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of F. verticillioides on F. verticillioides is probably due to its different chemical structures. The assays using the control and the rice plants showed the same results as the assays with the rice plants (Table 3). These results suggest that F. verticillioides has distinct chemical structures.

The findings in Table 3 suggest that F. verticillioides has a strong potential for the development of new plant pathogen models. The plant pathogen F. verticillioides was firstly tested in the assays described in the Methods section and then transferred to the rice plants. The results showed that the relative inhibitory effect of F. verticillioides on F. verticillioides was observed in the assays involving the control and the rice plants (Table 3). A significant difference was found between the assays using the control and the rice plants (Table 3). This suggests that F. verticillioides has a strong potential to develop new plant pathogen models.

As shown in Fig 3, the assays using the control and the rice plants showed the same results as the assays with the rice plants. This suggests that F. verticillioides has a strong potential for the development of new plant pathogen models.

## Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the interaction between Fusarium and . albicans as a fungal pathogen. C. albicans was found to be an opportunistic pathogen in infected plants and is also a colonizer of wounded plants [23,24]. However, fungal pathogens are associated with different plant diseases and to a large extent also fungal pathogens are virulent in plants [25].

C. albicans was found to be a fungal pathogen in infected plants, but C. albicans was found to be a colonizer of wounded plants, such as, leaves, flowers, and fruits, and to be highly virulent in infected plants, such as, flowers, and fruits [26]. In contrast, C. neoformans was found to be an opportunistic pathogen in plants, and it was found to be a colonizer of wounded plants, such as, flowers, and fruits, and to be highly virulent in infected plants, such as, leaves, flowers, and fruits [27]. In this study, we found that C. neoformans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans.

Our results showed that C. neoformans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans and C. albicans. In addition, we showed that C. neoformans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans and C. albicans. These results suggest that these two fungal genera co-evolved with C. albicans and C. albicans.

The interaction of C. neoformans and C. albicans was shown previously [27]. The interaction between C. neoformans and C. albicans in this study is consistent with previous studies [28]. However, C. neoformans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans, and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans. In addition, C. neoformans and C. albicans co-evolved with C. albicans and C.
