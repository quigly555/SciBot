## Abstract

Antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles in combination with ketoconazole against . furfur was evaluated. In vitro activity was performed against Candida albicans ATCC10231 and M. paraffin larvae. In addition, we evaluated the antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles used as both carriers and colonizers.

The results showed that the combination of silver nanoparticles and ketoconazole was able to inhibit the growth of M. furfur and M. paraffin larvae. Ketoconazole was more effective than silver nanoparticles as the antifungal agent against M. furfur and M. paraffin larvae.

Our results demonstrated the synergism of combination of silver nanoparticles and ketoconazole against M. furfur and M. paraffin larvae. Ketoconazole was more effective than silver nanoparticles as the antifungal agent against M. furfur and M. paraffin larvae.

The synergism of combination of silver nanoparticles with ketoconazole was demonstrated.

The synergism of combination of silver nanoparticles with ketoconazole was demonstrated.

## Introduction
The genus Aspergillus includes approximately 90 species, most of which cause invasive mycoses in humans, primarily affecting immunocompromised patients, as well as immunosuppressed patients, such as those with cancer, diabetes, and HIV infection [1]. Aspergillus niger is a common filamentous fungus found in soil, water, and on plants, animals, and humans. Infection is mostly caused by conidia produced by A. niger, which can be cleared by phaeohyphomycosis, which is the most common invasive fungal disease in humans [2]. Other species, including A. parasiticus, A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. versicolor, and A. nidulans, are capable of causing disseminated infections in humans [3]. In endemic regions, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. parasiticus are the most prevalent and can cause infections in immunocompromised patients [4,5]. Other species of Aspergillus, such as A. niger, A. flavus, and A. nidulans, have been isolated from plants, insects, and animal skin [6,7].

Aspergillus niger is one of the most important airborne fungi, since it is one of the most important airborne fungi in the world [8]. It causes significant economic losses in food, feed, and medicine [9]. Some studies have shown that A. niger causes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and allergic pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary aspergillosis (PPA) [10]. A. nidulans is a dimorphic fungus, which is often found in soil, especially in the soil with low levels of nitrogen, which can be caused by soil-borne plant or animal saprotrophs and the excess of organic nitrogen in the air. This imbalance creates an environment that is conducive to the development of anaerobic growth and yeast growth [11,12]. As a consequence, A.


## Methods
The antifungal activity was evaluated by determining the MIC value (mg/mL. The microdilution method was used in this study to determine the MIC values of the antifungal drugs and the interaction between them. The MIC values of SNPs and ketoconazole were compared by SDA-MS analysis (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to determine the MIC values of silver nanoparticles in combination with ketoconazole. The microdilution method was used to determine the MIC values of SNPs and ketoconazole.


## Results
The antifungal activity of ketoconazole and silver nanoparticles was evaluated in combination (Table 4. The antifungal activity of silver nanoparticle was dependent on the MIC and MIC_50 values. The MIC_50 value of silver nanoparticle was found to be 0.0625 µg/mL, while the MIC_50 value of ketoconazole was found to be 0.125 µg/mL.

## Discussion
In this study, we have used computational models to predict a series of genes in C. neoformans with various phenotypes. We have used two different genetic approaches to identify genes for each of the two approaches, one using genetic approach and the other using network model. The genetic approach predicts a set of genes in each of the two models, which are used to predict a set of genes in each of the two approaches. The network model is the result of genetic model and computational approach, but the computational model is more complex because the genetic approach has to be performed in different time and space. We then used this information to develop a new model for the prediction of genes in C. neoformans.

In this study, we show that C. neoformans is a heterothallic mutant and the genes of C. neoformans are mostly clustered into two distinct clusters, each of which is associated with two different phenotypes.
