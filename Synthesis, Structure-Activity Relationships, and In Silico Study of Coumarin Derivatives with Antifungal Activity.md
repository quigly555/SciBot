## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the leading cause of fungal meningitis worldwide. Genetic diversity and drug resistance have made it difficult to develop novel therapeutics against cryptococcosis, and there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular targets that can exploit C. gattii as a drug reservoir. The fungus is a heterothallic fungal pathogen that survives inside macrophages by blocking virulence factors, which makes it a suitable drug reservoir for testing new antifungal drugs against this fungus. Whole genome resequencing of C. gattii over a two-year period using a novel universal primer platform (bacteria-bacteria-bactriaDB, BioDB) and a customized gene deletion library resulted in the discovery of a unique gene (CMA-CMA-B) in C. gattii known as the “m2-cba toxin” that is required for growth and filamentation in C. gattii. Silencing C. gattii B-1 has been demonstrated to be advantageous in model systems such as the Galleria mellonella and is a promising new antifungal candidate for developing new antifungal drugs against C. gattii.


## Introduction
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a serious condition that can lead to death, especially in immune-compromised patients.1 In the literature, most studies have focused on specific pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium haemophilum, and Mycobacterium marinum.2, 3-5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for causing a wide spectrum of diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate of 60%,2 acute myelogenous leukemic cell leukaemia (AML), and acute myelogenous leukemic cell leukaemia (AML-CM), with a mortality rate of 60%,5 and acute myelogenous leukemic cell leukaemia (AML-CM) with a mortality rate of 73%,6 and acute myelogenous leukemic cell leukaemia (AML-CM) with a mortality rate of 62%,7 and acute myelogenous leukemic cell leukaemia (AML-CM) with a mortality rate of 70%8.

In the past, most of the diagnostic tests have been done on only a small number of cases, such as TBM, and it is only after the widespread use of antimicrobials in the treatment of patients with TBM that the diagnostic tests can be performed.


## Methods
The PAS structure was modeled as a continuous spectrum of a hydrophilic structure with a window of 8 n. The PAS structure was defined as a quaternary structure with a window of 4 nm. The structure-activity relationships between the drugs were assessed using the software [1] while the PAS structure was modeled as a multivariate structure. The PAS structure was modeled as a whole molecule with a window of 4 nm. The structure-activity relationships were evaluated by the PAS-expert model, which employs a linear-active group in the center of the PAS structure, and the data was statistically analyzed with the software program PAS-Expert 2.0 [43]. The PAS-expert model is a graphical program that uses a linear-active group in the center of the PAS structure. The data obtained from the PAS-expert-parsed structure was compared with the PAS-expert structure, which was a QIIME structure. The PAS-expert-parsed structure was compared with the PAS-expert-qpearised structure, which was a QIIME structure. The data obtained from the PAS-expert-parsed structure were compared with the PAS-expert-qpearised structure, which was a QIIME structure. The data obtained from the PAS-expert-parsed structure were compared with the PAS-expert-qpearised structure, which was a QIIME structure.

In order to analyze the structure-activity relationship of the coumarin derivatives with the selected antifungal compounds, the structures of the compounds were determined by chemical means. The structures of the coumarin derivatives with the selected antifungal compounds are shown in Figure 1. The majority of the coumarin derivatives were active with the selected antifungal compounds, whereas the coumarin derivatives with the selected antifungal compounds were active with the selected antifungal compounds.


## Discussion
cerevisiae [39. The FKS gene is encoded in the promoter region of S. cerevisiae SgFKS2, and its mRNA is rapidly phosphorylated by the fungal protease FKS. The activity of the enzyme can be easily observed by the presence of the exo-sialotase (FKS, 5-5-5-6) domain. This domain is present in the structural organization of the enzyme in the 5’-strand, and is recognized as a key enzyme for the synthesis of arginine and threonine. It is also involved in the binding of the yeast FKS to the FKS-rich domain of the FKS protein.

The screening of the anti-fungal activity of the FKS gene of the FKS gene of S. cerevisiae using the structure-activity relationship (SAR) approach showed that the anti-fungal activity of the FKS gene of the S. cerevisiae strain Q6^T can be attributed to the formation of the outermostmost scaffold of the enzyme. The enzyme is characterized by the presence of the FKS domain in its promoter region. The activity of the enzyme can be easily observed by the presence of the exo-sialotase (FKS, 5-5-6) domain. This domain is present in the structural organization of the enzyme in the 5’-strand, and is recognized as a key enzyme for the synthesis of arginine and threonine. It is also involved in the binding of the yeast FKS to the FKS-rich domain of the FKS protein. The crystal structure of the enzyme is also elucidated by the GC-MS of the purified protein (Table 1).

The anti-fungal activity of the 6’-strand-containing scaffold of the FKS gene of the S. cerevisiae strain Q6^T was determined by the GC-MS of the purified enzyme. The activity of the enzyme was determined by the presence of the FKS domain in its promoter region. The activity of the enzyme was determined by the presence of the FKS domain in its 5’-strand-containing scaffold.
