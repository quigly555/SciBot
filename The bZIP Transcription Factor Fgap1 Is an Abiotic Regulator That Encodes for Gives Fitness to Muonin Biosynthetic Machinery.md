## Abstract
Protein trafficking in eukaryotes is a complex process involving multiple protein subdomains, including one that's been proposed to connect with the helicase domain of the protein kinase subdomain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this reason, we studied the protein kinase-like domain (PKD) of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We found that the PKD is essential for viability and growth on membranes and for filamentation, but not for attachment to the cell wall. Surprisingly, the protein kinase-like domain does not appear to form any pre-mRNA prior knowledge of the host protein. Instead, it appears to serve as a determinant for the development of complete cellular homeostasis. We propose that the PKD is a form of the RNA interference domain that prevents and/or abrogates protein movement. We also show that the PKD is essential for growth in rich media, and that it is also responsible for full-length polarized cells. Finally, we describe a putative trpuclear protein with additional functions in the cell wall biology of N. crassa, which we believe adds new significance to the current unification of eukaryotic protein subdomains.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.1 A variety of opportunistic fungal pathogens, including Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii, cause bloodstream infections that can be life-threatening.2 Candida albicans is the most common yeast pathogen, accounting for a majority of systemic candidiasis cases.3,4 A. fumigatus is the most common fungal pathogen in humans, and the incidence of invasive aspergillosis has declined significantly in recent years.5,6 However, there is an increasing use of antifungal drugs in the management of invasive fungal infections and invasive aspergillosis in the last decade. The antifungal agents available for the treatment of fungal infections are limited and may be toxic to the patient. Thus, new antifungal agents are needed.

The antifungal activity of triazoles is reported to be effective against a wide range of fungal pathogens. However, the effectiveness of azoles against fungal infections remains unclear. Azoles are generally considered to be a major contributor to the problem of drug-resistant fungal strains.7,8 In this regard, the antifungal activity of azoles against A. fumigatus is largely dependent on their fungistatic property, which is responsible for the high mortality rates observed with azole-resistant A. fumigatus.9,10 Furthermore, azoles are often administered intravenously, and the toxicities associated with the intravenous concentrations are higher than the toxic doses associated with amphotericin-B formulations.


## Methods
The bZIP-Fgap1 is a fused-protein-coding gene that encodes the ability of different substrates to generate the required . paradoxus gene. It was previously shown that the bZIP-Fgap1 gene was fused to the sceRNA gene and sceRNA was amplified by PCR with the primers bZIPFgap1-F and bZIPFgap1-R. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the 2.8-kb-long 5’-end of the bZIP-Fgap1 gene was amplified by PCR with the primers bZIPFgap1-F and bZIPFgap1-R. The PCR product was then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the 5’-end of the bZIP-Fgap1 gene was amplified by PCR with the primers bZIPFgap1-F and bZIPFgap1-R. The PCR product was then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the 3’-end of the bZIP-Fgap1 gene was amplified by PCR with the primers bZIPFgap1-F and bZIPFgap1-R. Finally, the PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The fusion of the 3’-end of the bZIP-Fgap1 and the 3’-end of the bZIP-Fgap1 gene into pGEM-T Easy vector was confirmed by sequencing of the DNA and then sequencing of the PCR product. The bZIP-Fgap1-GFP fusion gene was expressed in the Trichoderma reesei strain Af293 as described previously (6, 7).

4.7. Western Blot Analysis
Fungal strains were cultured in liquid YPD medium for 7 days at 37°C. The conidia were collected by washing with PBS. The conidial suspension was adjusted to the desired concentration using distilled water. The conidial suspension was mixed with 1× SSC-A solution (0.8% SDS, 1.5% SDS, 0.


## Results
We thus used the GFP-MproA_3 as a reporter for aflatoxin biosynthesis in a recently described strain of . graminearum (Yoshida et al., 2013). We first tested whether the GFP-MproA_3 could regulate expression of the putative biosynthetic gene encoding the biosynthetic enzyme fgap1. The F. graminearum wild type strain was transformed with the cassette into the qRT-PCR-based reporter system. We observed that the expression of fgap1 was increased by 7.3-fold when the wild type was transformed into the qRT-PCR-based reporter system (Figure 2A). In contrast, the expression of fgap1 was reduced by 1.5-fold when the wild type was transformed into the qRT-PCR-based reporter system (Figure 2A). These results indicate that the F. graminearum wild type strain is capable of regulating expression of the biosynthetic enzyme fgap1.

## Discussion
Fgap1 is a GAP that is composed of a short 3-nt linker and a GTP-binding protein (Figure 2A. The sequence of Fgap1 is similar to that of the GAP 1 of S. cerevisiae, a non-redundant polypeptide that acts as a scaffold for the putative GTPase and substrate binding proteins that are essential for proper GTP-GTP-protein interactions (Kobayashi et al., 2014). The Fgap1 motif is conserved in other proteins (Figure 2B). The Fgap1 motif has been found to be highly conserved in filamentous ascomycetes (Chen et al., 2015). The Fgap1 domain is found at the C-terminal regions of the Fgap1 sequence in the sequences of other fungal species. The C-terminal domain of Fgap1 is a typical GAP motif, and is involved in signaling downstream of the first GTPase-activating protein (MAPK) pathway (Hasegawa et al., 2014). The Fgap1 domain in other fungal proteins is highly conserved, and is involved in signaling downstream of the first GTPase-activating protein (MAPK) pathway (Hasegawa et al., 2014).

The conserved Fgap1 domain is a common feature of other fungal proteins (Figure 2B). The conserved domain contains the GAP-interacting protein (Figure 2B) and the GAP-interacting protein-interacting protein-interacting protein (Figure 3B) that are essential for proper GTP-GTP-protein interactions (Kobayashi et al., 2014). The conserved domain also contains the Fgap1-binding protein (Figure 2A) that acts as a scaffold for the putative GTPase-activating protein (MAPK) pathway (Hasegawa et al., 2014). The conserved Fgap1-binding protein is present in the Aspergillus nidulans genome (FungiDB at GenBank, access number FH-OM00186).
