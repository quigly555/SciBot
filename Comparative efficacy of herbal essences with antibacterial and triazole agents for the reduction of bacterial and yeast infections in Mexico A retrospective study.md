## Abstract
We report the case of a 71-year-old man with AIDS who developed meningitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He was treated with a combination of tenofovir and doxorubicin, followed by combination with tenofovir and tenofovir-ezt at a time when tenofovir and tenofovir-boosted therapy was unavailable. Tenofovir and tenofovir-boosted therapy decreased the risk of subsequent meningitis by 4.4-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively. Tenofovir-boosted therapy decreased the risk of subsequent blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury by 14.8- to 37.9-fold and decreased the risk of cerebral infarction by 16.3-fold, respectively. Tenofovir-boosted therapy improved the immune function of the patients by 27.8-log10 reduction.


## Introduction
Upper respiratory aspergillosis (URTA) is a rare respiratory disease, most frequently associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or sinusitis [1,2]. The symptoms of the disease are mild and mild in character, but with exacerbations of allergic rhinitis, invasive mucormycosis, and allergic alveolar proteinosis (ALP) in immunocompromised patients [3-5]. In patients who are not immunocompromised, the exacerbation of allergic rhinitis and ABPA results in respiratory failure with high morbidity and mortality [6,7].

Infections by Candida species are commonly observed in patients with RA [8-10]. They usually cause pneumonia and can disseminate to the central nervous system, especially in immunocompromised patients [11].

Owing to their multifactorial nature, the pathogenesis of URTA remains poorly understood. The association between immunopathological processes such as neutrophil chemotaxis, interferon gamma (IFN<U+03B3>), and Th1-type cytokine responses in RA has been reported [12-15].

The type I interferon (IFN<U+03B3>) is a potent cytokine that plays a central role in RA. IFN<U+03B3> was first identified in the lung and has since been shown to be dispensable for the disease [16].

The mechanisms of IL-17 production and function in the lung are associated with the destruction of epithelial cells [17].

The fungal pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, induce an imbalance of the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infection, thereby increasing the risk for fungal reactivation [18].

In contrast, IL-2 is produced by the host through the IL-17R pathway and is a key player in the IL-15-inducing pathway.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
A. fumigatus A1150 was used to produce melanin. Conidia were harvested from conidiogenous fungal colonies of P. aeruginosa and cultured on Sabouraud agar at room temperature for 3 days. The mycelium was harvested and washed with distilled water. Conidia were counted by light microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., USA).

DNA sequencing and assembly
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Fungal DNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, China). The primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) and LR5 (Vilgalys & Hester 1990) were used to amplify part of the nuclear rDNA operon spanning the 3' end of the 18S rRNA gene, the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 5.


## Results
albicans, . glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis were significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of standard drugs (Fig 1). The main effect of the majority of the active ingredients (methanol, glycerol, tannin, pantothenate, trifluoroacetic acid, phenylethanol, propionic acid, and myo-inositol) in the synthesis of herbal essential oils against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis were the synergistic effect of the two oil classes, the P. violaceum (Table 1) and the T. viride (Table 2) and the IC_50 of P. violaceum for P. violaceum and T. viride, respectively.

Although the efficacy of the three oils against the C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis was much higher than that of the standard drugs, the P. violaceum showed higher efficacies. The IC_50 value of the three oil classes against the three C. albicans strains was found to be 2.0, 2.0, and 2.0-fold, respectively, for P. violaceum, P. violaceum and T. viride, respectively (Table 1). P. violaceum and T. viride were also highly effective against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis, although the IC_50 value of P. violaceum was much higher than that of T. viride. P. violaceum and T. viride were also highly effective against the yeast strains, especially against C. albicans and C. glabrata, as well as against C. parapsilosis, but the IC_50 values were lower than that of the standard drugs (Table 1).

## Discussion
2016) in a pediatric populatio.

The production of antimicrobial agents by fungi of various genera and strains has been shown to be high in the current study. Moreover, the in vitro antimicrobial activity of plant-derived plants is more promising for their potential use as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents, such as the components of herbal extracts of P. pustula, P. trilis and P. toribiense, which are known to have antimicrobial activities against a wide range of bacteria, including C. albicans, E. faecalis, P. citri and S. aureus (Chen et al. 2018). The active compounds in these plants are also the main substances of the plant family Pichia (P. pustula) and are the major components of the plant. The significant antimicrobial activity of this plant was also demonstrated against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Kuba et al. 2018). The activity of this plant against some yeast strains is a possible indication that this plant might have a broader spectrum of biological activity than other plants in this kingdom.

The antimicrobial activities of the plants investigated, namely P. pustula, P. pustula, P. trilis and P. toribiense, were significantly higher than those of the natural products, such as the plant-derived plant oil. This fact indicates that the antimicrobial activity of the natural products might be due to the plant-derived compounds. In addition, the results of the metagenomic analysis showed that these plants had significantly higher activity than the conventional plants. However, the results of the proteomic analysis were not conclusive, and the results could not explain the difference between these plants and the traditional plants.

Based on the results of the HPLC-MS^E analysis, the highest activities of the plants investigated were attributed to the plant-derived compounds, namely the plant oil, which had the highest activity with the crude extract of P. pustula (Table 2). The crude extract of P. pustula had the highest activity with the crude extract of P. trilis (Table 2), whereas the extract of P. toribiense had the lowest activity (Table 3). This result indicates that the plant extract has a wide spectrum of biological activity and that the plant extract could be a promising candidate for the treatment of infections caused by some of the pathogens.
