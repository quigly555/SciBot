## Abstract
The majority of the genes responsible for the adaptation to cold-adapted conditions were obtained at the end of the Miocene, as the Dictyostelium discoideum, the Vitek-Ia system, and the Chlamydomonas clad. The evolution of plant-pathogen symbiotic relationship was relatively slow (dating back to the middle Miocene), and the divergence between the first plants and their pathogens was very slow. The endolithic-era was the longest supported group of eukaryotic domestication events in eukaryotic evolution. Evolved by horizontal gene transfer, plant pathogens were relatively rare, and the vast majority of them were domesticated by symbiotic or parasitological microbes. Most plant symbionts were parasitized by fungal symbionts but were either completely lost or only rarely domesticated. The symbiotic-or-diszymatic symbiont was often embedded in the foliage of plant hosts and, when the host was not home, it often served as a locus of disease propagation. Almost all the plant symbionts that were domesticated at the end of the Miocene were parasitized by the host plants and, most notoriously, the Bacillaceae family was formed. The next major domestication event that followed the middle Miocene was the introduction of the ciliari (steam engines), an enormous white-nose-tailed animal-trafficking syndromes of Pleosporales that transported the vast majority of the human and bryophytes that accompanied the mummification of animals. The evolution of pathogenicity in plants and animals was driven primarily by the dispersion of the phytopathogens in the host plants, but also by the dispersion of microbes in the hosts and the host-specific symbionts that carried these pathogens. The emergence of disease by members of the phylum Zygomicrobiology was driven primarily by the dispersion of the microbes that were carried by the plants, and by the dispersion of a substantial diversity of the microbes that were carried by the Bacteria, Eukarya, Archaea, and Cyanobacteria.


## Introduction
Antibiotic resistance, particularly in food, feed, and agriculture, is a serious public health problem worldwide (Singh et al. 2018). Over the past decade, the number of new antibiotics discovered and synthesized has increased exponentially, making the discovery of new antibiotics essential. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to a group of clinical and environmental microorganisms that cause a wide range of diseases, including infections, allergic reactions, haematological malignancies, and skin and soft tissue infections (Singh et al. 2018). Currently, over 15,000 new antibiotics have been discovered (Bj√∂rk et al. 2017).


## Methods
The phylogenetic relationship of Dictyosphaera, Dictyosphaera, and Dictyosphaera was analysed by the neighbour-joining method, and the neighbour-joining method was applied to analyse the phylogenetic relationships between species, and the bootstrap values were set to 100. The analyses were performed using PhyML software version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The values were compared using the non-parametric test of equal variances and to determine if the null hypothesis was false. The two groups of cases (Dictyosphaera and Dictyosphaera) were compared using the non-parametric test of unequal variances and to determine if the null hypothesis was false. The two groups of cases (Dictyosphaera and Dictyosphaera) were compared using the non-parametric test of equal variances and to determine if the null hypothesis was false. The phylogenetic relationship between Dictyosphaera, Dictyosphaera, and Dictyosphaera was analysed by the neighbour-joining method, and the neighbour-joining method was applied to analyse the phylogenetic relationships between species, and the bootstrap values were set to 100%.

## Results
hanseni. Dictyosporella is closely related to D. laricina (75 % BS) (Table 2) but is quite distinct in having a more basal branching relationship to D. hansenii. The ITS, TEF, and ACT sequences were identical for all three taxa. Dictyosporella is currently regarded as a synonym of D. hansenii (Barr.) s. str. (Tanaka et al. 2009). Dictyosporella can be distinguished from D. hansenii by its subclade of D. laricina (75 % BS) (Table 2) and a single-spore-like sexual morph with a similar conidial morphology as the sexual morph of D. hansenii. The ITS, TEF, and ACT sequences were identical for all three taxa.

Taxonomy
Dictyosporella is considered a cryptic species of Dictyosporella with only three species (Kunze, 1967, Gao, 2003, Wu, 2008), but this species was tentatively introduced as a new combination in the Dictyosporella clade. Dictyosporella can be distinguished from D. hansenii by the larger conidiophores and the shorter branching sexual morph (Table 2). However, it has conidia with variable lengths of septation (Table 1).

Taxonomy
Kunze (1967) reported a conidiophores and a sexual morph that were not identical in morphology and were distinguished by a single-spore-like sexual morph with a similar conidiophores and a conidia with a wider septum, and a long- standing branch from Dictyosporella (57 % BS) (Table 2).

Taxonomy
Dictyosporella is closely related to D. globulus (79 % BS) (Table 2) and D. winghamii (80 % BS) (Table 1). Dictyosporella has a longer and wider branch from D. winghamii (86 % BS) (Table 2).
