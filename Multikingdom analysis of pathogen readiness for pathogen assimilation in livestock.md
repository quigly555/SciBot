## Abstract
The rapid growth of non-typhoidal Salmonella Enterococcus spp. (S. Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacteria and Staphylococcus) coupled with the identification of a novel agent that can efficiently penetrate into the digestive tract of amoebas is a concern for human health, because this organism harbors a wide range of virulence factors that could play a role in pathogenesis.


## Introduction
The number of infected cells is determined by the infectious agent’s physical characteristics, the size of the lesions, the time in which the lesion was established, and the number of lesions that were not diagnose. The need to survive in the presence of an infectious agent is one of the major factors that increase the risk for infection with bovine mastitis [12].

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends three additional factors to be considered when evaluating the risk of mastitis in the presence of bovine mastitis [1,3,4]:

The number of infected cells: B cells are the most commonly infected cells. B cells are able to colonize the body and cause infection. However, B cells are more resistant to the immune system than other cells, and are more likely to initiate a self-limiting inflammatory response and develop into viral infections [1,3]. B cells are also more likely to activate the immune response [5]. The severity of the disease: B cell necrosis is the most severe and can produce a wide spectrum of symptoms. B cell necrosis is usually diagnosed by incubation on agar slants and in water at 37 °C for 1-2 h. Afterwards, B cells are killed by phagocytosis. B cell persistence: Once B cells are dead, they are slowly released into the blood circulation. The absence of B cells leads to blood flow disturbances. B cell persistence in the circulation: B cells in the blood may remain in circulation for longer than they are killed, causing diseases such as anemia, rheumatalgia, and other diseases [6]. The role of the immune system in immune responses to bovine mastitis: The role of the immune system in response to bovine mastitis is also important for the treatment of other disorders of the immune system such as lymphomas, nephrotoxicity, and other autoimmune diseases [7,8,9]. The role of the immune system in response to Cryptococcus neoformans: The role of the immune system in response to Cryptococcus neoformans is not yet clear. In fact, there is a lack of information on the role of the immune system in response to bovine mastitis.


## Methods
Experimental Design and Data Collection
This was a 1-h-old experimental design using P. brasiliensis yeast cells obtained from the Fungarium of the University Hospital of Pernambuco. The yeast cells from P. brasiliensis culture were used for the experiments. Plates were incubated at 25°C and 200 rpm for 2 days. After growth, the yeast cells were transferred to a new sterile tube and incubated at 25°C and 200 rpm for 48 h. The cell wall was removed and the liquid was removed from the tube by filtration using a 0.22-µm-pore-size filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with sterile distilled water. The pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of water and centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min. The pellets were then suspended in 5 µl of methanol to give the final concentration of 1 µg/ml.


## Results
The lipid production from the oleaginous yeast Sc. placenta is well established [14]. We therefore next compared the lipid production from the yeast form of Sc. placenta. Using lipid assays, we tested the ability of the two yeasts to produce a high amount of lipids from the oleaginous yeast cells (Fig 1). When the oleaginous yeast cells were incubated for 24 h, the total lipids in the oleaginous yeast form (Fig 1A) were significantly higher than those from the yeast form (Fig 1B).


## Discussion
These interactions were observed in a recent study of PK2 inbred cattle [13.

We observed that PK1 and PK2 inbred cattle are very resistant to various pathogens including Cryptococcus neoformans, Vibrio cholerae, Blastomyces dermatidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Similar to the above study, the PK1-P2 interaction has been demonstrated to be extremely well regulated inbred cattle and sheep, and the PK2-P1 interaction was also observed to be highly efficient inbred cattle [43]. In addition, we observed that the PK1-P2 interaction is highly efficient inbred cattle, and PK2-P1 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep.

Protein kinase I (PKC) is a major regulator of protein kinase I in eukaryotic cells and it is activated by numerous stimuli including the bacterial cell wall, nutritional and environmental cues, and is thus essential for growth and survival of microorganisms [44]. Protein kinase I is involved in many biological processes including protein metabolism, DNA and RNA metabolism, cell differentiation and morphogenesis, and apoptosis [45]. In this study, PK1-P2 interaction showed a strong interaction of PK1 and PK2 inbred cattle, and the PK2-P1 interaction was also highly efficient inbred cattle. The PK1-P2 interaction was also efficient inbred sheep. In addition, we observed that the PK1-P2 interaction was highly efficient inbred sheep.

The PK1-P2 interaction has been shown to be highly efficient inbred cattle, and the PK2-P1 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep. The PK1-P2 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep. PK2 is the main protein kinase involved in many biological processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, and programmed cell death (PCD) in the mammalian cell line MDA-2 [46]. The PK2-P1 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep.

The PK1-P2 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep. PK1-P2 interaction was also highly efficient inbred sheep. PK2 is a major protein kinase involved in many biological processes including protein metabolism, DNA and RNA metabolism, cell differentiation and apoptosis [47].
