Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that primarily infects immunocompromised patients. In addition to being a cause of cryptococcal meningitis, it can also be a causes for disseminated disease. The primary causative fungal cause of AIDS-related deadly complications is cryptococcosis, an emerging, life-threatening disease. An increasing number of cases of cryptococcosis due to Cryptococcus are being reported worldwide, and the majority of these cases occur in people with weakened immune systems. The immune response of the host is the first line of defense against the pathogen and the primary cause of disease is determined by cytokines released by the fungus. The main driver of host response is T cell homeostasis. T cell homeostasis is essential for the host to be able to eliminate, control and ultimately eliminate the pathogen. Studies of the effects of chemokine receptors and ligands on cytokine production in Cryptococcus are described in this review. Recent developments suggest that the interaction of the host with C. neoformans is also important for control of this fungus. Finally, this review discusses the pathogenic mechanisms of C. neoformans.


## Introduction
Current Opinion in Oncology 29(2):1-.

V.C. Escobosa is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes acute infections ranging from localized to disseminated infection that can cause fatal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant patients. Invasive cryptococcosis is responsible for approximately 1,350,000 deaths each year, and cryptococcal meningoencephalitis accounts for 10% of AIDS-related deaths worldwide. Cryptococcosis is acquired by inhalation of infectious particles or desiccated yeast cells from the environment, where the organism can disseminate to the brain and cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis. Cryptococcosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts.

Cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection, with nearly 3 million cases and 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide. The most common sites of cryptococcosis are the lungs and the central nervous system, and most cases are asymptomatic. The clinical manifestations of cryptococcosis are nonspecific and range from asymptomatic to severe headache, lethargy, fever, seizures, and brain changes. Although most cases of cryptococcosis are asymptomatic, immunocompromised patients can present with a variety of clinical presentations, including cryptococcal meningitis, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and acute cryptococcoma (AC) in which the infection is thought to be acquired by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeasts, or by disseminated cryptococcosis involving the central nervous system and skin (hypercapnia), although the latter presentation is rarely seen.

C. neoformans is an ubiquitous fungus that causes meningoencephalitis predominantly in HIV-positive patients and is responsible for more than 600,000 deaths annually worldwide. The organism is found in the lungs, but not in the central nervous system, although cryptococcosis is a primary fungal pathogen in HIV-negative individuals. Cryptococcosis is acquired by inhalation of yeast cells or desiccated cells from the environment, and is often caused by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells, although this infection is rarely reported.


## Methods
All children with a Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolate were included in this stud. Children with a Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolate were included in this study.

Laboratory tests for CNA and antigen were performed at the Uganda National Council of Health, Institute of Clinical Research, and Kenya National Council of Health Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Cryptococcal antigen test was performed in the microbiology laboratory of the Uganda National Council of Health.

The study was approved by the Uganda National Council of Health, Institute of Clinical Research, and Kenya National Council of Health Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Approval No. 559/2012) and by the Uganda National Council of Health, Institute of Clinical Research, and Kenya National Council of Health Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Approval No. 510/2012).

Ethics Statement
All patients with Cryptococcus neoformans cryptococcal antigenemia who had received any kind of antifungal treatment in the past 12 weeks were informed about the risks of receiving antifungal treatment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Uganda National Council of Health, Institute of Clinical Research, and Kenya National Council of Health Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Approval No. 559/2012).

Study Population and Sample
A total of 121 HIV-1 and TB-1 patients admitted to the Department of Pathology at Makerere University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2012 were included in this study. The HIV-1 and TB-1 patients were those with HIV-1 and TB-1 CM and those with TB-1 CM without any underlying cause of meningitis. These patients were matched with those with a history of cryptococcal meningitis, confirmed by Cryptococcus neoformans culture or serum cryptococcal antigen assay, and a Cryptococcus neoformans-specific serum cryptococcal antigen assay was performed at the University Hospital of Pretoria.


## Results
The occurrence of cryptococcosis has been documented in a majority of patients in the setting of . aeruginosa, as shown by studies in the context of tuberculosis [20-22] and by other studies. The patient population is very diverse, with up to 4 cases of cryptococcosis per year.

2.4. Characterization of the Non-Candidate Non-Cultured Cryptococcosis Patient Population
In order to determine the demographic characteristics of the non-cultured cryptococcal population, we classified the cryptococcal culture as either non-cultured, or cultured. The non-cultured cryptococcal population is considered to be C. neoformans, but a relatively small number of C. neoformans (approximately 3/18) were recovered from the culture. The non-cultured cryptococcal population was considered to be C. neoformans. The prevalence of non-C. neoformans in the non-cultured cryptococcal population was estimated at 30%, and this value was lower than that in the C. neoformans population (Table 1). The non-cultured cryptococcal population is reported to be C. neoformans and C. albicans [23]. The prevalence of non-C. neoformans in the non-cultured cryptococcal population was estimated at 13% in the non-cultured cryptococcal population. The prevalence of C. neoformans in the non-cultured cryptococcal population was estimated at 18% in the non-cultured cryptococcal population.

2.5. Analysis of the Candida Community
The C. neoformans community is reported to be very diverse, with a total of 9,514 species and 1,869 species groups (Table 1). The majority of C. neoformans species are isolated from diverse ecological niches, including bacteria and fungi. The C. neoformans species isolated in the present study are C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, C. parapsilosis, C. neoformans var. grubii, and C. parapsilosis. The remaining nine C. neoformans species are isolated from clinical specimens, including C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var.


## Discussion
We conclude that the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans in Toxocariasis patients has a risk factor for the development of Toxocariasi. The presence of Cryptococcus neoformans in the CNS is a risk factor for the development of Toxocariasis and the development of non-Toxocariasis Toxocariasis (NTS) in the setting of non-toxic immunosuppressive therapy.

This case report is the first report of Toxocariasis in a non-Toxocarnaceae patient with Toxocariasis. While a majority of patients have been treated with fluconazole alone, use of fluconazole for Toxocariasis has been associated with a risk for NTS and this risk factor has been previously associated with non-Toxocarnaceae. Recent studies have also shown that patients with NTS who have undergone a second round of Toxocarcoidosis treatment could develop non-Toxocarnaceae Toxocarnorum Virus (Toxocarnovalinae virus) infection and have a significant risk of NTS. The risk of Toxocarnovalinae virus infection was previously associated with Toxocarnovalinae virus (Toxocarnovalinae) infection and a large proportion of patients who had undergone Toxocarnovalinae virus infection had also been treated for Toxocarnovalinae virus infection (PMLSA 2017). In this case report, the patient had been treated with fluconazole and was subsequently treated for Toxocarnovalinae virus infection with fluconazole.

Toxocarnovalinae virus infection in non-Toxocarnaceae patients is a rare disease in which a pathogen is isolated from a human body, which is then encapsulated and subsequently disseminated to the brain. Most patients with Toxocarnovalinae virus infection have been treated with fluconazole alone. In the setting of Toxocarnovalinae virus infection, treatment with fluconazole alone is associated with a risk of Toxocarnovalinae virus infection. In this case report, the patient had been treated with fluconazole, but was subsequently treated with fluconazole for Toxocarnovalinae virus infection.
