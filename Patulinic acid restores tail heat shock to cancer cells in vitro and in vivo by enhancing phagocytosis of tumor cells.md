## Abstract
In this study, the effect of different dried cereals on Candida albicans biofilm formation and the antifungal activity of the Aureobasidium pullulans and Candida glabrata strains was evaluated. Cereals were prepared using dried cereals in which C. albicans spores were removed from a non-fermentable volume of 30 g/L broth. The biofilm matrix was evaluated by microscopy and ultracentrifugation techniques using C. albicans cells. The biofilm viability was measured by viability assay for yeast cells. The antifungal activity of the dried cereals was evaluated by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The antifungal activity of the dried cereals was inhibited by FK506, clotting inhibitors, and amphotericin B. The results showed that the dried cereals were able to inhibit the biofilm growth of C. albicans.


## Introduction
A study by Goh et a. found that the HSAI is protective against the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and induced ROS production in the macrophage through the NADPH-oxidase complex (22).

The HSAI has been studied in the context of microbial infections such as urinary tract infections (19, 23), oral thrush (24, 25), cutaneous aspergillosis (26), pneumonitis (27), sinusitis (28), and skin diseases such as eczema (29). In addition, it was shown that the HSAI can protect microorganisms against antimicrobials by enhancing phagolysosome maturation and ROS production (30, 31). Furthermore, HSAI can decrease the toxicity of HSAI due to inhibition of the phagolysosome and ROS production (32).

In this study, the effect of HSAI on the cell cycle of primary human neutrophils and the cytoskeleton of pulmonary aspergillosis, however, was tested. The main effectors of HSAI on the cytoskeleton were the large phagosome and the small phagosome. The cytoskeleton is the first cell organelle associated with the mitotic cycle, which constitutes the initiation of the egress of the fungal cells from the phagosome and the phagolysosome. The small phagosome contains two types of organelles, the endosome and the lysosome, which are separated by a thin membrane. Endosomes contain the small cytoplasmic membrane, which is connected by a tight cell-cell adhesion network. The endosomes contain lysosomal and heparanic residues that are involved in the transport of cell material and DNA from endosomes to the cytoplasmic membrane, which is the first organelle associated with the mitotic cycle. The cytoskeleton of the endosome is composed of several organelles, which consist of a ring composed of a-(1<U+2192>3)- and ß-(1<U+2192>5)-linked cysteine residues and a-(1<U+2192>6)-linked cysteine.


## Methods
Similarly, . parapsilosis mutant strain pACT-1 (ATCC 25922) was used to examine the effect of caspofungin on C. parapsilosis-induced C. albicans cell death, which was evaluated in vivo by mounting of C. albicans cells on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides.

Analysis of cytokines in the lymphatic cells
To detect C. albicans cell death, C. albicans cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640 media at a concentration of 2 × 10^6 cells/ml. C. albicans cells were cultivated for 48 h in RPMI-1640 medium at 37°C with 5% CO_2, and then were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640 media at a concentration of 2 × 10^6 cells/ml. C. albicans cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 48 h and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) for 5 min at 4°C. The stained cells were washed with PBS and mounted in Rhodamine-Br served as mounting medium for fluorescence imaging.

C. albicans cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 48 h, and then were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640 media at a concentration of 2 × 10^5 cells/ml. C. albicans cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 48 h and then were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640 media at a concentration of 2 × 10^6 cells/ml.


## Results
A monoclonal antibody against CMF-PAGE specifically detected a single colony in the tail (Figure 3A. These results demonstrated that Phagocytosis of tumor cells by whole blood was enhanced by PMA-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells. We next tested whether PMA-induced phagocytosis was impaired in animals treated with PMA. PMA-treated animals were able to colonize their tail with a single colony of CMF-PAGE. In contrast, animals treated with PMA had no colonies of CMF-PAGE. These results demonstrated that PMA-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells was impaired in animals treated with PMA.

PMA induces phagocytosis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo

PMA-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells was evaluated using in vitro in vitro phagocytosis assay. PMA-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells was demonstrated by phagocytosis of tumor cells by tail-transfected CMF-PAGE cells (Figure 3B). This observation indicated that PMA induced phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro, although this assay required an in vitro assay. To test whether PMA-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells was impaired in a mammalian host, we next tested the phagocytosis of tumor cells by tail-transfected PMA-induced or PMA-induced cathepsin B (CMF-PAGE) cells. No significant differences were observed in the number of cells in the tail between the two groups of cathepsin B cells (Figure 3C).


## Discussion
The immunopathological responses to . falciparum infection are largely conditioned by the use of exogenous peptides and cytokines. In contrast, P. falciparum-derived anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies have been shown to be important for the development of immunity in cancer [24], [25].

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies to modulate the T cell response to P. falciparum infection and found that P. falciparum is able to modulate the T cell response to infection. This is in contrast to other pathogens that are capable of activating the immune response to infection [26], [27].

Although the role of T cells in the innate immune response to P. falciparum infection is still unknown, our data showed that T cells are required to stimulate the immune response to P. falciparum infection. T cells are activated in response to P. falciparum and are necessary for the activation of innate immune cells [28]. T cells are also activated in response to P. falciparum and are required for the induction of adaptive immune responses [29], [30]. T cells are also activated in response to P. falciparum and are required for the induction of adaptive immune responses to infection [31], [32]. T cell responses to infection were enhanced in the presence of P. falciparum-derived peptides. P. falciparum-derived anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies are required for the induction of adaptive immune responses to infection and protection from infection [32]. In contrast, the anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies are not required for the induction of adaptive immune responses to infection [33]. In contrast, P. falciparum-derived anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies are required for the induction of adaptive immune responses to infection and protection from infection [34].

In the present study, the anti-IFN<U+03B3> autoantibodies were more potent in the presence of P.
