## Abstract
Acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) is a rare but severe syndrome of unknown etiology in which subacute manifestation in an apparently healthy adult is rare. We report a case of AUF with subacute clinical manifestation in an apparently healthy adult.

A 21-year-old Indian man was admitted to hospital for postoperative pain, tenderness, and loss of vision in the left eye of his wife, which was later found to be mild. On examination, he had mild fever with neutropenia and mild chills, accompanied by mild vasculitis in the left lower limb.

Acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology, with a relatively severe comorbidity, probably due to autoimmune and immunodeficiency. We present a case of AUF with subacute clinical manifestation in an apparently healthy patient. Autopsy revealed disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in the left posterior limb.


## Introduction
Owing to the widespread use of airborne hyphomycetes, invasive fungi have become increasingly prevalent in indoor environments, such as dishwashers, dishwashers, saunas, sinks, dishwashers, dishwas, sink parts, and even on carpet and carpeting.1,2 The use of fungal indoor pathogens in these settings has led to the appreciation of species that are often difficult to distinguish from known species in the environment.3 In the past decade, a number of species of the genus Cryptococcus have been isolated from environmental sources, including bird droppings and decaying wood.4,5 In many countries, such as Canada, the European Union, and USA, many species are distributed into several geographic zones.6,7 However, species that are difficult to distinguish from each other and are often difficult to distinguish from the common environmental fungal species are less common than those species that are uncommon and rare. This article summarizes the current status of Cryptococcus species in the European Union and the USA.


## Methods
fumigatus species was performed using previously described methods, including the use of a single colony type as a standard isolat. The wild type of A. fumigatus A. fumigatus strain KAC 633 was used as a reference. The newly generated sequence reads were aligned to KAC 633 (a reference strain from the K. k. orientalis collection) using the software Nucleotide BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/blast). The deduced amino acid sequences were then translated using the SILVA database (https://www.arb-silva.de/) and the sequence similarity was analyzed by BLASTp (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastp).

To obtain the sequence similarity index for each Aspergillus species, the reference sequence of each species was used in order to distinguish it from the other species. The index was calculated with the software EdgeR (http://edger.sourceforge.net/).

The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method and the maximum likelihood method using MEGA 6.0 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/). The method was used to analyze the relationships among all fungal genera. The best-fit model was selected by a maximum likelihood (ML) test with the default settings (100 bootstrap replicates, 0.01 replicates).

Identification of Aspergillus flavus subsp. floresis
The taxonomic classification of Aspergillus flavus was performed by using the Aspergillus Genome Database (AGB) [17]. The bacterial and fungal genera of Aspergillus flavus were compared with other fungi of the genus Floccitinae (the genera Vitis vinifera, Vitis vinifera, Vitis citrinii, Vitis fibronectinii, Vitis tabulata, Vitis kudriavzevii and Vitis vinifera, the genera Saccularia, Saccularia annulata and Saccularia glaucescens, the genera Spizellomyces, Spizellomyces floccosum, and the genera Macromorphaceae) and was compared with other fungal species of the genus Flavus.

## Discussion
The phylogenetic analyses of proteins involved in the pathogenesis, virulence and cell wall/membrane integrity were not consistent with the results of previous studies on the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus [31], [32. In fact, the presence of fungal protein proteins in Aspergillus was not associated with the presence of fungal infection or virulence in Aspergillus spp. [32]. Thus, the protein abundance and phylogenetic analyses were not consistent with previous studies on Aspergillus flavus.

The proteins involved in the biosynthesis of glucose, sucrose and fructose were found to be abundant in Aspergillus species. The protein synthesis of fructose was also found in Aspergillus niger [33]. This result could suggest that Aspergillus flavus might utilize glucose as a carbon source for its metabolic activities. However, the authors used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the protein composition of the genome. The level of the protein was also significantly higher in Aspergillus flavus than in Aspergillus niger. This result may suggest that the A. flavus genome might be more compact and contain more genes than the Aspergillus flavus genome. However, the authors do not discuss this issue further.

A number of proteins involved in the degradation of the cell wall/membrane/chromatin were found to be abundant in Aspergillus flavus. The presence of cell wall/membrane/chromatin was associated with the presence of the pathogen in some studies [34], [35], [36]. The presence of cell wall/membrane/chromatin was also detected in the Aspergillus flavus genome. This result could suggest that the A. flavus genome might be more compact and contain more genes than the A. flavus genome. However, the authors do not discuss this issue further. The presence of the V-ATPase, which is responsible for the production of cell wall/membrane/chromatin, was present in Aspergillus flavus. This result could suggest that the A. flavus genome might be more compact and contain more genes than the A. flavus genome.
