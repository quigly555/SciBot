## Abstract
The meningococcal fungal meningitis (MS) panel is a diagnostic tool that has become increasingly popular in clinical trials. However, the usefulness of this panel remains limited. Here we report the efficacy of a 3-month long double blind clinical trial (control trial) in patients with MS. At baseline, patients were randomized to either standard (sidestic) or repurposing dose of standard (sidestic) doses (1200 mg/kg, 1200 mg/kg repurposing dose). Upon completion of the second week of Trials with Interserrant Rheumatic Syndrome (IRS) status, the MS panel was removed. After the second week, all MS paneling patients were transitioned to a new vehicle (M&T Therapeutics) dose prior to the second week of trials. At the end of the third week, all MS paneling patients were transitioned to the repurposing dose of the MS dose. At the end of the fourth week, all MS panels were retained in the vaccine suspension. Six weeks after the third week of the MS suspension, the panel was removed in three patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) with the repurposing dose set at 1200 mg/kg. Two patients had relapses following this repurposing dose repurposing. One patient had a relapse after the second week of the MS suspension. Finally, one MS paneling patient completed the third week of the MS suspension. Interestingly, all the patients in the MS paneling group had a significant improvement in the control dose when compared with the second week of the MS suspension. These results suggest that the MS panel removal could be a useful strategy for MS patients with MS to recover from their relapses and regain their ability to respond.


## Introduction
Medicinal plants are extensively used in traditional medicine because of their unique properties, which can be utilized in a variety of applications, such as the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases, asthma, cough, sore throat, fever, and diarrhoea. The vast majority of patients seek medical help for ulcers and oral candidiasis, but the overall incidence of these diseases remains extremely high, with more than 400,000 cases of these diseases and more than 600,000 reported deaths in 2017 [1]. A major concern is that these infections are difficult to treat because the natural enzymes in plant extracts are generally highly mutagenic, and the phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, are known to play an important role in this process [2]. In addition, the most common species of fungi are responsible for fungal infections, and the number of reported cases in the literature is continuously growing, and the number of deaths from fungal infections is increasing [3, 4].

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms used by these species to cause disease in plants. In addition, several fungi are able to degrade various types of recalcitrant substrates, and this fact is important to develop effective treatments, especially against fungal infections. In this context, it is necessary to study the enzymatic activity of some of the plant extracts and to investigate their potential to be used as biological control agents against these diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant activity of plant extracts and their major components (Vitamin E, carotene, minerals, and amino acids) isolated from the leaves of Placidiobolus lupens (P. lupens) collected in Pernambuco state, Brazil, against the fungal strains causing yeast infection.


## Methods
2007; . L. Sartorius, unpublished data). Rhodorsyllopodium, Rhodorhynchus, Rhodorhynchus rhinosinus, Rhodorhynchus mays, Rhodorhizosporium, Rhodorhynchus fischeri, Rhodorhynchus nigra, Rhodorhynchus rubripes, Rhodorhynchus verrucosa, Rhodorhynchus verrucosus, Rhodorhynchus rugosa, Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. sp. sp., Rhodorhynchus sp., and Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. were selected from the available literature and identified as Rhodorhynchus sp. due to the similarity between Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. and Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. (Kirchner and Benckiser, unpublished data). Rhodorhynchus sp. was chosen because it has been used to study the hyphal structures and morphologies of hyphae of several hyphae of Ascomycetes species (C. Paul and G. M. Siqueira, unpublished data). Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. was selected due to its ability to form monophyletic conidiomata and to grow on solid media (Kirchner et al. 2012). Rhodorhynchus sp. sp. was selected because it has been used to study the lipid and hydrophobicity of A. oryzae, as well as the structure and morphologies of Ascomycetes fungi (Kirchner and Siqueira, unpublished data).

## Results
pedrosolla was originally described as an endophyte of the flowering weed . brachysula, which has been treated as a botanical medicine in the USA [19]. Rhodotorula pedrosolla is a typical endophyte of the P. brachysula complex, which was discovered in the USA [19]. The Rhodotorula pedrosolla complex was established in the USA in 2002 by D. Glawe, Ph.D.W.G. (D.W.G. Soc.), who received the Ph.D. from Cornell University and Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. The results of this study indicate that the Rhodotorula pedrosolla complex is probably distinct from other endophytes, because the species from this complex have the same taxonomic group (Fig 2). The Rhodotorula pedrosolla complex was first described by D. Glawe and W. Gams in 2002 and is recognized as an important plant pathogen of P. brachysula and P. brasiliensis, which have been treated as a botanical medicine in the USA [19].

R. pedrosolla was recently described as a pseudocercospora-like fungus [16]. It is very close to R. pedrosolla (97 % identical in all four DNA sequences), and in the genome sequence has the same ITS2, 28S, and 26S regions as R. pedrosolla. It also shares 49 % (841/391) similarity in all five DNA sequences, with R. pedrosolla P-37 (CBS 139500, CBS 137285) and R. pedrosolla P-39 (CBS 138808), and 49 % (841/391) similarity in the 28S region of the rDNA sequence. The rDNA phylogeny of R. pedrosolla also shows a close relationship with the Rhodotorula species, with the exception of the third set of trees (Fig 3). This indicates that R. pedrosolla is a well-supported fungal species in this study.

## Discussion
(1973) who used a Rhodotorula s. strain with an identical type strain and gene in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 1). This species is characterized by its conidial morphology, conidial color, hyaline to light brown and velvety conidiophores, and smaller basidiospores (7.4-7.7 × 3.3-4.2 µm). This species has a distinct and distinct morphology, which is characteristic of Rhodotorula species (Gams, 1966). Rhodotorula pedrosolla has been collected in the Northern Hemisphere from various locations, such as Mexico, Brazil, Peru, South America and the Pacific coast (Gams 1966, 1972, 1984, 1973, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2010). It was originally classified as a genus in Costa et al. (1973) and was transferred to the genus Rhodotorula by Costa et al. (1973) and is related to Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Rhodotorula citrinum (Gams 1966, 1972, 1984, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2010). In addition, the genus Rhodotorula has been recorded from Mexico, Brazil, Peru, South America and the Pacific coast (Gams 1966, 1972, 1984, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013). In this study, the genus Rhodotorula was identified as Rhodotorula pedrosolla and it has been collected in the present study. However, Rhodotorula pedrosolla was not listed in the original taxonomic work, but we decided to do a comparative study of Rhodotorula species. Rhodotorula rubra is a Rhodotorula species with a phylogenetic position of 99% (Crous et al. 2009). This species has been found worldwide and is distributed in the USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, and Turkey (Gams 1966, 1972, 1984, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2010). It has also been reported from Colombia, Ecuador, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Paraguay, Venezuela, and Brazil (Gams 1966, 1972, 1984, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012).
