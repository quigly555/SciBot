## Abstract
Infections with Fusarium species remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. In the last few years, various new insecticidal antifungals have been developed including the new poly-lactic acid (PLA) coated SLAF (SLAF-like compound) formulation, the use of a quaternary ammonium-based coating in the formulation, and the use of a fusarinine-fused SLAF-like compound in the antifungal armamentarium. However, the exact mechanism by which Fusarium graminosa plants protect itself against fungal infections remain unclear. Here, we show that F. graminosa also responds to arthropod-borne heat stress by increasing the sensitivity to arthropod stressors.


## Introduction
Protein secretion systems play key roles in eukaryotic cell-to-cell communication and protein-protein interactions.


## Methods
Isogenic fungi were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchoalveolar perfusion, pulmonary specimens, bronchoalveolar endoscopy, and lung specimens collected in the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of São Paul.

Isogenic fungi were isolated from bronchoalveolar specimens and bronchoalveolar perfusion samples from the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo. The isolates were confirmed by morphological characteristics of the tissue of interest. The isolates were obtained from clinical specimens and bronchoalveolar specimens. These specimens were originally isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis of the respiratory system, and were subsequently used for the study.

Preparation of specimens
Bronchoalveolar specimens were prepared according to the previously described method [32]. Briefly, specimens were removed from the bronchoalveolar region and stained with an appropriate microscope. The specimens were then cut into sections and visualized by using a Nikon E600 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera.

Morphological characteristics
The specimens were stained with an appropriate morphological standard (S-9A1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the procedure reported by Taubman and Wagner [33], and observed by light microscopy with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera and an AxioVision A1 digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA). The specimens were examined by light microscopy with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera and an AxioVision A1 digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).

Molecular procedures
The fungal strains used in the present study were maintained in the culture collection of the Laboratory of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo, and are listed in Table 1.

DNA extraction and amplification
The genomic DNA was extracted from the specimens according to the procedure reported by Daum and Sárkönen [34].


## Results
Other reports have demonstrated that pulmonary inflammation and inflammation-related immune inflammation are associated with a predisposing factor for HIV infection [15], [16], [17. We evaluated the effect of antifungal therapy on fungal burden in the BALB/c and CNS of HIV-infected mice (Table 1). We found no differences in the number of CFU in the brain between the two groups of animals. The overall fungal burden in the CNS was significantly higher in the liver (p<0.05), kidney (p<0.01), and spleen (p<0.01) than in the brain (Table 1). No differences were observed in fungal burden in the lungs and brains between the two groups of animals.

Caspofungin and L-Amplase Induced Significance in Fungal Fungal Load in the Liver and Brain of HIV-Induced Infected C57BL/6 and Non-HIV-Induced C57BL/6 Mice
Given the previously reported involvement of Caspofungin-mediated killing in the host immune response and its importance in fungal clearance, we investigated the effect of L-Amplase-mediated killing on the fungal burden in the liver and brain of HIV-infected mice. L-Amplase-mediated killing of L. amazonensis was dose-dependently effective in killing C57BL/6 mice at a higher dose than that of the control group of mice (1 × 10^4 CFU/mouse) (Figure 2). We also found that L-Amplase-mediated killing of C57BL/6 mice resulted in significantly more CFU of L-Amplase-dead in the liver at 1 × 10^4 CFU/mouse compared to that of the control group of mice at 1 × 10^5 CFU/mouse. The liver fungal burden was significantly higher in mice treated with L-Amplase-mediated killing (p<0.05) compared to those treated with the control group of mice (Figure 2). In contrast, the brain fungal burden was significantly lower in L-Amplase-treated mice compared to that of the control group of mice (Figure 2).


## Discussion

Cryptococcus is an encapsulated yeast, which can be found in the environmen. It can also be present in respiratory tract infections and other infections. Cryptococcus is also a causative agent of mucormycosis, which is associated with chronic cough [3,6,8].

The main route of transmission between the patient and the infection is inhalation. The patient inhales cryptococcus from a variety of environmental sources, including tree hollows, soil, bird droppings, and air, thus leading to the human inhalation [2,6,8].

Cryptococcus spp. is a common cause of cryptococcosis in the respiratory tract. However, in a retrospective study, only 17 cases of cryptococcal meningitis were reported. Most of these patients had no apparent underlying immunodeficiency such as HIV or diabetes mellitus. The patients were younger, the majority male, and the prognosis of the patients was poor [9].

Cryptococcus spp. infections have been reported in immunocompetent patients with hematologic malignancies, including immunocompromised individuals, in association with bacterial infections. However, in a study by Wilson et al. [9], the majority of patients had no identifiable immunodeficiency. However, in a patient with a documented immunodeficiency, Cryptococcus spp. was detected in the blood and CSF of patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients with a history of systemic cryptococcal infection and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) had the highest risk for cryptococcal infection.

Cryptococcus spp. is the most common human opportunistic infection causing cryptococcosis. In a retrospective study by Eyssall et al. [8], the median age of diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was 33 years. The majority of patients were males and the majority of patients were HIV-positive. The median CD4 cell count in the HIV-negative patients was 5 cells/µL, and the median CD4 cell count was 81 cells/µL [8].

Cryptococcus spp. is present in the respiratory tract of immunocompetent patients with an underlying immunodeficiency, as well as patients with underlying immunodeficiency. In a retrospective study by Lutke et al.
