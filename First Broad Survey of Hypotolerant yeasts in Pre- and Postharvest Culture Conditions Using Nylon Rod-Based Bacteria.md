## Abstract
Uric acid (U12) is an important trace element and a well-known component of cell survival in many fungi. U12 production by Magnaporthe oryzae is a poorly studied mechanism but might involve uptake by degradation of U12 by biotransformation. We investigated if M. oryzae uptake of U12 by degradation of U12 by either Ca2+ or U12+CD18 followed by biotransformation of U12+CD18 would induce an increase in fungal fitness. M. oryzae uptake by uptake and biotransformation in a forward-flow model (FGF) of M. oryzae were not dependent on substrate adherence. U12 uptake by Ca2+ uptake was higher in the forward-flow model but was almost opposite in the FGF model, indicating an effect of substrate adherence in the process. M. oryzae uptake into fungi was also higher in the FGF model, but not in the bulk model, when the uptake of U12 was dependent on substrate adherence. Overall, these results suggest that M. oryzae uptake of U12 by degradation of U12 by either Ca2+ or U12+CD18 would induce an increase in fungal fitness in a forward-flow model, whereas in a bulk, this effect was independent of substrate adherence.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom comprises more than 1.5 million species, but only about 300 species are pathogenic to humans and animals [1]. The number of opportunistic fungi is expected to increase, and the number of deaths due to fungal diseases has risen dramatically over the past two decades [2,3]. Although fungi are ubiquitous in nature, their impact on human health and the environment have been underlined [4,5,6]. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a major cause of fungal infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals [7]. The isolation of C. albicans from blood or skin may cause severe, life-threatening infections, such as life-threatening candidiasis [8]. The most common species isolated from blood are Candida glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei, but C. parapsilosis is most commonly isolated from patients with hematological malignancies or in intensive care units [9,10]. These microorganisms are the most common cause of blood-borne infections in the United States, with infections occurring in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [11,12]. In the United States, C. albicans accounts for approximately 15% of infections [13].

The most common yeast-to-hypha transition of host-pathogen interactions is caused by two major morphological transitions, namely, yeast-to-hypha transition and hypha-to-intracellate transition [14]. Candida albicans enters the bloodstream via the renal tubular epithelial cells and resides within the blood-brain barrier. The primary hyphal form of C.


## Methods
All bacterial cultures were grown in a sterile, .5 L container at 25°C. Bacterial isolates were recovered by spore isolation. Bacterial suspensions (10^3) were prepared in sterile, distilled water and diluted with distilled water. After the bacterial suspension was diluted by 10 times, the diluted suspension was poured into a sterile, 0.45 L container and the diameter of the filter was measured. The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to the desired concentrations using hemacytol (50-1.0%). The concentration of the bacterium was determined using the method described by Pritchard et al. [7]. The final bacterial concentrations were recorded in millimoles of hemacytol per liter of wine [8]. The experiment was repeated at least three times with different replicates.

Bacterial isolates were subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 25°C. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 48 h. A bacterium-free culture was prepared by transferring 100 µl of the culture to sterile 0.45 L containers and spreading the suspension over the surface of the media. The top agar layer was discarded and the bottom layer was removed. The agar layer was removed and spread onto a glass slide. The slides were kept at 25°C for 48 h and the diameter of the slide was measured. The experiment was repeated at least three times with different replicates.

## Results
The data from the soil experiment were used to investigate the distribution of the most frequent fungi and the most prolific pathogenic fungi in seedlings during the two sampling period. The majority of the fungal genera were found in the lower 48 hpi and higher 48 hpi samples, as shown in Fig 5. The most frequent fungi were Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). The most frequent fungi were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). The most frequent fungi in the lower 48 hpi samples were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus. The most frequent fungi in the higher 48 hpi samples were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus.

The most frequent fungal genera in the two different soil types were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). The most frequent fungal genera in the lower 48 hpi samples were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). The most frequent fungi in the lower 48 hpi samples were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus (Table 1). The most frequent fungi in the postharvest soil types were Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus (Table 1).

## Discussion
The natural degradation of wood and other plant material by osmoprotectants is known for its significant impact on the plant growth, development, and reproductio. For instance, osmoprotectants are commonly found in fruits of apple (e.g., apple from apple fruit to apple trees), and the proliferation of osmoprotectants is observed in apples from apple trees to apple trees. Additionally, fungi are the dominant phylum in apples. This study showed that the fungal community was strongly influenced by the use of biotic and abiotic factors. These studies showed that the fungal communities of apple fruit were influenced by biotic and abiotic factors and were dominated by Ascomycota. Therefore, these findings indicate that the fungal communities of apple fruit are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors.

The wheat ripening process is known to affect the ripening of apple fruit and the function of several key biotic and abiotic factors. For instance, wheat diseases are caused by two wheat species, C. subglaciale and C. lindemuthianum, which are grown together in wheat fields. During the process, the application of biotic agents leads to a decrease in wheat disease symptoms in wheat fields. Furthermore, the biotic agents that inhibit the growth of wheat pathogens are also found to be positive effects of wheat disease in apple fruit. For example, C. subglaciale was found to be positive effects of apple fruit in postharvest storage period. Moreover, C. lindemuthianum, a biotrophic fungus that also occurs in apple fruit, was found to inhibit the growth of apple fruit during storage period. In addition, C. subglaciale was found to be negatively correlated with the peach fruit, and the development of peach fruit was found to be affected by apple fruit biotic agents. These results indicated that the fungal communities in fruits of apple fruit were influenced by biotic agents, which was also reflected in the fungal communities of apple fruit.

The fruit withering process was also observed to be influenced by biotic factors, such as temperature, pH, and drought conditions. This study revealed that the fruit withering process is known to be a key factor in the development of apple fruit and the production of pear fruit. The fruit withering process is a process that takes place during the ripening process.
