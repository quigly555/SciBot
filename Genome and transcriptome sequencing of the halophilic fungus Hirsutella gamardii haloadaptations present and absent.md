## Abstract
Due to the large number of patents pending in cryptococcal medicine and due to the emerging threat of drug resistance, the challenges in finding new new drug leads to the discovery of long-acting anti-cryptococcal compounds from old drugs. In this study, we screened two Chinese pharmaceutical drug libraries and identified compounds with activities against Cryptococcus neoformans, the major fungal pathogen of humans. We also screened ten old antiproliferative drugs, and identified two new anti-cryptococcal compounds, which act as coumarins in vitro. The anti-cryptococcal compounds were also tested in a murine model of cryptococcosis, and both compounds were safe. These results suggest that these compounds pose no threat to the human body. These findings may be of clinical relevance and open new perspectives for drug development.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially those with solid organ transplantation. [1-4] IFIs are caused by fungi from the genera Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, and other fungi from the class of genus Candida, with the number of IFIs increasing by over 200 in the last 10 years. [1], [4] The most common antifungals used in the management of IFIs are polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins. [5-7] The best studied antifungals are fluconazole and itraconazole. [8-10]

Amphotericin B (ITC) is the predominant azole used in the treatment of IFIs. [11-13] ITC is a strong prodrug, with a selectivity of approximately 70-80% and an 80-90 µm wide cut-off point. [14] It is effective against Candida and Aspergillus strains. [15-17] The success of ITC treatment depends on several factors, including the patient’s immune status, drug resistance profile, and site-specific safety measures. [18-21]

Itraconazole (ITC), a member of the echinocandins, has been used in the treatment of Candida and Aspergillus infections in the clinic for over 20 years. [22], [23] It is also effective against the opportunistic pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. [24] It has antifungal activity against Candida and Cryptococcus yeasts. [25]

The antifungal activity of ITC is mainly attributed to its significant prodrug partial to the azole moiety. [26] It is mainly effective against C. albicans and C. glabrata. [27-29] However, it is less effective against C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. [30] Although ITC is more active than other azoles, its mode of action is not restricted to killing C. albicans and C. glabrata.


## Methods
Morphological study
Treated sporocarps were dried in the dark and voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Perugia. Morphological studies were conducted with the help of a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. Nomenclatural novelties were deposited in MycoBank (www.MycoBank.org).

The tree-mounted specimens of T. fruticosus (MY1, MY2, MY3 and MY4) and T. mesonii (MY1 and MY2) were used for morphological observations. The tetraploid specimens of T. lascauxii (MY1 and MY2) were used for microscopic investigations.


## Results
Of the three time points studied, only seven (three time points in the form of an intron) are located on the hemizygous genomes of . gamardii and the other two species (two intron positions in the genome of H. gamardii and one intron positions in the genome of H. gamardii).

The fact that the species of H. gamardii have the same genome size as the H. gamardii, and the small size of the genome of H. gamardii, is consistent with the hypothesis that these species were originally isolated from marine environments [23]. The other six species of H. gamardii have genomes of four intron positions in the genome of H. gamardii, and the three species of H. gamardii have the same size genomes as the species of H. gamardii (Table 2). In addition, the two species of H. gamardii have the same size genomes as the species of H. gamardii.

In addition to the sequenced strains of the four species of H. gamardii and the two species of H. gamardii, six species of H. gamardii, six species of H. gamardii and seven species of H. gamardii were sequenced. A total of 21,849,717 and 21,939,234 high quality reads were generated, respectively (Table 2). The number of reads per genome ranged from 1,953 to 4,319. The total number of reads per genome ranged from 2,012 to 3,836.

Sequencing of the gene-rich H. gamardii genome
The genome assembly of H. gamardii was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform, which is the database for high-quality genome assemblies of large and small genomes. The assembly of the H. gamardii genome was verified using the BLASTx tool. A total of 1,077,372 high quality reads (average read length of 1.9 Mb) were obtained from the sequencing reads. The genome assembly of H. gamardii had a mean read length of 4.7 Mb, which is the same as that of the genome of H. gamardii (Table 3). The average length of the genome assembly was 4.1 Mb for H. gamardii and 3.4 Mb for H. gamardii.


## Discussion
gamardii is a halophilic fungus closely related to species of the halophilic fungi in the order Melampsor. These two species have a wider range in their genome sizes, and have been widely distributed in many regions of the world. H. gamardii has two main lineages, the halophilic and the more distantly related species of the order Melampsora. The order Melampsorales, which includes several species of halophilic fungi, represents a group of distantly related and saprophytic species that have been reported from a wide range of environments. Melampsorine and dimerum are known to be saprotrophs, and were found in soil and on plants [36], [38]. The order Melampsora, which includes species of halophilic fungi, is closely related to that of Melampsora and has been reported from several sites in the tropical region [39], [40].

The halophilic and more distantly related species of the order Melampsora, are known to be saprophytes. They were found in soil and on plants [39], and are a group of distantly related and saprophytic species that have been reported from a wide range of environments [40]. The order Melampsorine, which includes members of the order Melampsora and a few other species from the order Melampsora, is also closely related to that of Melampsora sp. This species was originally described from soil and was later found in the rhizosphere of M. robertsii [41].

The order Melampsorine is a group of distantly related species from the order Melampsora and known from different sites in the tropical region. The order Melampsora contains a number of species, such as H. capsuligenum, H. brevis, H. israelii, H. terreus, H. tarentanus, H. vineae and H. versacellus, as well as several other halophilic and more distantly related species. The order Melampsorine is most closely related to that of H. brevis and H. israelii, which is closely related to H. capsuligenum. The order Melampsorine includes only one species, H. israelii.
