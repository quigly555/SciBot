## Abstract
The comparison of the composition and effects of a sponge and a soft tissue biopsy specimen from a patient with type 1 diabetes revealed an inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages, which is highly diverse in nature. This pattern was consistent in the patients with various types of type 1 diabetes, which were subjected to various types of immunosuppressive therapies. Furthermore, the inflammatory infiltrate rapidly expanded in the diabetic patients, which was associated with the development of a type 2 immune response characterized by a significant increase in the number of monocytes and lymphocytes, which produce type 2 immune responses. In addition, the sponges had a pronounced effect on the sponges recruitment, which was associated with a decrease in their density, which was followed by a decrease in their thickness and architecture. Interestingly, the sponges induced a remarkable fungicidal activity, which was significantly inhibited by the interferon-<U+03B3>, which was inhibited mainly by a polyene macrophage-macrophage colony-stimulating factor molecule, Rhodamine. Finally, we saw a similar phenomenon with the soft tissue biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with type 2 diabetes who presented with a non-inflammatory soft tissue mass nearly the size of fist. This is the first report describing a fungal sponges induced inflammatory tissue mass in a diabetic patient.


## Introduction
Pseudozyma is a polyphyletic group (with six to eight genera) of micro-organisms (Dujardin et al. 1999, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009, Voglmayr et al. 2012, 2013) that colonize the roots of healthy plants of the seed-bearing relatives, particularly Meloidogyne brasiliensis and Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Phylogenetic and ecological evidence indicates that P. destructans and P. pseudozyma are closely related and geographically distant (Dujardin et al. 2000, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009; Joffe & Hennebert 2002, 2007, 2009; Hennebert et al. 2004; Voglmayr 2011), and morphologically similar (Hennebert et al. 2004; Hennebert et al. 2005; Hennebert et al. 2006; Voglmayr 2011) but distinct pathogenicity strategies (Voglmayr et al. 2012, 2013). Their ability to colonize seeds of different seed-bearing relatives is crucial to their growth (Hennebert et al. 2005; Hennebert et al. 2006). P. destructans and P. pseudozyma have been considered as important pathogens of the seeds of P. brasiliensis (Hennebert et al. 2004; Voglmayr 2011) and the seeds of Cinnamomum kanehirae (Hennebert et al. 2006; Voglmayr et al. 2012).

The genera Pestalotiopsis, Pestalotiopsis, Pestalotiopsis, and Pestalotiopsis are most commonly isolated from the seeds of the European honey bee (Baldusch et al. 2015).


## Methods
The prepared compound was also diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg/m.

The preparation of the stock compound was performed in a 96-well plate at room temperature with agitation in a shaker at 200 rpm for 3 h. The stock compound was then diluted with 0.1 M NaOH to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.


## Results
neoformans is a major target of antimicrobial drugs and antifungal drugs due to the involvement of the central nervous system (NPD) [8], [9], [10. In addition, we found that 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine Boronaphthyrite (2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine) inhibits NPD mediated N-glycosylation and increases the susceptibility of C. neoformans to azole antifungals. We next compared the fungicidal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine and 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against a number of fungal strains, including the strains with increased susceptibility to azole antifungals (Table 1).

As shown in Table 1, the fungicidal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans increased with increasing concentrations of azole drugs. The fungicidal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans increased with increased azole drug concentrations. The fungicidal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans was highest when the drug concentration was at least 10 µg/ml. On the other hand, 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine significantly inhibited the growth of the C. neoformans strains with higher drug concentrations, indicating a synergistic effect of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans. The fungicidal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans was the highest when the drug concentration was at least 10 µg/ml.

2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine Increases the Tolerance of C. neoformans to Amphotericin B
In the presence of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine, the antifungal activity of 2-Amino-4-Phenylalanine against C. neoformans was evaluated by two methods.


## Discussion
While previous studies have shown that phenylalanine is more potent than its derivatives, the effects of phenylalanine on fungal growth, morphological alterations, and toxicological and pharmacological effects are still unclear [24,25. Here, we investigated phenylalanine binding and interaction with the plant cell wall integrity regulator, LPMO. Our results revealed that phenylalanine binding to LPMO is not only not necessary for fungal growth but also cannot be completely abolished, with the exception of the effect of phenylalanine on ergosterol levels in A. fumigatus. Phenylalanine binding to LPMO is in line with the finding that phenylalanine has anti-fungal activity in some other fungi. In fact, it has been reported that phenylalanine has antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [26,27].

The antifungal activity of phenylalanine has also been reported for other fungal species. In Candida albicans, the combination of phenylalanine with fluconazole and fluconazole resulted in a reduction in the fungal growth rate. In Candida albicans, phenylalanine was also reported to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and reduce the antifungal activity of fluconazole [28]. In addition, phenylalanine has been reported to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans and Candida albicans and to enhance the antifungal activity of a yet unidentified compound [29]. The mechanism of action of phenylalanine against A. fumigatus and A. parasiticus has also been reported. In C. albicans, a phenylalanine derivative was reported to be potent antifungal in combination with fluconazole and in combination with the azoles, amphotericin B, and flucytosine [30]. In the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, phenylalanine was reported to be potent antifungal in combination with fluconazole and antifungal in combination with amphotericin B and azole [31]. In A.
