## Abstract
Invasive candidiasis (IC), caused by Candida species, is common in immunocompromised patients and its treatment is complex. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of Candida species to fluconazole, with particular emphasis on its in vitro activity.

In vitro susceptibilities of 27 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates from 30 different countries to fluconazole were evaluated.


## Introduction

Burkly lymphohistiocytosis is often associated with hyperinflammation of the extracellular matrix, leading to inflammation of the cell wall, and its association with neuroinflammation has been recognized for over a century (Strobel and Daisy, 1963; Redhead and Long, 2002; Fauré et a., 2003; Zhao et al., 2004). Hyperinflammation and polymicrobial inflammation have been recognized as risk factors for ocular Burkle lymphohistiocytosis (OTC), a rare infection that is often asymptomatic, but can cause ocular lesions in immunocompromised individuals. The pathogenesis of OTC has been studied by microscopy and molecular approaches, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood.

RNA and protein post-transcriptional regulation have been postulated to be critical for the regulation of inflammation in vivo. The roles of RNA and protein post-transcriptional regulation in OTC have been studied in a number of model organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans (Chalabi et al., 2006; Tamang et al., 2006; Meletiadis et al., 2012; Lian et al., 2015), yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hertzberg et al., 2010), Arabidopsis thaliana (Naris, 2004), and Homo sapiens (Fauré et al., 2007; Tamang et al., 2006). RNA-binding proteins, such as uPAR, are post-transcriptionally regulated by the action of post-transcriptionally regulated RNA polymerase (Pro-Qs) (Hurtado et al., 1999). Pro-Qs function to repress the splicing of the mRNA isoform from the RNA precursor, thereby preventing translation of the protein (Wathurst et al., 2000). Pro-Qs have been shown to regulate expression of genes encoding protein subunits (Rung and Shanahan, 2000; Task et al., 2002). In contrast, Pro-Qs have been shown to repress the expression of genes encoding protein subunits in the promoter region of genes encoding RNA polymerases (Laghan et al., 2007). The role of RNA-binding proteins in OTC has been studied in A. thaliana (Bong et al., 2002; Poeta et al., 2002; Salahudeen et al.

## Results
. Microscopic Evaluation of S. brasiliensis and S. sclerotiorum
The material examined in this study was the chlamydial organs of the adult female of S. brasiliensis and S. sclerotiorum. The lungs and brains were extracted from the same tissue. The typical morphology of the chlamydial organs of S. brasiliensis and S. sclerotiorum is the formation of small, rounded cysts in the middle of the organs. In S. sclerotiorum, the lungs and brains were extracted from the same tissue. The typical morphology of the chlamydial organs of S. brasiliensis and S. sclerotiorum is the formation of small, rounded cysts in the middle of the organs. In the other species, the typical morphological characteristics of the organs are the formation of small, rounded cysts in the middle of the organs.

2.2. Analysis of the Microscopical Pigmentation
The microsclerotia in S. brasiliensis and S. sclerotiorum were evaluated by the microsclerotial pigmentation method. The microsclerotia were initially stained with an antibody to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dye and then stained with an antibody to trypanosome polyclonal antibody (PAMP). The microsclerotia were analyzed by light microscopy.


## Discussion
As is the case in most cases, the majority of patients with fungal infection had normal CD4 counts and CD8+ T cells, and thus the authors were surprised to see that most of the patients had normal CD4 count. Interestingly, the vast majority of the patients were immunocompromised and did not have other types of immune response. This is in contrast to what has been reported in many other studies [27-29], where immunocompromised patients have been reported to have normal CD4 counts and low CD8+ T cell responses. The authors speculated that the immune response in these patients could be a consequence of the large number of opportunistic infections that they had.

Several studies have shown that the immune response is a significant component of the immunopathology in HIV-infected individuals [30-33]. In this study, the patients with lymphoid tissue infection had a lower CD4+ T cell response than the patients without lymphoid tissue infection. This finding is consistent with a study by Kim et al. [30] that suggested that CD4+ T cells are a prominent marker of immunocompromised patients.

The immune response in the setting of HIV infection was also found to be a significant component of the immune response in this study. This finding is consistent with what has been reported in other studies [33-35], where immune response in HIV-infected patients with lymphoid tissue infection was found to be a significant component of the immune response in HIV-infected patients [36-38].

In contrast to the lymphoid tissue infection, lymphoid tissue infection was not found to be a significant component of the immune response in this study. This finding is in line with a study by Yang et al. [40] who found a significant immune response in HIV-infected patients with lymphoid tissue infection. This finding is also in line with a study by Huang et al. [41] who found a significant immune response in HIV-infected patients with lymphoid tissue infection.

In the context of TB, this study did not find any significant immune response in the lymphoid tissue infection. This is in line with a study by Baek et al. [42] who found that a significant immune response was found in lymphoid tissue infection in HIV-infected patients with HIV.
