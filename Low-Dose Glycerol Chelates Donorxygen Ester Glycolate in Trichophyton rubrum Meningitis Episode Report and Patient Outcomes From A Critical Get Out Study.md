## Abstract
Co-infection with HIV and tuberculosis (HIV) is common in developing nations but uncontrolled co-infection is not uncommon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the a-GalAD and glanase 7a-7b transmembrane proteins in the virulence of the yeast-inhibiting strains of VNI, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis carinii, respectively, which were isolated from patients with HIV and tuberculosis and which were associated with significant mortality. One hundred and fourteen patients were male and 184 with HIV and TB, and 180 were female, with a mean ofuito age of 38 years (SD Â± 13), and 169 with HIV and TB, respectively. The a-GalAD protein expression was significantly lower in HIV- (p < 0.01) and Pneumocystis species (p < 0.001) strains, and was significantly up-regulated in P. carinii in comparison with the control P. aeruginosa (p = 0.01). Furthermore, both P. aeruginosa and P. aeruginosa mutants were infected with G2/S-GalAD transmembrane proteins, which were up-regulated in the presence of the superoxide dismutase inhibitor, sulfadiazole. In addition, P. aeruginosa and P. aeruginosa mutants were also significantly more sensitive to the fungicide, flucytosine. The sensitivity of both transmembrane and nuclear protein-encoded cytochrome P450 enzymes was significantly higher in HIV- (p < 0.01) than P. aeruginosa mutants, which suggested that the high level of transmembrane protein expression may be a quality that may be a driving force behind the development of HIV-associated resistance in African patients with AIDS.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is a major opportunistic infection and its incidence in the human population is increasing at a rate of one per year (1). Fungemia is the second most common fungal disease in the central nervous system (CNS) (2). The prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has been estimated to be 10-30% in the United States (3,4), and the incidence of IFIs in South and Southeast Asia is estimated to be about 5-10% (5,6). However, due to the increase in the prevalence of IFIs and the increased use of antifungals, the incidence of IFIs has also increased (7). IFIs are usually acquired by inhalation, and it is believed that this is due to inhalation of fungal spores or spores of pathogenic fungi (8-10). However, the converse route of infection, via the respiratory tract, is more likely to occur in patients with respiratory disease. The route of infection is therefore not yet completely understood.

We herein report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with severe pulmonary histoplasmosis, and note that he was not treated with antifungal agents but was treated with fluconazole.


## Methods
Data sources
We analysed data for adult patients with adult onset of CM or without CM at Mulago Hospital, Singapore.

Data sources
We analysed data from four sets of patients, namely, HIV-positive patients, HIV-negative patients, CM patients, and CD4 cell count and viral RNA concentrations, from the June 1st 2017 to June 30th 2017. The data sources included HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with a positive result from blood culture or culture of Cryptococcus, and HIV-negative patients without a positive result from CSF culture or culture of Cryptococcus.


## Results

A total of 17 patients were treated with fluconazole at the time of the diagnosis of CSF T-cell infiltration (Table 3. Of these, 5 patients received fluconazole during the first 2 weeks of therapy and 4 patients received fluconazole at a later time point after fluconazole discontinuation. Three patients were treated with fluconazole in the hospital, and 2 patients received fluconazole in the same setting. Fluconazole treatment was not associated with other clinically relevant clinical manifestations (Table 3).

The majority of patients with CSF T-cell infiltration (53/56) had advanced disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-2.26; p = 0.07) or had advanced disease (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-2.11; p = 0.09) after starting fluconazole (Table 4). The median duration of fluconazole treatment was 18 days (range, 0-1 year; p = 0.01). The median duration of fluconazole therapy was 4 days (range, 2-8 days; p = 0.002). In 5 patients with advanced disease, fluconazole was administered intranasally and once a day for 2 weeks. In all patients with advanced disease, fluconazole was administered intranasally in 1 patient (0-2 weeks; 1-3 weeks; 1-3 weeks) for 4 weeks. In 3 patients, fluconazole was administered intranasally and once a day for 1 week. In 6 patients, fluconazole was administered intranasally and once a day for 2 weeks. Fluconazole was administered intranasally in 5 patients. The median duration of fluconazole therapy was 14 days (range, 5-17 days; p = 0.04). The median duration of fluconazole therapy was 16 days (range, 7-25 days; p = 0.03).

Laboratory Diagnosis of C. neoformans in the CSF of Patients With Transfusion Defects
All of the CSF T-cell infiltrates were confirmed by culture and/or by DNA sequencing. In all 3 patients, the clinical characteristics of the CSF samples were similar to those of the CSF specimens from the same patient.


## Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the role of the P1 protein kinase in diverse cellular processes such as cell differentiation, morphogenesis, development and virulence. The P1 kinase was shown to be involved in the regulation of numerous cellular morphological and molecular processes, including cell wall integrity and cytokinesis. We have found that P1 is involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell morphology, cell cycle, morphogenesis, cell division, stress response, and cell differentiation and adaptation. In addition, the P1 kinase was involved in the regulation of several stress-related genes and phagocytosis. In our study, we found that the P1 kinase is required for the control of the stress-related genes, cytokinesis and cell growth.

P1 regulates cell-cycle processes in response to environmental changes
The P1 kinase was found to be involved in the cell cycle and cell growth in response to various stresses. In addition, the P1 kinase was found to be required for the cell-cycle processes in response to various stresses. In our study, we found that P1 plays an important role in the cell-cycle processes in response to diverse environmental stresses, such as cell death and oxidative stress. The P1 kinase was found to be activated by various stress conditions, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, nitrogen starvation, oxidative stress and temperature. It was found that P1 promotes cell growth and cell death in response to various stress conditions. The P1 kinase was found to be activated by various stress conditions, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, nitrogen starvation, and temperature.
