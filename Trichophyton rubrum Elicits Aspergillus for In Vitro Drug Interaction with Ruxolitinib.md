## Abstract
The hyphal tips of Aspergillus niger, Penicillium italicum, and Microsporum gypseum form a protective coating over the cell walls of the cells. The orientation of hyphal compartments is primarily in the direction of cell division, with a major difference between A. niger and other fungal species. The orientation of hyphal compartments in the filamentous ascomycete Puccinia striiformis can affect cell wall thickness and architecture, since the hyphae are genetically and physically distinct from each other. The advantage of a genetically distinct division of cells into genetically distinct division subsets is the genetic stability and versatility they confer to their growth in different conditions.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is a major fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. C. neoformans infection is acquired by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells into the lungs, where it persists for extended periods.


## Methods

. albicans ATCC90028, C. parapsilosis ATCC22019, and C. krusei ATCC6258 were used as the control strains. The inoculum was prepared in sterile saline and inoculum density (IPD) was determined by counting colony-forming units (CFU) in a Neubauer chamber. The inoculum was diluted 1:10 and the inoculum density was adjusted to 1 × 10^3 to 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The experiment was repeated three times.

2.3. Determination of Compounds and Antibacterial Activity
To determine the antibacterial activities, the cell suspensions (1 mL) were treated with 0.5% nitric acid (NaCl) solution for 30 min, and then 100 µL of this solution was added to the suspension (10 µL of cell suspension), and then mixed with the corresponding solution of NaCl solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The aqueous solution (1 mL) was then added to the suspension (100 µL of NaCl solution), and the mixture was then mixed with 100 µL of 0.5% NaCl solution. The mixture was incubated at 35°C for 30 min and then the precipitate was removed by filtration. The dissolved organic solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure at 40°C. The concentrations of NaCl, NaCl-NaCl_2NaCl_2, and NaCl-NaCl_3NaCl_2 were determined in accordance with the DNS method [28].

2.4. Determination of Compounds and Antibacterial Activity
The antimicrobial activity was determined using a 100-µL (1 × 10^4 CFU/mL) aliquot of the cell suspensions (1 mL) was treated with 0.5% nitric acid (NaCl) solution for 30 min, and then the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed. The aqueous solution (1 mL) was then added to the suspension (100 µL of NaCl solution), and the mixture was mixed with the corresponding solution of NaCl solution. The mixture was incubated at 35°C for 30 min and then the precipitate was removed by filtration.


## Results
mucilaginosa, . coli, and other pathogens. Ruxolitinib was isolated from a clinical isolate of C. albicans, and was included in this study as the model drug for future study. Ruxolitinib was tested in vitro for its interaction with R. mucilaginosa, E. coli, and other pathogenic bacteria (Table 4) and against a panel of antifungal drugs. In the presence of R. mucilaginosa, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4). In the absence of R. mucilaginosa, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4).

In addition, in the absence of R. mucilaginosa, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4). In the presence of E. coli, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4). In the presence of E. coli, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4). In the presence of E. coli, R. mucilaginosa-ruxolitinib interactions were observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4).

## Discussion
were able to inhibit the uptake of Ruxolitinib by . mellonella (NA3-24). In addition, Aspergillus sp. was able to inhibit the uptake of Ruxolitinib by A. fumigatus (NA3-13), but not by A. terreus (NA3-13). In the present study, we found that G. mellonella is a suitable host for Aspergillus sp. to inhibit the uptake of Ruxolitinib.

The anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib was also found to be independent of the host strain used. The anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib against A. fumigatus was found to be approximately 50% dependent on the host strain used. This result suggests that the anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib is not a consequence of strain-dependent strain-dependent anti-Aspergillus activity. In contrast, the anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib against C. neoformans was approximately 25% dependent on the host strain used. This result indicates that the anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib is not a result of strain-dependent anti-Aspergillus activity.

We also found that the anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib was independent of the host strain used. The anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib against C. neoformans was approximately 80% dependent on the host strain used. This result suggests that the anti-Aspergillus activity of Ruxolitinib is not a consequence of strain-dependent strain-dependent anti-Aspergillus activity.

Aspergillus sp. is a rare fungal pathogen causing infections in humans, and is responsible for outbreaks of systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [27]. It is also a fungal infection of the skin, mucosal and soft tissues of the central nervous system (CNS), skin, urinary tract, and vagina [28]. In the current study, we found that G. mellonella is a suitable host for Aspergillus sp. to inhibit the uptake of Ruxolitinib by G. mellonella. This result suggests that G.
