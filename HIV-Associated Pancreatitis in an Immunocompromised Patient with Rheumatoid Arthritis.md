## Abstract
In this study, we investigated the potential roles of endosomal localization and DNA damage repair in the pathogenic fungus, Fusarium graminearum. To investigate the role of endosomal DNA damage repair in resistance to the agent, inactivation of repair genes, or in virulence mechanisms, RNA-dependent silencing and overexpression of the Dicer1 gene, a Dicer1-associated transcription factor, was performed. A Dicer1 silencing program, consisting of a siRNA-dependent RNAi knockdown and a constitutively-suppressed siRNA-mediated siRNA replacement, abolished the ability of F. graminearum to infect infected mice. In vivo, Dicer1-mediated silencing of the Dicer1 gene restored virulence in wild type, uninfected, or infected F. graminearum conidia. Moreover, Dicer1 silencing restored virulence in F. graminearum conidia treated with the same lethal dose of Dicer1-deficient mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Dicer1-associated machinery of fungi is involved in the interaction with the host, and we propose that mechanisms that allow fungal colonization in the host may confer susceptibility to fungal infection.


## Introduction

The most common identified risk factor for mortality from the RARE is sarcoidosi. Sarcoidosis, the commonest form of sarcoid arthritis, is characterized by the presence of cartilage in the joint surface, which is present in 30% to 50% of cases. In 20-40% of patients, the causative organism is detected in the blood and its definitive diagnosis is confirmed by culture, which usually indicates the presence of the organism in the patient's blood or the immune status of the patient's hosts.

Complications of Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the chronic or subacute inflammatory reaction to a group of medications, commonly steroids, to which the patient has been exposed to for a long time. The incidence of RA is approximately 10-30% in patients with sarcoidosis, and the majority of patients have a well-known underlying sarcoidosis [10]. In RA, the skin is the most commonly affected site and can be found on the skin of patients with RA and other immunocompromised patients, such as cancer patients, immunosuppressed patients and solid organ transplant patients [11]. There are two types of RA: acute, which is characterized by an ulcerative inflammation with loss of cartilage and fibrosis of the dermis, and chronic, which is characterized by pain, inflammation, tissue necrosis and loss of cartilage [11]. The skin and dermal tissues are the most susceptible site for the development of RA [12].

The most common sites of skin RA are the trichomes, usually in the upper part of the dermis, followed by the mesophilic areas, where the dermal is the most susceptible site [13]. In the trichomes, there are two groups: chronic and atypical skin RA. The trichomes are characterized by the presence of cartilage and fibroblast infiltration in the dermis, and the presence of cartilage and fibroblast in the skin, after the inflammatory lesions [13]. The atypical skin RA is characterized by the presence of cartilage and fibroblast infiltration in the skin, after the inflammatory lesions, and atypical skin RA is characterized by the presence of cartilage and fibroblast infiltration in the skin, after the inflammatory lesions [13].


## Methods
Sample Collection and Isolation of B. pseudomallei
Samples of P. lindemium s.l. (Friedlar #2450) were collected from Puebla, Mexico, in October 2013 and are deposited in the Collection of P. lindemium of Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Mexico. B. pseudomallei was isolated from these samples by using the method of Díaz-Matañes et al. [25] and it is deposited in the Microbiology Department of the College of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Mexico. B. pseudomallei was isolated from a small portion of the sample by using the method of Almeida-Cabrera et al. [26] and is deposited in the Mycological Culture Collection of the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Mexico.

In this study, 10 samples were taken from Puebla, Mexico. The culture was cultivated on PDA for 3-4 days. The mycelia were extracted with a solution of methanol and then dried in an oven at 80 °C. The dried mycelia were then weighed and divided by the sample and the total weight was calculated.


## Results
. Obtained Duplicate Chromosomal DNA in a One-Year Study
In a one-year study, 13.3% of the libraries were sequenced and assembled into 2,000,000 reads. The coverage of the 4,890-nucleotide alignment (Table 2) was 55.3% (95% CI: 16.


## Discussion
However, we did not identify any difference in either patient’s CD4+ lymphocyte counts or CD8+ lymphocyte counts between the two case. The only finding we did identify was an increase in CD4+ lymphocyte counts in the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RAr), consistent with a previous report that did not identify any difference in CD8+ lymphocyte counts between the two patients [15].

While the number of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis increased with increased immunological and therapeutic doses of steroids, the number of cases remained relatively constant in the present study. Of the 13 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and 12 patients with CD4+ lymphocytopenia, 3 patients were treated with steroids at least once during the study period (Table 2). Although this patient was immunocompromised, he was treated with steroids for the rest of the study period (Table 2). These cases were also found to be immunocompromised, with 4 patients receiving steroids for the rest of the study period (Table 2). As seen with other chronic inflammatory diseases, the amount of therapy required to achieve a breakthrough infection may be low [16]. In addition, the severity of disease may vary between individuals, and the severity of disease may vary by multiple factors, including the severity of disease itself, the severity of infection itself, and the duration of steroid therapy [16].

A large proportion of patients were not on therapy at the time of diagnosis, which may have contributed to the limited number of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Although not statistically significant, there was a significant difference in the percentage of patients who were on therapy between the two cases (Table 2). This discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the study period was an observational study, and no study was conducted in a randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, while the study is a single-center, the number of patients in a single center may not be representative of all patients, as a single patient may be treated for a certain disease and not for another. Therefore, the incidence of patients receiving steroids may not be representative of all patients, and the possibility of subclinical infection is present in patients receiving steroids [17].

The presence of anti-inflammatory medication was not significantly associated with the incidence of Rheumatoid Arthritis, but it was associated with the occurrence of T cell lymphoma.
