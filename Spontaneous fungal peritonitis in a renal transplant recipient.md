## Abstract
Citrus ginseng (C. ginseng) is a popular Indian medicine and popular food with millions of people worldwide.


## Introduction
The genus Acanthamoeba is characterized by the production of acanthamoebaourtidiopsis (AAC) (the ‘pepperhead’ fungus), which causes browning and bleaching of woody material in semiarid areas (Hirakawa et al., 2009; Koehler et al.


## Methods
Briefly, five patients with acute acute renal failure (ASD) were excluded from the stud. The diagnosis of ASD was made based on the clinical findings and the histological assessment of the patients. A total of 60 patients with acute acute renal failure were selected for the study. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the laboratory tests of the samples were included in the study. All of the patients were admitted to the hospital. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: age, sex, race, origin, chronic kidney disease, renal disease, age, underlying diseases, history of chronic kidney disease, renal transplantation, renal transplantation, nephrotoxicity, positive blood culture, positive culture, negative blood culture, negative blood culture, negative serum, positive serum, positive urine, positive culture, negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and negative CSF.

Blood culture and blood smear
The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The blood cultures were performed by a lumbar perfusion technique using a sterile glass needle and allowed to cool to room temperature. The serum was obtained from the donor by centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 10 min. The plasma was obtained by negative staining with anti-BSA [100 µg/mL stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)] and then stored at -70°C until use. The procedure was performed with a BD Bioscience Bioscience System, Germany.

Statistical analysis
The categorical variables were as follows: age, sex, race, origin, underlying diseases, kidney disease, blood culture, positive serum, positive urine, positive CSF and negative CSF. The continuous variables were as follows: age, sex, origin, underlying diseases, blood culture, positive serum and negative serum. The categorical variables were as follows: kidney disease, blood culture, positive serum and negative serum, hematological status, hematological condition and renal transplantation. The categorical variables were as follows: age, sex, origin, underlying diseases, renal transplantation. The categorical variables were as follows: kidney disease, urine, positive CSF and negative serum. The categorical variables were as follows: blood culture, positive serum and negative serum. The categorical variables were as follows: urinalysis, positive serum and negative serum, positive CSF and negative CSF.


## Results
Experimental design
To investigate the possible role of T. marneffei in C.


## Discussion
A recent case report of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in a renal transplant recipient (28) who had a history of NTM infection was a high-risk cas. In this patient, the patient had a history of NTM infection. The patient was immunocompetent, had no history of NTM infection, and had received a lipid-based therapy for NTM infection. The patient's serum and CSF CSA was CSA, which was also found to be increased in the initial stages of NTM infection. The patient had a history of NTM infection and a negative CD4 count. The patient had a negative test for HIV-1 RNA. The patient had a history of NTM infection and a positive serum CSA. The patient had a history of NTM infection and a negative CSF Cr. The patient had a positive blood culture.

As with all infectious diseases, there is a risk for infection by NTM. Patients with NTM infection typically present with symptoms of meningeal inflammation, fatigue, hemoptysis, seizures, and a mixed infection pattern. In addition, NTM infections may occur in patients with other infectious diseases. These infectious diseases may present with subtle symptoms of meningeal inflammation and hemoptysis, or may present as a mixed infection pattern. Patients with NTM infection typically present with severe headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, and neck stiffness without symptoms. Patients with NTM infection may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome and alveolar sepsis. The patient was a former smoker. The patient had a history of NTM infection.
