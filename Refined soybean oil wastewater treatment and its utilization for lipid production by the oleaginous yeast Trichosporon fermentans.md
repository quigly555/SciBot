## Abstract
Urease is a virulence factor in Aspergillus fumigatus that plays an important role in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompromised patients. Urease activity is essential for the fungus to invade and colonize the lungs and pharynx, and for virulence in other fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified and characterized the Urease-E3 gene, and studied its role in Aspergillus fumigatus virulence.


## Introduction
The microbial flora of the wastewater treatment plant is influenced by the various chemicals and their mechanism. The presence of antibiotics and their activity against C. albicans was shown to be important for the growth of the fungus. In addition, there are examples of resistance to antibiotics in some strains of bacteria, fungi and parasites [9-12]. Among the factors contributing to resistance to drugs, among them are the production of antibiotics and other antifungal compounds, like the production of peptidases, of which there are examples of resistance to drugs by Cryptococcus neoformans [13].

The production of antibiotics by different bacteria has become a great challenge due to the resistance to antibiotics and the high metabolic costs of the bacteria to antibiotics. In addition, the use of antibiotics has become a public health problem. The global burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has been estimated at 23 million deaths per year [14], and the global prescription for antibiotics by the World Health Organization is 8.3 billion pills [15]. This poses a big threat to the world health because of the antibiotic use. Thus, in the fight against this infectious pathogen, it is essential that we understand the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

Some reports have shown that the use of antibiotics is associated with changes in the microbial community of the wastewater treatment plant [16]. Microbial community analysis showed that there is a predominance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the wastewater treatment plant [17], and the presence of the most abundant Cladosporium species was correlated with the activity of the antibacterial drugs. The concentration of antibiotics used in the wastewater treatment plant is dependent on various environmental conditions [18]. The concentration of antibiotics used in the wastewater treatment plant is not always a good indicator of the microbial community and the activity of antibiotics. For example, the concentration of antibiotics used in the wastewater treatment plant was found to be higher than the equivalent concentration of standard wastewater [19].

In addition, the use of antibiotics has been shown to have a negative impact on the quality of the wastewater treatment plant [20]. In order to overcome the negative impact of antibiotics, the wastewater treatment plant should be equipped with high-quality water, a good water and a good wastewater treatment system [21,22]. The main factors that lead to the growth of resistant bacteria in the wastewater treatment plant include the microbial diversity, the activity of antibiotics, and the route of administration of antibiotics.


## Methods
[23. The method was based on the optimization of the oleaginous phyllosphere as a non-fluorescent source of lipids. Briefly, the aqueous phase (0.3% w/w) was incubated at 20 Â°C with 4% CO_2. The aqueous phase containing the lipid-rich oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans was washed twice with 0.1% w/w NaCl and once with 0.1% w/w Tween 20. The aqueous phase containing the lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans was washed twice with 0.1% w/w NaCl and once with 0.1% w/w Tween 20. The aqueous phase containing the lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans was washed twice with 0.1% w/w NaCl and once with 0.1% w/w Tween 20. The lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans was resuspended in 0.1% w/w KOH, and the lipids were extracted with 0.1% w/w KOH. The lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans was dried by evaporation and weighed. The lipid content was calculated according to the following formula:

2.3. Analysis of Phytochemical Characteristics
The fungal lipid profile was compared with that of the non-fungal lipid content by assessing the ability of the lipid-rich lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans to degrade wood and other substrates, while to enhance the cellulose or other substrates. The lipid-rich Trichosporon fermentans was divided into three groups: The solid phase consisted of 0.6% w/w KOH, 0.2% w/w KOH, 0.02% w/w Tween 20, and the non-fluorescent phase (0.6% w/w KOH, 0.02% w/w Tween 20) consisted of 0.05% w/w KOH, 0.01% w/w KOH, 0.05% w/w Tween 20, and 0.01% w/w Tween 20. The solid phase consisted of 0.6% w/w KOH, 0.2% w/w KOH, 0.


## Results
The oil treatment resulted in the production of significantly higher concentrations of total total fatty acids (t_50 = 1.4, p < 0.01), compared to the untreated wastewater (t_50 = 11.3, p < 0.01), with a decrease in the maximum concentration of oleic acid, which reached to 12.1 mg/L (3.4 g/L). Oleic acid content of the oil treated wastewater was similar to the untreated wastewater, but the concentration of oleic acid increased to 23.7 mg/L (3.4 g/L) (p < 0.01), which was significantly lower than that of the control (7.4 mg/L), which was produced by the same oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans and Trichosporon pseudolae.


## Discussion
These results indicated that oleaginous yeasts and their biomass had potential for cultivation on organic oil. In addition, the use of a potential oleaginous yeast for lipid production by oleaginous yeasts and their biofuel production has been well-documented for other oleaginous yeasts (reviewed in [54]) [55].

The utilization of biofuel by oleaginous yeast is a practical and cost effective strategy for biodiesel production. This strategy is now being reported for the oleaginous yeasts and their bioprocessing strategy for biodiesel production [56]. In our study, the utilization of biofuel by oleaginous yeast was associated with the utilization of ethanol, lipids, and esters. The utilization of lipids was a direct result of the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. In our study, the use of cellulose, a common type of carbon and nitrogen source, was one of the key components. However, the use of lipids was not required for oleaginous yeasts. This could be because of the difficulties in obtaining cellulose from other sources such as ethanol. Cellobiose is considered to be the main carbon source for the biomass and in oleaginous yeasts, the use of cellulose is a major component of the biomass. This is an alternative to cellulose as a carbon source for lipid production [57].
