## Abstract
Highly conserved, Pichia pastoris is a yeast that is considered to be the primary inocula for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. P. pastoris strains isolated from different clinical and environmental sources in the USA, Europe, and North America have been studied for their ability to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have been considered to be a major source of resistance. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies reporting the genetic and phenotypic consequences of P. pastoris infection.

We studied the genomes of eight P. pastoris strains from clinical and environmental sources to determine their P. pastoris infection gene copy number and phenotypic characteristics. We found that these P. pastoris strains were resistant to antibiotics, exhibited a high frequency of drug resistance mutations, and were resistant to UV-induced bactericidal activity. Although the phenotypic and virulence factors for P. pastoris were identical among clinical and environmental isolates, our data suggest that P. pastoris infection may be carried by multiple genetically distinct genotypes of the same strain. The genomes of the isolates differed from each other by up to 30-fold in several phenotypic and virulence factors. These results suggest that the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of P. pastoris strain may contribute to the genetic variability of clinical and environmental isolates of this model.


## Introduction
2017; Park et a. 2018; Wijayawardene et al. 2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel antifungal agents that are effective against A. fumigatus.

More than 300 known antifungal compounds have been described in the literature, including the synthetic chemical class (polymyxin, vincristine, myristoylurean, miconazole, and clotrimazole) (Lombard et al. 2012; Munoz et al. 2013; Szyman and Feldmesser 2016; Asplund et al. 2017; Willger et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017) and the amino acid based chemical class (terpinen-3-ol) (Hess et al. 2010). With the development of new antifungal drugs, the development of new classes of antifungal agents is becoming more demanding (Dignani et al. 2016; Deveau et al. 2015). As an example, it is well known that the azole derivatives, such as fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and echinocandins, can induce a phase I IFNa-dependent mechanism (Andersson and Kolter 2014; Deveau et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017). These compounds are highly active against A. fumigatus and can be applied as antifungal drugs in the treatment of fungal infections (Fisher et al. 2015; Fones et al. 2016).

One of the main problems in antifungal therapy is the resistance of the fungal species to the current antifungal drugs (Kaur et al. 2017; Esher et al. 2018). In the past few years, increasing evidence has emerged that the resistance of A. fumigatus to some of the existing antifungals is due to a combination of chemical and physical factors (Hoffmøller et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2017).


## Methods
 2017. The phytochemical and the physiological profile of the yeast strains was assessed by the Aspergillus Alveolata Database (Aspergillus Fumigatus and Fusarium graminearum, unpublished data). The microbial growth was measured by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) at the end of the growth phase by using a spectrophotometer (Biotek, Shanghai, China). The DNA content was calculated by the method of the Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Seoul, Korea) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Microbial growth was evaluated by gravimetric method using the dilution method according to the methodology of Zhang et al. (2016). The microbial growth was calculated by dilution factor (F) and was expressed as a percentage of the initial growth rate. The fermentations were classified as “vegetative” if the biomass was greater than 10% and as “no growth” if the biomass was less than 10%.

2.3. Fungal Growth Measurements
The yeast strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C for 24 h. The mycelium was harvested and extracted with chloroform and ethanol, respectively, and extracted with hexane. The extracts were then subjected to temperature- and pressure-dependent reduction of the phenolic compounds. The analysis of the samples was performed using a TCS-Orbitrap XL analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The analysis of the extracts was performed on a 10% agarose gel at 100 V for 60 min. The bands were visualized using the Gel-Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

2.4. In Vitro Antifungal Activity Assays
The in vitro antifungal activity of the purified fungi was determined using the broth microdilution method as described previously (Murdoch et al., 2015). The in vitro antifungal activity of the compounds against the yeast strains was determined using the C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. glabrata ATCC 700272. The in vitro antifungal activity of the compounds against the yeast strains was determined using the R. solani S. aureus strain and the C.


## Results

In vitro, the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain was found to be very potent against the Aspergillus strain, with a MIC of 100 µg/mL against the Aspergillus fumigatus strain, with a Q/M of 3.5. The antifungal activity of the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain was demonstrated by the MIC_50 and MIC_90 values for the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain, as well as the combination of the two, using the MIC_90 values of the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain. The results showed that the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain was more potent than that of the Aspergillus strain (MIC_50 = 1 µg/mL) and the combination of the two, using the MIC_90 values of the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain.

The chemical composition of the essential oil of Aspergillus fumigatus strain and Aspergillus strain strains was determined. The essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain was highly concentrated and had a strong antifungal activity against all strains tested. The essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain showed moderate to strong antifungal activity against all strains tested, and the combination of the two, using the MIC_90 values of the essential oil of Aspergillus fumigatus strain, showed a strong synergistic activity (MIC_90 = 100 µg/mL).

The antifungal activity of the essential oil of Aspergillus fumigatus strain was also evaluated. The MIC_90 values of the essential oil of the Aspergillus fumigatus strain were calculated, using the combination of the two, using the MIC_90 values of the essential oil of Aspergillus fumigatus strain. The combination of the two, using the MIC_90 values of Aspergillus fumigatus strain, showed a strong synergistic activity (MIC_90 = 100 µg/mL).


## Discussion
 2013.

In our patient, the only antibiotic that was in the patient’s system, amoxicillin, was used in the initial stages of treatment. However, within 24 h, the antibiotic was discontinued. As a result of this, the patient’s symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, were relieved. The symptoms were resolved within 48 h of commencement of antibiotics treatment.

The treatment for Fusarium graminearum, an invasive fungal infection causing bloodstream infections, was very effective, although this agent was not available in the patient’s system. Although the patient was already treated with amoxicillin, the antibiotics were stopped and the patient’s symptoms were relieved. The patient was discharged from hospital with a full recovery and was treated for Fusarium graminearum with amoxicillin. The patient’s symptoms were resolved and the patient was discharged with a complete recovery. The patient was treated with chloramphenicol, followed by an antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin. The patient’s symptoms improved and the patient was discharged with a complete recovery. The patient was treated with amoxicillin for a short period of time before the clinical picture was changed to a headache and fever. The patient was discharged with a complete recovery and was treated with chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. The patient was discharged from hospital with a complete recovery and the patient was discharged with a complete recovery and a negative response to the antibiotics.

Further investigation revealed that the patient had an underlying condition similar to that of the other reported cases. The patient had undergone a series of surgical procedures and the patient had a favorable response to the initial antibiotic therapy. However, the patient’s symptoms were resolved within 48 h of the start of antibiotics treatment. This indicated that the patient had a weak or no response to the initial antibiotics treatment. The patient’s response to the initial antibiotics treatment was not good, and the patient’s symptoms improved and the patient was discharged with a complete recovery. The patient was discharged with a complete recovery and the patient was discharged with a complete response to the initial antibiotics treatment. The patient was discharged with a complete recovery and the patient was discharged with a complete response to the initial antibiotics treatment.

The patient was treated with chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin, followed by a short course of amoxicillin.
