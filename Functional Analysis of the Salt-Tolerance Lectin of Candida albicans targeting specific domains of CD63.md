## Abstract
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil-borne fungi that inhabit diverse crop, human and animal hosts. Their interactions with the host and the fungus are crucial for both genome and ecology analyses of these organisms. AMF are able to turn their biomassy material composition to a reddened, liquefied and/or hydrolyzed state, which in this case indicates their high-elevation lifestyle. In addition to their remarkable capacity to thrive in hostile environments, their life style and mating systems have also been suggested to be prominent drivers of their ecological success. Here we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms of interaction of AMF with their hosts, the fact that the filamentous form is also the main microbial-synthetic hub of many plant-fungus networks and the existence of many eukaryotic life strategies that involve the possible utilization of biomassy material by both fungal and host cells.


## Introduction
The silk proteins are identified by conserved proteins that consist of different domain. In this case, the antigenic domains of the CD63 proteins are presented to the CD63 using a synthetic ligand, and they are recognized by the proteins by binding to specific sites on the surface of the protein. The silk protein is degraded in the presence of various ligands, and the protein is then transported by the cell to the extracellular space. The CD63 proteins are expressed on a variety of cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, epithelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and eosinophils [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38]. The CD63 proteins are also expressed in different cell types and tissues, including spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and testis [31,32,33,34,35,38,39]. Furthermore, CD63 proteins are expressed in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) lectin, a human surface protein that binds to the surface of extracellular microbes and secreting large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [31,32,33,35,36,39].

In addition to antimicrobial activities, the CD63 proteins are also associated with the transcriptional regulation of other cellular processes, such as the differentiation of resistant strains, and the induction of virulence factor expression [39,40]. This review will explore the biological functions of the CD63 proteins, focusing on the action of these proteins on the immune system, and on their role in the inflammatory response.

CD63 proteins are expressed in diverse cells, and they are recognized by different receptors. These receptors include Toll like receptors (TLRs), CD63D, and various surface proteins that bind TLRs, CD63D and TLR2. CD63D is expressed on macrophages, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. CD63D is expressed on fibroblasts and macrophages, and it is responsible for their fibrosis. CD63D is involved in the control of inflammatory response, and the recognition of inflammatory cells by the host is important in the control of microbial infection. In this review, we will discuss the role of CD63D in the control of microbial infection.


## Methods
albicans (. lectin, reference 4) was chosen as a candidate antigenic molecule to evaluate the effect of the salt on the growth of the fungal cells. In brief, 1 µL of the filtered serially diluted (SDS) sera of C. albicans at a concentration of 1 × 10^6/mL were added to 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The plates were then washed with PBS and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscope, Oberkochen, Germany). The inhibition of growth of the cells was measured as the rate of decrease in absorbance at 540 nm/h.

For the comparison of the MIC of the salt and the antifungal compounds, a well-preserved fraction of the cell culture supernatant (100 µL) was inoculated into a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The wells were washed with PBS and the assay of the MIC was performed as previously described (Sambrook et al., 2017b). The MIC of the antifungal compounds was evaluated by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm/h. In order to evaluate the antifungal effect of the salt, a well-preserved fraction of the cell culture supernatant (100 µL) was also inoculated into a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The plate was washed with PBS and the assay of the MIC was performed as previously described (Sambrook et al., 2017a). The MIC of the antifungal compounds was evaluated by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm/h. In this study, the antifungal effect of the salt was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm/h. In order to evaluate the antifungal effect of the antifungal compounds, a well-preserved fraction of the cell culture supernatant (100 µL) was also inoculated into a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.


## Results
albicans strains, the specific proteins were immunoprecipitated from various cultures of . albicans and analyzed by anti-CD63 antibodies. After antifungal susceptibility testing, the purified CD63-, CD62E-, CD62E- and CD63E-resistant C. albicans strains were identified as CD63E^+ and CD63E^- (Figure 3). The survival curves of the CD63E^+ and CD63E^- strains were similar to those of the clinical isolates (Figure 3). The CD63E^+ strain was most resistant to antifungal agents, with the log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml. The CD63E^- strain was more susceptible to antifungal agents, with log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml. The log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml was the same for all other test isolates.

The ability of the CD63E^+ strain to survive in the blood was examined by blood culture (Figure 4). The CD63E^+ strain had a log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml. The CD63E^- strain was more resistant to antifungal agents than the clinical isolate (log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml). The log_10 CFU of the isolate in the log_10 CFU range of 0.06-5.0 log_10 CFU/ml was the same for all other test isolates.


## Discussion
In fact, in . albicans, CD63 is also required for the growth and survival of the yeast and hyphal forms [40], and in C. dubliniensis, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strain, CD63 is required for the cellular response to infection with C. albicans [41]. The CD63-dependent lectin CD63 is the major enzyme required for the expression of CD63 in fungi, and the lectin CD63 is also a critical element of the recognition of fungal antigens [42]. The CD63-dependent lectin CD63 is required for the recognition of fungal antigens and the formation of hyphal structures, and the cytokine response is important for the initiation of the immune response [42].

Our findings indicate that the lectin CD63 is involved in the recognition of Candida antigens. The lectin CD63 plays a crucial role in the immune response to C. albicans, and it is activated to a similar extent as CD63-Cg [42]. The lectin CD63 is a key component of the immune response to C. albicans and its function is critical for the cell defense against the infection and virulence of the pathogen [43]. The lectin CD63 is also involved in the recognition of human and plant antigens, including fungal antigens [44]. Our results suggest that CD63 is involved in the recognition of antigens in C. albicans and its function is crucial for the cell response to C. albicans infection.

The lectin CD63 is required for the development of hyphal structures and the immune response to C. albicans [42]. Our results also suggest that CD63 is involved in the recognition of antigens in C. albicans and its function is critical for the cell response to C. albicans infection.
