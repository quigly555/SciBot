## Abstract
Marine organisms are able to form biofilms on rubber seals on many industrial and pharmaceutical products. Marine bacteria are able to form biofilms because they are able to grow in multiple environments at the same time.


## Introduction
The family of Aspergillus fumigatus (Aspergillus nidulans, A. nidulans var. nidulans, and A. nidulans var. gattii) is a heterotrophic fungal group with a range of infecting ascomycetes. These fungi can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), a lethal disease with high mortality (up to 70% [1, 2]) (2, 3). IPA is a well-known cause of human morbidity and mortality (4). The incidence of IPA is relatively low, and its prevalence has been low to date. IPA has a worldwide distribution, with a high incidence in the northern part of the world. The most prevalent IPA-causing species are A. fumigatus and A. niger, which occur in the air and soil of approximately 70 countries, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. The major groups of IPA-causing species are: A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus (5, 26, 27). The global A. nidulans population is estimated to be ca. 20,000 (28). The global incidence of IPA is 0.68 cases per million inhabitants per year (29). A. flavus and A. niger are the most common IPA-causing species (2, 25). However, other Aspergillus species such as A. niger and A. nidulans, as well as A. oryzae, A. nidulans var. oryzae, A. nidulans var. nidulans, and A. nidulans var. gattii are increasingly recognized as causes of IPA (25, 27).

The genus Aspergillus is divided into two subgenera (A. nidulans and A. nidulans) (30) and the cryptic species A. nidulans, A.


## Methods
Study population
We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with HIV-1 positive blood cultures from March 2011 to December 2015. We retrospectively assessed medical records of all patients and controls with a primary outcome outcome: central nervous system (CNS) findings. Our primary outcome was CNS findings. We used descriptive statistics to identify potential laboratory-based variables. Continuous variables were summarized as the mean Â± standard deviation. The clinical characteristics of the cases and controls are described in Table 1. All of the patients were randomly assigned to four groups: the HIV-1 positive blood cultures (5), the control (5), the positive blood cultures from the central nervous system (CNS), and a second group of patients who were HIV-negative and were randomized to two groups of HIV-1 positive blood cultures, as previously described (18).

Statistical analysis
The influence of the central nervous system on HIV-1 status was tested by the Mantel-Haenszel test with a cut-off of p<0.05 considered clinically relevant. We also tested for significance using two-tailed t-test. For the HIV-1 negative blood cultures, we analyzed the difference in CD4^+ T-cell count between the control and the positive blood cultures. We performed a log-rank test for the comparison between the two groups using the SPSS version 20 software.

We evaluated the outcome of the study by two-sided P-values. The antiretroviral therapy was considered as a positive control, and the outcome of the study by a two-sided P-value of =0.01 was considered as a significant value.

Statistical analysis
The difference in the CD4^+ T-cell counts between the positive blood cultures and the negative blood cultures was determined by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a cut-off of p<0.05 considered clinically relevant.


## Results
A majority of patients were reported to have a high CD4+ count (n = 40) and had a high percentage of IFN-<U+03B3>-producing cells (n = 30. The characteristics of the patients with high CD4+ count were similar to those of the patients with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies. The rate of IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells was lower in patients with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies than in those with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies (95% CI: 95% to 100%; P = 0.05; Table 2).

A comparison of IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells (10^8 cells/ml) in the pulmonary compartment showed that, in comparison with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies, patients with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies produced more IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells (10^4 cells/ml) (Table 2).

The lung pathology was confirmed by microscopy and CSF culture in six patients (Table 3). The samples were from the lungs of four patients with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies. Four of the six patients were missing in the lung pathology. The remaining six patients were confirmed to have CSF culture positive for HIV-1. The CSF culture samples were from the lungs of four patients with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies. Five of these patients were missing in the CSF culture samples. The remaining six patients were confirmed to have HIV-1.

The patient with anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibodies was diagnosed as a recent HIV-positive patient with a history of pulmonary cryptococcosis, and the patient was reported to have a high CD4+ count. The patient had a history of pulmonary cryptococcosis and cryptococcal antigen testing. The patient had a history of being on antiretroviral therapy for pulmonary cryptococcosis.


## Discussion
The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis is challenging and often requires a culture or serolog. A single case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a patient with an anti-interferon-<U+03B3> autoantibody has been described in a patient with hematologic malignancies (64). The patient presented to the center was HIV-uninfected and had not been exposed to HIV. However, his skin biopsy suggested that the fungus was caused by Cryptococcus species. The patient had a history of multiple bacterial infections and pulmonary cryptococcosis. He had a history of HIV. The patient had no prior history of pulmonary cryptococcosis.

Cryptococcus species is the most common cause of pulmonary cryptococcosis in HIV-uninfected patients. The most common cause of disseminated disease (CVD) is pulmonary cryptococcosis (65). Most patients with disseminated disease do not develop cryptococcosis due to the involvement of the respiratory tract (65). Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of disseminated disease (D), while Cryptococcus gattii is the most common causative organism (66). Both C. neoformans and C. gattii are commonly found in HIV patients. The majority of patients with disseminated disease have a history of HIV. Most cases of cryptococcosis occur in immunocompromised individuals. The most common patient in HIV-uninfected patients is a patient with HIV who has previously been exposed to corticosteroid therapy (67). The patient presented with a history of corticosteroid therapy and was treated with fluconazole for 6 months. He had no history of corticosteroid therapy or HIV. In a case of pulmonary cryptococcosis, the patient had been exposed to corticosteroids for 6 months prior to the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis.

In our patient, the patient was HIV-uninfected and had not been exposed to corticosteroid therapy. The patient had a history of HIV and had not been exposed to corticosteroid therapy. He had no history of HIV. The patient had a history of HIV and was exposed to corticosteroids for 6 months prior to the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis.

The most common site of infection for cryptococcal infection is the respiratory tract.
