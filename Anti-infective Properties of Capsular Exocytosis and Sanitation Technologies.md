## Abstract
In the last few decades, the number of reported fungal infections has increased. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with these infections and to determine the influence of different intervention regimens on the outcome.

All patients enrolled in this study were enrolled for this study. The patients were mostly male (36.5%) and the mean age was 49.8 years old. The study was cross-sectional in design. No male patients were recruited. No female patients presented. The main risk factors for infection were self-reported or reported hypothyroidism.


## Introduction
 2011. Although the majority of cryptococcal infections are caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii, and Cryptococcus tetragattii, non-neoformans species such as Cryptococcus laurentii, Cryptococcus albidus, Cryptococcus porosanus, and Cryptococcus floricola have also been reported to be involved in infections (Bork et al., 2005; Goh and Goh, 2010). In contrast, Cryptococcus tetragattii and Cryptococcus tetragattii have been reported to be associated with mostly superficial infections such as mucocutaneous infections and cutaneous infections (Diaz and Boroujerdi, 2008; Miller et al., 2011; Hoeghae-Robben et al., 2012; Thangamani et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013; Bezerra et al., 2014; Wijayawardene et al., 2015). In addition to these clinical characteristics, C. tetragattii has been reported to be more virulent in a mouse model of disseminated infection than C. neoformans (Miller et al., 2011), indicating that C. tetragattii is capable of producing a complex array of infectious mediators.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of the presence of different antifungal agents on the bioavailability of various bioactive compounds from the capsule of C. tetragattii. For example, the presence or absence of two or more antifungal agents was selected in this study because this is the most commonly used study for this purpose. Bioactive compounds were tested in a murine inhalation model of pulmonary infection and in vitro infection models of human bronchoalveolar lavage (HAL) and alveolar macrophages. The bioavailability of the antifungal compounds was determined by the following principle: the concentration of the compounds in the serum and the concentrations of the bioactive compounds in the serum of the mice administered orally. The concentrations of the bioactive compounds that were present in the serum and/or serum were analyzed in order to determine their concentration in the serum and/or the serum of the mice administered orally.

## Results
reported the involvement of the fungal cell-surface proteome in fungal infection and fungal chemotaxis [37. Capsular exocytosis is associated with pathogenicity and chemotaxis and thus may be used to manage microbial infections, such as COPD and COPD-induced pulmonary infection [38]. The capsule and exocytosis properties of Capsular exocytosis are usually associated with the two major classes of fungal chemotactic molecules, DIP-amino-bisphosphate dehydrogenase (ADH), and CXCL10 [39,40]. The extracellular catabolite and secreted metabolites of Capsular exocytosis have been shown to be critical for fungal pathogenesis [41]. The capsule is not an extracellular molecule and is metabolized by cell surface proteases and enzymes that are involved in the degradation of extracellular proteins in fungi and plants [42,43]. Capsular exocytosis is reported to be associated with high sensitivity to cell wall perturbing agents such as SDS and CFW [44,45]. In addition, the fungal cell wall may contain multigene complexes, which are similar to those for extracellular membranes and have been shown to be involved in fungal virulence in human host [46-48].

The Capsular exocytosis properties of the extracts are shown in Figure 3 and in Table 1. The extracts are the main components of the capsule and exocytosis. The capsule and exocytosis properties of the extracts are shown in Table 1. The C. albicans extract was found to be the most active and the anti-cryptococcal extract the least active. The major antioxidant enzyme was found to be CXCL10. A less active inhibitor of enzymes of the cell wall proteome, CXCL10, was found to be the most active extract.

Effect of Capsular Exocytosis on Cytokine Production in P. aeruginosa
The effect of Capsular exocytosis on the production of cytokine metabolites in P. aeruginosa was determined by the following standard criteria: total cell lysates, secretions, and the concentration of any cytokine metabolites. The concentration of any cytokine metabolites was determined at 1 Ã— 10^5 cells/ml.


## Discussion
albicans is well known [34. In our previous study, it was demonstrated that in vitro C. albicans secretes a cytotoxic compound [36]. In our current study, we showed that C. albicans secretes a high number of toxic compound in its secretome [37]. The concentration of the toxic compound in the secretome of C. albicans was studied for several months (from 14 days to 180 days). The cytotoxicity was studied in vitro and in vivo (Table 3). The results showed that the total cytotoxicity of C. albicans cells was in the range of 0.08 to 2.1 mg/mL (Table 3). In our current study, the toxic compound concentration in C. albicans cells was in the range of 0.06 to 9 mg/mL. Our current study was also in accordance with previous study in which the cytotoxicity of C. albicans was in the range of 0.06 to 1.2 mg/mL [38].

In addition to the cytotoxicity of C. albicans, other cytotoxic compounds are also present in the secretome of C. albicans. The most prominent is the polyketide, cetiramer, which is an antifungal agent, as well as the polyketide, methylprednisolone, which is an antifungal agent [39]. Another class of toxic compounds is the alcohol, methylglyoxal, and alcohol derivatives. The most prominent example of these compounds is the alcohol derivative of the alcohol derivative of ethanol. In our study, the toxic compound was the alcohol derivative of alcohol (alcohol derivative of alcohol). The chemical structure of alcohol derivatives were studied and the results showed that the alcohol derivative of ethanol contains a number of hydrogens, alcohol esters, alcohol hydroxyl, alcohol alcohol, and alcohol esters. This compound was also detected in the cytotoxicity of C. albicans cells. However, no C. albicans cells showed any cytotoxic activity (Table 3). This is the first study that demonstrates that the toxic compound was not present in the secretome of C. albicans and that the cytotoxicity of C. albicans was not a result of the toxic compound.
