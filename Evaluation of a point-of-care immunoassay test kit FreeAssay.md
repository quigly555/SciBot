## Abstract
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is the second cause of invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. In this study, we discovered that hygromyalgia (H) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients have increased susceptibility to cryptococcosis. We hypothesized that a C. glabrata-derived peptide with broad spectrum antifungal activity would promote this evolution. In addition, we tested the antifungal activity of this fungal species in vitro against two yeast strains, Cryptococcus neoformans (VG20) and Candida albicans (CG14) in a murine model. The antifungal activity of CG14 was found to be higher than that of H and CLL patients. We found that CG14 was also more effective than H and CLL in inducing the expression of the down-regulated protein kinase C subunit (PKC), a major effector cytokine. Furthermore, CG14 was found to induce the TNF-a and IL-6 cytokines more effectively in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that CG14 is a potential new antifungal candidate for improving treatment efficacy and attenuation efficiency of C. glabrata infection.


## Introduction
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger is used in the pharmaceutical industry for the treatment of various diseases, including respiratory infections, dermatoses, osteoarthritis, and hypertension [1]. However, in recent years, a number of factors have contributed to the development of Aspergillus infections, including the growing number of immunocompromised patients, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and the recent shift to high-dose therapy of corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents [2]. This shift in disease pathogenesis has created a need for new and effective antifungal agents to combat the growing number of immunosuppressive disorders. In addition, novel antifungal agents have the potential to inhibit fungal growth and/or to cause death from aspergillosis.

Fluconazole (FLU) is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used as a first-line therapy against Aspergillus infections [3]. It has been shown to have excellent activity against a large number of fungal species including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. parasiticus, all of which can cause life-threatening invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [4]. It is also active against a large number of non-albicans species, including Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and non-albicans species of Candida and Aspergillus [5].


## Methods
For CD4^+ T cells, the cells were stimulated with .5 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at the 4th, 9th, 12th, and 14th day of immunization. For CD3^+ T cells, the cells were stimulated with 1.5 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at the 3rd, 8th, and 14th day of immunization. The cells were incubated with anti-CD11b^+ T cells (BD Bioscience, USA) at the 4th, 10th, and 14th day of immunization. The cells were infected with human herpesvirus (H. capsulatum) (H-H. capsulatum; ATCC 25922, USA), followed by culturing at 37 °C for 7 days. The nuclei of infected macrophages were harvested and the total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the purity of the extracted RNA was measured at 260 nm using Nano-Drop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). The concentrations of the samples were 10^2-10^4 cfu/ml.

H. capsulatum ATCC 25922 was used as a positive control for the detection of H. capsulatum specific IgG1 and IgG2a.


## Results
Experimental design
Six fluconazole-resistant isolates, including the previously identified isolate of E. coli, were isolated from two different compartments of the upper respiratory tract. After three days of incubation at 37°C, all isolates grew as well as the isolate obtained from the upper respiratory tract of the clinical patient (Figure 1).

Antibiotic resistance
The growth rate of E. coli was not significantly different between the two clinical isolates from the upper respiratory tract, and the growth of the E. coli strain was not significantly different between the two isolates from the upper respiratory tract of the clinical patient (Figure 2). However, the growth of the E. coli strain was significantly different between the two isolates from the upper respiratory tract of the clinical patient (Figure 2).

During the course of the experiment, the E. coli strain was resistant to all antibiotics tested, including fluconazole and voriconazole (Table 2). No significant differences in resistance were observed between the clinical isolates of E. coli and the E. coli strain from the upper respiratory tract of the clinical patient (Table 2).

## Discussion
5, was performed in 96 patients with a median time to diagnosis of CM with a positive serum CrAg LFA for C. The HIV-1 RNA-negative patients had a median time to diagnosis of CM with a CrAg LFA of 23 days, while the HIV-1-infected patients had a median of 35 days. In our study, CrAg screening was performed in 11 of the 12 patients with CM. In a study by Garcia-Santana et al. [8], the results of CrAg screening were only performed in one patient. In a study by Lahiri et al. [9], the CrAg screening was only performed in two patients. In our study, CrAg screening was performed in all of the patients with CM.

The most common method for fungal infection detection in HIV-infected patients is the direct visualization of the infection with a fluorescence microscope. This method has a sensitivity of approximately 80% for Cryptococcus spp. [10]. However, for Cryptococcus, it is difficult to obtain this result using this method due to its high cost and its time-consuming use. Therefore, the indirect visualization of the infection with a fluorescence microscope is important for fungal detection.

The first step in the diagnosis of CM is the direct visualization of the infection with a fluorescence microscope. The sensitivity of this method is 100% with this method. In our study, the sensitivity of this method was 91% (1/3) and the specificity was 92.7%. The sensitivity of this method was similar to that of a commercial kit that is recommended for rapid diagnosis of CM [11].

The use of a DAPI stain can be difficult as the Epsonized DAPI stain is a dye that is used to stain the cytoplasmic organelles of Cryptococcus neoformans [12]. It is also a dye that can be used to stain the cytoplasmic organelles of Candida albicans [13]. The use of the DAPI stain can also be useful in the diagnosis of CM in HIV-infected patients. In our study, the sensitivity of this method was 89.9% (1/3). This is similar to the sensitivity of a commercial kit that is recommended for rapid diagnosis of CM in HIV-infected patients [11].
