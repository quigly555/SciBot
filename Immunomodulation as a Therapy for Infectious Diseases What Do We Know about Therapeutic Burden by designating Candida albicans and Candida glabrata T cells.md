## Abstract
The eukaryotic cytoplasmic membrane participates in the import of various biomolecules and their cargo. The membrane components of the cytoplasm are organized into transmembrane to the plasma membrane and a large number of transmembrane proteins, which belong to the P-type ATPase superfamily. A pyranidial membrane protein, Pmc1, is an essential component of the cytoplasm and is necessary for the uptake of the major components of the extracellular matrix, for example polysaccharide capsule and matrix polysaccharide proteins. The structure of the P-type ATPase superfamily was first described in the 1940s. Nowadays, the P-type ATPases are responsible for the biosynthesis of a large range of essential substances, including the popularly called M-pyranosyltransferase. Besides the P-type ATPases, other groups of eukaryotic membrane enzymes also contain members with additional roles in different biological processes, for example membrane trafficking, transmembrane transport, and protein degradation. These enzymes have evolved, in part, in response to changes in the environment and specific environments, influencing the presence and/or the absence of P-type ATPases in all organisms. These enzymes are known as membrane enzymes because they break down molecules, such as membrane microbes and proteins, into various other different products, such as substrates and functional units. This review covers the literature on the role of P-type ATPases and their derivatives in the biological processes and/or in the physical, chemical, and biological systems as well as their future developments.


## Introduction
The regulation of morphological transitions in fungi, particularly those associated with sexual reproduction, has long been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, mating is controlled by two different types of transcription factors, pheromone receptor-like proteins (PRRs) and pheromone receptor-encoding genes. The pheromones in S. cerevisiae are a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit (PRR-1) and a regulatory subunit (PRR-2). The pheromone in S. cerevisiae is a homodimer consisting of two different pheromone-inducible (PRR-1/2) isoforms (PRR-1 and PRR-2). The PRRs are encoded by the genes CNAG_07329, CYT_15, and SOC_11. The gene for CNAG_07329, CYT_15, and SOC_11 is under the control of the transcription factor Crz1 in the absence of the transcription factor Pcl14. The genes for both Pcl14 and Crz1 are located in the same locus and transcriptionally active in the absence of the Pcl14 transcription factor. Deletion of the CNAG_07329 and CNAG_07329 genes reduced mating efficiency, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and induced a decrease in filamentation. These results suggest that the PRRs involved in mating are cAMP-dependent proteins and may be involved in regulating the expression of genes related to cell wall integrity in the absence of Pcl14.

## Results
The results of the quantitative PCR analysis showed that 10^4 isolates were obtained from the maceration. The average PCR product size was 29.1 × 10^3, which is comparable to the size of the clinical isolate obtained from a patient. The size of the total isolate was larger than 100 isolates, which are typically found in human infections, such as those from HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative patients. The clinical isolate obtained from a patient with an isogenic keratitis infection was less likely to be a PCR product (Table 1).

The CD4 cell count was higher in the CSF in patients with a keratitis infection than in the CSF of patients with a keratitis infection
The CD4 cell count of CSF was higher in patients with a keratitis infection than in those with a keratitis infection (Table 2). The difference in the difference in the CD4 cell count between the two groups was significant (P<0.001).

The CSF sample was more likely to contain 4, 5, and 8 out of 20 isolates than the CSF sample was to contain the total isolate (Table 2). The number of isolates was higher in CSF samples that were collected from patients with a keratitis infection (2.3; 95% CI 1.1-5.9) than in those with a keratitis infection (2.2; 95% CI 1.5-6.5). The number of isolates was higher in CSF samples that were obtained from patients with a keratitis infection (1.9; 95% CI 1.2-2.9) than in those with a keratitis infection (1.3; 95% CI 1.1-2.


## Discussion
albicans and . glabrata and/or C. neoformans in the blood in response to infection.

In this study, we found that the increased numbers of C. albicans T cells in the brain are associated with increased risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Further, the increased number of T cells in the brain suggests that the increased susceptibility could be related to the risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Further, these data suggest that brain toxoplasmosis is not only a neuroendocrine tumor but also a chronic inflammatory disorder and that brain toxoplasmosis might also be a latent infection.

The increased number of C. albicans T cells in the brain suggests that brain toxoplasmosis may be a neuroendocrine tumor. Brain toxoplasmosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by exposure to highly concentrated fungal infection in the blood, which is also known as brain metastasis. It is a chronic disease that occurs at least twice per year in infected individuals. About 50% of brain toxoplasmosis cases occur in the first few years after infection [1]. The most common route of infection in brain is inhalation of aerosols, which may be the result of environmental exposure to fungal infection or immune deficiency. The brain toxoplasmosis is also known as “tuberculosis infection,” a parasitic infection that has a high prevalence in the lungs and disseminated infection, which is also known as cryptococcosis. In addition, the increased number of C. albicans T cells in the brain suggests that brain toxoplasmosis could be a latent infection.

Our results indicated that the increased numbers of C. albicans T cells in the brain were associated with increased risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Furthermore, we showed that the increased numbers of C. albicans T cells in the brain were associated with increased risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Further, our findings suggest that the increased numbers of C. albicans T cells in the brain might be associated with the increased risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis.

A previous study indicated that the frequency of C. albicans T cells in the brain was associated with increased risk of cerebral toxoplasmosis [10]. Our results indicated that the frequency of C. albicans T cells in the brain was associated with increased risk of cerebral toxoplasmosis.
