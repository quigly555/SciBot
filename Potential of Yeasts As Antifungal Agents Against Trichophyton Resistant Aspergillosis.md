## Abstract
Co-infection with Cryptococcus is usually associated with impaired growth in immunocompetent patients. Conversely, the majority of patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis have ataxia or hypokalemia, and cryptococcosis in non-HIV patients has no impact on vitamin D status or renal function. Vitamin D may be required for ataxia or hypokalemia and may interfere with splenic and splenic copper homeostasis. In addition, hypokalemia can be a predictor of cryptococcosis in patients receiving vitamin D, and the majority of patients receiving vitamin D have poor outcomes.

Here we report a case of a young female with cryptococcosis complicated by ataxia or hypokalemia and renal insufficiency who was managed by dialyzedividedale with flucytosine. Ataxia or hypokalemia were the most prevalent vascular risk factor in her system, and vitamin D may be indicated to improve renal function, but unfortunately she did not have adequate splenectomia for ataxia and hypokalemia.

We report a case of a young female with cryptococcosis complicated by ataxia or hypokalemia and renal insufficiency who had to be managed by dialyzedividedale for splenectomia and who had poor outcomes.


## Introduction
Encephalitis is a rare and often life-threatening illness. It occurs predominantly in immunosuppressed individuals, such as those infected with HIV, organ transplant patients, and cancer patients. It can cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with underlying immunosuppression [1]. Despite the available drugs, the incidence of acute myelogenous encephalitis (AME) has declined significantly in the last decade, despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy and the introduction of newer, more efficacious antiretroviral drugs [2]. AME accounts for approximately 70% of fungal and bacterial infections, and it is estimated that only 2%-4% of patients with acute myelogenous encephalitis survive [3].

The main mechanisms by which fungi and bacteria evade host immune defense are through different mechanisms including peptidoglycan formation [4], [5]. These mechanisms are generally associated with virulence and include peptidoglycan formation, hypoglycemic responses, and secretion of surface molecules. Plectomyramidazole (Mentha^Â®) is a large polypeptide antibiotic peptidoglycan (PG) that has been described to exhibit fungicidal activity against a wide range of fungi, including Candida spp., and Trichophyton spp., although it is not fungistatic against Candida albicans [6]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Plectomyramidazole acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the polypeptide plectomylamidase (pptA) enzyme, which is involved in the formation of fungal plectomylamides. This inhibition of the enzyme results in increased sensitivity to different kinds of stresses and an increase in drug efflux, including drug-drug interactions [7].

Treatment of AME has been a challenge in the past decades, and a rapid and effective treatment has been advocated [8]. Various compounds such as nalidiximab, koroconazole, and zidovudine have been developed and are currently available as antifungal agents [9]. However, as there is no evidence that these compounds are toxic to the patient, the development of novel antifungal agents is a challenge. The use of chemical agents, particularly synthetic compounds, is therefore of the utmost importance to reduce the side effects of these drugs.


## Methods
The MIC of the tested antifungal drugs was determined by broth microdilution method according to the CLSI M27-A3 method and is reported as the lowest concentration of the drug that is capable of inhibiting visible growth of the microorganis. The MIC of the tested antifungal drugs was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in the minimum reduction in visible growth of the microorganism, as compared with the lowest concentration of the drug that was able to cause no visible growth of the microorganism in comparison to the lowest concentration of the drug that was able to cause no visible growth of the microorganism. The growth of the microorganism was determined by the colorimetric method as described by [27]. The antifungal activity of the tested drugs was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in no visible growth of the microorganism, as compared with the lowest concentration that caused no visible growth of the microorganism in comparison to the lowest concentration of the drug that was able to cause no visible growth of the microorganism in comparison to the lowest concentration of the drug that was able to cause no visible growth of the microorganism in comparison to the lowest concentration of the drug that was able to cause no visible growth of the microorganism.


## Results
cerevisiae, . albicans, and S. pombe) are among the most resistant fungi to antifungal agents [28], [29]. We have previously observed that C. albicans is the most susceptible fungus to C. neoformans antifungal agents [30]. However, our new study shows that the C. neoformans strain CEA17 is more susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole than the control strain. To better understand the mechanism of antifungal resistance in C. neoformans, we compared the susceptibility of C. neoformans and C. albicans to fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Although fluconazole is well tolerated by all four yeast species [31], it is ineffective against C. neoformans and C. albicans (Table 1). Fluconazole and voriconazole were also effective against C. neoformans and C. albicans (Table 1). However, the fluconazole MICs of C. neoformans and C. albicans were significantly lower than those of the control strain. The MICs of fluconazole and voriconazole against C. neoformans and C. albicans were lower than those of the control strain. These results suggested that antifungal agents might be effective against Candida species. Therefore, we conducted a screen for C. neoformans and C. albicans strains that showed resistance to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. The MICs of fluconazole and amphotericin B were significantly lower than those of the control strain.

To further characterize the antifungal drug susceptibility of C. neoformans and C. albicans, we first analyzed the susceptibility of the four strains to amphotericin B and voriconazole. The MICs of amphotericin B were lower than those of fluconazole and voriconazole, but lower than those of amphotericin B against C. neoformans and C. albicans (Table 2). The MICs of amphotericin B and voriconazole against C. neoformans and C. albicans were also lower than those of fluconazole and voriconazole against C.


## Discussion
rubrum, . brasiliensis, and B. subtilis, has been studied. In addition to the well-known antifungal agents, several novel antifungal agents have been developed. Most of these compounds are characterized by the presence of ascosporine A, dibenzothallienone, and ellagic acid, and the presence of ellagic acid, butyric acid, and phenyl acetate. The antifungal agent ellagic acid is well-known as a promising treatment for candidiasis, but its mechanism of action is still unknown. The involvement of the cell wall in fungal cell wall integrity has been reported in Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans [19,20,25]. The cells of these fungi were exposed to the antifungal agents, and cell wall integrity was investigated. The results of the cell wall integrity assay showed that ellagic acid, the major constituent of ellagic acid, was effective in inhibiting the growth of all four tested strains. However, the mechanism of action of ellagic acid is still unclear. In this study, a synergistic effect of ellagic acid was observed against the dermatophytes T. rubrum, P. brasiliensis, and B. subtilis. The synergistic effect was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that the synergistic effect of ellagic acid was observed in an exponential growth phase. However, the growth phase was not observed in the cell wall integrity assay. The results of the cell wall integrity assay showed that the synergistic effect of ellagic acid was not observed in a growth phase. In addition, the synergistic effect was observed in the cell wall integrity assay. The results indicated that the synergistic effect of ellagic acid was not observed in a hyphal growth phase. The results indicated that the synergistic effect of ellagic acid was not observed in a basidiomycete. In addition, the synergistic effect of ellagic acid was observed in the growth phase. The synergistic effect of ellagic acid was observed in a hyphal growth phase.

The results of the cellular structure, morphology, and various biological properties, showed that the combination of ellagic acid and ellagic acid was efficient in inhibiting the growth of T. rubrum, P.
