## Abstract
A 56-year-old gentleman with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma was admitted to our hospital with a two-year history of progressive weakness, induration, and gradual onset of cough. Chest X-ray and computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe. Lumbar puncture yielded a chest mass. Tests for leptomeningeal inflammation, autoimmune encephalitis, and antineutrophil cytopenia were negative. The patient's symptoms progressed to fulminant leptomeningeal inflammation, with left hemiparesis, right hemiparesis, and right hemiparesis. Nitrotoxic angiography showed diffuse infiltrates in both kidneys with underlying deep granulomata. Hereditary, autoimmune, and infectious causes were excluded through biopsy. VATS was performed, and a neoplasia was performed. Pathologic findings in the right lung mass were consistent with a leptomeningeal granulomata. Antimycotic angiography showed multiple infiltrations in both kidneys with underlying multifocal granulomata. His clinical response was poor, and he died due to progressive respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed an undetermined primary cause of death, and complete effusion of the work-up was negative.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease caused by the encapsulated yeasts of the genus Cryptococcus. It is caused by two distinct species: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcosis is mainly caused by Cryptococcus spp. but is also possible in non-human animals such as rabbits, pigeons, cats, bats, horses, and cattle [1]. The two species differ in the clinical presentation and the kinetics of infection, and they can be distinguished from each other by their expression of the characteristic cryptococcal capsule. Cryptococcus neoformans is more often encountered in immunocompetent individuals, while Cryptococcus gattii is more commonly encountered in immunocompromised individuals [2].

Cryptococcosis can be categorized into three serotypes: serotypes A, D, and AD. The first two species are found in the immunocompromised population, while the AD and C. neoformans are found predominantly in immunocompromised individuals [3]. Cryptococcosis is an emerging opportunistic fungal infection, which affects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Most cases are caused by C. neoformans var. grubii, which was once considered to be a rare but strongly virulent species. However, cryptococcosis has recently gained importance due to its increasingly common human and animal immunodeficiency. Cryptococcosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Inhalation of C. neoformans/C. gattii particles by the respiratory tract is the common route of infection [4]. The infection usually develops into pulmonary infection, but can also develop into meningoencephalitis [5].

Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon and severe fungal infection in humans and animals. Inhalation of C. neoformans/C. gattii mainly occurs by the respiratory tract, and the infection usually develops into pulmonary infection in immunocompromised individuals [6].

The mechanisms whereby C. neoformans and C. gattii differ in humans are relatively well understood, but the details are even more complex in animals.


## Methods
Briefly, Cryptococcus gattii S/S was grown overnight in YPD at 30°C and then diluted to OD_600 = .2 in fresh YPD and inoculated into fresh YPD at 30°C for the indicated time points. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of sterile lysis buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors, and protease inhibitors), followed by incubation at 30°C for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended with PBS and plated on YPD agar to determine the colony-forming units (CFU) per ml. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h. Colonies with no Cryptococcus gattii S/S in the lysate were considered as “no Cryptococcus spp.” The CFU were defined as the number of Cryptococcus spp. per cell in a volume of the well that was at least 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/ml. For the phagocytosis assay, we used a 10-fold dilution series of Cryptococcus gattii S/S as described previously [27]. Briefly, Cryptococcus gattii S/S was grown overnight in YPD at 30°C and then diluted to OD_600 = 0.2 in fresh YPD and inoculated into fresh YPD at 30°C for the indicated time points. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended with PBS and plated on YPD agar to determine the colony-forming units (CFU). The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h. The phagocytosis index was defined as the number of Cryptococcus spp. per cell in a well that was at least 1.0 × 10^6 CFU/ml.

## Results
The gene set of 28 C. neoformans var. grubii (CnVG) strains included in this study is very similar to the one of the 19 C. neoformans var. neoformans (CnVG) strains (Table 1) and, in some instances, resembles the other species of the genera. The majority of the CnVG strains were found to be distinct from the other species, but the C. neoformans var. grubii strain was found to have some differences in the mating types.


## Discussion
gattii in the gu. This is supported by the fact that the C. neoformans/Cryptococcus neoformans hybrid has the same initial growth rate and haploidy as C. gattii but with an additional growth stage of more than 10-15 days instead of the normal 7-8 days for C. neoformans/Cryptococcus neoformans. The C. gattii/C. neoformans hybrid was thus found to be an independent strain and it is the first report of this hybridization event.

The above-mentioned work was performed with respect to the collection of Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus neoformans hybrids for the ITS and LSU regions. The results show that the hybrid isolates were more than indistinguishable from each other. The hybrid sequences from the current collection of C. gattii and C. neoformans strains used for this work were as follows: C. gattii ITS1, C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. gattii SSU2. The ITS and LSU regions are shown in Table 3 and can be used to identify C. gattii and C. neoformans, respectively. This will be the first report of hybridization between C. gattii and C. neoformans in the gut of C. gattii, and further studies in this area are needed to characterize the hybridization events.

The ITS region is the largest of the seven regions used for this work, and it covers over 95% of the ITS gene, which is the major difference between C. neoformans and C. gattii. In C. neoformans, the ITS region is over one hundred and fifty-four genes compared to the ITS region of C. gattii. In contrast, the LSU region is only a few hundred and twenty-four genes compared to C. gattii. These results indicate that the ITS region is the most reliable marker for C. gattii isolates, and that it has a greater discriminatory power compared to the LSU region.

The genus Cryptococcus comprises several species of Cryptococcus and they are most frequently found in association with plants, animals, and insects.
