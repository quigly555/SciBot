## Abstract
The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains controversial and based on previous studies that have found higher prevalence of non-typhoidal Salmonella-associated CM (NSAC) in non-US population, however more research is needed. We herein report a case of CM in a patient with a rare diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis.

A 57-year-old man with HIV presented with cough for 2 months and fever for 1.5 months. A chest computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 4 cm (2.0-3.0 cm) right pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodular shadows. He was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine. A corticosteroid regimen was started and gradually increased. Eventually, he developed acute upper respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with left hemiparesis, right hemiparesis, and right pleural effusion. His fever persisted despite treatment with amphotericin B. He was treated with fluconazole for a week and then had a slight improvement with recovery of lung function.

Once he had recovered, he continued to have symptoms and chest radiographs, but he had lung nodular shadows. Cytology and biochemistry of lung tissue from chest showed numerous lymphocytes with highly adenosine gradients. The lung lesion gradually worsened to the extent that he developed right lung lymphoma. He died 2 days after the diagnosis of CM by the thoracic specialists.

Since cases of cryptococcosis are rare, autopsy, culture, and histopathology are essential, this case report serves as a reminder that even low peripheral immunodeficiency (PID) can impart a high risk of CNS infection.

We hereby present a case of CM in a patient with a rare diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clinically, the importance of having a high index of suspicion for CNS infection in HIV-infected patients is emphasized. We also discuss the importance of having a good clinical and radiological record, and our case serves as a reminder that even low immunodeficiency (PID) can impart a high risk of CNS infection.


## Introduction
The rhizosphere is a microbial community of highly complex microdomed structures found in a variety of environments. These structures are composed of layers of proteins, lipids and polysaccharides that are formed by the interaction of an environmental microbe and the host (Lorenz, 1998). The rhizosphere is a complex structure that is formed by microbial cells from bacteria, fungi and other organisms and is embedded in a lipid-rich extracellular matrix. The composition of the rhizosphere varies from one host species to another, and from one species to another and from planet to planet. The rhizosphere is the most stable and nutrient-rich layer of the rhizoplus and the most diverse component of the rhizosphere microbial community. As a result, the composition of the rhizosphere is influenced by both the host and the microbe. In addition to the individual hosts, the microbial community is composed of many other organisms, e.g. bacteria, fungi and other organisms that grow in the environment (Rosk et al., 2012). However, as a result of the host environment, several fungal species can colonize the rhizosphere, and many of them can cause infections that can be fatal (Timmerman et al., 2006; Pretorius et al., 2009; Nemecek and Pretorius, 2013).

Many fungal species, including the most common fungi, can be found on the surface of the rhizosphere and are capable of colonizing the rhizosphere under certain conditions, such as high salt concentration, pH, temperature, nutrient availability, and moisture, as well as under abiotic stresses (Maiti et al., 2012; Pretorius et al., 2013; Pretorius, 2014; Zalar et al., 2015).


## Methods
The study involved 2 patients, one with HIV and one with non-HIV-associated cryptococcosi. They were randomly divided into two groups. The first group was treated with amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (0.2 mg/kg/day). The second group received flucytosine (0.5 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (0.3 mg/kg/day). All patients were treated with fluconazole, which was administered on the basis of a CLSI-recommended regimen [17].

The first group of patients was treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and flucytosine (0.2 mg/kg/day) for the first 3 weeks after initiation of the therapy. A second group of patients was treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (0.2 mg/kg/day). After the first week, patients were treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Then, patients were treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (0.2 mg/kg/day).

Both groups received subcutaneous injections of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (0.3 mg/kg/day) for the first 3 weeks after initiation of the therapy. Then, patients were treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and fluconazole (0.2 mg/kg/day). Patients were divided into two groups.

A total of 6 patients were treated with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg/day), fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day), cyclophosphamide (0.3 mg/kg/day), and naloxone (0.3 mg/kg/day). After the first week, the patients were treated with fluconazole (0.5 mg/kg/day) and naloxone (0.3 mg/kg/day). Patients were divided into two groups.


## Results
01. The mean CD4 count of the uninfected group was lower than that of the infected group at both 3 and 6 months of age (Figure 2). In the uninfected group, the mean CD4 count of the infected group was lower than that of the uninfected group at all 3 and 6 months of age. In the infected group, the mean CD4 count of the uninfected group was lower than that of the uninfected group at all 3 and 6 months of age.

In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower in the infected group at 3 months of age than that in the uninfected group at all 3 and 6 months of age. In the infected group, the mean CD4 count of the infected group was lower than that of the uninfected group at all 3 and 6 months of age.

Of the three groups with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL, the infected group had significantly lower CD4 counts at 3 months of age than that at 6 months of age. The infected group had significantly lower CD4 counts at 3 months of age than that at 6 months of age.

The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 3 months of age, 6 months of age and 3 months of age. The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 3 months of age and 6 months of age.

The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 3 months of age and 6 months of age. The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 6 months of age and 3 months of age.

The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 3 months of age, 6 months of age and 3 months of age. The CD4 counts of infected and uninfected patients were significantly lower than those of uninfected patients at 3 months of age and 6 months of age.


## Discussion

Most patients were immunocompromised, with few studies showing immunocompetent patients with CMV infectio. The majority of the patients had HIV/AIDS [14], and we found that the risk of CMV infection was similar in our study population, with the median CD4^+ cell count of 5 cell/µL in HIV-positive patients was 13 cells/µL, with the median CD4^+ cell count of 4 cells/µL and the median CD4^+ cell count of 3 cells/µL. HIV-infected patients also had higher levels of serum viral load than HIV-infected patients, which could explain the increased risk of CMV infection in HIV-infected patients.

Our study also revealed the increased risk of CMV infection among HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings. This is in contrast to a study from India, which showed that HIV-infected patients had a higher risk of CMV infection [15]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of CMV-related mortality in India [16], and it was not unexpected that Cryptococcus neoformans infection was also associated with mortality in HIV-infected patients in our study. Cryptococcus neoformans infection was also reported to be more prevalent in HIV-infected patients [17], and it was less common in HIV-infected patients in our study population. Cryptococcus gattii was also detected in patients with CMV infection, but it was not as frequent as in HIV-infected patients. This could be due to the fact that Cryptococcus gattii is more common in resource-limited settings [18].

The other risk factor for CMV infection was the use of antiretroviral therapy, which was associated with mortality in our study population. However, antiretroviral therapy was not associated with mortality in our study population, and a study from South Africa [19] showed that antiretroviral therapy was not associated with mortality. We found that the mortality risk was higher in HIV-infected patients with CMV infection, which could be due to a lower CD4^+ cell count in HIV-infected patients.
