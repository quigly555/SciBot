## Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death in hematology patients, with AIDS-related deaths nearly threefold less than for tuberculosis (TB). The incidence of these two diseases is rising slowly in our midst, but both are of primary and secondary concern in hematology patients. To guide development of effective TB treatment strategies, clinicians should be knowledgeable about the potential for the disease to develop in its pathogen. However, despite this progress, the incidence of TB and its treatment are emerging threats to hematology patients. In this review, we describe the novel ways in which the immune response of the host against the target organism may recognize and orchestrate the development of a new TB infection.


## Introduction
The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is a commensal of the skin and mouthparts of humans and animals, and can cause superficial mucosal and/or systemic infections. The infection process is initiated upon inhalation of aerosolized spores. Once inside the host, the yeast cells differentiate into mature hyphal cells that reside in the lungs and disseminate to other organs and tissues. This yeast has been associated with diseases such as as multiple mucocutaneous candidiasis (CM), skin and nail fungal infections, and systemic candidiasis (1-3).

It has been demonstrated that C. albicans biofilm can develop in vitro, in vivo, and in vitro within the host environment (4-7). Biofilm formation is most evident in the lungs, where the yeast cells differentiate into yeast-like cells and are transported to the bloodstream and, eventually, in the blood. The yeast cells, which are protected from host immune response by the host immune system, colonize the bloodstream and disseminate to the draining lymph nodes and other tissues (8, 9).

In the bloodstream, C. albicans biofilm cells differentiate into macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs), in addition to other effectors, including epithelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, that may be recruited to sites of infection (10, 11). The innate immune system (NIC) is composed of a diverse group of cells that recognize and internalize pathogens, initiate host defense mechanisms, and regulate the outcome of the infection process. The generation of a sufficient response against the yeast and the establishment of the appropriate immune response to the yeast are required to prevent its growth and dissemination.

In the pathogenesis of C. albicans, mechanisms of biofilm formation are related to the host and the fungus (12, 13). In the host, Candida biofilm cells differentiate into phagocytes and microsclerotia, which may be attacked by phagocytes, which may then migrate to the bloodstream and cause disease (14, 15).


## Methods
The information on the possible causes of the heart attack/death in patients with bacterial meningitis was not available in the electronic medical record. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, San Francisco.

Clinical diagnosis of heart attack in patients with bacterial meningitis was performed by the clinician using standard clinical criteria. Although the procedures were performed by specialists, the methods used were not always the same and were therefore difficult to follow. For the diagnosis of heart attack, the best-established criterion was the presence of a new heart attack within a specified time period. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, San Francisco.

## Results
The use of immunosuppressive medications was commo. The major complications were malignancies, fibrosis, and lymphadenopathy. The main complications in the hospital were acute myocardial infarction (1/3), acute myocarditis (2/3), acute stroke (1/3), and diabetes mellitus (1/3). Other major complications were disseminated inflammatory diseases (1/3), polymicrobial infections (1/3), and diabetes mellitus (1/3). The progression rate of the hospitalization was not significantly different between the groups (Table 3). The complications in the hospitalization was also not different between the groups (Table 4).

Treatment of bacterial meningitis and other bacterial meningitis
The microbiological studies of the patients with bacterial meningitis are summarized in Table 3. The most common bacterial meningitis was ascites, followed by pancreatitis, pancreatic duct infection, and abscess, followed by colonic cancer. The bacterial meningitis was associated with 2-3 bacterial meningitis a year. Among the patients with ascites, 13 were hospitalized with ascites, 2 with pancreatitis, 1 with pancreatitis, and 1 with pancreatic duct infection. The incidence of ascites was 4.3% in the hospital with ascites and 4.7% in the hospital with pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis was 2.9% in the hospital with ascites and 2.5% in the hospital with pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis was 2.9% in the hospital with ascites and 1.2% in the hospital with pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis was 1.2% in the hospital with ascites and 1.2% in the hospital with pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis was 0.8% in the hospital with ascites and 1.6% in the hospital with pancreatitis.

The incidence of pancreatitis was 0.8% in the hospital with ascites and 0.7% in the hospital with pancreatitis. The incidence of pancreatitis was 1.2% in the hospital with ascites and 1.6% in the hospital with pancreatitis.


## Discussion
In this study, we have identified several novel proteins in the common pathway of eukaryotic replication that can be involved in the regulation of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, and thereby affect the function of the nucleus. We have identified a novel protein, HKSP1, that can interact with and bind DNA and RNA during replication. The interaction of HKSP1 with RNA has been shown to be regulated by the transcription factors Ccr1 and Bcr1, which have been shown to be independent of and activated by HKSP1 [36], [37]. Interestingly, the Ccr1-mediated nuclear fusion and fission of the nuclear chromosome of A. fumigatus is controlled by the HKSP1-mediated DNA replication. In contrast, the nuclear fusion of A. fumigatus does not require HKSP1 [37], [38]. Although we have not specifically addressed the interaction of HKSP1 with DNA or RNA, it has been reported that transcriptional regulation of DNA replication is controlled by the HKSP1-dependent transcription factor HapX [39]. The HKSP1-mediated DNA replication has been shown to be controlled by the MAPK/MAPK-dependent transcription factor NF-Y1/2 [40], but this did not translate into complete control of nuclear fission and fission of A. fumigatus. We therefore propose that the HKSP1-dependent nuclear fusion and fission of A. fumigatus may be regulated by the MAPK/MAPK-dependent transcription factor HapX, which is expressed on the vacuolar membrane. This will be the first report that HKSP1-dependent nuclear fusion and fission is regulated by the MAPK/MAPK-dependent transcription factor HapX.

In addition to the conserved HKSP1-dependent nuclear fusion and fission proteins, other proteins associated with the transcriptional control of the nuclear fusion and nuclear fusion of A. fumigatus also have been identified. For example, in S. cerevisiae, HapX regulates the transcription of genes involved in replication, and the genes that contain the HapX-like protein are required for the establishment of an efficient replication-replication system [41], [42].
