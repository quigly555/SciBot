## Abstract
Background. We aimed to determine the prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) among HIV-infected patients and their optimal treatment regimen (MFR) diagnosis. Method. Eligible studies were enrolled in the Francisco J Muñiz Hospital, Science and Technology Institute (JHST) Research Institute ( http://jhst.jhst.ch/ ) between February and September, 2012. Data was analyzed using Epi-info version 3.5.1. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors predicting IFI.

Results. Among the 129 studies included, the median age of the study participants was 42 years (IQR 31-50), and the median time of IFI was 21 months (IQR 13-34 months) from onset to diagnosis. The median CD4 count at the time of IFI was 123 cells/µL (IQR 57-300), and the median time of IFI from onset to diagnosis was 74 months (IQR 23-151 months). The median time of IFI from onset to diagnosis was 186 months (IQR 40-1,323 months), and the median time of IFI from onset to MFR was longer (p < 0.0001). Patients in the MFR had an average of 12.1 months (IQR: 11.2 months) and 3.9 months (IQR: 2.7 months) before the onset of MFR, respectively. IFI was more frequent in patients in the MFR group (29.1%) than in those in the BFR group (23.9%). Twenty-eight percent of patients in the MFR group had at least 2.0 replicates/mL of cryptococcal antigen in their blood.

Conclusions.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a typical colonizing yeast of human skin. It can cause superficial infections, life-threatening systemic infections, and a wide spectrum of pathologies including thrush, seborrheic dermatitis and ocular infections. The skin is the main site of entry for C. albicans. The cells of the skin are covered by the mucus lining the outer layer of the dermis. It is the main route of entry for fungi into the dermis, and its expansion is promoted by the secretion of virulence factors. The secretory pathway is the route of invasion, and the most active part is the release of secretory vesicles. The secretion of secretory proteins is a complex process. Some secretory proteins are secreted at different stages of the process. The secretion of secretory proteins is mainly composed of cAMP proteins, which are very important for the growth of fungi. The secretion of secretory proteins is promoted by many factors including C. albicans cell wall, nutrient, and fungal cell wall.


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/protein). The resulting query sequence was used as a BLAST alignment to establish the phylogenetic placement of Vibrio virens protein sequences in the present study. To identify the phylogenetic relationship between Vibrio virens protein sequences and proteome, a BLAST search was performed using the protein database of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein). The resulting query sequence was used as a BLAST alignment to establish the phylogenetic placement of Vibrio virens protein sequences in the present study.

The identification of Vibrio virens protein sequences was performed by sequencing of the fragment of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the Vibrio virens protein sequence.


## Results
virens proteome harbors a small number of HIV-1 and . bovis transporters, which is consistent with the high abundance of HIV-1 transporters in HIV-1 transporters. Therefore, we explored the distribution of HIV-1 transporters in the V. bovis proteome by using the common V. bovis transporters as well as the transporters from other fungi. To do so, we used the enzyme-inhibitor (HI)-specific TaqMan probe to test the abundance of Vibrio V. bovis transporters in the proteome of the V. bovis V. bovis mutant, as well as the C. albicans transporters, which we previously observed to be enriched in the V. bovis proteome [30, 31].

As shown in Fig 3, the V. bovis V. bovis transporters were found to be highly abundant in the V. bovis proteome, which is consistent with the high abundance of HIV-1 transporters in V. bovis proteome, which is also consistent with the high abundance of transporters in the V. bovis proteome. The remaining V. bovis V. bovis transporters were found to be highly abundant in the V. bovis V. bovis mutant proteome. In particular, the V. bovis V. bovis transporters were found to be highly abundant in the V. bovis V. bovis mutant proteome. These data suggest that the V. bovis V. bovis transporters are involved in the regulation of the proteome of V. bovis, but not the V. bovis V. bovis mutant proteome.

Sequence analysis of V. bovis V. bovis transporters
Based on the above results, we wanted to use the V. bovis V. bovis transporters as a possible model for the regulation of the proteome of V. bovis. The results obtained in the proteomic proteomic analysis are in concordance with those reported by Ho et al. [14] and Su et al. [32], which showed that V. bovis V.


## Discussion
parahaemolyticus differed from that of . albicans. This could be due to the different DNA and RNA extraction methods used to produce the proteins. The DNA was extracted with a 554-well plate with a maximum of 16,740 reads, which represented approximately 80% of the total length. The RNA was obtained with a yield of approximately 75% of the total length. The proteome of V. parahaemolyticus was constructed using the same procedures used in the previous analysis of the proteome of C. albicans. The results showed that the proteome of V. parahaemolyticus was composed of approximately 50% of the proteins and that the proteome of C. albicans was composed of approximately 40% of the proteins. The proteome of C. albicans was also constructed using the same methodology as in the previous analysis of the proteome of C. albicans. The results showed that the proteome of C. albicans was comprised of approximately 50% of the proteins and that the proteome of V. parahaemolyticus was composed of approximately 50% of the proteins.
