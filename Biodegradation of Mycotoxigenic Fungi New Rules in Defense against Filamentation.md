## Abstract
Despite being important human pathogens, Candida glabrata are a relatively understudied component of the human microbiome. This contributes to the understanding of their virulence potential and their innate responses to environmental stresses. The most common molecular virulence factor of C. glabrata is a dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphal growth, which is tightly controlled by multiple genetic clusters and transcription factors. Here we review the roles of transcription factors and its genetics in regulating hyphal development and dimorphic switching, both in C. glabrata and other fungal species. We then review how specific transcription factors and specific hyphal morphogenetic genes are important for hyphal growth and dimorphic switching in C. glabrata.


## Introduction
Acute febrile neutropenia (AFP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by neutrophilic inflammation of the lung that usually manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute bronchitis (ARDS) [1-3]. It is caused by a primary immunodeficiency, an inherited immune disorder, or by a combination of both [1, 2, 4, 5]. AFP is rarely reported, but its histological presentation is very rare, and its clinical presentation is often indistinguishable from that of tuberculosis (TB) [3, 6]. A recent review of more than 200 cases of AFP in two continents identified six clusters of neutropenia with a high variability of diagnosis and outcomes, with a case fatality rate of approximately 60% [7, 8]. The diagnosis of AFP may be challenging, as some studies have relied only on indirect immunohistochemical methods, and others rely only on qualitative tests [8]. Nonetheless, most of the patients with AFP present as a stable, productive, and well-lived adult patient. There is, however, an increasing clinical misdiagnosis of AFP, and a number of prophylactic and empirical therapies are not effective [9-12].

In the present study, we investigated the diagnostic value of the immunohistochemical tests performed on the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with AFP and the factors that contribute to this misdiagnosis.


## Methods
The mycotoxigenic fungi were subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) for 7 days at 37°. The fungal growth on the agar was assessed after two days of incubation at 37°C and the fungal hyphal growth was assessed after 1 day of incubation at 37°C. The mycotoxigenic fungi were identified using the method of Doshi et al. (2018).

Antifungal Activity of Mycotoxigenic Fungi
The antifungal activity of mycotoxigenic fungi against C. parapsilosis var. parapsilosis was evaluated using the broth microdilution method, with minor modifications. The mycotoxigenic fungi were inoculated in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDA) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) at a density of 1 × 10^4 CFU/mL, at 37°C for 3 days. The mycotoxigenic fungi were subjected to the broth microdilution method. The mycotoxigenic fungi were subjected to the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) method. The FIC method was performed by using a dilution factor of 100. The mycotoxigenic fungi were subjected to the fractional fungicidal concentration (FFC) method using a dilution factor of 100. The fungal growth was evaluated after two days of incubation at 37°C and the fungal hyphal growth was assessed after 2 days of incubation at 37°C. The antifungal activity of mycotoxigenic fungi was determined using the antifungal factor combination method, with minor modifications. The mycotoxigenic fungi were subjected to the fractional fungicidal concentration (FIC) method using a dilution factor of 100. The fungal growth was evaluated after 2 days of incubation at 37°C and the fungal hyphal growth was assessed after 2 days of incubation at 37°C. The antifungal factor combination method was performed by using a dilution factor of 100.


## Results

In the first experiment, the number of CFU recovered by the 4-day challenge in the . furfur strain was significantly greater than that of the 1-day challenge in all three tested time points (P < 0.001).

The results of the interaction of the CFU recovered by fungal challenge with bacteria and fungi are presented in Fig 2B. In the first experiment, the CFU recovered by the 4-day challenge in the M. furfur strain was significantly greater than that by the 1-day challenge in all three tested time points.

## Discussion
In this study, we confirmed that Mycobacterium s. were bioactive against the biofilm formation and were also able to reduce the biofilm formation and to reduce the biofilm formation of C. neoformans biofilm in an in vivo experiment. Additionally, a new study demonstrated that the efficacy of mycobacterium sp. against C. neoformans biofilm was reduced by a factor of 2.3-3.2-fold compared to the non-Biofilm disease. Our data demonstrated that the biofilm formation was significantly reduced by an order of magnitude by Mycobacterium sp. Biofilm Reduction was Also Reduced by a factor of 2.3-3.2-fold in a C. neoformans biofilm and that the biofilm formation was reduced by a factor of 2.3-3.2-fold in a C. neoformans biofilm [16]. Furthermore, the inhibition of mycobacterium growth by different biofilm-forming pathogens was also significantly reduced by the addition of L-arginine (LAR), which is the first-line antibiotic for biofilm formation [16]. LAR is an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of mycobacterium, which is a key component in the biofilm formation. LAR inhibits the growth of a wide range of mycobacterium, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., and Pneumococcus spp. [17]. LAR is also the first-line antibiotic for biofilm formation. LAR inhibits the growth of many clinically important pathogens, including C. neoformans, E. coli, and S. aureus [18]. LAR inhibits the growth of mycobacterium by inhibiting the ribosomal protein Gpa1 and the enzyme that is responsible for the biosynthesis of L-arginine, which is the first-line antibiotic for biofilm formation [19]. LAR is also the first-line antibiotic for biofilm formation.
