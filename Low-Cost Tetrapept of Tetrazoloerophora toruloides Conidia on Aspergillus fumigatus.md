## Abstract
In the past two decades, the incidence of non-infectious fungal infections, such as Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans, have increased dramatically. Candida infections, on the other hand, are a relatively uncommon manifestation of fungal infections. The current availability of antifungal drugs could limit their effective therapeutic window. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antifungal effects of the phenolic compound metronidazole against C. albicans.

The minimum effective concentration (MEC) for the phenolic compound metronidazole was determined using the CLSI guidelines.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The causative agent(s) of these IFIs are typically classified into at least five types: (1) Candida albicans, (2) Cryptococcus neoformans, (3) Aspergillus fumigatus, and (4) Mucor circinelloides. These three yeast species are the most common fungi that cause IFIs in the intensive care units of hospitals (ICUs). Of these, the most common invasive yeast types in ICUs are: C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. However, the mortality rate is high (75%) despite the availability of antifungal therapies. The mortality rate in the intensive care unit is as high as 50% in patients with invasive candidiasis [1], [2], [3]. The most common type is A. fumigatus and the remaining opportunistic species are C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. However, other opportunistic yeast such as C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei are increasingly being recognized as important pathogens of ICUs [4], [5], [6].

The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections has changed dramatically in the past decades.


## Methods
. Plant Material and Collection
The leaves of Yunnan in the autumn of 2012 were collected from the east of Yunnan Province in the central region of China, and were immediately labeled with the following abbreviations: white stem with pileus, red stem with pileus, green stem with pileus, and yellow stem with pileus. The leaves of Yunnan were identified by their description. This species was collected from the Yunnan Forest of Shanxi Province, China, and the specimens were identified by Chinese and American taxonomists (C. Chen and T.B. Wiens, 2005). The material was dried and deposited in the China Forestry Culture Collection Center (CFCC). The specimens were identified by the following search terms: Ranges of white stem, green stem, pileus, yellow stem, pileus, and yellow stem with pileus. The identity of the specimens was confirmed by the ITS and LSU sequences. The samples were identified as belonging to the Yunnan Yunnan Plant Collection (YTBCC) and they were kept in the Herbarium of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Northwest China. The samples were deposited in the Herbarium of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

4.2. Plant Material and Collection
The dried leaves of Yunnan were sterilized by boiling for 15 min, followed by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The leaves were washed with sterile water and air-dried. Then, the leaves were ground into fine powder by using a blender. The powdered powder was kept in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for three days, then the powder was transferred to a new flask and stored at -20°C until use. The following procedure was followed for the preparation of the extract: powder was kept in a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for three days, then, the ground powder was transferred to a new flask and stored at -20°C until use.

4.3. Preparation of the Extract
The extract was prepared according to the method of Ehrlich (1959) [36] and was purified by evaporation method using a rotary evaporator (Eppendorf 3500, Germany) at 50°C. The crude extract was dried in an oven at 60°C for 30 min, then, the extracted extract was stored at -20°C until use.


## Results

.3. Fungal Selection of Phylogenetic Factors
A total of 35,843 phylogenetic trees were constructed for the four fungal lineages analyzed (Fig 6). The topologies of the trees constructed from the topologies of the tree topologies and the topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 6. The topologies of the topologies of the topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 7.

The topologies of the topologies of the tree topologies and the topologies of the tree topologies were largely similar for each of the three dikaryotic lineages. The tree topologies of the topologies of the topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 8. The topologies of the topologies of the topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 9. The topologies of the topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 10. The topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 11. The topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 12. The topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 13. The topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 14. The topologies of the tree topologies and the tree topologies of the tree topologies are shown in Fig 15.

A total of 38,207 characters were used in the analysis of the sequences.


## Discussion
The species of Tetrazoloerophora in our survey has been shown to produce two kinds of conidial structures, a perithecial conidium and a perithecial hyph. These conidia are usually present in the conidial state, which is characterized by thick-walled conidiomata, simple conidiogenous cells or large conidia (Srinivasan and Baral, 2012). In the present study, we show that Tetrazoloerophora species produce perithecia with conidia that are small in diameter and not very thick-walled (7.8-8 µm) or well-developed (8-12 µm) (Fig 1B, Table 1) (Tropical). These conidia are also not as thick-walled as those of the perithecial type. The perithecial structures of the Tetrazoloerophora are not as well-developed as those of the perithecial type, as previously noted for other species (Srinivasan and Baral, 2012).

The fungal structures on the perithecial type were compared to that on the perithecial type of Tetrazoloerophora perithecia. The results of the comparison showed that the perithecial type of Tetrazoloerophora perithecia is similar to that of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. (Fig 1A). The differences in the fungal structures were caused by the different types of fungal structures in the perithecial type and the perithecial type of Tetrazoloerophora.

The Tetrazoloerophora perithecia are simple and thin-walled, whereas the perithecial type of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. is narrow and thin-walled. The perithecial type of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. has a hyphal body with two conidiophores, whereas the perithecial type of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. has two conidiophores. The perithecial type of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. is also different from the perithecial type of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. The hyphae of Tetrazoloeromyces sp. are not as well-developed as those of Tetrazoloeromyces sp.
