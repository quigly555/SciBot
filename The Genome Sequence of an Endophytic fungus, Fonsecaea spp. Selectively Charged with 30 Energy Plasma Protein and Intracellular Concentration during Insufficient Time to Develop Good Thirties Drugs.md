## Abstract
Fungal infection of the brain is associated with a variety of conditions such as metabolic disturbances, neurodegenerative disorders, and immune deficiencies, but the brain fungal infections in general are difficult to manage and often have high morbidity and mortality rates. The first-line therapeutic approach used to treat fungal infections is based on the use of antifungals that target essential fungal proteins. However, the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has recently been applied for the treatment of aspergillosis, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological syndromes. The use of antibody-based therapies has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of these antifungals. This review provides an overview of the use of fungal mAbs in the treatment of fungal infections.


## Introduction

These two diseases, invasive fungal disease and systemic fungal disease, are caused by Candida sp., Histoplasma capsulatum, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides spp., Blastomyces spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, and Sporothrix schenckii, which are the most common fungal pathogens. C. albicans and C. neoformans are opportunistic pathogens, which cause systemic infections of the skin, nails, and mucosa. In immunocompromised patients, C. albicans can disseminate from the gastrointestinal tract to the bloodstream and cause life-threatening systemic infections. In the 1980s, a major outbreak of C. albicans and C. neoformans in the United States and Europe resulted in the deaths of at least 600,000 people, mainly in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Venezuela, and Argentina [6, 7]. Although the number of patients with systemic fungal infections is declining, systemic fungal disease continues to be a problem. In Brazil, systemic fungal disease has killed more than 3,000 people in the past year [8].

The mechanisms that control fungal infections are complex. The most common is fungal glycosylation. The second is the interaction between the fungus and the host’s immune system. The third is the regulation of the immune response and the final is the immune response. Glycosylation is associated with the production of antiphospholipids, complement components, and glycoconjugates. Glycoproteins are secreted from fungi and they serve important roles in fungal life cycles. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the glycosylation pathway has been studied in detail and the biochemistry of glycosylation has been reported. In C. albicans, only the CcpA-encoding gene, which is not active on glycoproteins, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored carbohydrate [9, 10]. In C. albicans, the glycosyltransferase inhibitor, rapamycin, affects the biosynthesis of the major glycoproteins, glycolipids, lipids, proteins, and proteins involved in the cell signaling.


## Methods
The gene deletion was confirmed by a double PCR assay (Table 1. To ensure gene complementation in the selected fungal strains, a final PCR product of each gene was obtained by using the primer pair FRG1 and FRG2, the hph gene from the plasmid pJAF1 [22] and the plasmid pJAF2, the promoter region from the cdc43 gene and the actin gene from the plasmid pNP1 [23]. For the first PCR, a 1.0 kb fragment of the Hph gene was amplified using primers Hph1 and Hph2, the hph promoter region was amplified using primers Hph3 and Hph4 and the actin promoter region was amplified using primers ACT-F and ACT-R, and the plasmid pNP1-F and pNP1-R were used as positive control, respectively. The second PCR product of each gene was amplified using primers ACT-R and ACT-F, and the hph gene from the plasmid pNP1-F and pNP1-R were used as positive control. The final PCR product was then purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) transformation. All the fungal transformants were then screened by PCR for the presence of Hph and hph-regulated transcripts using primer pairs Hph1 and Hph2, and hph-F and hph-R, respectively.

Molecular biology
The fungal transformants were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium at 28 °C for 3 days. The mycelium was harvested, washed with sterile distilled water and flash-frozen in liquid N_2.

For the differentiation of fungal strains into a more heterogeneous population, mycelium was filtered with sterile distilled water to yield about 10 g of mycelium. This was kept at 4 °C overnight in a shaking incubator. The mycelium was washed with sterile distilled water and flash-frozen in liquid N_2. The mycelium was ground to a fine powder in liquid N_2.


## Results
genome encodes a novel ATPase inhibitor, MPA, that is able to grow under different condition. Here, we first compared the growth of Fonsecaea spp. with that of other Fonsecaea species. We also analyzed the growth of Fonsecaea spp. on AMB, which is the standard drug for blood transfusion and for the introduction of experimental drug agents into the blood. The fungal growth was much slower in the presence of AMB compared to that in the presence of PDA (Fig 4).

In Fonsecaea spp., the higher concentration of PDA (25 mM) leads to a significantly lower growth rate than that in the presence of AMB (Fig 4). In contrast, the growth of Fonsecaea spp. was significantly faster than that in the presence of PDA (Fig 4).

We then examined whether the inability of Fonsecaea spp. to grow under high PDA, compared to that in the presence of AMB, is caused by a defect in cell viability. The viability of Fonsecaea spp. in the presence of PDA was compared to that in the absence of PDA. As expected, the presence of AMB did not affect the viability of Fonsecaea spp. under these conditions (Fig 5).

Fonsecaea spp. Are Proteinsensitive to Metabolite-Induced Cell Death
In order to investigate the effect of AMB on the cell-cell system, we were concerned about the ability of Fonsecaea spp. to kill cells, as they were known to have a reduced capacity for killing extracellular proteins, particularly extracellular proteins with important activities such as DNA replication and degradation [2], [3].

To investigate whether Fonsecaea spp. are sensitive to the cell-cell system, we were also concerned about the viability of the cells under both conditions. For example, in the presence of AMB, the growth of Fonsecaea spp. was significantly inhibited compared to that in the absence of PDA (Fig 6). In contrast, the viability of Fonsecaea spp. in the presence of PDA was also inhibited by AMB (Fig 6).


## Discussion
proliferatum is predominantly generated by hydrogen peroxide in response to the oxidative burst of peroxid. In F. proliferatum, the superoxide anion is generated by the glyoxylate cycle which is mainly carried out by glyoxylate dehydrogenase (GDH) and is used as a carbon source for the synthesis of NADP. The reduced superoxide anion of F. proliferatum is used as a substrate for the formation of lipid peroxidation in this fungus. As previously described, there is a limited availability of high concentration of superoxide anion for the production of energy (30) and the generation of the superoxide anion is normally used as a carbon source. For the production of a large number of molecules (including superoxide anion) in the liver, the energy of the superoxide anion is extracted from the ethyl acetate in the medium of F. proliferatum by the methanol in the presence of superoxide anion [33]. In this study, the superoxide anion of F. proliferatum was used as a carbon source in the case of the yeast and other fungi. To establish the viability of the fungus in the presence of superoxide anion, the cells were treated with superoxide anion for 3 h and then the cells were transferred to the culture medium. The results showed that the yeast and other fungi had the ability to produce superoxide anion in the presence of superoxide anion and the superoxide anion was extracted from the yeast and other fungi. These results indicated that the fungus could produce superoxide anion in the presence of superoxide anion.

In this study, the superoxide anion extracted from the culture medium of F. proliferatum was also extracted from the superoxide anion and it was found that it was present in the culture medium. The superoxide anion from the culture medium was digested with ethanol and its metabolic activity was assessed by ^13C NMR. The ^13C NMR spectrum showed that the ^13C NMR spectrum of the superoxide anion was characterized by three major peaks (Figure 2). The three peaks were assigned to the two oxygen atoms at C-4 (C-4, C-3) and C-7 (C-7, C-3).
