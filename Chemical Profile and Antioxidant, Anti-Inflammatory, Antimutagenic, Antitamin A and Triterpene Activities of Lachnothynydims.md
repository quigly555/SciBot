## Abstract
Sphingolipids are essential nutrients for the life of animals. They play important roles in the regulation of inflammation, infection and development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of sphingolipids in animals infected by the Plasmodium falciparum parasites, which are known to produce severe pulmonary diseases and invasive aspergillosis in humans.

Spho sphingolipids were isolated from the liver and kidney of the infected mice and from the spherules of the animals infected with the parasites, and their levels were detected by real time turbidity and by using a kit supplemented with a microplate reader method. The activity levels of sphingolipid metabolites were also assessed by measuring the in vitro antioxidant activity of extracts from the animals, and the results indicated that the extracts exhibited a good activity against the Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus strains. In particular, the extracts showed antimalarial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.

The results of this study indicated that extracts from the liver and kidneys of the animals can be used as alternative sources of sphingolipids for the development of immunocompromised patients with aspergillosis and might be a potential source of novel compounds for the treatment of aspergillosis.


## Introduction
Fungi are often found in nature and are important for the survival of their microorganisms. However, information on the distribution of fungal species in the natural environment is limited. The natural soil is a rich source of microbial flora that has been linked to many climatic conditions (e.g., temperature, rain, etc.) and its biogeography. The rainfall in many countries is mainly monocultured and is often too high for most fungi to be propagated on-site. Therefore, these fungi are commonly found in soil or trapped in soil particles by plants and animals.

The ability of fungi to form true hyphomycetes (i.e., hyphomycetes that do not form true hyphomycetes) has received special attention in recent years (1). These fungi have been reported as pathogens of plants (2) and as potential pathogens of animals (3). In fact, some of the plant pathogenic fungi are already described as plant pathogenic.

The genus Phylloporus contains more than 150 species, most of them associated with diseases on soybean, caused by the production of transgenic lines (4). Soybean is one of the most important crops in the world, and soybean plants are considered to be one of the most important sources of bioenergy (5). However, the number of reported cases of phytopathogenic fungi is still insufficient to mention this topic (6).


## Methods
The Lachnothynchroic acid-free . *Nelmiari broth (Lachnothynchronoprenone, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was prepared according to the standard method of Grierson and Broda [39]. For the preparation of lachnothynchroic acid (Lachnothynchronoprenone) stock, 1.0 L of the Lachnothynchronoprenone (1.0 mg/mL) was mixed with 1.0 L of 1.0 M H_2SO_4 and the mixture was poured into a screw-cap tube and poured into the Lachnothynchroic acid broth (Lachnothynchronoprenone). The lachnothynchroic acid-free L. *Nelmiari broth (Lachnothynchronoprenone) stock was prepared according to the standard method of Grierson and Broda. The lachnothynchroic acid-free L. *Nelmiari broth (Lachnothynchronoprenone) stock was prepared as described in [40] and stored at -20 Â°C.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activities
The antimicrobial activities of Lachnothynchroic acid and Lachnothynchroic acid (Lachnothynchronoprenone) in general are described in [41] with modifications. Briefly, the lachnothynchroic acid and Lachnothynchroic acid (Lachnothynchronoprenone) stock were dissolved in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) and adjusted to a final concentration of 0.125 mg/mL. The lachnothynchroic acid and Lachnothynchroic acid (Lachnothynchronoprenone) stock were diluted in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted to 0.125 mg/mL.

## Discussion
These genera are in contrast to other genera that were observed in previous studies (Barrer et a. 2010). Also, B. thalli, B. catappa, B. heimaeyensis, B. aphanoate, B. palleosa and B. taiwanensis were the most frequent genera in the analyzed samples.
