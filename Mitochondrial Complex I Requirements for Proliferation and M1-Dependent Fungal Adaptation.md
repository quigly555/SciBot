## Abstract
In the past several years, in vitro activities of the major lineages of the essential oil (EO) from the essential oil of Portugal Cabernet Sauvus were investigated and compared with those from the cuminous oil (CRP) and Cabernet Sauvitins. The results showed that the latter have an important role in plant health promotion, antioxidant defense, antifungal drug resistance and virulence factor production. In addition, the EO from the CRP showed strong antifungal and antimalarial activity against Candida spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichosporon asahii, while it was inactive against Trichoderma reesei and dermatophytic fungi, and it was inactive against dermatophytes and other pathogens. The results also showed that the EO from the CRP is a promising candidate for the development of a new chemical and biological control agent that can be used as herbal or nutraceutical product with antioxidant, antifungal and/or anti-inflammatory properties.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is an inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) that results from the formation of microorganisms within the brain, spinal cord, or spinal fluid (1). It is a chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by a decline in ion homeostasis and neuronal death, which results from a combination of infectious agents and immune cells, termed as immune encephalitis (1). It is estimated that approximately 2 million people develop neurological encephalitis each year (2). Meningoencephalitis is an infectious disease that can lead to life-threatening neurological sequelae and can lead to permanent neurological sequelae, which can be devastating, even life-threatening, in those with immune compromise (3, 4).


## Methods
Fungal cells were collected by centrifugation (5000×g for 10 min), and the supernatant was mixed with distilled water, and then centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 mi. The pellet was suspended in sterile distilled water and then centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and the pellet was centrifuged again. The pellet was then suspended in sterile distilled water and the supernatant was placed on a chilled stainless steel filter paper. The filtrate was then removed and the filtrate was decanted. The filtrate was then resuspended in 500 µl of sterile distilled water. The filtered filtrate was then subjected to a bead beater (Biorad) to precipitate fungal spores and debris. The precipitated fungi were then washed twice with 400 µl of distilled water, and then dried at 37°C until the pellet was resuspended in sterile distilled water. This method was selected because it allows for the detection of fungal biomass without affecting the morphology of the cells.

In vivo KAAP–GFP Experiments
For in vivo KAAP-GFP experiments, 5 × 10^4 fungal cells (vol/vol) were cultured in 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Costar) at 25°C for 16 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation (4,000×g for 5 min), and the supernatant was removed. The cells were then resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors (20 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively) and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were then resuspended in PBS containing ß-mercaptoethanol (20 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL, respectively) and the optical density was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).


## Results
verticillioides, the proliferation and differentiation of . verticillioides was monitored by nuclear division. The majority of the F. verticillioides cells grown in liquid nitrogen (MM) were dead (Figure 4A). The growth of F. verticillioides in MM was similar to that of cells grown in MM supplemented with glucose and fructose, but the yeast was still viable (Figure 4B). In contrast, the proliferation of F. verticillioides in MM was significantly reduced compared with that in MM supplemented with glucose (Figure 4B). The F. verticillioides cells grown in MM had a low cell density, which was consistent with the increased cell biomass observed for F. verticillioides in the MM. The fumonisin-dependent growth of F. verticillioides in liquid nitrogen was not caused by increased fumonisin production (Figure 4C). Furthermore, a high amount of fumonisin was detected in the fumonisin-stained spleen (Figure 4D).

To further evaluate the effects of F. verticillioides on the immune response, we measured the levels of cytokines in the spleen, liver, and kidney after treatment with FLC, a FLC-induced cytokine (Figure 5). There were no differences in the cytokines evaluated in the spleen after treatment with FLC in either the control or FLC-treated groups (Figure 5). These data indicate that FLC does not induce the immune response in F. verticillioides and is not involved in the proliferation of F. verticillioides.

F. verticillioides Is Necessary for Fungal Growth and Development

To test the role of FLC in the pathogenicity of F. verticillioides, we further tested the growth of F. verticillioides in MM and mouse serum. The growth of F. verticillioides was completely inhibited in MM supplemented with FLC (Figure 6). The growth of F. verticillioides in MM was slightly reduced compared with that in MM supplemented with glucose and fructose (Figure 6). The increase of FLC in MM was not accompanied by an increase in the amount of FLC in the spleen (Figure 6). These data indicate that FLC is not required for the growth of F.


## Discussion
neoforman. Consistent with previous studies, we found that a robust expansion of the fungal-specific IFS in the wild-type strain was observed. We then conducted a comparison of the three functional categories of IFS in the wild-type and the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant, which is composed of a new protein-protein interaction domain (PI3D) with an N-terminal IFS domain (Fig 5). The filamentous fungus C. neoformans encodes a complete set of IFS proteins including the PI3D domain (Dicer and Pka1) and the PKA1 domain (Dicer and Pka2) (40). While the PI3D domain is found in many pathogenic fungi, the N-terminal IFS is conserved in other fungi (41). To investigate the role of PI3D domain in the maintenance of IFS-mediated gene expression, we tested the impact of IFS on the expression of a PKA1 gene in the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant, which encodes a novel PI3D protein. We found that the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant is much more sensitive to the stress-inducing agent C. neoformans H99 than the wild-type strain. We also showed that the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant is not as robust as the wild-type strain. Overall, the Cda1 mutant is more sensitive to H99 than the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant strain. Interestingly, we observed a severe reduction in the sensitivity of the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant to oxidative stress (Fig 6B). However, we found that the cda-2<U+0394>/<U+0394> mutant was less sensitive to oxidative stress (Fig 6D). The relationship between the IFS and oxidative stress responses is still unclear, but it has been shown that the glyoxylate cycle is activated by oxidative stress (42).
