## Abstract

The average age of the patients was 40 years (range from 40-88 years), and the median CD4 cell count was 208 cells/mm. The treatment regimen consisted of three to four doses of amphotericin B/sodoprazole, flucytosine, and fluconazole, followed by three to four doses of fluconazole. The treatment outcomes were cirrhosis (75.7%), disseminated tuberculosis (56.8%), and total lung, lung, and liver loss (27.5%). Patients treated with amphotericin B/sodoprazole had lower burdens of lung, liver, and spleen tumor cells (TC) and had lower survival after all four doses of amphotericin B/sodoprazole and fluconazole. A higher proportion of patients had TCD4 cell counts >50/mm3. A higher proportion of the patients had a CD4 cell count =50/mm3 after all four doses of amphotericin B/sodoprazole and fluconazole.

Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous yeast that is responsible for several serious human diseases. In recent years, the emergence and spread of multiple uncommon drug-producing pathogens including C. albicans, a causative agent of fatal fungal meningoencephalitis, has heightened the need for new anti-cryptococcal drugs and have made the search for alternative therapies a priority.

We conducted a single-center, prospective, in-hospital study to evaluate the in-hospital outcomes of patients with cryptococcosis. A seeded, well-controlled, ongoing, well-managed multicenter, observational study design was conducted. Hospitalization, study end date, in-hospital cryptococcosis outcome were compared between the control and treatment arms. Key variables were in-hospital cryptococcosis outcome, in-hospital cryptococcosis outcome over 28 days, in-hospital cryptococcosis outcome by week 14, and week 28 outcome by week 52.2.

A total of 116 patients (292 patients control and 139 patients treatment) were enrolled in the in-hospital, in-hospital multicenter study design. Overall survival (64.7%) was associated with in-hospital cryptococcosis, in-hospital and control arms, and between the two arms. Independent predictors independently associated with mortality were in-hospital cryptococcosis (odds ratio = 3.


## Introduction
Meningitis and meningoencephalitis are important causes of mortality in adults in developing countries, especially in Brazil. ^1 The incidence of infection has risen sharply in the last few decades due to advances in modern medical care, modern diagnostic laboratory techniques, modern diagnostic laboratories and increased awareness of the epidemiology of the disease. ^2 However, the real incidence of infections is still relatively high, and most reports focus on cases reported in remote areas, mainly rural areas. Moreover, the high cost of medical care, the absence of a well-established medical center and the emergence of drug resistant strains pose a challenge to public health. ^3

Several approaches have been used to control infection, such as direct vaccination with live attenuated vaccines, live microorganisms (LMS) and/or live clinical laboratory infection (LCHI), although these have been often ineffective. ^4-6 Several commonly used methods are the aerosol route and contact with aerosolized microorganisms. ^7,8 These can be considered as early and accurate measures to control fungal infections in a hospital setting. ^9,10 However, the use of aerosol methods has inherent disadvantages, such as the need to transport microorganisms across building walls, the risk of microbial resistance to the method and the development of resistance in the laboratory environment.


## Methods
Microorganisms and growth conditions
A total of 16S rRNA gene sequences of C. albicans and C. tropicalis were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (CBI) database. For the construction of the yeast-macrophytosis complemented strain, a total of 1 × 10^4 cells of C. albicans and C. tropicalis were grown in YPD broth at 30°C in a shaker incubator for 3 days. Then, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and adjusted to OD_600 of 0.2 using a hemocytometer. The cells were incubated at 30°C for 2 days, and then, the medium was harvested, washed with PBS, and adjusted to a final concentration of 10^6 CFU/mL with PBS. The media was removed, and the yeast cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The yeast cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS to obtain a final volume of 2.5 × 10^5 cells/mL. The cells were mixed with 2 mL of PBS to obtain a yeast cell suspension of 1 × 10^5 yeast cells/mL, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT). The culture was washed with PBS, and the supernatant was discarded. The yeast cells were washed with PBS, and the corresponding cell suspension was added to 1 mL of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The media was removed and the yeast cells were washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in PBS, and the number of CFU/mL was determined using a hemocytometer.

Cell growth and purification
The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for 4 days at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The culture was then harvested, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL of 0.


## Results
To determine the biological function of the C. neoformans Fungi and the H. capsulatum HCO3 gene, we constructed a C. neoformans HCO3 deletion strain by introduction of a single copy of the HCO3 gene into a H99 strain and verified that the HCO3 gene is functional. After growth at 37°C and under iron-limiting conditions, the wild-type strain was indistinguishable from the H99 strain (Figure 1A). We also generated a C. neoformans HCO3 deletion strain by introducing the single copy of the HCO3 gene into the H99 strain.


## Discussion
neoformans requires a high index of suspicion and multidisciplinary involvement of cryptococcosis managemen. In our study, we observed that the majority of the patients were diagnosed with cryptococcal pneumonia, with only a minority presenting with pulmonary symptoms. This was supported by a median duration of cough (28 days vs. 6 days) and significant bronchiolitis with presence of bronchiolitis (75% vs. 70%) in one quarter of the patients. We also observed that the majority of patients were admitted with anemia (81% vs. 47%) and mild to moderate hemolytic anemia in another patient (50% vs. 25%) in our study.

Risk factors of complications of pulmonary cryptococcosis in cirrhosis with pulmonary monoclonal antibodies
The clinical presentation of C. neoformans infection in cirrhosis is nonspecific and usually presents as a solitary infection (3). Pulmonary cryptococcosis can present with multiple forms (1, 5, 7). Among the two forms, cryptococcosis is most commonly associated with pulmonary tuberculosis and may also present as a solitary infection. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is most often associated with cirrhosis with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. In addition, some patients have a presentation of bilateral focal pulmonary nodules (3). In our patient, the pulmonary cryptococcosis was mild, with 2% of the patients presenting with bilateral focal nodules and 2% of the patients presenting with bilateral focal pulmonary nodules. Other types of pulmonary nodules include pleural effusion (6), submandibular (5), or sub-pulmonary nodules (4).

The majority of the patients had fever, chest pain, and cough (41%), and non-responsive to antibiotic therapy (20%) (8). In our patient, the patient had normal chest radiographs and no fever or cough. In our patient, he had a negative CD4 result, which was corroborated by histopathology and immunohistochemistry (9). Therefore, we strongly suggest that the patient had a pulmonary cryptococcosis.

In our patient, the pulmonary cryptococcosis was initially diagnosed as C. neoformans infection (8). As we have been unable to diagnose C. neoformans by conventional means, we have thought that the diagnosis of C. neoformans infection with MitoR (14) was incorrect.
