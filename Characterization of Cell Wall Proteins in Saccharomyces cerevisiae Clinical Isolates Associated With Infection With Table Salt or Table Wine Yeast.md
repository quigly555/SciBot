## Abstract
The human fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans can use the cytoplasm to transport small molecules and transition from yeast to filamentous state. The filamentous form can colonize the central nervous system (CNS) in a number of human diseases and can initiate immune responses against the host strain. We recently reported that C. neoformans can uptake and use glucose and protoporphyrin, two amino acids that confer antiviral activity, but we did not know that this activity was necessary for the virulence of this fungal pathogen. In order to determine whether the C. neoformans cytoplasm is a membrane compartment capable of loading cargo with a cargo-specific protein, we generated a conditional mutant in the cytoplasm of C. neoformans clinical strain CRF 23.

We found that the overexpression of the ribosomal protein kinase gene (RRKF 1), which encodes the protein C1q, affects the virulence of C. neoformans. Further, we also found that the C. neoformans Rbf-1 strain can survive and replicate in macrophages. The overexpression of the amino acid ALUBP 3, which encodes a glycolytic serine/threonine/threonine/threonine/threonine transporter, did not affect the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of systemic cryptococcosis.

## Introduction
However, the most extensively studied pathway of bacterial cell wall, the polysaccharide matrices, has only a small fraction of the diversity of those present in the cell wall of most eukaryotic organism. The cell wall is typically composed of linear and branched chains of monomers, and many of these are formed by the intracellular polysaccharide matrices of bacteria [23], [24], [25]. The bacterial cell wall is thought to be the major barrier to the pathogen entry, and the cell wall is thought to be the most sensitive by a wide range of physiological models [26], [27].


## Methods
Briefly, yeast cells were cultured in YPD broth (.2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 1% glucose) at 37°C in a shaking incubator. Then, 5-µL of yeast cells (0.25 OD600 nm) were added to the medium to which the bacterial strains were added by mixing 10 µL with the yeast cells. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 4 h to reach complete cell wall formation. The cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min, and resuspension in PBS. The cells were then resuspended in PBS and the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular devices, USA).

Yeast cell walls were obtained from S. cerevisiae culture supernatants obtained from peritoneal macrophages (a kind gift of Dr. Jeffrey Reiner) cultured in a cell-free culture medium. Macrophages were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by density centrifugation of the cells at 1,500 × g for 1 min. The cell walls were collected and washed with PBS. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was then subjected to one-step extraction of protein extracts from yeast cell walls using the Bradford method (12). The protein extract was denatured at 80°C for 10 min in order to obtain the resulting supernatant. Then, the pellet was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The supernatant was mixed with 20 mL of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS. The solution was mixed with a 0.2 mL of centrifugal forceps (0.22 mm, 0.25 mm, and 0.25 mm) and gently shaken.


## Results
cerevisiae is typically based on analysis of the peptide chain length and/or the length of the individual peptides [34. The proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water or oat liquor was analyzed using GGA or BHI broth extracts as substrates. Table 3 shows the total proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water and oat liquor, and the proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of BHI broth extracts. Figure 3 shows the proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water and oat liquor, and the total proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of BHI broth extracts. The total proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water and oat liquor was 61.6, 39.5 and 40.9% higher than that of S. cerevisiae cultured in the absence of BHI broth extracts, respectively. The proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water and oat liquor was 54.3, 47.2 and 50.3% higher than that of S. cerevisiae cultured in the absence of BHI broth extracts, respectively. The total proteome of S. cerevisiae cultured in the presence of tap water and oat liquor was 39.9, 49.5 and 48.4% higher than that of S. cerevisiae cultured in the absence of BHI broth extracts, respectively.

Total RNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Culture-Assisted Infection With Table Salt or Table Wine Yeast
In this study, S. cerevisiae culture-mediated infection was performed using a P. pastoris culture-assigned infection with yeast cultured in the presence or absence of tap water or oat liquor. Figure 4 shows the results of the method of the present study. The total RNA of S. cerevisiae culture-assigned infection with Table Salt or Table Wine Yeast was higher than that of S. cerevisiae culture-assigned infection with P. pastoris culture-assigned infection with tap water or oat liquor.

In Table 3, the total proteome of S. cerevisiae culture-assigned infection with Table Salt or Table Wine Yeast was 31.2, 28.3 and 40.3% higher than that of S.


## Discussion
The majority of species examined in this study are well-known and widely distributed in the world, which is highly unusual for a new species. The identification of this species in the genus Peziza is a rare event, but the identification was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analyses. A phylogenetic tree based on ITS sequence analysis (Fig 2) is the most consistent for Pezizomycotina, and a phylogenetic tree based on the ITS1-5.8S region is the most consistent for basidiomycetous yeasts, which are the most widespread.
