## Abstract
Glucan synthases are key players in the glucome of fungal pathogens, and the aim of this study was to generate an enzyme specific for the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that possesses an intact glaA subunit. This enzyme encoded by glaA was identified as an Als3p GlcA4 GlcA4Gly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. The enzyme was also expressed in A. fumigatus and was found to be essential for growth and morphogenesis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS or other immunosuppressive disorders. [1], [2] Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and eosinophilic mucormycosis (EPM) are the most common IFIs in patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. [1]Epm and EPM are life-threatening diseases that are difficult to treat. [1]The most common clinical presentation is aspergillosis, which is defined as the acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with/without thrombosis or other abnormalities of the hematopoietic system. [3]Some of the most common manifestations include pyelonephritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis (pTBM), and fungal keratitis.


## Methods
albicans ATCC 90028, . glabrata ATCC 2001, and C. krusei ATCC 6258. The strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at room temperature. For the preparation of the mycelial phase, the mycelial samples were harvested from potato dextrose agar slants at room temperature. Mycelia was washed with sterile deionized water and re-suspended in sterile deionized water. For the fungal growth, the mycelial samples were harvested from mycelia grown on PDA slants at room temperature. The fungal suspensions were adjusted to a density of 1 × 10^8 CFU/mL and incubated at 30 °C for 10 days in a growth chamber. Then, the mycelium was washed twice with sterile deionized water and re-suspended in sterile deionized water.

RNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the mycelium samples using a QIAamp RNA purification kit (Qiagen). The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and an RNA Nano Lab kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA concentration was determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The quality of the RNA was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and an RNA Nano Lab kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

## Results
As expected, the mDA-producing strain JEC21 was highly susceptible to both spermidine and rifampicin, the former of which was unable to kill the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cell. As observed in Figure 2B, the JEC21 strain was also highly susceptible to either of the two agents. The susceptibility of the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cells was determined by incubating them for 10 minutes in the presence of 0.2 M of SDS, and 3 h of treatment with spermidine. As shown in Figure 2C, the susceptibility of the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cells to rifampicin was decreased compared to that of the wild type (Figure 2D). However, the susceptibility of the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cells to spermidine was not significantly different from that of the wild type. The susceptibility of the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cells to rifampicin was also determined, with the susceptibility of the wild type (Figure 2E) and the susceptibility of the <U+0394>fdr<U+0394> cells (Figure 2C) to spermidine.

The FDR^+ strains showed a mild fungicidal effect on both fungi at concentrations of 50 µg/ml (Figure 2F). However, it was not as strong as in the case of the FDR^+ strains, which showed a fungicidal effect at concentrations of 0.5 µg/ml (Figure 2G). The results suggest that the C. neoformans FDR^+ strains have a higher sensitivity to spermidine than the C. neoformans FDR^+ strains.

Loss of FDR^+ Strains Reveal Their Sensitivity to the Drug of Their Antagonistic Potential
Although the results of the chemogenicity testing are in line with those from the fungicidal tests, it is important to note that both the drug-drug interaction and the drug-drug interaction are dependent on the drug species used as the antagonists.


## Discussion
Although the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly higher in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples, the relative abundances of the fungi were lower in the NPL and PL soil. Moreover, the relative abundances of the fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples, while the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples.

The relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples, but the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly higher in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples. In addition, the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples, while the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples. It is known that the bacterial and fungal communities in soil and in soil-based farming are characterized by a high diversity of soil-inhabiting fungi. A similar pattern was observed in soil-based farming in India. Some of the soil-inhabiting fungi (Bacillaris, Cercospora, Cladosporium, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Alternioides, Aspergillus, Aspergillus, and Penicillium) are generally considered as undistinguishable from other soil-inhabiting fungi. In this study, the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly lower in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples, while the relative abundances of the related fungi were significantly higher in the NPL and PL soils than in the soil samples.
