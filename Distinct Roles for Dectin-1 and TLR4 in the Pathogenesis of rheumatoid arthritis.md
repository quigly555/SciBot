## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal disease that affects Cambodian people. In 2017, the Ministry of Public Health in Cambodia implemented several anti-fungal treatment recommendations for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans infection. This study aims to review the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of fatal case of cryptococcosis in Cambodian population in 2017.

A representative clinical record of cryptococcosis cases were reviewed and compared between 2017-2018. Demographics, clinical data, treatment, and fatal outcome were recorded. Biodazar co-infection and Chinese language exposure were analyzed.

A total of 107 fatal cases of cryptococcosis were reported in 2017 (77.3%). The most common co-infection was HIV (71%), followed by other co-infections (14.9%) and other (7.7%). Co-infection with other co-infections was associated with a 69.5% mortality rate. Meningeal enhancement was the most common presentation of cryptococcosis (39%), followed by cutaneous (17.5%) and subcutaneous (11.7%) manifestations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed cryptococcal infection. Treatment with fluconazole (CZ) and amphotericin B (AmB) was associated with increased survival time in comparison to HIV-infected controls. Co-infection with Cryptococcus neoformans was associated with increased liver burdens, altered mental status, and decreased CSF burden.

Cryptococcosis can occur in Cambodian patients with HIV, and the most common form is cutaneous manifestation. Fluconazole and other immunosuppressants should be started early to improve survival.


## Introduction

The association between Rheumatoid factor and IFI has been reported in both hematological and experimental settings [13. The involvement of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI has been demonstrated in patients with RA and in RA patients with RA. In RA patients, the Rheumatoid factor and Rheumatoid factor are present in the same cellular organ, whereas in RA patients, the Rheumatoid factor and Rheumatoid factor are restricted to the bone marrow [13]. In RA patients, the Rheumatoid factor and Rheumatoid factor are present in the same organ, whereas in RA patients, the Rheumatoid factor and Rheumatoid factor are not found in the bone marrow [13].

In contrast to the involvement of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI, the role of Rheumatoid factor has been demonstrated in the literature. The role of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI has been demonstrated in the RA patient in whom the role of Rheumatoid factor was absent [14], [15]. The role of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI has also been demonstrated in RA patients in whom the role of Rheumatoid factor was absent [15].

The role of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI has been demonstrated in RA patients in whom the role of Rheumatoid factor was absent [14]. The role of Rheumatoid factor in the development of IFI has also been demonstrated in RA patients in whom the role of Rheumatoid factor was absent [15].

Rheumatoid factor is involved in the development of IFI, which is associated with its involvement in both benign and experimental forms of IFI [15]. The association between Rheumatoid factor and IFI has been demonstrated in both benign and experimental forms of IFI, such as Crohn's disease and gastritis [16]. The association between Rheumatoid factor and IFI has also been demonstrated in patients with Crohn's disease and gastritis, which are associated with a less severe form of IFI, namely Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease gastritis [17].


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTp) tool. The distribution of the proteins encoded by the two transcription factors was determined by using a BLASTp (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTp). For this, we used a gene-specific BLASTp (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLASTp) tool with a similar parameters as described previously [54]. To check the phylogenetic position of rheumatoid arthritis protein in the Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, we used the protein sequences obtained from the Pathogen Box Project (http://www.phplog.org/) and a phylogenetic tree of rheumatoid arthritis using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in the AIC software (http://www.acces.org/cgi-bin/AIC). In order to determine the phylogenetic position of rheumatoid arthritis in the Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, we used the data of the Pathogen Box Project (http://www.phplog.org/) and a phylogenetic tree of rheumatoid arthritis using the AIC. To confirm that the proteins encoded by the two transcription factors were different, we conducted a second round of phylogenetic analyses using the data obtained from the Pathogen Box Project. The sequences of the proteins obtained from the Pathogen Box Project were analyzed using the AIC software.

Identification of the orthologs and ortholog groups of rheumatoid arthritis proteins
The orthologs of rheumatoid arthritis protein sequences were identified by using BLASTP (http://www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with a maximum e-value of 20^-10. We aligned the protein sequences with ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and used a phylogenetic analysis to identify the homologs of rheumatoid arthritis proteins.


## Results
The Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were higher in the joint arthritis joints than in the spleen, but the expression of Dectin-1 and TLR4 were not significantly different (P-values are not significant, two-tailed t test. Interestingly, the Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were significantly higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test). The Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression pattern in the spleen was similar to that in the joint, except Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test). However, the Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression patterns in the joint joints were significantly higher than in the spleen, indicating that Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test). The Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression pattern in the spleen was similar to that in the joint, but Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test).

In addition, the Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression patterns in the joint joints were also similar to that in the spleen. However, Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were significantly higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test). The Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression patterns in the joint joints were similar to that in the spleen. However, Dectin-1 and TLR4 expression levels were significantly higher in the joint joints than in the spleen (P-value is not significant, two-tailed t test).


## Discussion
albicans, . glabrata, and C. tropicalis (Fig 5) are similar to the distribution in a number of human pathogenic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and suggests that the pathogenic fungi within the human pathogenic fungus C. albicans and C. tropicalis are functionally distinct from the pathogenic fungi in the fungi other than C. albicans (Fig 5).

Although the majority of C. albicans and C. tropicalis isolates contained orthologs of LALF genes, only one LALF gene was present in all isolates (Fig 5). A possible explanation is that LALF genes are acquired through a process involving a long DNA repair process. In other words, this gene might be a component of a larger, yet still unidentified, gene cluster. The LALF gene has been identified in C. albicans as a putative transcript regulator in the ERK/Calcogene pathway, a component of the ERK/Calcogen-4 kinase pathway [34]. The ERK/Calcogen-4 kinase (ERGK/Calcogen-3) is responsible for the ERK/Calcogen-2/Calcogen-5 transcriptional activation in response to ER stress [35]. In C. albicans, a putative ERK/Calcogen-2/Calcogen-5 transcription factor (ERGK/Calcogen-3) is also involved in the ERK/Calcogen-4/Kos1-1 signaling pathway [36].

The transcription factor CDC10 (Cdc10-3) is required for the activation of the ERK/Calcogen-3/Calcogen-5/ERK/Calcogen-2/Calcogen-5/ERK/Calcogen-2 pathway in response to ER stress [37]. In C. glabrata, CDC10 is required for the transcription of the ERK/Calcogen-3/Calcogen-5/ERK/Calcogen-2/Calcogen-5/ERK/Calcogen-2 pathway [37]. Similarly, C. albicans and C. tropicalis have two CDC10 orthologs (Fig 5).
