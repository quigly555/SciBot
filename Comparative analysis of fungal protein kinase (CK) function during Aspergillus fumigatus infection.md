## Abstract
In our previous study, we found that mice lacking a functional LPK gene, LecE, exhibited a different phenotype from control mice. In this study, we constructed two independent lines of evidence to demonstrate that LPK deficiency resulted in increased virulence in a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis. The LPK null mice were treated with immunosuppressants and immunotherapy, and they were sacrificed at 4, 7, and 12 months of age to evaluate the virulence of LPK deficiency in their respective models of pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results show that this is the most sophisticated in vivo approach to investigate LPK-mediated mechanisms of infection. The immunological data and virulence comparison from these lines show that immunotherapy did not cause an increased virulence in LPK-null mice. However, treatment with immunotherapy that did not cause immune cell hypergrowth, i.e., immunotherapy with an aspartyl protease inhibitor (iPSI), or histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDA) reduced the virulence of LPK-null mice. This reduction was associated with an overall decrease in pulmonary aspergillosis loads and a reduction in the number of fungal cells in the spleen and peritoneal cavity. Moreover, we found that immunotherapy with an aspartyl protease inhibitor (iPSI), but not immunotherapy with a protein kinase inhibitor, increased the protein kinase activity of the spleen and peritoneal cavity. These data suggest that immunotherapy with a protein kinase inhibitor may increase the fungal burden in the spleen and peritoneal cavity, which in turn may increase the fungal survival during invasive pulmonary disease.


## Introduction
Azo-invasive fungal infections (AIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. A number of genera are capable of causing diseases in healthy hosts, while some strains of the so-called ‘black yeasts’, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and C. albidus, have been reported to cause disease in immunocompromised patients [1]. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is considered to be a benign commensal of the skin and mucosa of humans, whereas the pathogenic yeast C. glabrata, as a pathogen of immunocompromised patients, has been reported to cause disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals [2]. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen that can cause disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. It is generally recognized as a commensal of the human body and can cause disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. It is typically recognized as a harmless commensal of the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract of the human host, but can also cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. It can cause serious fungal infections, especially in the immunocompromised patient, which are difficult to be contained by the host immune system. Although a number of other yeast species are known to cause disease, the predominant species in the clinical setting are Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, and Candida glabrata [3].


## Methods
We used a modified version of the method described by Halat et a. [27] to measure kinase activity in Aspergillus fumigatus as described previously [10, 12, 19]. Briefly, we used the kinase assay to measure kinase activity in Aspergillus fumigatus spores that were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C in the presence or absence of a different substrate (nitrate salt). We then determined kinase activity in Aspergillus fumigatus spores that were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. The kinase activity was defined as the unit of the kinase activity expressed as a ratio of the kinase activity of a control fungus to the enzyme activity of a control strain (in µg/g protein). The kinase activity of the control strain was expressed as a ratio of the kinase activity of the control strain to that of the enzyme activity of the fungus.

To assess kinase activity in Aspergillus fumigatus, the kinase assay was performed by incubating spores with different concentrations of 5 µM of SDS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 °C for 30 min in a shaking incubator. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 µM SDS (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was diluted 1:5, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. The kinase activity of the control strain was expressed as a ratio of the kinase activity of the control strain to that of the enzyme activity of the fungus.

Determination of fungal load in the cell supernatant
The fungal load was determined by using a standard method of counting the number of yeast cells that have consumed a volume of 0.5 ml of cell supernatant (extracellular vesicles) by a hemocytometer (Leibniz laboratory, Germany). Briefly, a volume of 0.5 ml of supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The number of yeast cells that have consumed a volume of 0.


## Results
Fungal burden and control of rheumatic disease
The fungal burden of the lungs of BALB/c mice was assessed by using a pulmonary fungal burden curve. The results showed that all animals had a 1.5 log_10 CFU/ml of pulmonary fungal burden during the first day of the experiment. By day 3, the pulmonary fungal burden had reached a plateau in all animals, which was similar to the results of the fungal burden curve (Fig 1). On the same day, the mice were sacrificed to determine the total number of animals per animal. The number of animals per animal in all animals was higher than in the control animals.

Culture results
All the control animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and the lungs were harvested at the end of the experiment. The fungal burdens in the lungs were assessed in all the animals by using the Mucorales Collection Mice Collection (http://mccl.imdb.org/mucor/). A significant difference was found in the lung fungal burden of all the mice (p<0.001), with a significant difference in the lung fungal burden of 0.05 log_10 CFU/ml between the control and the mutant strains (Fig 2). The fungal burden of the lungs was significantly higher in the mutant strain compared with the control (p<0.001). The mean fungal burden of the lungs was 1.7 log_10 CFU/ml in the mutant strain compared with 1.7 log_10 CFU/ml in the control strain.


## Discussion
neoformans orthologue of . neoformans) was performed. As shown in Fig 5A, both CKs and C. neoformans Ck2/3 are required for full virulence of C. gattii during Aspergillus infection. Consistent with this finding, Ck2/3 deletion is only deleterious in C. gattii infection. The Ck2/3 deletion is also essential for Aspergillus growth and conidiation at elevated temperature. Consistent with the observation that C. gattii infection of mice with Ck2/3 knockout is more toxic than C. neoformans infection (Fig 5B), the use of Ck2/3 knockout mice for C. gattii infection probably had more severe consequences in vivo. In addition, Ck2/3 knockout mice with Ck2/3 knockdown were more toxic to C. gattii than C. neoformans infection. Taken together, these data suggest that Ck2/3 is required for full virulence of C. gattii.

During Aspergillus infection, both Ck2/3 and Ck2/3 knockout mice with Ck2/3 knockdown were more toxic to C. gattii than C. neoformans infection. Taken together, these data suggest that Ck2/3 is required for full virulence of C. gattii.

In this study, we identified the functions of Ck2/3 and Ck2/3-deficiency in the ability of C. gattii to cause lethal disease. We used a total of 12 C. gattii virulence determinants to study the role of Ck2/3 and Ck2/3 deficiency in virulence of C. gattii. We found that Ck2/3 and Ck2/3-deficiency was required for full virulence of C. gattii during C. gattii infection. Our data suggest that Ck2/3 and Ck2/3-deficiency is important for virulence of C. gattii, although Ck2/3 is not required for full virulence of C. gattii during C. gattii infection.

In summary, we identified the functions of Ck2/3 and Ck2/3-deficiency in C.
