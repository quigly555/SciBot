## Abstract
Melanin is a natural pigment used in human medicine and is one of the main ingredients in many cosmetic products. Due to its easy handling and removal, it is widely distributed in the environment and has become a modern main ingredient in cosmetics, among other products. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of the black pigment on the health of mice and cat.

Mouse model was exposed to a medium containing 1 × 104 melanin molecules/ml. Three treatments were conducted: exposure to 1 ml. solution only in saline solution (100 µg/ml for 14 days), followed by exposure to 1 ml. solution in saline solution in concentrate solution (500 µg/ml for 30 days), followed by exposure to it alone in saline solution in concentrate solution (500 µg/ml for 14 days), followed by exposure to it alone in concentrate solution in concentrate solution only (100 µg/ml for 30 days). The results were compared with those obtained for a control. A decrease in the concentration of melanin was observed for treatments that did not lead to death (neutropenic mice), and for the following treatments (cutaneous (n = 14), vasculitis (n = 14), and encephalitis (n = 14), respectively.


## Introduction

A number of plant-derived strategies for controlling fungal pathogenesis involve chemical inhibitors of the enzyme that catalyzes the C-terminal glutamate dehydrogenase (SDH. The SDH is a cysteine-rich kinase and catalyzes the catalytic conversion of C-to-Gly at position C of the glycosyl donor-acceptor protein (Gly-C) to form a C-terminal nucleophile. Several studies have demonstrated that glufosyl a-(Gly)-Gly could inhibit fungal growth and virulence in a number of different mammalian models including Galleria mellonella, Acanthamoeba castellanii, and mice (Kaake et al., 2007, 2009; Zhang et al., 2011; Lopadura et al., 2013; Segal et al., 2014).

The G protein-coupled protein GPI mediates a rapid intracellular glutamate uptake by Gßß and G<U+03B3>ß receptors (GPI-R) (Stirling et al., 1990). Although G protein-coupled receptors, Gß and G<U+03B3>, have been demonstrated to have broad spectrum activity (Koskola et al., 1993; O'Brien et al., 1995), Gß-mediated signaling is limited by its catalytic activity, which is mainly accomplished by the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family of proteins. G protein-coupled receptors can be divided into two types: G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and non-protein GPCRs (Gpr) (Wang et al., 2013). Non-protein Gpr have a low affinity for Glutamate, and the G protein-coupled receptor (G-CRR) is responsible for the subsequent degradation of glutamate in the Glutamate-rich plasma membrane (Gulati et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2007). However, the G protein-coupled receptor (GCR) family can also be divided into two subfamilies: the “Non-protein” GCR family and “protein GCR” subfamily.


## Methods
 2011) in . musculus brain heart infusion (BAL) medium (Becton Dickinson, Franklin, MA, USA) at 37°C for 5 days. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 at the end of the incubation to prevent the aggregation of a volatile protein into the cell walls. The pH was also maintained at 5.0 by using 1 M NaOH at a constant temperature. Cells were cultivated in a 10% (v/v) glycerol-1% w/v ethanol solution (Eliopoulos et al., 2003) and grown at 28°C until the exponential phase.

All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the experimental design was consistent with previous studies (Fernandez et al., 2017). The cell-free supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 20,000× g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL PBS. The cell-free supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 15 min at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL PBS and centrifuged at 20,000× g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was recovered by passing the supernatant through a 0.45 µm-pore-size filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and the number of yeast cells was determined by optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).

To assess the antifungal activity of the fungal protein A1 in vitro, we used the method of Lin et al. (2003), in which the fungal cells were grown in the presence of a salt solution (2% sucrose, 2% KH_2PO_4, 0.3% NaCl) and then incubated in a total medium (20 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/L ammonium sulfate, 1 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L K_2HPO_4, and 20 g/L FeSO_4).


## Results
Both cell cycle-related genes were highly enriched in the G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells, and also in the G3/H3 and G3/H3 cells (Fig 1C. In addition, the expression of some genes, such as the transcription factor CNA1 and the N-terminal GTPase Rho1, were also detected in the G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells (Fig 1D). These results demonstrated that the cell cycle processes are regulated in a G4/H4 manner and, consequently, the expression of some genes in G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells was higher than in the G3/H3 and G3/H3 cells.

Gene expression analysis
The protein expression of several genes was further investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis to investigate their expression in the G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells (Fig 2). The results indicated that the expression of a number of genes was significantly increased in the G4/H4 cells, but not in the G3/H3 and G3/H3 cells (Fig 2). The most significant changes were found in the C-terminal GTPase Rho1 and the N-terminal GTPase Rho2, which were highly expressed in both G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells (Fig 2A,B).

We also performed qRT-PCR analysis to further evaluate the protein expression pattern of some genes in G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells (Fig 2). The results indicated that the expression of some genes was significantly increased in the G4/H4 cells, but not in the G3/H3 and G3/H3 cells. These results indicated that the cell cycle processes are regulated in a G4/H4 manner and, consequently, the expression of some genes in G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells was higher than in the G3/H3 and G3/H3 cells.

Cell cycle-related genes were also identified in the G4/H4 and G4/H4 cells (Fig 2).


## Discussion
commune has been shown to encode a gene encoding chitin deacetylase that plays an important role in fungal virulence and cellular differentiation in . fumigatus (Mayer et al., 2006). In this study, we show that the gene HapE, a member of the Hap family, is required for S. commune to produce fungal pyruvate. The ability to use pyruvate for pyruvate is evolutionarily conserved in fungi. However, pyruvate is also a major component of cell wall, which also gives rise to other cell wall components such as fungal cell wall proteins, and is required for fungal growth and survival in the host (Liang et al., 2006). The requirement for pyruvate also means that the fungal cells need to convert pyruvate into pyruvate. The gene encoding HapE was recently found in the Hap family of glycosyltransferases (GTPases) in S. commune, which are involved in the synthesis of the pyruvate-containing glycosidic bond. This result suggests that HapE may be a conserved fungal gene required for pyruvate metabolism.

In S. commune, the genes encoding glycosyltransferases are also present. A high glycosylation index of A. fumigatus cells is required for growth in the presence of glycerol, but it is not required for its production of pyruvate, which is required for pyruvate production by most fungal species (Edwards et al., 2002). This result suggests that glycosyltransferases play a key role in pyruvate biosynthesis in S. commune. However, the pyruvate-related genes are not present in S. commune. This result suggests that the glycosyltransferase genes are conserved in S. commune.

In contrast to the pyruvate-mediated biosynthesis, pyruvate is also produced by several other fungal species, including S. commune and A. fumigatus. The first protein that was identified in A. fumigatus was pyruvate transporters.
