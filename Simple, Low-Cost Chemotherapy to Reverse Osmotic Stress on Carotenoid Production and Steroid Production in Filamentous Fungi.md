## Abstract
Fungal infections are currently treated with amphotericin, itraconazole and posaconazole. However, the impact of these treatments on antifungal resistance, tolerance and efficacy of these drugs is still largely unknown.

We evaluated antifungal susceptibilities and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of two triazoles (1.25 mg/ml and 0.08 mg/ml) against Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium sp. were determined. The study was also conducted using a serial case-shend set of atopic dermatophytes from a young patient with a history of atopic dermatophyte dermatophytosis and antifungal therapy. Internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) primer was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Candida species are the second most common causative organisms and the most common cause of bloodstream infections. However, other fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, are rarely encountered in these patients. In this study, we report a case of disseminated candidiasis caused by P. brasiliensis in an immunocompromised patient with progressive diabetes mellitus.


## Methods
cerevisiae was measured in the presence of urea-dextrose (UDR) as previously described (32) using the method described by Riehmeyer et a. (39). Briefly, S. cerevisiae cells were grown to log phase in SC medium (0.9% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 1% glucose, 1 mM CaCl_2, pH 7.0), pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500× g for 5 min and resuspended in SC medium. A 1:1 mixture of urea-rose (0.9% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 1% w/v tryptone, 0.02% w/v sodium nitrate, pH 7.0) and uridine (0.5% w/v uridine, 1.2% w/v glucose, 0.04% w/v ammonium sulphate) was added to the SC medium to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The urea-dextrose mixture was mixed with 5 mL of SC medium and the urease-dextrose (UDR) activity was measured at 30 °C, using the method described by Riehmeyer et al. (39).

The C. albicans URA3 gene was used to identify the C.


## Results
2.1. C. neoformans Isolation and Identification of Putative Proteins
From the samples of fungal hyphae, two putative proteases of C. neoformans were identified (Table 1). It was observed that both proteins were found in fungal cells from different stages of the fungal life cycle.


## Discussion
pombe revealed that the results of methanol and pyrrolidine as the main substituent in these two compounds, are in good agreement with the results obtained by the present researc. In comparison, the results of methanol and pyrrolidine were in a weakly agreement with the results obtained by the two study conducted by Zhou et al. [18] for S. pombe, which indicated that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains. The results obtained by the present study for the antagonistic growth of Ustilago maydis and Candida albicans, respectively, corroborate with the results obtained by the present study on U. maydis and the results obtained by Zhou et al. [18].

Furthermore, the results of methanol and pyrrolidine were in agreement with the results obtained by the present study conducted by Zhou et al. [18]. In comparison, the results obtained by the present study were in a weakly agreement with the results obtained by the two study conducted by Zhou et al. [18]. In the present study, the results obtained by the two studies were in a weakly agreement with the results obtained by the present study, which indicated that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains. The results obtained by the present research, which indicated that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains, corroborate with the results obtained by the present study conducted by Zhou et al.

Also, the results obtained by the two studies were in a weakly agreement with the results obtained by the two studies conducted by Zhou et al. [18]. The results of the present research indicated that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains. Zhou et al. [18] also concluded that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains. Zhou et al. [18] also concluded that the compounds were not able to generate sufficient propidium-40 to yield satisfactory results for the endophytic fungal strains.
