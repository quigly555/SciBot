## Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine whether TumORH would interfere with TBM-induced lipid peroxidation, lipid peroxide synthesis, and membrane fluidit.

BLAST searches between TumORH and unigenic DNAs from different sources revealed TumORH-coated and unigenic DNAs were more abundant in the TBM extracts and DAF-N extracts than TBM-coated DNAs. The accumulation of lipids (Carvacrol, C16-19, C18-19, C18-19), superoxide dismutases (eosinophils), peroxidases (coumarins), and peroxidases (ß-D-glucans) in TUMORH-coated and unigenic DNAs were significantly higher than those in unigenic DNAs. Further digestion of TUMORH-coated and unigenic DNAs revealed a significantly higher accumulation of superoxide dismutases and peroxidases and a higher accumulation of peroxidases in TBM-coated than in unigenic DNAs.

TumORH-coated and unigenic DNAs were found to have higher accumulation of lipids than TBM-coated. TUMORH-coated DNAs were more abundant in the extracts and DAF-N extracts. The accumulation of peroxidases and peroxidases in TBM-coated and unigenic DNAs were higher than those in unigenic DNAs. Further digestion of TUMORH-coated and unigenic DNAs revealed a higher accumulation of peroxidases and a higher accumulation of peroxidases in TBM-coated than in unigenic DNAs. Further digestion of TBM-coated DNAs revealed a higher accumulation of peroxidases and a higher accumulation of peroxidases in TBM-coated than in unigenic DNAs. Further digestion of TUFM-coated and unigenic DNAs revealed a higher accumulation of peroxidases and a higher accumulation of peroxidases in TBM-coated than in unigenic DNAs. Further digestion of TUMORH-coated DNAs revealed a higher accumulation of peroxidases and a higher accumulation of peroxidases in TBM-coated than in unigenic DNAs.


## Introduction
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a human systemic granulomatous disease that primarily affects South American and Amazonian regions of Brazil, causing 1.5 million deaths each year [1]. The disease is caused by two species of the genus Paracoccidioides, P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii. The species are divided into four subspecies, Pb01, Pb01a, Pb01b, and Pb01c.


## Methods

TUFM has been shown to occur in pathogenic algae, fungi, and bacteria [13, 14, 15, 16. Therefore, to avoid such effects, TUFM should be used in conjunction with inhibitors of TUFM [13, 15]. For instance, the effect of trans-3-acetyl-N-acetyl-N-methyl-N-N-propylamine (3A) on the growth of C. albicans and C. albicans amylase in the presence of 3A in a liquid culture was assessed in a liquid culture of C. albicans. The inhibitory effects of 2-oxo-N-acetyl-N-N-methyl-N-N-propylamine on C. albicans were tested by performing the assay in a liquid culture of C. albicans. The assay was performed in duplicate and the results were monitored. The assay was performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean ± SD.

4.4. Effect of Glutathione-Dependent Activation of TUFM
The inhibitory activity of TUFM has been shown to occur in the presence of glutathione-dependent activation of the G-protein kinase C-terminal region of C. albicans, [13, 16]. The activity of these two enzymes was previously shown to be enhanced by oxidative stress in a culture of C. albicans. Therefore, TUFM was used to test the inhibitory activity of the enzyme in a culture of C. albicans. The inhibition of the growth of C. albicans was also determined in a culture of C. albicans. The assay was performed in quadruplicate and the results were expressed as the mean ± SD.

4.5. Effect of Homocysteine-independent Activation of TUFM
The effect of homocysteine-independent activation of TUFM was performed using a culture of C. albicans. The activity of these two enzymes was previously shown to be enhanced by oxidative stress in a culture of C. albicans. The assay was performed in quadruplicate and the results were expressed as the mean ± SD.

## Results
Therefore, the TUFM-deficient mutant was subjected to a liquid culture experiment to test whether TUFM induces the TUFM-dependent accumulation of dead cell. Under standard conditions, TUFM-deficient cells exhibited a wild-type phenotype, whereas wild-type cells were highly robustly proliferating, indicating that TUFM was involved in the regulation of the TUFM-dependent cell death phenotype. To determine whether TUFM is directly regulated by the PKA pathway in the context of P. aeruginosa, we used a mutant strain of P. aeruginosa that is unable to express GFP and thereby induces death of P. aeruginosa by the PKA pathway (data not shown). To further examine the effects of TUFM on P. aeruginosa, we generated a double knockout strain of P. aeruginosa to express the PKA promoter (Fig 4a). Wild-type cells were highly robustly proliferating and, under standard conditions, they displayed wild-type levels of PKA activity (Fig 4b). By contrast, the double knockout mutant of P. aeruginosa failed to generate PKA activity when cultured in liquid medium containing 10 µM TUFM (Fig 4c). These results suggest that TUFM is directly regulated by the PKA pathway in the context of P. aeruginosa PKA-mediated death.

The inability of P. aeruginosa to produce PKA activity under the PKA inhibitor rapamycin, which targets the PKA pathway, may explain the low PKA activity observed in the TUFM-deficient mutant. We found that the PKA activity of the wild-type strain was significantly inhibited by rapamycin, whereas the PKA activity of the TUFM-deficient mutant was greatly enhanced (Fig 4d). These results suggest that PKA activity of the PKA pathway is strongly repressed by TUFM, whereas PKA activity of the TUFM-deficient mutant was strongly repressed by rapamycin, a novel inhibitor of PKA.

We further tested the effect of TUFM on P. aeruginosa virulence by assessing the killing of P. aeruginosa by measuring fungal burden.


## Discussion
TUFM is also required for development of resistance to fungal infections [39.

Our study demonstrated that SREB-mediated signalling plays a crucial role in promoting survival of C. albicans in the environment. It is possible that some species of SREB are able to survive in the extreme habitats of the marine environment, such as the extreme pH of the arctic and the extreme temperature of the Tibetan Plateau. However, this is not the case for SREB-deficiency in other marine species, which are known to be extremely sensitive to environmental stresses. For example, the SREB-deficiency in P. digitatum was observed to be relatively uncommon in the Arctic, which has an extremely harsh environment, which can be related to the extreme temperatures of the Tibetan Plateau [40]. In addition, the occurrence of the species S. terrestris in the Arctic has been observed [41]. Further research is required to investigate whether the SREB-deficiency in other marine species is the result of SREB-dependent or independent environmental factors, and whether SREB is required for adaptation to the extreme environments of the Arctic and the Tibetan Plateau.

The ability to cope with environmental stresses was found to be a key determinant of survival of marine fungi in the environment. Our results indicated that the marine fungus C. albicans, which is known to be sensitive to the extreme environments of the Tibetan Plateau and Antarctic [42], is able to survive in the extreme environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. The Antarctic fungal species S. pararoseus and S. natalensis are also known to be sensitive to the harsh environmental conditions of the Antarctic [43,44]. However, there is limited data available on the survival and virulence of these two marine fungi. The other marine fungi, such as the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis, are also capable of adapting to the harsh environmental conditions in the Arctic and Antarctic environments, suggesting that adaptation to extreme environments is also an adaptation to the Antarctic environments [35]. In addition, the study of S. commune revealed that the fungus C. commune was able to adapt to the extreme habitats of the Tibetan Plateau [45]. In this study, we demonstrated that the strain R265 was able to survive in the extreme habitats of the Antarctic, where other marine fungi such as P. digitatum and S.
