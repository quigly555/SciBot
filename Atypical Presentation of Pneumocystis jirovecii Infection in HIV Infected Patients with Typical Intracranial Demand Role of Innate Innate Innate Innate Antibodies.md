## Abstract
Fusarium species are known to be the major pathogens of mushrooms and other edible mushrooms that can be cultured in a number of different media. Microbial communities known to be important for the reproduction of virulence factors in pathogens are also investigated or often used to develop novel strategies to control fungal pathogens. To survive in the human host, fungi need to be able to acquire nutrients, namely iron. The uptake of iron from the host and the subsequent lowering of the host-fungus balance determine the virulence of Fusarium isolates. In this work we used Fusarium oxysporum to grow on fortified medium containing high iron (FeCl3) as the only media with sufficient iron availability to kill Fusarium sp. infectiones. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for FeCl3 was determined using two different fungicides, one with high FeClo (30 mg/kg) and low-FeClo (25 mg/kg). The minimal effective concentration (MEC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MLC) were determined using two different fungicides with similar in vitro activity. The MIC of FeClo and low-FeClo were equivalent to 0.07 µM and 0.031 µM respectively for FeClo and 0.06 µM and 0.002 µM respectively for MEC. The minimal effective concentration (MIC) for FeClo and low-FeClo were 0.12 µM and 0.1 µM respectively for FeClo and 0.125 µM and 0.2 µM respectively for MLC. The viability of the Fusarium isolates upon treatment with FeClo, low FeClo, and low-FeClo were similar to that of colonies treated with low concentrations of low concentrations of these fungicides. We conclude that the fungicides used here have an important role in the virulence of Fusarium sp. and therefore have potential for preventing fungal diseases in humans.


## Introduction

The aim of this study was to examine the presence of direct, indirect, and indirect antibodies in the infectious agent of Pneumocystis jiroveci. Antibody titers were measured using immunodiffusion of the same antibodies and the second antibody titers were determined using indirect immunodiffusion. This study builds on previously published studies that demonstrated that immunization with Entamoeba histolytica direct antibody (ELA) does not induce the antigen-specific T cell response (4-6). This study demonstrates that ELA may be a powerful antigen-specific antigen, which can be used to stimulate the antigen-specific T cell response.

There was no significant difference in the antigenic repertoire of the antibodies from the two infections. The antigenic repertoire of the two Pneumocystis jirovecii infections was similar. However, the antigenic repertoire differed significantly in terms of antigenic repertoire. The most abundant antigen in the Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was IgG3, followed by IgG2A, IgG3B, and IgG4. This difference in antigenic repertoire likely reflects the antigenic specificity of the immunization regimen (7). The antigenic repertoire of Pneumocystis jirovecii was similar to that in HIV infected patients. The antigenic repertoire of the same Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was comparable with that in HIV-infected patients. The antigenic repertoire of the same Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was similar to that in HIV-infected patients. The antigens were antigen-specific, and these antigens were presented in the infected patient's blood. The same antigen was presented in the infected patient's blood, and this antigen was eliminated from the body.

The aim of this study was to determine the antigenic repertoire of the antigens from the two Pneumocystis jirovecii infections.


## Methods

Statistical analysis
Sensitivity analysis (ratio test) and specificity (ratio value) were performed by conducting a sensitivity and specificity analysis on the data obtained from the study populatio. The specificity analysis was performed by conducting a specificity analysis on the data obtained from the study population, in order to identify possible contaminants.

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 [44] and all statistical methods were performed using the “statistics” module in the “statistics” module. The statistical analyses were performed using the “vegan” package in R. The “Budget” module was used to calculate the contribution of the individual tests for the category of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated pneumonia, the “clinical” module was used to calculate the contribution of the individual tests for the category of clinical pneumonia, and the “OCT” module was used to calculate the contribution of the individual tests for the category of disseminated pneumonia. The “Data Analysis” module was used to analyze the data and analyze the relationships between the individual tests and the covariates, and the “Statistical Analysis” module was used to analyze the data.

The cumulative incidence of C. parapsilosis (COP) was calculated by dividing the number of patients who were clinically suspected of having COP by the total number of patients with COP. The cumulative incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) was calculated by dividing the number of patients with PJP by the total number of patients with PJP, and the cumulative incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia (PPM) by the total number of patients with pneumocystis. The cumulative incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (NPC) was calculated by dividing the number of patients with nosocomial pneumonia with the total number of patients with NPC, and the cumulative incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia (PPM) by the total number of patients with pneumocystis.


## Results
jirovecii (MIC = .00 µg/ml) and low mortality rate (median survival = 73.6%). In HIV-infected patients with typical intracranial demand (ICR), Pneumocystis jirovecii infection had a higher MIC (4.00 µg/ml) and mortality rate (median survival = 20.0%) compared with systemic candidiasis (ICR) (0.53% vs. 8.50%; P = 0.0006). However, in HIV-infected patients with typical ICR (ICR-infected patients), Pneumocystis jirovecii infection had a higher MIC (4.00 µg/ml) and mortality rate (median survival = 15.0%) compared with systemic candidiasis (0.52% vs. 8.50%; P = 0.039).

In HIV-infected patients with typical ICR, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was characterized by a higher mortality rate (median survival = 21.3%) compared with systemic candidiasis (0.52% vs. 8.50%; P = 0.037).
