## Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is the causative agent of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. It causes community-acquired and acute liver and urinary tract diseases, and is responsible for a large clinical and public health problem. The resources of the literature are scattered and the research on this organism is currently improving. However, the literature on other nosocomial pathogens is less updated and more on-going studies are published. The goal of this review is to update the knowledge on Acinetobacter baumannii and provide an update on the literature data on this important pathogen.

This article is part of a special issue on nosocomial infections in a Chinese cohort, which contains information on the most frequent causes of hospital-acquired and acute liver and urinary tract diseases in Chinese.

In this nationwide study, we investigated the most frequent causes of hospital-acquired and acute liver and urinary tract diseases in Chinese by year of birth, and examined the distribution of these causes in the population by year of residence.

We found that more than half of the participants in this study were girls. The study participants were mostly residing in rural areas of China. The most common infection categories were enterococci and vaginal tract pathogens.


## Introduction
The role of host immune responses in the virulence of fungal pathogens is currently well described, yet many of the existing knowledge on the interactions of pathogens with host cells remains unravelle. The understanding of the host-parasite interaction is therefore of fundamental importance for the development of new approaches to the control of fungal infections.

Emergence of the immune response against fungal infections was first described in the mold Aspergillus nidulans (“Aspergillus niger”) [1], a pathogenic yeast that causes aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients [2]. Aspergillus niger has a wide host range and is often isolated from the environment, often asymptomatically or at high concentrations [3]. The fungus grows as a mold in the respiratory tract of the human host and as a yeast in the soil of warm-blooded animals. Under certain conditions, a fungus can switch from the filamentous form to the yeast-like form, which it causes disease in. Depending on the nature of the infection, A. niger can cause as many as 30 different diseases, depending on the immune status of the individual [4].

The A. nidulans repertoire of virulence factors is diverse, and the best-characterized virulence factors are the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms [5]. In A. nidulans, the dimorphic switch is controlled by two different signaling pathways, one that depends on ERK signaling and the other that regulates the expression of virulence-related genes, such as those involved in the metabolism of cell wall-degrading enzymes [6].

Yeast-to-hyphal transition is a key event in human disease and has been implicated in many aspects of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer [7], diabetes [8], inflammatory bowel disease [9], rheumatoid arthritis [10], diabetes [11], and asthma [12]. The dimorphic switch is also regulated by a myriad of other signaling pathways. This dimorphic transition involves the production of a morphological switch from the filamentous, yeast form to the yeast-like form, which involves the sequential expression of the ERK1/2 and ERK3/4 genes [13].


## Methods
The optimal concentration of each nanoparticle was determined by two-fold serial dilution method and according to previous studies [11, 14, 15. Three different formulations were tested, viz., FK506 (5.0 µg/mL), FK506 (0.25 µg/mL), FK506 (2.0 µg/mL), and FK506 (0.25 µg/mL). In our tests, the optimal concentrations of each nanoparticle were determined in triplicate in a 96-well microplate. We investigated the inhibition of FK506/DAP interactions by using four different formulations of the nanoparticles. The minimum effective concentration (MEC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the drug that produced no decrease in microorganism growth. The MEC value was defined as the lowest concentration that prevented any change of macro-organisms growth in relation to growth control. The inhibition of FK506/DAP interactions was determined by the observation of the reduction in the growth of the microorganism by the FK506/DAP combination in the presence of FK506 nanoparticles.

The results of the experiments were confirmed by the quantitative assay, i.e., the concentration of FK506/DAP/MIC values. The MIC values of FK506/DAP/MIC were determined by the DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) method. MIC values of FK506/DAP/MIC were also determined. In addition, the results were confirmed by measuring the microorganism growth after DAP/MIC as previously described [11]. The experiments were performed in triplicate in a 96-well microplate. The MIC values of FK506/DAP/MIC were measured by the assay of the inhibition of FK506/DAP/MIC by the FK506/DAP combination.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study
The following test was performed on the study group. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 [18]. The pharmacokinetics of FK506 and DAP/MIC on clinical isolates of C.


## Results
The essential oils of Arabidopsis, . albicans, C. neoformans, F. oxysporum, and F. graminearum were found to have anti-microbial activities against the different bacteria that were tested [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Essential oils of plant species, such as Arabidopsis, C. albicans, and F. graminearum, have a strong antioxidant activity and they have the potential to be used as antifungal agents in skin infection models [22,23]. The antifungal activity of Arabidopsis, C. albicans, and F. graminearum is thought to be mediated by the essential oil of C. albicans and C. neoformans. Antifungal activity of Arabidopsis and C. albicans is in accordance with their potential as potential phytoalexins. C. neoformans is a pathogen that causes human and animal infections, so it is important for human health. The phytoalexins, which are also found in plants, have a great potential for the development of a novel phytoalexin, phytoalexin-like, phytoalexin-like, and phytoalexin-like, respectively [24]. The essential oils of Arabidopsis, C. albicans, and F. graminearum have a strong antioxidant activity against the different bacteria tested [25]. The antifungal activity of Arabidopsis, C. albicans, and F. graminearum is in accordance with their potential as novel phytoalexins.

## Discussion
fumigatus and that this fungal surface protein is recognized by the immune system in response to fungal infection [41. The analysis of TNF-a and other NO-signaling pathways in A. fumigatus in response to fungal infection supports the idea that fungal pAMPs are also produced by other fungal species and/or could act as virulence factors in Aspergillus infections. In A. fumigatus, a high frequency of PAMP-1 production by TNF-a, NO-signaling and interleukin (IL)-2 production by dendritic cells is observed when infected with A. fumigatus [42]. TNF-a expression by chitin and/or cell wall components was previously reported to be upregulated in A. fumigatus cells infected with A. fumigatus [42]. Our findings suggest that fungal pAMP-1 expression could be induced by fungal infection and that this induction may be mediated by TNF-a and other NO-signaling pathways.

TNF-a and IL-2 are well established in A. fumigatus cell wall. TNF-a and IL-2 are involved in the activation of chitin-related genes, such as AGL1 and AGL2 [43]. TNF-a has also been reported to be involved in the activation of the cell wall integrity pathway, including NF-<U+03BA>B [44]. IL-2 is also involved in the activation of the cell integrity pathway [45]. IL-2 was previously reported to be activated in the myeloid cell and macrophage cell lines treated with pAMP-1 [42]. The data from our study suggest that fungal pAMP-1 expression is induced by fungal infection and that this response is associated with TNF-a and IL-2.

In this study, we showed that the fungal pAMP-1 was activated in the fungal cell wall. We found that the cell wall integrity and pAMP-1 expression was induced by A. fumigatus, which may be a response to fungal infection or a response to other stimuli. In A.
