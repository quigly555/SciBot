## Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue that threatens the viability of almost all systems and threatens the viability of the agricultural and medical industries that are reliant on it. The main driver of this resistance is antimicrobial resistance, a genetically determined, self-encompassing group of genes that is of increasing importance for the design of agricultural and medical antimicrobial strains. These genes have been continuously transferred from mother cells to vast hierarchical groups of pathogens, a status that is determined by three core attributes of the organism: (1) resistance to antimicrobial compounds by the resistance gene-encoding fusion proteins of the target gene, 2) adherence to the host cell and (3) pathogenicity. These attributes have been subject to many genetic engineering efforts that have resulted in significant changes in the genome architecture of multiple important drug target genes.


## Introduction
In contrast, this study demonstrated that the CCR3-knockout mice did not kill the corresponding wild-type (WT) cells, and thus did not distinguish between the CD4 cell lines from WT and CCR3-knockout mic.

In this work, we investigated the effect of the CCR3-knockout mice on the expression of the CCR3-knockout genes. We found that the control mice were able to clear the CD4 cell lines from the mice with strong CD4 cell depletion, and the expression of CCR3-knockout genes was increased. In addition, CCR3-knockout mice were more susceptible to experimental infection with the murine model. This is in contrast to WT mice, which are insensitive to CCR3. The CCR3-knockout mice are more susceptible to infection with the murine model, which results in a similar infection pattern to WT mice. In conclusion, the CCR3-knockout mice are more resistant to infection by the murine model and may represent a new phenotype of the CCR3-knockout mice.

4) CCR3^-/- mice, CD4 cell depletion or IL-8 treatment, and paucity of CD4 cell numbers in CD4 cell-depleted or IL-8-depleted mice, all cause disease. The authors' data are inconclusive and the conclusions are not supported by the data.

Reviewer #2:

The data in the manuscript are presented as though they had been presented in Part I of the presented studies. The authors could not determine the content of the manuscript or the source of the data. I have no problem with the types of data and figures presented but not with the authors’ experiments.

The key findings in the manuscript are as follows.

CD4 cell depletion is a major therapeutic strategy to treat patients with CD4 cell count less than 100cells/µL. The authors demonstrate in Part II that the strategy is working and show that it may be successful. The data in Part III are consistent with Part I and III and conclude that the strategy may be further developed. The data in Part IV are significantly different from the data in Part III. The data in Part V are not consistent with the results presented in Part III. The data in Part VI are not consistent with the conclusions presented in Part III.


## Methods
Briefly, CD4^+ T cells from the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells line SC5314 were isolated from a C57BL/6 mouse model of disseminated CM (NCBI GenBank accession number: AF99707) using a monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone RIF7-FITC, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described previously [24. Briefly, CD4^+ T cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone RIF7-FITC, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the presence of a mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone E9-5, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the monoclonal antibody was removed and the CD4^+ T cells were lysed in the presence of a monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone E9-5, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and performed in the presence of a mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone E9-5, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the presence of a mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone E9-5, Cell Signaling Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described previously [25]. The purity of the purified CD4^+ T cells was determined by quantitative culture and is shown in Figure 2. The specificity of the specificity assays is shown in Figure 3.

The specific activity of the CD4^+ T cells was also determined by flow cytometry, using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, the cell-free supernatant was collected and the supernatant was mixed with the flow cell suspension.


## Results
. Microbiota Identification
The total and pooled ITS-TOF-MS^+ RNA was separated and subjected to gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The amplicons were sequenced and aligned to obtain the most parsimonious trees (Figure 1). The topologies of the topologies obtained from the Bayesian analysis are shown in Figure 1. The analyses were used to identify the ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene (Figure 2). The analysis of the ITS2-5.8S rRNA gene of P. kudriavzevii showed a very similar topology and topology to that of the topologies of the Bayesian analysis (Figure 2). The topologies of the Bayesian analyses were similar to those of the topologies of the Bayesian analysis (Figure 1).


## Discussion
albicans were studie.

The results of CD4 T cell responses to C. albicans and other Candida strains indicated that the presence of these yeasts in the environment is not only important for the survival of the fungus, but also for fungal virulence. According to the results of susceptibility to infection in a murine model of infection, the presence of C. albicans and other Cryptococcus strains in mice was not lethal. This is in line with the fact that our experiments with uninfected mice showed that the absence of C. albicans or other Candida strains, particularly the strains of C. neoformans, could significantly decrease the fungal burden in the lungs of mice and also significantly reduce the fungal burden in the spleen and other organs (Figure 7B). In addition, studies in a murine model of infection with C. albicans showed that C. albicans could also be found in the blood of infected mice and also in the spleens of infected mice (24). It is interesting to note that C. albicans is also known to be the causative agent of cryptococcosis in humans (31). In addition to the fact that C. albicans is the predominant yeast isolated from blood of infected mice (31), the results of our study with uninfected mice suggested that C. albicans could also be present in the blood of infected mice.

The observation that the presence of C. albicans or other Candida strains in the environment is not lethal to mice suggests that C. albicans is a potential human pathogen that can be easily identified by antibodies against this species. In addition, our results indicated that the presence of C. albicans in the bloodstream of infected mice is not lethal. Therefore, it is also possible that C. albicans could be detected in the blood of infected mice.

The results of this study suggested that the presence of C. albicans in the environment can be a potential virulence factor for C. albicans. It is also important to note that C. albicans could also be isolated from the environment and used as a vaccine candidate. In addition to the fact that the fungus was already known to be a major human pathogen, such as in the case of C. albicans, the occurrence of C. albicans in the environment could provide a novel strategy to control C.
