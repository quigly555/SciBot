## Abstract
rg/1.1371/journal.pmed.100062632)

Fungi and yeast have been frequently used as a cause of food allergies (FA) and skin problems (SF). Flavours, such as pigments, pigments, teas, milk and yoghurt, were the main ingredients used for the production of these products. However, fungi have been shown to produce other secondary metabolites, such as bioactive compounds, especially secondary metabolites with antimicrobial and antiviral activity. This study aimed to explore the association between fungal metabolites and FA andSF in food allergy.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 61 cases of food allergy reported between January 1, 2016 and May 31, 2018. FA was the main FA ingredient identified. Data was collected using questionnaire and collected data from representative data takers using Epi-Info software.

A total of 182 participants were recruited. In the study, fungal sensitization scores were used to estimate the association between FA and SF. The difference between FA sensitization scores and takers' results was 0.064 (95% CI: 0.acher's test). Among takers, those who knew their FA sensitization scores better than takers who did not had a significantly higher SF when comparing the SF predictors of FA and SF. For a second takers' test, we repeated the comparison between FA sensitization scores and takers' results.

The results of this study suggest that FA and SF are important for FA and SF, since they are different from each other and similar to fungi and yeasts. Future studies should consider the possibility of using fungal and yeast derivatives to improve FA and SF.

In conclusion, fungal and yeast derivatives of plant origin as antioxidants could be useful as new and safe food and pharmaceutical products with commercial potential.

In this study, we investigated the potential of the fermentation products of Bacillus cereus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces cereus and other yeasts into plants for the formulation of new anti-infectives, anti-inflammation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs.

The fermentation products were prepared by the yeast extract preparation and incubated at 45 °C in a non-ventilated area for 10 - 12 hours. The yeast extract was mixed and dried and the dried K. lactis extract was centrifuged at 15 rpm for 30 min.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is an important airborne fungal pathogen of plants and humans and is responsible for up to 30% of infections in immunocompromised individuals [1]. There are many reports on the epidemiology of A. fumigatus infections [2-5]. In one study, the mortality rate in patients with invasive aspergillosis was higher than in the general population [6]. The mortality rate of invasive aspergillosis was 10% lower than in the general population, and the mortality rate in patients with aspergillosis was 19% lower than in the general population [7]. The mortality rate of invasive aspergillosis was also higher than in patients without invasive aspergillosis [7]. In this study, the mortality rate in patients with invasive aspergillosis was 19% higher than in the general population and 37% higher than in patients with invasive aspergillosis. In addition, the mortality rate was higher in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency and AIDS than in patients with normal immune function. These results clearly demonstrate the urgent need to understand the epidemiology of A. fumigatus infections and to improve disease control strategies.

To date, the lack of an effective treatment for invasive aspergillosis has been widely attributed to the high mortality rate and pathogenicity of A. fumigatus [8]. In the past two decades, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as the use of various combinations of various classes of antifungal agents, has resulted in the development of serious infections and deaths. This has resulted in the development of drug resistant strains, the widespread use of azole antifungals, and the aggressive use of antifungals against resistant and susceptible strains [9].


## Methods

A total of 30 samples were selected randomly from each of the two study sites (Table 1) and used to evaluate the impact of growth on the microbiota on plant growth (.e., root rot, leaf litter, and soybean) and on the architecture of plant bodies (i.e., leaf sheaths, flowers, and plants). The plant and plant debris were removed after 24 h of treatment and rinsed with distilled water three times and a total of 30,000 × g in a water bath for 10 min to remove excessive water. The pellet, which was then air-dried and weighed, was then placed in a 2% agarose gel and transferred to a 1% agarose membrane, followed by incubation at 50 °C for 18 h. To evaluate the influence of cultivation temperature on the growth of the microbiota, the lower a_c of the medium was subtracted from the a_c of the medium and the inoculum was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard.

In addition, the soil was cleaned and air-dried with a paper shredder. The residual fungi were removed by removing the debris by scraping, and the soil-bacterial matrix was removed by washing the soil with 50% ethanol. The remaining bacteria were removed by washing with sterile distilled water. The microbial matrix was then rinsed with sterile distilled water to remove soil, and the residual fungal matrix was resuspended with sterile distilled water and used for subsequent analysis.

The soil-bacterial matrix was further subjected to ultrasound-treatment using a cotton swab (0.5 cm in diameter) and was then placed on a 1% agarose gel to block the air and vacuum for 15 min. Then, the gel was then air-dried and rinsed with sterile distilled water. The soil-bacterial matrix was further subjected to a 4% agarose gel for 10 min, and then air-dried and rinsed with sterile distilled water. The microbial matrix was further subjected to a 4% agarose gel for 10 min, and then air-dried and rinsed with sterile distilled water. Finally, the microbial matrix was air-dried and rinsed with sterile distilled water.

After air-drying, the remaining microbial matrix was used for subsequent analysis.


## Results
In addition, the fungus was found to be more prevalent in the guts of fusarium-associated animals (Unger et a. 2009). In addition, it has been reported that C. neoformans and C. albicans are the main pathogens of crop plants (Hana et al. 2007). This might be due to their presence in the guts of these animals and the increased production of drug resistance as a result of their antifungal action.

In order to examine the pathogenicity of C. neoformans on host plants, we inoculated B. cereus with 10^6 conidia of each strain, and evaluated the effect on the growth of these plants. The results demonstrated that all the strains demonstrated more or less significant growth inhibition on all the tested plants. C. neoformans and C. albicans were also found to be more prevalent in the gut of the model plants than in the vegetative organs (Figure 3).

Effect of the presence of the fungus on the host-pathogen interaction
To study the effects of the fungus on the host-pathogen interaction, we inoculated B. cereus, C. neoformans, and C. albicans strains into the flagellum of maize plants and evaluated the effect on the fungal growth of these plants. The results showed that all the strains showed significant growth inhibition on the flagellum of B. cereus, although in the case of C. albicans, the fungus was found to be more prevalent in the guts of the plant.

The B. cereus strain was found to be more prevalent in the flagellum of the maize plant than in the flagellum of the control plants (Figure 4). The presence of the fungus in the flagellum of the control plants was more evident in the plant with the smaller gut area (Figure 4). The fungus was also found in the flagellum of the maize plant in the case of C. neoformans (Figure 4). The infection of the flagellum of the maize plant was observed in the case of C. neoformans in the case of C. albicans.


## Discussion

The present study describes a case of a patient with atypical CD4 T cell lymphopenia with a relatively recent diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis (CTS) and an opportunistic infection with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In addition, we describe a patient who developed symptoms of CNS toxoplasmosis and died after a prolonged illness.

Our patient presented with a relatively rapid progression of neurological symptoms and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the same patient's cerebral cortex, with no identifiable lymphoma. This patient was initially diagnosed as CMV-associated lymphopenia (CTS), which is a lymphopenic disease that involves the contiguous cerebral hemispheres and the spinal cord. He presented with an unremarkable clinical presentation and a large cerebrospinal fluid volume of approximately 6.4 g/L. Although the cause of death was not clearly established, the authors hypothesized that this patient was a carrier of CMV-associated lymphopenia, and this possibility was also supported by the presence of extensive cytopenia in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Cryptococcus neoformans is the predominant agent of CTS, and the predominance of Cryptococcus neoformans in the CNS has been reported in patients with CTS. As such, a clinical suspicion of CTS should be established based on the presence of CNS symptoms, such as CSF lymphopenia, although an incidence has been reported of 1 to 5% in patients with CTS [21]. The diagnosis of CMV-associated lymphopenia is challenging, but several laboratories have reported a very high rate of CTS among HIV-infected patients in the USA [22].

Pulmonary TB is an uncommon disease in which multiple, subcutaneous or subarachnoid pulmonary involvement of the lungs is observed [23]. In our patient, the patient’s symptoms were nonspecific and his clinical presentation was nonspecific.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast-like fungus that causes pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients. The most common disseminated disease in HIV-infected patients is cryptococcosis, which is associated with severe immunosuppression [24].
