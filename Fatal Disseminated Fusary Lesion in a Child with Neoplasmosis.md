## Abstract
Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides brasiliensis, a thermophilic fungus.


## Introduction
The transition from the soil to the sea is a continuous process that requires both systematic and non- systematic processes [1]. The first transition of life begins when fungi form specialized cells that inhabit the sea [2]. They reach the water and land at different times of the year. These specialized cells then enter into a specialized life-cycle in which they will be able to survive in the sea and adapt to the harsh conditions found in the sea [3].

The soil is an important environment in which fungi form specialized cells. These specialized cells are called “soils” and are specialized in the presence of the soil, and they have the ability to grow on the surface of the sea. These specialized cells can be differentiated into hyphae, spores, and eventually yeast cells. Because of the influence of the surface water, specialized cells in the soil can survive in the sea for a long time [4].

The microorganisms that inhabit the sea are very diverse. They can be isolated from the surface, such as fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms, or they can be released into the water, where they can be propagated and spread and be able to cause disease. The propagules can be of any type and they can be different from each other, and their biocides can be produced by different microorganisms. Therefore, it is important to understand how the microorganisms that inhabit the sea are controlled and to what extent the diversity of microorganisms is influenced by the environmental conditions.


## Methods


For each case, the Fusarium species was identified based on its antifungal susceptibility and the presence of compatible fungi as well as on the anatomical characteristic. The specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Pretoria and the specimens are deposited in the Mycology Herbarium of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Pretoria. The specimens are also deposited in the Herbarium of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Pretoria and the specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the National Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of São Paulo.

DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from the frozen specimens using a QIAamp DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) and LR5 (Vilgalys & Hester 1990) were used to amplify part of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit rDNA operon spanning the 3’ end of the 18S rRNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the 5.8S rRNA gene. The primers ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used for the partial fragment of the LSU rDNA operon. Amplification was performed using the ABI BigDye Terminator v. 3.1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 5 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl_2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP (10 mM), 0.5 mM of each of the forward and reverse primers, 0.25 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), 0.1 µM of each primer (5 µM), and 0.5 µM of the DNA template (10-20 ng). The PCR products were purified by using the Wizard PCR DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.


## Results
However, the perinuclear and/or perinuclear leukaemia was not due to perinuclear infectio. We thus hypothesized that perinuclear leukaemia was a result of perinuclear peritoneal infection. The perinuclear leukaemia was confirmed in all the animals in the experimental infection model (Fig 1B). This result was consistent with the prior findings [28], [29]. The perinuclear leukaemia was not further exacerbated by the drug treatment, as the perinuclear leukaemia was completely suppressed by fluconazole. Although the prior studies have shown that the antifungal drug fluconazole has a modest inhibitory effect on perinuclear leukaemia, the drug treatment has been shown to have an impact on the frequency and severity of perinuclear leukaemia [30].

To further evaluate the impact of fluconazole on perinuclear leukaemia, we performed immunofluorescence with a fluorescent protein dye fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antifungal drugs. Fluconazole treatment was shown to significantly reduce the number of viable perinuclear leukaemia in mice (Fig 2A). Fluconazole treatment alone had no effect on perinuclear leukaemia in the perinuclear leukaemia model (Fig 2B), while treatment with fluconazole plus a combination of fluconazole and amphotericin B had a strong effect on the perinuclear leukaemia model. Fluconazole plus fluconazole plus fluconazole was shown to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of perinuclear leukaemia in the perinuclear leukaemia model (Fig 2C). Fluconazole plus amphotericin B treatment was shown to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of perinuclear leukaemia in the perinuclear leukaemia model in the perinuclear leukaemia model (Fig 2D).


## Discussion
No cases of PCDH in our patient were reported in the literature, but it was diagnosed in a non-neoplastic adult with PCDH, as reported in our patien.

The differential diagnosis of PCDH is very different from other neoplasms, such as malignant neoplasms of the lymphoid tissue, and granulomatous pleurisy, which can occur in children [29, 30]. However, PCDH is a benign disease, and the prognosis is poor, because the immune system is generally intact and the disease is controlled. Therefore, the patient had a good response to antifungal therapy, which was also considered in our patient. However, PCDH is a life-threatening disease, as reported in several cases of PCDH in children [31, 32].

In summary, this patient had a good response to antifungal therapy and was cured of PCDH, as reported in several cases of PCDH in children. The differential diagnosis of PCDH is very different from other neoplasms, such as malignant neoplasms of the lymphoid tissue, and granulomatous pleurisy, which can occur in children [33].

P65. Cell-mediated immune response to Candida sp. infection

Introduction: Candida spp. is the most common opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompetent patients. However, in immunocompromised patients, the incidence of Candida spp. has been declining. To further increase the incidence of Candida spp., a new and specific immunotherapy for Candida infection is proposed. The discovery of novel antifungal agents with antifungal activity against Candida spp. is important, as they are a promising tool for the treatment of fungal infections.

Objectives: To establish the inhibitory effects of new antifungal agents on Candida spp. and develop novel antifungal agents in order to prolong survival in patients with Candida spp. infection.
