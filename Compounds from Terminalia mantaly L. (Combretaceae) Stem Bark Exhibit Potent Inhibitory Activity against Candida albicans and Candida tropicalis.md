## Abstract
Fungal infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant (RT) recipients, especially in the face of increasing numbers of immunosuppressed individuals and chemotherapy. RT intracellular survival is critically dependent on the ability of microorganisms to proliferate within the host, and the survival of host immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, to effectively engulf fungi. Aspergillus and Aspergillus-host cell viability are hallmarks of progressive infection, as are fungal outer membrane vesicles and biofilm formation. Host defense relies on efficient clearance of the organism and the ability to establish a protective anti-fungal response. However, the immune response also needs to proceed in the presence of a limited number of microorganisms, particularly those that are resistant to all available nutrients, including organic compounds and proteolytic degradation products. The lack of efficient clearance of fungal cells in the face of available host resources makes it extremely difficult to eliminate fungal growth without excessive cellular damage. Therefore, there is a critical need for improved methods to alleviate fungal growth and, more importantly, to identify novel targets for antifungal therapy. One such nutrient is organic compounds, particularly those that are produced by plants and animals. These compounds can be classified into three groups based on their similarity to fungi: Ascotrans, Alginate, and Monoterpin, and are known for their ability to protect against UV- and ionizing radiation. The presence of these compounds in the Aspergillus genus has been demonstrated to enhance the resistance of the human patient population against fungal infections.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by encapsulated yeast species of the genus Cryptococcus, which invade the lungs of immunocompromised individuals causing a severe and often fatal disease. In fact, Cryptococcus spp. are the most common agents of this disease worldwide, accounting for over one million cases and over 300,000 deaths annually (Rajasingham et al., 2018). C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is capable of overwintering host trees and bird guano (Huson et al., 2003). Cryptococcosis can be controlled by various environmental manipulations such as nutrient limitation, over-exploitation, and disturbance of host-parasite equilibrium. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and osmotic stress affect C. neoformans growth and pathogenesis (Meyer et al., 2004; Kidd et al., 2010).

In the past, the protective effect of plant-associated fungi was attributed to their ability to degrade the plant antifungal agents, such as the cell wall chitin and polysaccharide glucans. However, recent studies have shown that the degradation of the fungal cell wall components is accompanied by alterations in the cell morphology, such as the formation of dark, thick, and porous layers (Chowdhary et al., 2018). During the pathogenic process, the cell wall is exposed to a wide variety of environmental conditions (Latgé, 2007). The cell wall is the major structure in the fungal cell, and its removal is essential for fungal pathogenicity. The effect of several antifungal agents on the cell wall of C. neoformans and on the fungal cell itself has been reported. Some of the antifungal agents, such as azoles, amphotericin B, and flucytosine, have been shown to increase the resistance of C.


## Methods
The results of the tests were taken from the total of seven different isolates and the results were expressed as the mean ± SE. In order to identify the possible direct inhibitory effects of the compounds on the growth of C. albicans and C. tropicalis, three different assays were performed with the compound control and the test of the antibiofilm effect on Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis.

2.4. Antifungal Activity of Fungi-Formed in Petri-Dishes
The antifungal activity of the Fungi-Formed in Petri-Dishes (FIB) was determined using the broth dilution method as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [23], in the context of the antifungal activity of C. albicans and C. tropicalis. FIBs were prepared as described previously [24], with minor modifications. Briefly, conidia were harvested from 1 × 10^7 conidia in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. The diluted FIB broth was added to sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and agitated at 100 rpm for 15 min and then centrifuged at 8000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000× g for 30 min to pellet the conidia. The resulting supernatant was collected, and the FIB pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS. The final concentrations of FIB were adjusted to the desired concentration by using the measurement of the dilution method. The final concentrations of FIBs were prepared according to the recommended stock solutions of FIB. The stock solutions of the FIBs were prepared in sterile PBS. The samples were then diluted to the desired concentration by using the measurement of the dilution method. The final concentrations of the FIBs were prepared according to the recommended stock solutions of the FIBs. The solutions were then added to sterile petri-dishes. The Petri-Dishes were then placed in a plastic container, and then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.

## Discussion
albicans and . tropicalis. Combretum bark is an aromatic tree widely used for the traditional medicinal use, especially in Korea. It has been used for centuries as a traditional medicine, particularly for the treatment of skin diseases, diarrhea and general illnesses [7,8]. Combretum bark exhibited potent antibacterial activity against C. albicans and C. tropicalis, with MIC values ranging from 64 µg/mL to 16 µg/mL. The antifungal activity against C. neoformans was demonstrated for Combretum bark, with MIC values ranging from 0.78 µg/mL to 0.46 µg/mL. Similar findings were also obtained with C. albicans and C. tropicalis [8,10].

The antifungal activity of Combretum bark against C. tropicalis was also observed, with MIC values ranging from 0.78 µg/mL to 0.88 µg/mL. Similar findings were also obtained with C. albicans and C. tropicalis [8,10].

Compounds from Terminalia sp. exhibited potent antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis. Combretum sp. exhibited potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis, with MIC values ranging from 128 µg/mL to 512 µg/mL. The antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. tropicalis was reported for Combretum sp. (IC_50 = 5 µg/mL) [12]. In contrast, the antifungal activity of Terminalia sp. was not reported in this study.
