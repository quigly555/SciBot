## Abstract
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common cause of adult meningitis and is thought to be associated with a very low pro-inflammatory cytokine level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with CMV infection has been shown to be enriched in non-cytomegaloviruses (NTVs), such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and herpes simplex virus type (HSV-1), and macrophages, such as CD8+T cells, NK cells and TCR+FoxD2. These findings suggest that CMV infection in non-cytomegaloviruses might be associated with an immune response that mediates viral invasion and destruction of the CNS.


## Introduction
The genus Pyrenochaetia was introduced by Edwards (1979) to accommodate species that sporulate on plant substrates, including a number of genera belonging to the Melanomycetes, e.g., Chaetomella and Phaeohyphomycetes, and which are characterised by immersed, melanised, 0.5-1-septate, fusiform, subglobose to globose basidiospores and a basal keratin sheath, giving rise to a conidium containing four peridium chains. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA phylogeny indicates that Pyrenochaetia is a monophyletic genus and, more recently, Pyrenochaetia is a monophyletic fungal taxon, which was formerly accommodated in a sub-family, Pyrenochaeaceae (Jones et al.


## Methods
Phenotypic and morphological characterization
Fungal strains and plasmids used in this study were deposited in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) (NIC, 2008; FGSC II, 2012) and the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (WFBP) (FGBP, 2013). Morphological studies were performed on the strains and plasmids described in Table 1. The flanks and heads of each strain were measured at least three times, and the morphological characteristics were recorded in the colony color (brown, cream, or reddish-red). Strain CBS138 [20] was used as a quality control strain.

Morphological characterization was carried out on filamentous fungi using C. albicans strains (C. albicans SC5314, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, and C. albicans ATCC 90025) and C. glabrata strains (C. glabrata ATCC 90012, C. glabrata ATCC 90030, and C. glabrata ATCC 90030).


## Results
against Thymoma Respiratory Tracts, we tested the antifungal activity of these two strains against . cruzi and T. cruzi B11 clinical isolates. The three clinical isolates were monoclonal and fungicidal against both strains of T. cruzi B11, but showed lower MIC values for the two strains of T. cruzi B11 (Table 2). The fungicidal activity of these two strains against T. cruzi B11 was highly similar to the fungicidal activity of the two isolates of T. cruzi B11. The MIC_50 values for these two isolates were comparable to the values of the two isolates of T. cruzi B11 (Table 2).

In order to determine the cytotoxic activity of the different strains of T. cruzi, the fungicidal activity of the three Malassezia spp. was assessed. The MIC_50 values for each strain of T. cruzi were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of T. cruzi were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of Malassezia spp. were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of Thymoma spp. were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of Malassezia spp. were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of Thymoma spp. were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of T. cruzi were determined using the B11 clinical isolates. The MIC_50 values for each isolate of Malassezia spp. were determined using the B11 clinical isolates.

3.4. Susceptibility Test Results
The MIC_50 values of the three Malassezia spp. strains against all the tested isolates of T. cruzi B11 were determined in triplicate using the standard combination of the fungicidal activity of the three Malassezia spp. strains and the inhibitory activity of the three Malassezia isolates.


## Discussion
This result is similar to the results of the Study by Pfaller et a., who found that the combined treatment of Malassezia and Pneumococcal antigen in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, hematologic malignancies, and mycotic pulmonary tuberculosis was beneficial [8].

In the previous study by Schoch et al., we observed that patients with Pneumococcal antigen therapy had significantly reduced fungal burden in their lungs and small bowel mycoses. This reduction in the fungal burden may be due to the fact that Pneumococcal antigen in the lungs of patients with tuberculosis was negative [9]. Pneumococcal antigen may increase the clearance of Pneumocystis jiroveci from the lungs of patients with tuberculosis. Pneumocystis jiroveci are difficult to treat and difficult to treat with Pneumococcal antigen [10].

In this study, we found that the combined treatment of Pneumococcal antigen and Pneumococcal antigen in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, hematologic malignancies, and mycotic pulmonary tuberculosis was effective. This effect may be due to the fact that Pneumococcal antigen may have a greater impact on the survival in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients.
