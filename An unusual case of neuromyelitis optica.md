# An unusual case of neuromyelitis optica

## Abstract
In the grand scheme of nature, the host is too late to prevent infection, and the end result is catastrophic. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an important complication of acute cryptococcosis and is thought to arise spontaneously and without prior immunization. Here, we report the first case of a nineteen-year-old HIV-infected male with a history of cryptococcal-induced hepatotoxicity, exacerbated by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. He had a normal T-cell count and negative swab samples, but he developed acute kidney injury and deteriorated rapidly to unrecognized meningitis. He died from acute renal failure at the age of seventy-three.

Cryptococcal IRIS is a novel, life-threatening complication of acute renal injury, which has occurred to mostly HIV-infected males in the past few decades. Its incidence in HIV-infected males has been increasing, and it is caused by two highly divergent, yet related pathogenic fungal genotypes, VGIIIa and VGIIIa, that were identified in clinical specimens from acute kidney injury and renal compromise patients, but were not shared with serology. Cryptococcal IRIS is thought to arise from a late-stage infection of the renal tissue that was caused by two unrelated, but related, fungal genotypes, VGIIIa and VGIIIb, that were identified in clinical specimens from renal compromise patients. The mechanisms underlying this case are not well- established.

A prospective cohort of HIV-infected, ART-naive patients with a serum C. gattii antigen titer of = 4.5 × 106/L was enrolled between October 2000 and March 2007. The patients were divided into IRIS (64/64 patients with IRIS) and non IRIS (18/64 patients with non-IRIS) arms, whose serum C. gattii antigen titer was <4.5 × 104/L. Patients in the non-IRIS arm had significantly higher serum C. gattii antigen titer (P < 0.001) and significantly higher serum C.


## Introduction
The patient was initially diagnosed with a mild T2KL and normal T2KL, but later with a more severe T2KL, and his condition deteriorate. He was treated for acute pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which is a potentially lethal infection, and was treated with intravenous (IV) fungicidal chemotherapy. The patient was found to have a non-healing acute low-grade thrombocytopenia (HTD) with headache, fever, productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. The patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the intensive care unit and had a radiological evaluation, which revealed a non-HTD thrombocytopenia. The patient was sent to the burn unit and found to have a non-HTD thrombocytopenia. The patient was discharged after 9 months.

Recognized as a probable cause of ABPA was established by a microbiology laboratory. A link to the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) antigens was established. The patient had a history of abdominal surgery, normal renal function, and no history of recurrent infections, he had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and he was not immunosuppressed. Abdominal ultrasound and microbiology showed no evidence of bacterial infection, but the patient was ill and was in critical condition. Laboratory parameters including oxygen saturation, temperature, and serum potassium levels were normal. On examination, the patient was in good health, but his condition deteriorated. Laboratory parameters were unremarkable: electrolyte profiles, hemoglobin, creatinine, and creatinine. There was no fever, and no pattern of lymphadenopathy.

Abortion was continued. The patient was discharged after 2 months, and then, on admission, he had a low grade fever, headache, and weight loss. His neurologic exam was normal, but his clinical response was non-specific. The patient received intravenous (IV) fungicidal treatment, and he was discharged after 2 months. The patient was referred to the burn unit and was found to have a HTD.

After initial evaluation, the patient's neurologic examination was normal, but his neurologic examination was almost entirely absent.


## Methods
The dog was treated for hematological and immunological complications, including an acute emphysema (altered lung and/or brain function), a pulmonary infiltrator, and a systemic infection, after he was given .1% hematocrit in water. On day seven, a second rat-attached mouse (NOG) was found euthanized and euthanized immediately on day nine. On day nine, a rat-attached mouse (EUS) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day nine. On day ten, a rat-attached mouse (MEL) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day ten. On day ten, a rat-attached mouse (NOG) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day ten. On day eleven, a rat-attached mouse (ELA) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day eleven. On day eleven, a rat-attached mouse (MEL) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day eleven. On day twelve, a rat-attached mouse (EUS) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day twelve. On day twelve, a rat-attached mouse (NOG) was euthanized and euthanized immediately on day twelve.

Time to death was calculated using the following formula:

For histopathology, a mouse (BALB/c) was sacrificed immediately on day twelve. A mouse (NOG) was sacrificed immediately on day thirteen. A mouse (NOG/PEDA) was sacrificed immediately on day fourteen. The lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys of the euthanized rat-attached mouse (EUS/ELA) were placed into plastic vials and immediately placed in sterile tubes. The body was dissected, weighed, and homogenized in sterile PBS using a pestle. The homogenate was serially diluted and plated on brain heart infusion agar to determine CFU/g of mouse. The fungal colonies were counted.

## Discussion
This patient presented with T cell-related lymphopenia which was followed by progressive lymphopenia, T cell-related lymphopenia and lymphadeniti. This patient had very high CD4+ lymphopenia, lymphadenitis and hemophagocytosis and died. Therefore, the patient’s lymphopenia was interpreted as a response to T cell-mediated T cell-mediated immune suppression.

Neurologic complications are common in lymphopenic patients, however, rare cases of T cell-related lymphopenia have been reported. For example, patients with T cell-related lymphopenia have been reported to have severe lymphopenia and/or focal brain abscesses. The patient’s severe lymphopenia could have been due to a lack of T cells in the lymph node. However, it is important to note that these patients were not immunocompromised and may not have had the same reactivating factors as the patient in our case. Therefore, the patient’s lymphopenia was likely due to a lack of T cell-related immunity. In addition, the patient’s lymphadenitis may have been due to T cell-associated lymphopenia.

Treatment for lymphopenic patients includes fluconazole and polymyxin B. Fluconazole is an azole-based regimen which has been shown to be effective in lymphopenic patients, but is not effective in lymphopenic patients. In a case series by Chen et al. (2015) of 25 patients with lymphopenic lymphopenic syndrome who had undergone fluconazole, the median time to onset was 3 months, and the median time to onset was 8 months. However, the patient’s lymphopenia was observed after fluconazole treatment, and the patient’s lymphadenitis occurred after fluconazole treatment. The patient’s lymphadenitis was observed after fluconazole treatment, and the lymphadenitis was likely due to lymphadenitis. It has been noted that fluconazole can cause a transient or persistent response to T cell-mediated immunity, with the patient’s lymphopenia being attributed to lymphadenitis, and the patient’s lymphopenia being attributed to lymphadenitis (Laegg, 2001).
