## Abstract
Metallothioneins (MTs) are a subclass of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a family of ascorbate monooxygenase (CMA) that are found in many eukaryotes. In fungi, they play important roles in cellular metabolism and in virulence, for example, by playing a role in the resistance to fungal growth within the human host. In addition, they are increasingly recognized as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nRNAs) due to their involvement in many metabolic processes, including stress response, virulence, and growth under different conditions. In this review, a brief overview of MTs and siderophores as a possible family of MTs is presented, which will be further discussed in the context of their role in stress responses, nutrient utilization, and pathogenicity. Specific examples of the involvement of MTs in stress responses are also discussed, as well as their potential suitability as biocontrol agents. The possible roles played by MTs in stress responses and virulence are also highlighted.


## Introduction

Case report: The patient was an undergraduate student who had attended a seminar on pathology at the University of Wisconsi. He had received a BA in English from the University of Wisconsin and worked as a nurse with occasional travel and teaching duties in the area. He had not traveled or taught outside of the last two years and his last teaching assignment was to conduct a seminar on leukemia in Wisconsin. A few weeks before his final class, the professor had invited the student for a lecture on teaching and research ethics. The student declined the invitation and gave the professor a short recess. The professor proceeded to his lectern and found a list of his papers that he and his colleagues had already listed as acceptable by the professor. The paper he selected as acceptable was his article on the research ethics of platelet transfusion in cancer (PLUS) in which I have no comment. The professor did not inform the student that the paper would be published online unless it was proof that the paper is true. The student agreed to share the identity of the journal editor, but agreed not to publish the article until it was published. The next day, the professor announced the suspension, which included a $250,000 fine. The student was not formally informed of the decision until the next day. A few days after the suspension was announced, the professor announced the hiring of a private investigator to conduct a background-analysis of all PLUS articles submitted to his laboratory since its publication (the review committee had agreed to review all PLUS articles submitted to his laboratory). The private investigator concluded that the article was "probable cause" and should be "reported" to the appropriate authorities. The following week, the private investigator returned from his trip to Japan, where the article was still online, and discussed his findings with several colleagues. A few days later, the professor announced the hiring of a private investigator to conduct a background-analysis of all the PLUS articles submitted to my laboratory since its publication (the review committee had agreed to review all PLUS articles submitted to my laboratory). The private investigator concluded that the article should be "reported" to the appropriate authorities.

The following day, the private investigator returned from his trip to Japan, and discussed his findings with several colleagues.


## Methods
Patients and Design
This study was carried out in the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo Hospital from January 1, 2016 to May 3, 2017. Patient data were obtained from patient interviews and investigations, as well as from the clinical notes. Data were entered into a Microsoft Excel database, and analyzed using the Microsoft Access Pro Knowledgebase (for the whole study, see Appendix S1, Table 1). All the data were analyzed by using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Patients were classified into two groups based on the age of the patients, and the main results of the data set were summarized in Table 2.

Study Population and Sample Size
The study population consisted of 7,092 patients (n = 8), including 20 males, 18 females, and 20 males (n = 6). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo Hospital from the State Law establishing the Institutional Review Board (Proc. No. 2019-03-05-01) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethical committee of the University of São Paulo Hospital approved this study.


## Results
. Lactobacillus spp. Isolation and Identification
The isolates used in this study were obtained from the four major epidemics of the phytopathogenic fungi, F. velutipes, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. verticillioides, and F. culicis, and were cultivated in a manner similar to those used for the studies of the clinical isolates. The isolates were collected from diseased leaves of the Brassica oleracea plant, and the results are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Detection of Antifungal Activity of Lactobacillus spp. Isolation of Lactobacillus spp.
The ITS region of all the isolates was amplified, and the sequences of the different species were compared by multiplex PCR (Additional file 1: Table S1). The amplification products were identified using the BLASTX algorithm and the ITS region of all the isolates was used to predict the species.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of Lactobacillus spp. Isolation of Lactobacillus spp.
The isolation of these strains was confirmed by PCR (Additional file 1: Table S2). A similar pattern of growth and fruiting body formation was observed on PDA, RAW, and BSA media, and no growth differences were observed between the isolates. The same result was obtained with the PCR amplification products (Additional file 1: Table S2).
