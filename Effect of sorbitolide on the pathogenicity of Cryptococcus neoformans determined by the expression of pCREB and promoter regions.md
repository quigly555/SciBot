## Abstract
To our knowledge, there is a not-yet documented case of Salmonella enterica Typhi associated with fingolimod, mimicking systemic lupus, to be treated typhus. The present study aimed to analyze the microbiological features and outcome of fingolimod-mimicid combination therapy in a cohort of patients with suspected typhus.

Between January 1, 2007, and May 31, 2009, all adult patients with suspected typhus admitted to the department of general medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases of Peking Union Medical College, renamed "Lipod-resistant typhus" or typhus-resistant-fingolimod, were reviewed.

All patients were monitored at ward eight and the ward's living room, living room and living room-diagnostic charts. Data were analyzed by using unpaired Student t-test or univariate Student t-test, significance at p < 0.05.

Data from the ward were compared to those from the living room, studio and the living room separately. Data were analyzed by examining trend and comparing proportions with non-wild type (NVP) sera. The ward was categorized as typhus patients with suspected typhus.

Out of 98 patients evaluated, 96 (40%) were men, 45% were female, 56% were HIV negative and the ward had an HIV infected staff. Fifty-one patients (24%) had microbiological tests done at the ward not in accordance with WHO guidelines on typhus. The most common manifestation of fever (33 patients; 11 men and 11 women) was seen in the living room with 49% and 34% of patients having fever in the living room, respectively. Serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/L and there was no significant increase with anti-fungal drugs used (P = 0.


## Introduction
In addition, pCREB is also required for the growth of . neoformans in the presence of sorbitolide [10]. The potency of sorbitolide on the growth of C. neoformans was found to be dependent on the expression of the pCREB promoter, which was upregulated at the onset of treatment with sorbitol [10].

D-Pinitol is a carboxyl group-containing alcohol which has attracted attention because it is a good source of a-pinitol with many biological activities, including antitumor [11]. D-Pinitol is also an aromatic alcohol with a high-mobility group and a high-affinity of oxygen to oxygen-dependent enzymes such as enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins [12]. Its presence in plants and mammals has led to the development of several pharmacological and toxicological compounds with a wide spectrum of biological activities, including anticancer, antifungal, antimalarial and anti-inflammatory activities [13]. The above-mentioned chemical entities are mainly represented by the pISC2 and pISC3 genes, which are functionally related but share some amino acid residues [14]. The pISC2 gene was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [15]. The pISC3 gene was first identified in Candida albicans [16]. In C. albicans, the pISC2 gene is required for the growth and virulence and the pISC3 gene is required for the growth and virulence only in the presence of the compound [17]. In the presence of d-d-pinitol, the c-mannulose-coated phenolic catechol is converted into ethanol by the catechol-phosphate pathway. The cell is then transported to the glycerol concentration of the media and is then phagolysosomal by the action of several proteins [18].

In this study, we identified and compared the pISC2 and pISC3 genes in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, respectively, and examined their roles in the growth and virulence of both species. We found that pISC2 and pISC3 are important for the growth and virulence of both species.


## Methods
gattii against . neoformans. The strains were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 25°C until they reached the optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. The cultures were then diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL and inoculated on PDA plates and incubated for 7 days. The number of CFU/mL was counted. Three to five strains of each strain were tested in each assay. The results were recorded in mm^2.

3.5. Experimental and Non-Experimental Studies
The yeast cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS. The cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL and 100 µL of this suspension was added to 1.5-mL of RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, USA), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 10 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The media was incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The yeast cells were then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 5 h and the optical density was determined at 600 nm. The experiments were conducted in triplicate.

3.6. Characterization of the Yeast Cell Line
The yeast cell line was cultured in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) at 30°C, and the culture supernatant was collected after 24 h. The culture supernatant was removed, and the cell suspension was resuspended in PBS. The cells were then plated on PDA plates and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The optical density was measured at 600 nm. The experiments were conducted in triplicate.

## Results
. Antifungal Activity of the Fungicide
The antifungal activity of the three agents was determined against five Candida spp. and four Cryptococcus spp. Candida spp. were selected because their susceptibility to fusarinine was shown in Table 1. The fungal biomass of these fungi was higher than that of the controls, but the fungicide was not significantly different from that of the control. In the case of miconazole, the antifungal activity was much higher than that of the miconazole fungicide, but the fungicide was not significantly different from that of the control. The MIC values for the fungicide and miconazole fungicide were found to be 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively.

3.2. Antifungal Activity of the Fungicide
The antifungal activity of the three fungicides was determined against five Candida spp. and four Cryptococcus spp. Candida spp. were selected because their susceptibility to fusarinine was shown in Table 1. The fungal biomass of these fungi was higher than that of the controls, but the fungicide was not significantly different from that of the control. In the case of miconazole, the antifungal activity was much higher than that of the miconazole fungicide, but the fungicide was not significantly different from that of the control. The MIC values for the fungicide and miconazole fungicide were 0.06, 0.12 and 0.


## Discussion
The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal therapy in a large cohort of patients with invasive fungal infection. We observed that in vitro antifungal therapy has a significant efficacy against invasive Candida spp. in a systemic infection model, while in vivo efficacy is less pronounced. Importantly, our results demonstrate that in vitro antifungal therapy in the combination with posaconazole is an effective and safe alternative in a systemic infection model.

The use of the antifungal agent, posaconazole, as initial therapy, is one of the most popular choices for invasive fungal infection in most settings [2], [3], [4], [5]. In our study, we found that the initial dose of posaconazole was effective in a systemic infection model, but the treatment duration was short, and posaconazole was not effective in a systemic infection model. Other studies have reported significant efficacy of posaconazole in the treatment of invasive Candida spp. infection in patients with invasive fungal infection [5], [6]. This study showed that posaconazole was an effective and safe option for treatment of invasive fungal infection.

In our study, the fungicidal effect of posaconazole against C. albicans was observed in a combination of posaconazole and posaconazole alone and in combination with posaconazole. However, the antifungal therapy of posaconazole was effective in both of the combination treatments, while the fungicidal effect of posaconazole was not. This could be due to differences in the interactions between the fungicidal and fungistatic agents, which may affect their activity in different antifungal systems [6]. Therefore, future studies are needed to investigate the potential of posaconazole to treat invasive fungal infections in patients with invasive fungal infection.

In this study, we used an infection model in which patients were treated with 200 mg/kg of a posaconazole orally or intravenously. The results showed that posaconazole was an efficient agent against C. albicans. In our study, the fungicidal effect of posaconazole was seen in patients treated with 200 mg/kg of posaconazole orally.
