## Abstract
The Cryptococcus gattii genome encodes a potential mutation hotspot for the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. Although this yeast is commonly misidentified in the literature, its unique ability to survive exposure to iron and other iron-related killing mechanisms has made it a target for biomonitoring antifungals and many other microorganisms. In contrast to the known and used antifungals, the predominant structure of C. gattii is the cointegral of a superoxide dismutase, which is essential for the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis. Here, we show that the C. gattii transcription factor YmXsf2 is required for its activation and activation of iron-sulfur protein-dependent pathways. We show that YmXsf2 deletion severely reduces growth of C. gattii in iron-depleted murine macrophages. Interestingly, we find that, unlike the mutant strain lacking YmYpd1, deletion of YmYpd1 also reduces growth of C. gattii in a hypoxic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Further, we show that YmYpd1 also negatively influences iron homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that the metal ion ion-sulfur protein (MRP) is essential for growth of C. gattii in a model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results suggest that the unique ability of YmYpd1 to respond to iron promotes its survival in the host, which in turn enhances iron homeostasis.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungal pathogen of the human respiratory tract. It is found in both healthy and diseased patients in the range of 3 to 10% of the patients.1,2 It is also an opportunistic pathogen in the severe asthma and mucormycosis cases,3 it is also a commensal in the healthy individuals.4 In the respiratory tract, the fungal flora comprises at least three groups, namely, Aspergillus fumigatus (Fus) fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and Aspergillus niger (As) fumigatus.5 Although they all present an infection problem, each of these fungi presents a more specific morphological morphotype, which is not well characterized. A. fumigatus is classified into two varieties, A. nidulans and A. strictum.


## Methods
For this study, DNA was extracted from all the samples and amplified using universal primers (Table S1) and the 3' end of the amplified DN. Each PCR mixture (10 µl) contained 0.5 µl of sterile water, 0.5 µl of MgCl_2 (10 mM), 0.5 µl of DNA template, 1.25 µl of PCR buffer, 0.25 µl of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 0.25 µl of PowerPCL Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 0.25 µl of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 0.25 µl of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and 0.5 µl of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was performed using the following protocol: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band bands were purified by using an Accuprime DNA Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (USB, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

## Results

The mitochondrial respiratory pathway is involved in the regulation of several physiological functions such as the metabolism of ergosterol, ergosterol-mediated fatty acid production, and the production of pro-oxidants, oxidative stress, and oxidative stress resistance [37. Previous studies have shown that the mitochondrial respiratory pathway is involved in regulating the functions of oxidative stress-related metabolic enzymes and other oxidative stress-related genes [36]. In addition, mitochondrial stress-induced nuclear and mitochondrial mitochondrial respiratory genes are enriched in the mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster [38]. The results of this study indicate that the mitochondrial respiratory pathway is under a high stress, which reflects the stressful nature of the environment.

To investigate the effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress on the nuclear and mitochondrial respiratory genes, we compared the mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus with those of other fungi and plants. Compared with Aspergillus fumigatus, the mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus is enriched in the nuclear respiratory gene cluster. The mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus is enriched in the nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus flavus. Compared with Aspergillus flavus, the nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus flavus is enriched in the nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. The nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus flavus is enriched in the nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus flavus. The nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus flavus is enriched in the nuclear respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus.

To examine whether mitochondrial oxidative stress induces changes in mitochondrial oxidative stress resistance, we examined the effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress on the mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. A decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress resistance was observed in Aspergillus fumigatus compared with the non-germinating Aspergillus strains (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Therefore, the mitochondrial respiratory gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with oxidative stress resistance.


## Discussion
In response to hyperbolic and arginine-rich mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial respiratory chain is required to maintain an oligotrophic stat. This is similar to a previous study in A. fumigatus, in which a significant increase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain was observed in response to low temperatures in both fumigatus and unicellular yeast (3, 4). The subcellular location of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been studied in other fungi and mammalian cells (29-31). The mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in the regulation of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in fungal species, including A. fumigatus (33). However, we did not detect any significant changes in the subcellular location of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in response to a high temperature (Fig 3A). Instead, the subcellular location was found to be significantly different in response to a high temperature (Fig 3B). This finding suggests that the subcellular location of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is important for the response to a high temperature. In addition, we found that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of a high-affinity and ATP-binding complex protein (mCherry) that regulates the respiration in response to low temperatures in A. fumigatus (Fig 3C). In the bHLH-type ATP-binding complex, ATP-M, the ATP-B motif, which is conserved in the bHLH-type ATPase complex, is required to produce the ATP-C (C-terminal ATPase) that converts ATP to ATP-A. The mCherry motif is important for the ability of the BHLH-type ATPase complex to convert ATP to ATP-B, which is important for the biosynthesis of a variety of secondary metabolites (34). The mCherry motif in the mitochondrial respiratory chain is located in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is important for the regulation of the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of various secondary metabolites (35). The mCherry motif in the mitochondrial respiratory chain is not found in other fungal species, suggesting that the mCherry motif may not be critical for the response to a high temperature in A. fumigatus.
