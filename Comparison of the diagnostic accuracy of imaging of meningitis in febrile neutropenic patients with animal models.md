## Abstract
Fungal infections are a growing global health problem, and new pathogens are emerging, making it imperative to have a better understanding of their etiology and epidemiology.


## Introduction
The soil is a dynamic ecosystem in which organisms live and function, including the control of soilborne diseases and the interactions of the microorganisms with the environments in which they occur (Grantham et al., 2016). The soil provides a source of nutrients for microbial growth, and the soil’s ability to support microbial growth is closely linked to the rate and volume of microbial extinctions. Soil microbes are estimated to consume more than 2% of the earth’s carbon and mineral resources every year (Ren et al., 2015), and the impact of soil microbes on global food security is still unresolved.

At present, microbial symbionts are characterized by their ability to control and modulate the microbial ecosystem, which in turn shape ecosystem processes and product flows of energy and materials (Liu et al., 2014). However, research on symbiotic mechanisms is still in its infancy and preliminary hypotheses on how microbes interact with one another and the environment are still in their infancy. Such hypotheses have historically been based on traditional culture-dependent methods, such as cultivation on acidic media, followed by culture-independent next generation sequencing (NGS) (Kim et al., 2016). Culture-independent NGS approach, which can be applied to environmental samples, has proven to be more sensitive than culture-dependent methods (Kim et al., 2016), and has also been validated using environmental samples from multiple environments (Kim et al., 2016). However, most culture-independent NGS studies use either culture-dependent or culture-independent techniques, and they do not include environmental variables that influence the growth of microbes. For example, the cultivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on acidic media (Kim et al., 2016), the culture-dependent NGS method, but does not rely on culture-dependent NGS, is highly sensitive to the variations in pH of the media and environmental conditions (Kim et al., 2016). The addition of environmental parameters (e.g.


## Methods
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Manchester (Approval No. I-002/10/11).

Mice and Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health, USA). The mice experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health, USA).

Animals and Experimental Procedure
Male BALB/c mice (5-8 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (USA). The mice were maintained in cages lined with normal filter paper and maintained in the facility of the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Manchester (United Kingdom). Animals were cared for in accordance with the principles outlined by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals (European Treaty Series, Number 14, Number 1185, Number 1591).

Mouse Fungal Strains and Growth Conditions
The LMMH strain of L. major (WT) was used as a reference for the experiments [9]. Briefly, the LMMH strains were grown in 50 ml of liquid medium (pH = 7.4) in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 37 °C for 3 days. The yeast cells were then inoculated on a glass slide and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days.


## Results
Genome-wide gene expression and gene prediction
In order to predict gene expression, we compared the genomic sequences of the 19 isolates using BLASTp. The classification of the 39 isolates as belonging to the same clade or to the same clade with similar strains in each strain was based on the presence of distinct transcriptional signatures (Supplementary Table 1). The 22 isolates in the nourseothricin (NAT) complex were included in this analysis.

The Aspergillus fumigatus isolates had the highest number of unique genes in the homing endonuclease-associated (HEGA) pathway as indicated by the presence of 16 of the 38 genes, the other five genes were absent. The genes in the intergenic and terminally terminally transcribed regions (ITS) were also present in all Aspergillus isolates. The majority of the Aspergillus isolates had the most similar gene expression pattern to the Aspergillus niger isolates. However, genes associated with the CCAAT-binding domain (CNBD) of the homing endonuclease (HET) pathway were also present in all Aspergillus isolates (Supplementary Table 1). The CCAAT-binding domain (CNBD) of the homing endonuclease pathway has been shown to be involved in the degradation of DNA and RNA, and is known to be involved in HEG activity [20].


## Discussion
The function of the TCA cycle in fungi is still largely unknown, but its role in diverse biological processes has been recognized as a key virulence trait of several pathogenic fungi [29]. It has been shown that TCA cycle, a process that has been implicated in the defense against stress-induced stress, is involved in the ability of many fungi to survive and replicate in various ecological niches [30]. Recently, it was also reported that, in the plant pathogenic fungus C. neoformans, the TCA cycle plays an important role in its adaptation to stress conditions such as nutrient limitation and infection [31]. It was also suggested that the TCA cycle may also play a role in the regulation of the host response to fungal infections [32]. In this study, we demonstrated that the C.
