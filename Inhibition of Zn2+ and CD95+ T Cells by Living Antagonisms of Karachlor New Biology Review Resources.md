## Abstract
Infection by yeasts is often a paradoxical process that may lead to severe complications and even mortality. Yeasts are usually isolated from the environment, from routine care and treatment, and from patients with very low immune function. They are not isolated from patients as far as we know and have not been reported as a cause of an accelerated rate of infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We report two cases of an AIDS-related bloodstream infection in a patient who developed an AIDS-defining illness several months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. We describe the infection, the possible etiology, and the spectrum of infections associated with this infection.


## Introduction
Plant biomass and carbon is the key to the world’s energy security and is the most abundant and renewable resource on earth (Doddapaneni and Lester, 2017). However, it is a complex mixture of biofuels, chemicals and other materials, which make it difficult for the development of sustainable processes and growth (Kidgal and Poonchik, 2014). One of the major challenges in the supply chain for biofuel production is the transition of raw materials from the fuel animal to the feed plant (Davoli et al., 2011). The transition to feed plant is already occurring in several countries in the world, and the cost of the process is expected to increase in the coming years (Cai et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017).

The transformation of the feedstock for biofuel production has been widely studied in recent years (Zhao et al., 2017), and many countries have developed new technologies to transform feedstock into biofuel. China has the highest biomass energy demand for biofuel production (4.7 Mtu/kg) and biomass carbon sequestration is the most important factor contributing to biomass energy demand (Zhao et al., 2017). China has one of the largest public biomass energy resources, and it has attracted attention from various countries (Zhao et al., 2017). Among the biomass resources, biomass carbon sequestration is one of the most promising technologies to be used in biofuel production (Davoli et al., 2011). The sequestration of biomass carbon occurs in different parts of biomass, such as carbon input (Haines and Mans, 2013), waste management (Haines and Mans, 2013; Zhou et al., 2014), and in the final products (i.e., biomass carbon) (Klis et al., 2014).

4.5. Biological Processes and the Molecular Model of Zn2+ and CD95+ T Cells
Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells were purified from C. albicans sphincter J774.16 cells using a standard protocol described by Li et al. [24]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 1% FBS and 0.5% sodium azide at 37°C for 3 h. The cells were then washed with PBS (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.05% NP-40), and the supernatants were collected and stored at -70°C. The cell monolayer was then transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate containing RPMI-1640, and the OD_600 of the culture was measured at a 532 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelength using a microplate reader. The cell monolayer was then washed with PBS to remove residual monoclonal antibodies. The OD_595 of the culture was then determined at the desired cell density. The following data was plotted: Data from RPMI-1640 medium. The OD_595 of the culture was then normalized to that of the control. The data were plotted with the help of GraphPad Prism v. 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

4.6. Antibody Receptor Binding Assays
The activity of zn2 and zn2+ antibodies against zn2-M1-P and zn2-M1-P+t cells was assessed by immunofluorescence. The immunofluorescent mAbs were synthesized with the mouse-made protein preparation kit (Dako, Daejeon, Korea). Briefly, the zn2 or zn2+ antibodies were diluted in RPMI-1640 medium to a concentration of 100 µg/ml. The antibodies were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the dark, then diluted with RPMI-1640 medium to a concentration of 10 µg/ml. The antibodies were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the dark and then washed with PBS.


## Results
Figure 2 shows that living parasites have a larger and more sensitive cell surface of the resting cell than resting parasite. Furthermore, living parasites have more and a more sensitive surface of the resting cell than dead parasites, while dead parasites have a less and less sensitive surface than living parasites. Cells of living parasites showed a lower number of Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells compared to dead parasites (Figure 2).

Influence of living parasites on the Transcriptional Expression of Zn2+ and CD95+ T Cells
As living parasites have a higher inhibition of Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells, we evaluated the influence of living parasites on the expression of Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells. Figure 3 shows that living parasites have higher expression of Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells compared to dead parasites. These results are in line with the earlier study on live parasites [3]. Furthermore, the expression of Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells increased in living parasites and the effect of living parasites on Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells was also observed (Figure 3).

The Zn2+ and CD95+ T cells produce abundant ROS in living parasites
We have shown previously that live parasites can increase the susceptibility of living parasites to ROS and it is necessary to protect living parasites from ROS in living parasites [2]. We have found that live parasites can increase the susceptibility of living parasites of living parasites to ROS and this is also important for living parasites to resist ROS [2]. The higher susceptibility of living parasites of living parasites to ROS and higher ROS was also observed when cells of living parasites were treated with ROS, but these are not the same for dead parasites (Figure 4). We have observed that live parasites in living cells have a higher susceptibility to ROS and higher ROS when compared to dead parasites (Figure 4).

For the three different treatments of ROS and ROS, the influence of living parasites on Zn2+ T cells was evaluated. Figure 5 shows that living parasites reduce the transcription level of Zn2+ T cells in living parasites, which is the most effective treatment for living parasites (Figure 5). On the other hand, living parasites have a weaker effect on Zn2+ T cells in living parasites, which is in line with our results.
