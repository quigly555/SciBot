## Abstract
Since the early development of agriculture, we have witnessed a marked increase in the number of new mutations arising from the transformation of iatrogenic microorganisms into diploid heterokonts. In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the genomic adaptations of diploids, as a result of the modifications to their molecular biology, of microorganisms from the wild. Among these organisms, two known strains, Cryptococcus curvatus and C. curvatus homologues (center B and D), are representative of the two predominant eukaryotic diploid groups in nature. Although both strains were from temperate habitats, their genomic adaptations were as follows: (i) they exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation, (ii) they possess a high degree of gene content insertion and modification, (iii) they grow in a relatively short time frame, and (iv) they exhibit strong selective pressures. To gain deeper insights into the selection and evolution of the two prevalent diploid groups, we performed an analysis of the genomes of the two Cryptococcus curvatus strains. Through this analysis, we identified several deduced molecular groups which appear to have evolved in parallel with the evolution of these strains. In particular, we found the divergence of the fungal conserved glycans, the recombining proteins, and also the putative metalloproteolytic enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the C. curvatus strains possessed a high degree of sequence variation in their genetic architecture, suggesting that the Cryptococcus curvatus genomes are more structured and expanded than the C. curvatus genomes. In addition, the genomes of Cryptococcus curvatus and C. curvatus homologues can also be considered to be in similar evolutionary pathways, although we found only two other Cryptococcus curvatus genomes, and only one C. curvatus homologue. Overall, our results suggest that the genomes of two eukaryotic diploids are in similar evolutionary pathways, although they share many additional aspects, such as genome architecture, that may be responsible for their phenotypic differences.


## Introduction
The genus Phylloporus was established by Crous & M.A. [1] and typified by P. infernae, P. pyriformis, P. saccicola, P. citrinum and P. solani. The genus is divided into four sections: Acrophora, Capillaria, Subulata, and Phylloporia. In this genus, the number of phylloporias is highly variable and ranges from 0.5 to 6 per species. Phylloporia sect. Galleria was found in a wide range of localities, especially along riverbanks, in arctic and temperate regions, along the coast of the Northern hemisphere and in the Mediterranean coast. Species of Phylloporus are generally found in extremely narrow geographical zones, which can be only be located in the habitat. Phylloporias are typically found in the temperate zones, in arctic areas and in the Mediterranean coast. Phylloporus species are also found in arctic, arid, and semi-arid regions of the world. The species of Phylloporus are found in both tropical and temperate zones. The species of Phylloporus have been isolated from freshwater, terrestrial and marine sources. They are found in many habitats with high elevation, such as rocky hillsides, lakes, and rivers.

The genus P. infernae has a well-known worldwide distribution, and P. infernae was found in a wide range of habitats, especially along riverbanks, along the coast of the Northern hemisphere and in arctic and temperate areas. Species of P. infernae have been reported from various parts of the world. The species of P. saccicola are found in the Mediterranean, Indian, Himalaya, and Himalayan regions. The species of P. citrinum are found in the Himalayan regions. Species of P. solani and P. quercicola are found in the Mediterranean, Indian, Himalaya, and Oceans. Phylloporias are mainly found in arctic, temperate, and boreal areas.


## Methods

.2. Assay Design
The testing design was developed by combining two different tests. For the first test, we used the positive result of the FISH on a “A” strain of C. albicans strain with a positive result from a serial dilution test, as described in the previous section [5]. This is because of the fact that fungal strains obtained from C. albicans and C. glabrata were closely related. We also compared the FISH results of an “A” strain on C. glabrata with a positive result from a serial dilution test.

The second test, was based on a literature review of published fungal species with a wide range of taxonomic ranks. In this test, we used FISH with the FISH threshold as previously described [5]. We also compared the FISH results of a “A” strain on C. albicans with a positive result from a serial dilution test.

2.3. Testing Methods
We used the FISH on a “A” strain of C. albicans strain. In this test, we used the FISH on a “B” strain of C. albicans strain, as previously described [6]. In the same way, we used the FISH on a “C” strain of C. albicans strain. In this test, we used the FISH on “C” strain. In this test, we used the FISH on “C” strain.

2.3. Testing Methods
We applied a simplified version of the FISH method of the FISH method for a “A” strain of C. albicans. We applied the “A” test on a “B” strain of C. albicans strain. We used the “B” test to compare fungal species, as previously described [6]. We used the “A” test to compare fungal species of “A” and “B”.

2.3. Testing Methods
We used a simplified version of the FISH method for a “A” strain of C. albicans strain.


## Results
. Screening and Characterization of the Isolation and Screening of IcPorous Plant Polyphenols
Isolation of IcPorous Plant Polyphenols was performed by the following methods: by means of the isolation method of pure ICP, purification of ICP, or extraction of the polyphenols. The isolation method of pure ICP, purification of ICP, and extraction of the polyphenols was performed by means of the isolation method of pure ICP.

3.2. Purification of ICP
Purified ICP was obtained from an insoluble-bead-based method and anionic methods. The purity of ICP obtained from anionic methods was approximately 60%. The purity of ICP obtained from anionic methods was 90%. The isolation method of pure ICP, purification of ICP, and extraction of the polyphenols was performed by means of the isolation method of pure ICP.

3.3. Screening of ICPorous Plant Polyphenols
All the ICPorous plant polyphenols were screened by means of the isolation method of pure ICP. Purified ICP was obtained from the insoluble-bead-based method and anionic methods.


## Discussion
., Drosophila genome database). The number of such studies was also increased to 11 in our study. The number of studies generated using the Drosophila genomic database was also increased to 4 in this study. A large number of studies have also used the Bioinformatics pipeline to generate reads and predicted gene-expression profiles (e.g., Schizophyllum commune genome database). The results presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 demonstrate that there is a higher proportion of RAPD profiles derived from existing reference genomes in comparison to RAPD profiles generated by Bioinformatics analysis. The genomic and sequence information on gene expression can be used to predict potential translational roles for some organisms. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that many RAPD profiles are highly expressed when RAPD is the most abundant marker (Table 1). However, the results of the comparison of the RAPD profiles generated with the Bioinformatics analysis and those generated with the RAPD analysis do not indicate a significant difference in the translational roles of these translational roles. The translational roles of RAPD are, however, not completely unknown. For example, RAPD profiles generated with the Bioinformatics analysis do not reveal translational events in other genes (Table 1). The presence of multiple RAPD profiles from other species could be due to differences in their mating type and the different evolutionary history of the RAPD profiles (e.g., Schizophyllum commune vs. Schizophyllum commune, V. cholerae vs. V. cholerae, and V. burgdorferi vs. V. cholerae) that have not been reported previously (Gourlay et al. 2015). Alternatively, RAPD profiles generated with the Bioinformatics analysis could be due to variations in the mating type of the two mating type loci that have not been previously reported (Gourlay et al. 2015). The RAPD profiles generated with the Bioinformatics analysis could also be due to variations in the mating type of the two mating type loci that have not been previously reported previously (Gourlay et al. 2015).

The Drosophila genomic database is also a good resource for comparative genomics studies.
