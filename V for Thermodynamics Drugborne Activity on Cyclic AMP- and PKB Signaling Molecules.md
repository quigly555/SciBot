## Abstract
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasitic protozoans with a life cycle dedicated to the survival and dispersal of the spores inside macrophages. The main virulence factor of this group of intracellular protozoans is its pisceral organ, the organelle known as the microsomal membrane. Macrophages are considered to be the primary portal of entry for many microsporidians, but recent studies have shown that many other microsporidian species have evolved distinct mechanisms of early-life transmission. The recent publication of the genomes of the pathogenic protozoans Mucor circinelloides (Mucor) and Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) led to predictions that the genomes of these species present an extensive diversity of genomes enriched for pathways associated with virulence factors. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing for six Cryptococcus species isolates to determine the diversity of their gene content and identified five genes of interest, i.e., secreted proteins and amino acids in each species. These results provide a global blueprint for understanding and monitoring the evolution of microsporidians.

Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that live in a closed micrososome and are the primary microorganism involved in invasion and dissemination of microsporidians. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing for the genomes of the pathogenic protozoans M. circinelloides and C. neoformans and identified five genes of interest, including secreted proteins and amino acids. These results provide a global blueprint for the pathogenic protozoans.


## Introduction
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare genetic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), is a rare disorder of the respiratory and/or urinary systems. It is characterized by an abnormal influx of astrocytic cells into the brain parenchyma (Vernis et al., 2009). Most cases are initially diagnosed with the astroglial route, with some cases being later diagnosed on other routes (Dilig et al., 1999; Baio et al., 2001; Baio et al., 2001). The major route of diagnosis is neoplasia due to the presence of astrogliosis, as well as specific bacteria or parasites (Kulli et al., 2009; Müller et al., 2009). However, there are few cases of PML in the literature (Kulli et al., 2009).

The occurrence of PML is not limited to the respiratory system. Lung involvement is commonly associated with fungal infections, and invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a common complication in cases of PML. In the literature, the occurrence of aspergillosis is rare. In an animal model of aspergillosis, the most common organisms are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (Razio et al., 2003; Stotz and Casadevall, 2004; Stotz et al., 2004; Espinel-Ingroff and Momany, 2005; Kulli et al., 2009).


## Methods
The calculation of EC_50 was performed according to the following equation: EC_50 = EC_50 (drug-drug-drug-drug) × 100 (drug-drug-drug.

The PKB-based drug-drug interaction was determined using the Pfam database for pathogen species (Version 7.0) (http://pfam.xfam.org/). In brief, we used a 10-fold dilution series of the starting concentration of the drug (i.e., 5, 20, 40, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg) for both the treatment of drug-induced and non-induced pathogen. For the positive control, we used a 50 mg/kg drug. The ratio of the starting concentration of the drug to the starting drug was compared. The mean values of the 3-fold dilutions were used to calculate the percent synergistic drug interactions.

Pathogen drug interactions were classified into different categories of drug-drug interactions (e.g., additive, antagonistic, or non-drug-drug interactions). These were defined as those interactions that resulted in 1 or more of the following: 1) no growth, 2) growth of a single pathogen, 3) growth of multiple pathogen, or 4) growth of more than one pathogen.

In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the starting concentrations of the drugs, we used the following formula: EC_50 = EC_50 (drug-drug-drug) × 100 (drug-drug-drug).

In order to evaluate the interaction between the starting concentrations of the drugs, we used the following formula: EC_50 = EC_50 (drug-drug-drug) × 100 (drug-drug-drug).

In order to evaluate the interaction between the starting concentrations of the drugs, we used the following formula: EC_50 = EC_50 (drug-drug-drug) × 100 (drug-drug-drug).


## Results
In the genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen, the genes were selected based on their predicted expression patterns, their known biological functions and the small RNAs (sRNAs) and their predicted predicted transposable elements (Tables S1 and S2.

The CRISPR-Cas9-based screen was performed in two biological replicates, one in each of the three biological replicates. A total of 10,763,805 randomly selected genes were successfully selected. The number of CRISPR-Cas9-targeting targets for each genome-wide screen was estimated using an evolutionary criterion, as described in the Methods section. The t-test, with Tukey’s test, showed that the number of target genes was high, even though the number of target genes was low (Table S3). The number of CRISPR-Cas9-targeting targets for each genome-wide screen was calculated using a method based on a reciprocal best hit approach based on the randomization model (Table S4). The distribution of CRISPR-Cas9-targeting targets in the two biological replicates was statistically significant (p = 0.0004, R^2 = 0.0007). The total number of target genes was approximately 30-fold higher than in the CRISPR-Cas9-based screen (Table S5). The percent of target genes that were differentially expressed between the two screens were also determined by comparing the relative expression of the targets using the in silico expression analysis tool (Table S6).

The distribution of CRISPR-Cas9-targeting targets was highly significant when the lowest score of the two replicates was greater than 0.10. This result indicates that the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene silencing system may be useful for drug-resistant infections in immunocompromised patients.

The CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene silencing system has been extensively used for the purification and characterization of drug-resistant fungi and pathogenicity genes.


## Discussion
These AMPs were selected for their ability to degrade PKB inhibitors in vitro, which are the major inhibitors of fungal growth and virulenc. AMPs were expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells, but not in mammalian cells, as previously reported (25). We subsequently examined the expression of AMPs in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans and found that the expression of AMPs varied among these species. The AMPs were expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells, but not in other species, as previously reported (25). In C. albicans, the expression of AMPs was significantly increased in the presence of AMP-1 and AMP-2, but decreased in the presence of AMP-3 (P<0.05), as shown in Fig 2. The AMPs were expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells, but not in other species, as previously reported (25). In S. cerevisiae, AMPs were upregulated in the presence of AMP-1 and AMP-2, whereas their expression was significantly decreased in the presence of AMP-3 (P<0.05). In contrast, expression of AMPs was decreased in the presence of AMP-2 and AMP-3 (P<0.05). These data suggest that AMPs might be required for the maintenance of the cellular integrity.

In contrast to AMPs, only PKB inhibitors were expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells. The PKB inhibitors are reported to have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (17), and their expression was significantly decreased in the presence of PKB inhibitors (P<0.05). The PKB inhibitors were upregulated in the presence of AMP-1 and AMP-2, but decreased in the presence of AMP-3 (P<0.05). These data suggest that the AMPs might be required for the maintenance of cellular integrity.

The expression of AMPs was decreased in the presence of AMP-3 and PKB inhibitors. In contrast, expression of AMPs was increased in the presence of PKB inhibitors (P<0.05). In contrast to AMPs, AMPs were expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells but not in other species, as previously reported (25).
