## Abstract
The Toxoplasma gondii genome encodes a complex of two RNAi-binding cassettes, one RNAi-binding cassette, and four non-RNAi-binding cassettes, representing two gene cassettes, both encoded by the TgPRX1 gene. The TgPRX1 cassette is enriched for a TgPL1 cassette with a single open reading frame (ORF) specifying ORF1, TgPL1, and TgPRX2 indicating that the transcript is a part of the TgPL1-folding polypeptide. The TgPL1-folding polypeptide is enriched for a single ORF specifying the ORF-subunit, revealing a complex of RNAi-binding cassettes, one of which contains both polyketides and non-polyketides.

The genome sequences of the causative agents of chromoblastomycosis (AKC) and non-AKC collectively reflect the genome structure and gene expression. The genome sequences from the TgTgTpoA/TgPL1 Toxoplasma gondii genome contain 22,488,767 unique sequence elements with an overall ORF1-size of 1.9 kb. ORF1-size is greater than the ORF2 genome size reported previously, but less than the TgPL1 ORF2, suggesting that the TgPL1 RNAi-binding cassette is a viable target to induce polyketide tolerance in T. gondii.


## Introduction
Chitin is a structural component of the cell wall of many fungi [19,20,21. It is found in fungal cell walls as a small amount in the cell wall of Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans [22,23]. This structure is responsible for the formation of chitin and chitosan, and has been shown to be essential for fungal virulence [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. However, the role of chitin and chitosan in the cell wall structure of filamentous fungi, especially in relation with the nature of their chitin and chitosan, is not well understood.

Microorganisms have developed a complex machinery to produce chitin and chitosan, which allows them to penetrate and invade the host tissues, as well as to act as pathogens [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43]. Chitin and chitosan are produced by several pathogenic fungi [44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. However, little is known about the effects of fungi producing chitin and chitosan on the fungal cell wall.

Chitin and chitosan are synthesized as two types of polymers: linear polymers and degradable degradable polymers. The degradable polymer is linear chitin and chitosan and its degradability is due to its non-abrasive nature. In the degradable polymer, chitin and chitosan are produced de novo. In the linear polymers chitin and chitosan are produced by de novo synthesis of de novo chitin and chitosan [51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58]. The degradable degradable polymer is linear chitin and chitosan. The degradable degradable polymer is linear chitin and chitosan. It has a high melting temperature and it is a common polymer used in detergent manufacturing. It is produced by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. However, there are few information on the effects of fungi producing chitin and chitosan on the cell wall.


## Methods
For these reasons, we found that the analyses were not suitable to include the experimental results and that some samples were not homogenous and thus did not provide a reliable picture of the microbial communit. Therefore, we re-annotated the experimental results for each sample, and the phytopathogen data were evaluated by means of the distance matrix and the calculation of the matrix. The distance matrix was implemented by means of the non-parametric method with arithmetic averages (ANOVA). The analysis was performed with three independent experiments and the data were evaluated by means of principal component analysis (PCA). The data were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means were compared by means of Student's t-test. The relative quantile method was applied to evaluate the relationships among the observed variables, which is the principle of “anonymous” methods. The relative quantile method is based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a fixed-ratio test and a discrete-effect test. The analyses were performed in the following order: Baseline (baseline value 0) and after (baseline value 0) times (Baseline value 1).

2.3. Control and Secondary Metabolite Beads for Flow Cytometry
The cell-free-floating-phase culture medium was used to prepare the cells for enzyme assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom, 96-well plates (Nunc) and allowed to settle for 10 min. Subsequently, 10 µl of culture media and 10 µl of 5 × 10^4 cells/ml were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS to remove non-phagocytosed bacteria. The media was then removed and the wells were washed with PBS to remove non-fluorescence-activated-cell sorting (FACS) beads. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 4000× g for 15 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, then resuspended in 1 × PBS to obtain the desired volume. The cells were then incubated with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the fluorescently labeled cells in the presence of 1 × 10^6 CFU of the standard cell-free-floating-phase culture medium.


## Results
. albicans infection induces the production of many cytokines, including IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-1ß, and TNF-a, in the host [30], and this cytokine production is stimulated by fungal cells and is highly conserved in both C. albicans and C. neoformans. We found that the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and TNF-a was increased in the presence of C. albicans. This observation suggested that C. albicans infection triggers a major immune response in the host. To further evaluate the contribution of these cytokines to C. albicans infection, we examined the production of cytokines that are not present in yeast. We found that, in C. albicans, the production of TGF-ß and IL-10 was increased, whereas that of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and TNF-a was decreased. These data suggested that C. albicans infection induces the cytokine production of the cytokines IL-1ß and TNF-a in the host.

The production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-1ß, and TNF-a was also reduced in C. albicans-infected mice (Fig 4). Furthermore, we found that C. albicans-infected mice showed higher numbers of neutrophils in the lungs compared to control mice. The number of neutrophils in the lungs was significantly reduced in C. albicans-infected mice (Fig 4). These results suggested that C. albicans infection triggers a cytokine production defect in the host.

C. albicans induces changes in the inflammatory response in the host
We next investigated whether C. albicans infection induces changes in the inflammatory response in the host. The main cytokines in the inflammatory response in the host were shown to be the cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and TNF-a [31]. We found that the production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-1ß, and TNF-a were increased in the presence of C. albicans. These results suggested that C.


## Discussion
Additionally, their roles in host-pathogen interactions and their influence on the composition of microbial communities have been observed in other microbial species and in their pathogenic lifestyles [14. In fact, the presence of chitin in the biofilm of human cells has been observed [45], suggesting that chitin is the primary component of the biofilm formed by human cells [46].

In addition to the roles of chitin and its biosynthetic enzymes in the biosynthesis of chitin and chitosan, it has been reported that the composition of the microbial community composition is affected by environmental factors, such as the type of nutrients, age and the number of carbon sources used by the microbes [47]. Therefore, the environment-related effects of microbial colonization and development are also affected by the type of nutrients present in the biofilm, which further increases the chance for the adaptation of the microbes to the stress conditions.

Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that chitin synthase (CgTrx1) and chitinase (CgTrx2) were down-regulated in the pre-culture and after the initial exposure to the initial stress conditions, respectively, and the transcription factor (CgTrx1) and the prokaryote (CgTrx2) were up-regulated in the presence of glucose and/or other carbon sources. The transcription factor CgTrx1 also regulates the production of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, which are important in the development and survival of fungi and bacteria [48]. In the microbial community, the expression of several genes involved in the biosynthesis of chitin and chitosan was down-regulated in the pre-culture and after the initial exposure to the initial stress conditions. The accumulation of chitosan (CgCnA) was increased by the increase of CgTrx1. The accumulation of CgCnA in the pre-culture is required for the production of chitosan [49]. In addition, the expression of CgCnB and CgCnC in the pre-culture was up-regulated by the increase of CgTrx1. The expression of CgCnA in the pre-culture was up-regulated by the increase of CgTrx1.
