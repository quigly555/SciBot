## Abstract
Candida glabrata is a human fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immune-compromised patients. The ability of C. glabrata to sense and adapt to different environmental stresses makes it an attractive model system for developing model antigens. One such model antigens is the polysaccharide capsule, which in Candida glabrata is composed of a polysaccharide and a polysaccharide capsule. The polysaccharide capsule is essential for virulence, as shown in murine models of infection, and in the murine model of systemic Candida infection. In this model of Candida infection, the C. glabrata capsule protects the yeast from the host immune system and is required for survival and morphological switching that is essential for the pathogen to gain entry into the host. In the murine model of Candida infection, the capsule protects the yeast from the host, and the ability of C. glabrata to protect virulence is dependent on the C. glabrata capsule. In contrast, the virulence boost of the capsule is lost in the murine model, as demonstrated by murine pulmonary infection with C. glabrata.


## Introduction
Lung dysplasia (also known as rheumatoid arthritis, : arthritis of the lungs, rheumatoid arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis) is a spectrum of diseases characterized by the presence of multiple nodules on the immune system, usually consisting of multiple nodules in the same nodule. The disease can be caused by many different bacteria, although the causative organism is often the subject of often-cited literature reviews and books. The most common cause of nodules is due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a gram-negative bacterium which in many cases is a direct causative agent of lung diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, mycosis, cystic fibrosis, and osteomyelitis. Other causes of nodules include: (1) bacterial infections (hematomycosis), (2) neoplastic diseases, (3) autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), and (4) viral diseases. The most common pathogens associated with rheumatoid arthritis nodules are: (1) Helicobacter pylori, (2) Streptococcus, (3) Neisseria meningitides, (4) Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (5) Mycobacterium avium complex, (6) Mycobacterium xenopi, (7) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and (8) Mycobacterium jejuni. The most common causes of nodules in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are: (1) Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (2) Streptococcus pneumoniae, and (3) Salmonella. Most cases of rheumatoid arthritis nodules are due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a bacterium which is ubiquitous in the environment, and S. aureus, a bacterium which is ubiquitous in healthy people.


## Methods
However, these models do not allow for exo- and exo-dna-mediated cdc42 regulation of cdc4. Therefore, we designed two models for studying the cdc42 gene regulation of Cladophora sojafura. For the cdc42 gene regulation, we tested the effect of GFP-GFP-TUB2 on transcriptome of Cladophora sojafura by a cdc42-gfp-TUB2-mCherry-GFP and cdc42-gfp-TUB2-mCherry-GFP models using bcl2, bcl2-mCherry-TUB2, bcl2-mCherry-TUB2-mCherry, and bcl2-mCherry-TUB2-mCherry-GFP models. For exo- and exo-dna-mediated cdc42 regulation, we tested the effect of cdc42-gfp-TUB2-mCherry-GFP-GFP and cdc42-gfp-TUB2-mCherry-GFP models using bcl2, bcl2-mCherry-TUB2, and bcl2-mCherry-TUB2 models. The cdc42 gene regulated by cdc42 was selected as the reference gene for the study. We assessed the effect of mCherry-NEO in Cladophora sojafura and hph-mCherry-NEO in Cladophora sojafura by a comparison of the expression patterns of H. sojafura WT and hph-mCherry-NEO, respectively. The cdc42 gene regulated by cdc42 was selected as the reference gene for the study. We assessed the effect of oProst-Tag-GFP-NEO-mCherry on transcriptome of Cladophora sojafura by a comparison of the expression patterns of H. sojafura WT and hph-mCherry-NEO, respectively.


## Results
AP-1 and AP-2 transcripts were up-regulated in the <U+0394>lac1 strain (p<.01) compared to the WT, suggesting that LAC1 influences AP-1 specific tRNAs. The AP-1 transcripts in the <U+0394>lac1 strain were not detected in the <U+0394>bac1 or <U+0394>bcs1 strains, but they were detected in the <U+0394>bac1 strain (Fig 1C). The transcript levels of the LAC1-1 transcripts in the <U+0394>lac1 strain were not detected in the <U+0394>bcs1 strain. To investigate the role of LAC1 in AP-1-dependent tRNA processing, we first examined the expression levels of AP-1 specific tRNAs. The transcript levels of AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 transcripts were significantly higher in the <U+0394>lac1 strain compared to the WT and <U+0394>bac1 strains, suggesting a role in AP-1-dependent tRNA processing in the <U+0394>lac1 strain. Interestingly, AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 transcripts were increased in the <U+0394>bcs1 strain compared to the <U+0394>bac1 strain (Fig 1D). The expression of the AP-1-1 transcripts was increased in the <U+0394>lac1 strain compared to the <U+0394>bcs1 strain (Fig 1D). To analyze whether LAC1 regulates AP-1-dependent transcription of AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 transcripts, we analyzed the transcript levels of the AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 transcripts in the <U+0394>lac1 and <U+0394>bcs1 strains. The transcript levels of the AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 transcripts in the <U+0394>lac1 and <U+0394>bcs1 strains were not detected in the <U+0394>lac1 strain, but they were detected in the <U+0394>lac1 strain (Fig 1E).


## Discussion
Cladophialophora sojafura was previously reported to interact with Langerin and to interact with Langerin E3 (21. We found that Cladophialophora sojafura was likely to have more receptors for AP-1 specific tRNAs and AP-2 specific tRNAs (Table 1). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Cladophialophora sojafura may possess additional AP-1 specific tRNAs.

Using RISC-2 and RISC-3 as a target for gene silencing, we also found that all of the genes of the TCA cycle were potentially silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura. Additionally, we found that genes involved in the H^+-ATPase/transporters complex were also silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura (Table 2). Further, we found that genes involved in the H^+-ATPase/transporters complex were also silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura (Table 2). This suggests that Cladophialophora sojafura possesses multiple potential candidate genes for gene silencing.

The RISC-2 and RISC-3 pathways were previously shown to be involved in the TCA cycle in M. oryzae (24). We found that genes involved in the TCA cycle were also silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura (Table 2). The TCA cycle has been shown to be associated with melanin production in M. oryzae (25), and the CCAAT cycle is implicated in the TCA cycle in M. oryzae (26). However, gene expression in the CCAAT cycle was not altered in Cladophialophora sojafura. Thus, it is possible that gene silencing in Cladophialophora sojafura was likely a response to reduced melanin production in M. oryzae.

We found that genes involved in the H^+-ATPase/transporters complex were also silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura. We also found that genes involved in the H^+-ATPase/transporters complex were also silenced in Cladophialophora sojafura (Table 2).
