## Abstract
The presence of a conserved transcription factor and two hypothetical proteins in Candida albicans pathogenesis and innate immunity cells was investigated using genome-wide analysis.

The C. albicans genome contains an extraordinary array of genes, and the C. albicans protein complex is the largest reported in nature. The complex contains 1,459 proteins, with an average length of 1.7 Megabases. The C. albicans protein complex encompasses 20 proteins, representing almost 20% of the protein family. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Basidiomycota, Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Chytridiomycota. The order and molecular masses of the complex members are conserved among all analyzed genomes, and it includes 14 putative secondary dimorphic groups. Several putative secondary dimorphic factors are also present in the C. albicans complex. The C. albicans protein complex includes several proteins expressed during the inflammatory response and are necessary for the pathogen to survive within the host and to cause disease in mammals.

We have identified the first transcription factor and hypothetical protein, which are required for survival in the host and are crucial for the survival of C.


## Introduction
albicans and yeast strains produced in vitro (Figure 1. Yeast strains are the most common causative species for invasive candidiasis. In vitro experiments indicated that the antibacterial agents (yeast, mold, and yeast) could inhibit the growth of Candida species and yeast species that were associated with the acquisition of tissue damage. Yeast strains that were isolated from lesions were found to be more resistant to the antifungal agents than yeast strains isolated from healthy individuals. The yeast species (yeast, mold, and yeast) isolated from the C. albicans infection lesions were found to be more virulent and to have higher growth and survival rates in comparison with yeast strains isolated from the infected skin, sinuses, and bloodstream. Yeast species that were isolated from the C. albicans infection lesions were also found to be more resistant to the antifungal agents than yeast strains isolated from healthy individuals. As a result, it is evident that yeasts that are not susceptible to antifungal agents are the main agents of invasive candidiasis.

The ability of yeasts to produce bioactive compounds has been a topic of interest. The genus Candida contains over 160 species. However, C. albicans has been reported to be resistant to at least one of the five antifungal drugs used for treatment of candidiasis. Candida albicans is considered to be a harmless commensal organism and can survive in the gastrointestinal tract without causing invasive disease [1]. Candida albicans is also a harmless human pathogen and can cause infections in immunocompromised patients such as HIV/AIDS patients, and those with diabetes, who are unable to stand solid foods such as fish or meat. The host immune response is critical for the pathogenesis of Candida infections [2]. The ability of Candida albicans to produce bioactive compounds is the major factor that contributes to the bioavailability of bioactive compounds, which can be used to improve the treatment of infections. In fact, recent studies have shown that bioactive compounds present in bioactive compounds can be used to improve the treatment of Candida infections. These bioactive compounds have been shown to be active against certain Candida species [3].

The identification of bioactive compounds in natural products has contributed to the discovery of many new compounds with potential anti-infective activities.


## Methods
The results of the MICs were expressed as the lowest concentration of the drug that inhibited visible growth or viabilit. The concentrations of efavirenz, flucytosine, posaconazole, and ketoconazole that yielded minimal inhibitory effect on the fungal growth were the same as the MICs for AMB and Efavirenz. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Institute of Microbiology of University of Pune, India (Approval No. PI/2012/4/10/16/12).

4.3. In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Water Coolant against Candida albicans
The antifungal activity of water cooled antifungal drugs against Candida albicans was evaluated by using the MICs for amphotericin B (AMB) and efavirenz (Efavirenz, Pfizer, Armonk, NY, USA), flucytosine (Citrimax, Pharmacia Biotech, Pune, India), and posaconazole (Zoloft, France). The MICs for AMB and Efavirenz were the same as the MICs for AMB and Efavirenz. The results of the MICs were expressed as the lowest concentration of the drug that did not inhibit visible growth or viability. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited visible growth or viability of the fungus. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Institute of Microbiology of University of Pune, India (Approval No. PI/2012/4/10/16/12/12).

## Results
Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen causing serious and life-threatening disease in patient. Therefore, it is an essential food product in many countries. Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections caused by Aedes aegypti and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which are used as the sole source of food in many countries. Candida albicans is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in humans, and it is the most frequently caused cause of serious, life-threatening and emergency respiratory diseases in the United States. Candida albicans causes extensive human and veterinary morbidity and mortality [31]. The mortality rate is 25% in humans and 25% in veterinary patients, and the mortality rate in humans is 5-10%. Candida albicans is also considered to be an opportunistic pathogen [32]. Candida albicans is commonly found in blood, kidney and skin of humans and other mammals, and causes bloodstream infection, hemorrhage and painful injuries [33]. The cause of death in humans is usually caused by a single cause of death, such as the post-mortem hemorrhage or infection [34].


## Discussion
cerevisiae, . neoformans and C. albicans was evaluated by determining the in vitro antifungal activity of water coolant against the strains of the pathogenic yeast. The antifungal activity of water coolant against the strains of S. cerevisiae was comparable to that of H. capsulatum against S. aureus. However, H. capsulatum was more resistant to water cooling (MIC = 2.0 µg/mL) and H. capsulatum was more susceptible to H_2O_2 (MIC = 2.0 µg/mL) than C. albicans (MIC = 4.0 µg/mL). The in vitro antifungal activity of water coolant against C. neoformans and C. albicans was significantly more than that of H. capsulatum against S. aureus and C. neoformans (MIC = 2.0 µg/mL). This may be because C. albicans and C. albicans are a highly virulent and highly diverse group of yeasts that cause a great deal of disease in the United States, which is a hostile environment for many clinical and environmental yeast species.

In this study, the in vitro antifungal activity of water coolant against C. neoformans, C. albicans and C. albicans was evaluated against C. albicans. The MIC values of water coolant against C. albicans ranged from 0.33 µg/mL to 4.0 µg/mL and the MIC of water coolant against C. neoformans ranged from 0.31 µg/mL to 2.0 µg/mL. The antifungal activity of water coolant against C. neoformans ranged from 0.31 µg/mL to 4.0 µg/mL. The antifungal activity of water coolant against C. albicans ranged from 0.31 µg/mL to 2.0 µg/mL.

The in vitro antifungal activity of water coolant against C. albicans was significantly more than that of H. capsulatum against S. aureus and C. neoformans. The antifungal activity of water coolant against C. albicans ranged from 0.
