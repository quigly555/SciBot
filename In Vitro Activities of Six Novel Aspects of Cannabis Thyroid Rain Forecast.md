## Introduction
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a well-known human pathogen, is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the global population. Although resistance to the essential and broad spectrum antibiotics is common in MRSA, the emergence of resistance to these drugs has been observed in the past few years. Recently, a new generation of MRSA strains has emerged in the Netherlands and other countries in the Southern European countries, where these strains have emerged in recent years. Although MRSA has been frequently used as a human and animal model, its safety has been repeatedly questioned. In order to control this pathogen, the global health-care system requires new approaches in combination with the development of better diagnostic tools and better prevention strategies.

The recent introduction of multiple line assays and genomic methods for the detection of MRSA has made it possible to rapidly detect and isolate MRSA strains in clinical samples. The rapid detection of MRSA in urine and blood is an important technique used in the management of MRSA infections. The most important feature of the rapid detection of MRSA in urine and blood is the lack of delay in the time of detection. The new technology of rapid culture (LAC) has resulted in a rapid turnaround time of 5-7 minutes. LAC is fast becoming a standard diagnostic tool in the clinical laboratory and has the potential to detect the presence of MRSA, although only a small percentage of MRSA isolates are positive. It can be used to detect MRSA, although MRSA-specific Gram stain still remains the most sensitive method for the detection of MRSA in urine. LAC was initially developed in 2002 for the rapid detection of MRSA in blood (He et al., 2002). The technique relies on lysis of infected cells or macrophages and allows the rapid detection of the organism in urine. The LAC test can detect both MRSA and non-MRSA species, although the percentages of MRSA and MRSA-specific Gram stain is significantly higher than that of MRSA-specific Gram stain (Klosowski et al.


## Methods
The test was performed according to the instructions of the Aspergillus Institute (AIF) [45. The strains were cultured in a growth chamber at 37 °C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 2 days. The turbidity of each culture was determined with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The test was performed in triplicate.

The test was performed in triplicate, and the mean inhibition rate (%) was calculated by the formula: [C-N]/([C-1] × 100).

Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
To evaluate the effect of the drugs on the growth of Aspergillus strains, the Aspergillus Institute (AIF) [45] test was performed. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a variety of Aspergillus strains were cultured on SDA at 37 °C for 7 days. The test was performed in triplicate.

For evaluating the effect of the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method to evaluate the effect of the drugs on the growth of Aspergillus strains, a variety of Aspergillus strains were cultured on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) at 37 °C for 7 days. The test was performed according to the instructions of the Aspergillus Institute (AIF) [45]. The strains were cultured in a growth chamber at 37 °C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 2 days. The turbidity of each culture was determined with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The test was performed in triplicate.

The test was performed in triplicate, and the MIC was determined by the formula: [C-N]/([C-1] × 100).

The MIC was determined by the formula: [C-N]/([C-1] × 100).


## Results
The fungal genera are characterized by fungal-like and plant-like-like-like and asexual morphs and are characterized by asexual morph. The bioinformatic analysis of the LC-MS/MS results revealed the following: (1) the MIC values were: (a) 2.35 µg/ml; (b) 2.83 µg/ml; (c) 2.33 µg/ml; (d) 2.53 µg/ml; (e) 2.55 µg/ml; (f) 2.75 µg/ml; (g) 2.69 µg/ml; (h) 2.72 µg/ml; (i) 2.75 µg/ml; (j) 2.49 µg/ml; (k) 2.48 µg/ml; (l) 2.60 µg/ml; (m) 2.33 µg/ml. The analysis of the LC-MS/MS results revealed the following: (1) the MIC values were: (a) 2.35 µg/ml; (b) 2.83 µg/ml; (c) 2.33 µg/ml; (d) 2.55 µg/ml; (e) 2.55 µg/ml; (i) 2.33 µg/ml; (j) 2.49 µg/ml; (k) 2.48 µg/ml; (l) 2.60 µg/ml; (m) 2.65 µg/ml; (n) 2.55 µg/ml.

## Discussion

Other studies have reported a variety of activities of the tested strains that are not relevant to the tested strain. For example, the activities of the tested strains were generally in the range of the activities previously reported for strains used in the present study. This is in line with the findings of the present study, in which the activities of the tested strains were in the range of activities previously reported for strains of C. albicans (see Table 2).

The activities of the tested strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii were also higher than those reported for C. albicans and C. gattii strains, as shown in Table 3. The activities of strains C-14 and C-23 were, in general, in the range of activities previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii.

The activities of strains C-6 and C-8 were in general similar to those previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii. The activities of strains C-20 and C-21 were similar to those previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii.

The activities of strains C-13 and C-14 were also similar to those previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii. The activities of strains C-13 and C-14 were in general similar to those previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii.

The activities of strains C-14 and C-20 were in general similar to those previously reported for strains of C. albicans and C. gattii.
