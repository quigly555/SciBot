## Abstract
The traditional use of flocculent plants for human consumption has gained considerable interest due to their health benefits. Inhibitors that are used to treat chronic infections, such as Aspergillus species, Aspergillus-related fungi, and Candida albicans, are all used to treat pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections caused by these opportunistic fungal pathogens. However, the wide use of fungi in human health and the development of new immunotherapies are limited by the lack of reliable, eco-friendly flocculent plants. To overcome the limited flocculent plant resources, natural products from these sources have been isolated from various natural sources. The aim of this study was to investigate the health benefits of citronella and water extracts of Flocculus agaricus on host plant and to identify the potential toxic effects of citronella. The study was conducted on human keratinocytes (NK cells) and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The extracts were subjected to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and cytotoxicity against the opportunistic fungi and other bacteria (TOD) of interest: Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and dermatophytes. The activity of the extracts against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and dermatophytes were also determined. The effects of citronella on human keratinocytes were analyzed. The results indicated that the extracts showed moderate cytotoxicity and low scavenging activity. Inhibitors were less active than in cells treated with citronella. This study revealed the efficacy of the extracts in treating fungal keratitis by Aspergillus fumigatus and dermatophytes.


## Introduction
arvar.edu/~anomol/species/species/asi_species.asp) is a project of the Allen Institute for RNA-Seq and DNA Sequencing (DSA), the first and only DNA-Seq database, and is aimed to provide a comprehensive, DNA-Seq resource for all organisms, from yeasts to humans. As a part of the DSA project, we are aiming to translate the biodiversity of the DSA database into a usable format, enabling comprehensive information on the genomic and functional aspects of all members of the Aspergillus.

The A. niger genus is a large and well-studied member of the Aspergilli genus and is regarded as one of the most successful plant pathogenic fungi (Kües, 2004; Baas Becking, 2014). The pathogenicity of A. niger is a complex system with many different morphs, including asexual and sexual stages, which are evolutionarily related to the baker’s yeast and some of its relatives. In spite of the name “pini-teff”, the sexual stage is not known from morphological data (Santangelo et al., 2006; Kües, 2004; Sexton et al., 2006; Baas Becking et al., 2014), although the sexual stage can cause many diseases in the host (Böhm et al., 2000; Thambugala et al., 2013). Although A. niger is known as a prolific pathogen for the human health, its population is largely unprocessed. The vast majority of the population is driven by the sexual cycle, which is asexual or sexual and is triggered by environmental cues such as temperature, nutrition, hypoxia, nutrients, and mechanical trauma (Böhm et al., 2000). Under certain environmental conditions, such as nutrient limitation, light, and temperature changes, the sporangiophores switch from the classic to a- and <U+03B3>-phase (Steffen and Böhm, 2002) and establish an infection (Baas Becking et al., 2014). The sporangiophores also produce mycelia and produce conidia (Steffen and Böhm, 2002). In addition to the classical sexual stages, several other hyphal and conidium-producing developmental stages are known to occur in the sexual stage of A.


## Methods
n.org/Anl.DB/Anl.DB/. The sequence data of the annotations was generated by different methods, including manual curation, annotation and annotation improvement using annotation tools available in AnlDB (http://www.anl.org/AnlDB/Anl_DB/annotations/annotations.html). In addition, the sequence data were also compared with the sequences of the newly published JGI protein database (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/JGI/index.html) and the reference sequences of the main A. niger strains in GenBank. The accession numbers of the newly published protein sequences and annotations are listed in Table 1.

Molecular biology and strain construction
The fungal strains used in this study were isolated from a strawberry (Auculatus cv. Myr.) variety of the same species. The strains were grown in 1 liter of YPD broth at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 3 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000× g and washed with ddH_2O. The pellets were suspended in 1 liter of ddH_2O and extracted by using chloroform and isopropanol. The organic extracts were washed with water and dried under vacuum for 48 h. The dried extracts were suspended in 1 liter of ddH_2O and the concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/ml. The fungal extracts were filtered and washed with water. The filters were then placed on polypropylene cover slips and placed on the surface of a 2-liter Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) containing 200 µg/ml of chloramphenicol (CMT, Sigma) at 30°C for 1 h. The TSB was centrifuged at 2000× g and the supernatants were transferred to fresh TSB. The cell concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/ml and the cells were suspended in 1 liter of ddH_2O and incubated for 18 h at 30°C. The cellular concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/ml and the cells were suspended in 1 liter of ddH_2O and incubated for 18 h at 30°C. The cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^5 cells/ml and the suspensions were transferred to fresh TSB.

Identification of candidate gene families
As shown in Table 1, over 100 candidate gene families were identified (Table S1). In total, 441 candidate genes were identified. The most highly represented gene families were: a-linked glycosyltransferases (102 genes), heme-binding protein (44 genes), glycoside hydrolases (25 genes), polysaccharide-binding protein (15 genes), glycosyltransferases (10 genes), and metallothioneins (10 genes). For the remaining genes, there was a wide variation in the number of genes, number of candidate genes, and number of candidates gene families. The most highly represented gene families are: a-linked glycosyltransferases (97 genes), heme-binding proteins (91 genes), glycoside hydrolases (68 genes), polysaccharide-binding protein (16 genes), and metallothioneins (15 genes). For the remaining genes, there were a broad variation in the number of genes, number of genes, number of genes, and number of genes. The most highly represented gene families are: a-linked glycosyltransferases (88 genes), heme-binding proteins (53 genes), glycoside hydrolases (20 genes), and polysaccharide-binding protein (12 genes).

The complete list of candidate genes can be found in Table S2. The results were reported in Table 2. The list of genes is summarized in Table 3. In general, the number of genes was very similar among the clusters. The genes with the highest number of genes were those with higher number of genes. For example, in cluster 1, the gene encoding the catalase of P. brasiliensis showed the highest number of genes (10 genes). This gene has been identified in several species of fungi. However, many of these species have the same host. This gene could be related to the infection of the banana, which is considered as the banana of the type cultivar, and thus, has been associated with the pathogenicity of Fusarium species.
