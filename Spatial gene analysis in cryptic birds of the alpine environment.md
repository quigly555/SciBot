## Abstract
A phylogenomic analysis of 111 genomes revealed that the presence of many geographically dispersed genes and a large number of gene families that are absent in the Asian population may reflect asexual stag. The wide distribution of genes that are inactive in the Asian population suggests that an ancient sexual cycle is more or less in conflict with common environmental management processes in the region than with the birds’ natural habitat. This conflict could be resolved by dispersal and dispersal of the birds from their natural habitat in Central Asia. Here we propose that sexual reproduction is a mechanism by which the birds acquire wings to fly on land. The birds then use their acquired wings to provide wing support and wing flaps to support the birds’ wings, and so on and so forth until the birds reach a certain abundance and density density, when the flies become exhausted and fly away. The wings flap has been shown to provide an important transportation system for the birds, and might even have a role in the birds’ land use.

Although they are tiny, avian and insect wing microenvironments have shaped the history of flight for almost as long as the insects have. For almost as long as land plants and animals have been described to give wings to fly. Now, at least two surprising conclusions can be drawn: 1) wings flap have been used to provide wing support for the birds in many places in the region; and 2) some of the genes that are inactive in animals have been used to acquire wings for the animals in the same manner. For example, the flies flap is probably used in the same way as the birds wing microenvironments as a means of supporting the birds land use, and 2) dispersal by the birds has been discussed to involve the birds’ land use. To begin to understand these questions, we suggest that the wings flap hypothesis is right, that the two distributions of the genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the birds and insects and the fly distributions of genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER rRNA) in the mammals are consistent with the possibility that the wings flap is a bastion of wings for the insects. Therefore, the wings flap hypothesis is right, that the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a less than tiny, airborne organelle, and that flies flap is a more general instrument for the transfer of wings to other less than tiny organelle.


## Introduction
The genus Trichoderma has been widely reported for its multisept morphological characteristics. This genus consists of more than 50 species; of these, Trichoderma is a well-known plant pathogen with a worldwide distribution [1]. In the past two decades, several Trichoderma species have been reported as human pathogenic fungi, which can cause superficial and deep-seated infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in the immunosuppressed patients. Trichoderma species can infect both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients.


## Methods
Morphological study
Strains were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) at 28°C for 7 days. Spores were harvested by scraping the spore suspension off the surface of the liquid medium with a cotton swab, and mounted in a growth medium with the solution of 2% glucose and 1.5% arabinose. A fungal colony of Candida albicans (ATCC 22019) was used as the mounting medium. Colony characters and colour were observed after 7 days of culture on potato dextrose agar.

Molecular biology methods
To isolate genomic DNA, 1 µl of genomic DNA was mixed with 4 µl of 0.5 mg/ml DNAseI (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), and incubated at 37°C for 5 min, followed by incubation at 80°C for 10 min. The mycelium was washed with distilled water and stored at 4°C for later use.


## Results
anserina, but also in many other cryptic bird. The P. anserina showed a low overall average gene expression level compared to the other cryptic species (Table S3). However, the P. anserina was relatively more highly expressed in the mycobiont than in the other species. The average gene expression level of P. anserina was 2.3-fold higher than the other species and 2.2-fold higher than the other cryptic species. In contrast, the average gene expression level of the other species was only 2.3-fold higher than the other species. In addition, the average gene expression of the P. anserina was higher than the other species and 1.8-fold higher than the other species. In all these comparisons, the average gene expression of the P. anserina was 2.3-fold higher than the other species, whereas it was not higher than the other species (Table S3).

In order to further assess the differential gene expression of P. anserina in the cryptic species, the gene expression levels of putative environmental phenotypes of the P. anserina were compared. Among the P. anserina, the expression of the P. anserina gene has been extensively studied [23], [24]. We found that the P. anserina genes are highly expressed in the mycobiont (Fig 2B). This gene was the only one of the four putative environmental phenotypes that was highly expressed in the P. anserina, and it was only expressed in the mycobiont.

P. anserina is expressed in all different developmental stages
In order to evaluate the biological activities of P. anserina, it was measured the effect of glucose on the growth of P. anserina under different developmental conditions (Fig 3A). The P. anserina grown under glucose-containing medium showed no significant growth inhibition on growth. However, the P. anserina grown under sorbitol-containing medium showed significant growth inhibition on growth and the expression of P. anserina genes was higher than in the other species. In contrast, the expression of P. anserina genes was also higher in the P. anserina grown under glucose-containing medium. The expression of P.


## Discussion
We have thus far studied cryptic species in the Eurasian and Indian Ophiostomatales, a group of known cryptic species of the Ophiostomatales that can be distinguished from each other by their interspecific gene transfer [44. The present study has confirmed that the Hap2a and Hap2b-like MAP kinases are absolutely required for the activation of the MAPK cascade in the Ophiostomatales. Thus far, no studies have addressed the functions of the MAPK and Hap2a-like MAPK MAP kinases in the signaling and stress responses of birds of the alpine environment.

Based on our previous studies in the alpine environment and our present findings, we conclude that the MAPK cascade plays a crucial role in the interaction between the alpine and ophiostomatoid life cycles in the Ophiostomatales, and that the MAPK cascade is involved in the signaling and stress responses of cryptic species of the Ophiostomatales, thus representing an evolutionary and evolutionary conserved family of MAPK cascades. In addition, our data indicate that Hap2a and Hap2b are absolutely required for the activation of the MAPK pathway in the Ophiostomatales. The MAPK cascade plays a key role in the adaptation of cryptic species to the alpine environment, and thus represents an evolutionary conserved family of MAPK cascades in the Ophiostomatales. The mechanism of MAPK cascades in ophiostomatoid species is mainly based on a pathway involving a paralogous protein from the MAPK cascade. A detailed study of the MAPK cascade in ophiostomatoid species and cryptic species in the Ophiostomatales has shown that the proteins of the MAPK cascade are required for the activation of the MAPK cascade in the Ophiostomatales [37,39]. The S. japonicus MAPK cascade has two distinct functions in ophiostomatoid life cycles in the Ophiostomatales. The first function is the activation of the MAPK cascade by the MAPK cascade in cryptic species of the Ophiostomatales. The second function is the activation of the MAPK cascade in cryptic species of the Ophiostomatales.
