## Abstract
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are fundamental nutrients for life, and are essential for various processes of eukaryotic organisms, including plant and animal development, reproductive development, and pathogenesis of diseases such as vascular disease and cancer. However, the functional roles of PUFAs in these processes are not well understood. In this study, we identified PUFAs in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and compared the biological significance of these PUFAs with other PUFAs. These studies indicated that the expression of a novel 2-kinase gene (kinaseC gene) is significantly induced in vegetative hyphae and is higher in vegetative conidia in A. nidulans compared with A. nidulans and A. flavus. The expression of a novel pathway-specific heat shock protein 1 (shock protein C gene) was also increased in A. nidulans, A. flavus, and A. nidulans-infected mycelium, indicating that these M1-like proteins play roles in the response of A. nidulans and A. nidulans-infected mycelium to oxidative stress. We also identified a novel phospholipase D (Pminase D) (ODS-1) in the mycelium of A. nidulans in response to oxidative stress. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the A. nidulans and A.


## Introduction

The application of natural products in traditional medicine has resulted in the recent recognition of a number of bioactive compounds that have been used for the treatment of different diseases and ailments [9. Y. lipolytica is one of the well-known Asian medicinal plants which have been used since ancient times for the treatment of several disorders including inflammatory diseases, cancer, inflammation and hemorrhage. The leaves, roots, fruits and seeds of this plant have been used for the treatment of digestive disorders, rheumatism, boils, boils, syphilis, rheumatism, boils, boils and neuroperennial hemorrhage [11]. The leaves and roots of this plant have been used in the treatment of inflammation and inflammation of the blood vessels and the wound healing [12].

The pharmaceutical industry has started to take off in recent years with the development of pharmaceutical drugs, including antibacterial, antifungal and antimalarial drugs, which have been given significant development in the past few decades [13]. The polyene, which is an antimicrobial compound is one of the main structural building blocks of natural products [14]. It has been shown that the pharmaceutical industry has increased tremendously in the past few years, with the discovery of potent number of novel compounds and compounds with unique properties [15]. The chemical structures of Y. lipolytica have been elucidated as a complex of four sub-families with different biological activities including antimicrobial, anticancer, antimalarial and antioxidant activities [16]. The lipids of these species possess a range of pharmacological properties, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer and immunomodulatory activities [17]. The composition of this complex is highly variable in China and is largely influenced by several factors, such as the cultivar, geographical location, microorganisms, strains, and application of the agent [18].

The most significant factor influencing the chemical structure of Y. lipolytica is the dry mass of the oil. The dry mass of Y. lipolytica is approximately 10,000 kDa. However, some of the natural products are active against the bacteria that live inside the yeast form of Y. lipolytica [19]. The active ingredients of Y. lipolytica are a flavonoid, a flavonol, a flavaniline, a flavanone, a flavanone-ß, and an ethanolic extract.


## Methods
Yeast cells were harvested, washed with 1×PBS, and suspended in sterile PBS to the same concentration as the yeast cell. Then, cells were resuspended in a sterile PBS solution (0.5% Bacto-TEF-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, D44-3546) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with gentle shaking. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 5,000×g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with PBS, and suspended in a 1×PBS solution containing 0.25% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, D44-3551) for 30 min at 37°C. Then, cells were centrifuged at 5,000×g for 10 min at 4°C and washed with PBS. Then, cells were lysed with 100% a-a-a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ABAC) for 5 min at room temperature and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000×g at 4°C for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 50% ACN and stored at -80°C.

We also prepared a new medium for the production of yeast cellulases using a modified yeast cellulose acetate medium (YCT) (see above). In brief, YCT is composed of 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% bactopeptone, 0.1% chloroform, and 1.0% phenol-sulfonic acid (Pyeast-IP) (Sigma-Aldrich, D44-3545). The media contained 0.3% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 2% agar. The media was kept at 20°C and periodically checked for the production of hyphae.

In order to prepare the yeast cellulases, we used the previously mentioned modified YCT medium. In brief, YCT contains 0.5% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% bactopeptone, 0.1% chloroform, and 0.


## Results
The first formulation, which was formulated with a sterile control of a cocktail of three compounds, had the highest rate of lipid production by Yarrowia lipolytica (Table 2. The second formulation was formulated with two agents, and the third with a sterile control. The third formulation, which was formulated with a sterile control, had the highest rate of lipid production by Yarrowia lipolytica (Table 2).

The final formulation of the second formulation, which was formulated with a sterile control of a cocktail of three compounds, had the highest rate of lipid production by Yarrowia lipolytica (Table 2).

Yarrowia lipolytica-produced lipids are considered the most abundant secondary metabolites in the environment [14]. However, their accumulation in the environment can be problematic due to the reduction in their activity [19]. However, several authors have reported that the lipids produced in Yarrowia lipolytica are not synthesized by the action of free fatty acids (FFA) or lipases [19], and a decrease in the activity of a number of lipases is not completely compensated for by the amount of FFAs that are present in the environment [20]. Therefore, we tested the effects of Yarrowia lipolytica on the growth of Y. lipolytica.

The growth of Y. lipolytica on a plate containing different concentrations of Y. lipolytica lipolytica was evaluated using a fermentation broth dilution method and a blank plate. The cells were grown for 14 days in the presence of yeast extract (YE) and the final concentration of yeast extract was evaluated by a broth dilution method. Y. lipolytica produced a higher amount of yeast extract after 14 days in YE than that in the presence of YE, while YE produced a higher amount of yeast extract after 14 days in YE (Table 3).

At the end of the growth phase, Y. lipolytica produced a large amount of YE, which was the concentration in which the growth was most vigorous (Table 3). The growth of Y. lipolytica was monitored for two days in the presence of glucose and fructose, and the results are summarized in Table 4.


## Discussion
Several natural yeasts were isolated from lignocellulosic biomass in this study, and the two varieties were able to produce natural Flavors and Fragrance. Most of the natural Flavors and Fragrances were produced by natural yeasts in other studies [11, 12, 13, 18-20]. The natural Flavors and Fragrances produced by different cultivars were also produced by the different cultivars. However, the natural Flavors produced by the cultivars were produced by different cultivars and cultivars. The natural Flavors and Fragrances were produced by the cultivars and cultivars.

The production of natural Flavors and Fragrances by other yeasts was shown by different cultivars and cultivars. The production of natural Flavors and Fragrances by Y. lipolytica was not observed in the cultivation medium of other yeasts (Figure 3).

In the natural fermentation medium of Y. lipolytica, Y. lipolytica was cultivated with water and glycerol as substrates. Water was used as the final fermentation medium, and the biomass was fermented with glycerol as the final fermentor. However, Y. lipolytica was unable to produce natural Flavors and Fragrances. The natural Flavors and Fragrances produced by Y. lipolytica were not produced by Y. lipolytica in the cultivation medium of other yeasts (Figure 3). The fermentation of natural Flavors and Fragrances with water as the final fermentor was unsuccessful (Figure 3).

In this study, the natural Flavors and Fragrances produced by Y. lipolytica were not produced by other yeasts in the cultivation medium of Y. lipolytica (Figure 3). The production of natural Flavors and Fragrances by Y. lipolytica was not observed in the cultivation medium of other yeasts (Figure 3). The production of natural Flavors and Fragrances by Y. lipolytica was not observed in the cultivation medium of other yeasts (Figure 3).

In the natural fermentation medium of Y. lipolytica, the production of natural Flavors and Fragrances was not observed in the cultivation medium of Y. lipolytica (Figure 3).
