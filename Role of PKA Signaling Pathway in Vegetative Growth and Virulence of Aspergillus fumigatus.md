## Abstract
The Fusarium graminearum (Fg) is a devastating fungal pathogen that can cause fatal infections in immunocompromised animals, including humans. The mechanism that Fg can overcome the immune defenses of its hosts has not been fully understood. Using gene deletion analysis, we found that Fg RNAs are required for the biosynthesis of the triose phosphate group of glycosylated proteins essential for Fg survival. Furthermore, we discovered that triose phosphate protein 60 (TPG-60) has a critical role in zinc finger transcription, whereas glycan trisaccharide and glycol-6 (GT-6) have no direct target in Fg.

Here, the authors show that the Fg transcriptional repressor, GTP-60, is required for the biosynthesis of triose phosphate protein 60 (TPG-60) in Fg. Interestingly, the deletion of TPG-60 does not affect the survival of the host in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis. In contrast, the complementation of a tetraspanin null mutant strain that is sensitive to TPG-60 was found to be non-pathogenic and to have reduced growth in a copper-independent medium. The complementation mutant is also non-pathogenic to mannoprotein lipase (MCP-1) and glycolipid lipase (GlcT), but it is more susceptible to GlcT blockade. Loss of TPG-60 results in severe cell wall perturbation in a murine model of aspergillosis.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a heterotrophic fungus that can cause invasive aspergillosis (IA), a life-threatening infection of the lung and skin in immunocompromised hosts. IA is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The number of invasive aspergillosis cases has increased significantly in the past two decades, especially in those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and neutropenia [1]. The incidence of IA is still relatively low, with some reports describing a decrease in incidence by approximately 60% or even 70% in some areas [2-4].

Infection of the lung by A. fumigatus leads to a severe and prolonged course of inflammation, macrophage activation, and death [5]. Macrophages are key players in both innate and adaptive immune systems [6], and macrophage activation is critical for clearance of A. fumigatus spores from the lungs [7]. Macrophages can produce type I IFNs, which are essential for immunity to A. fumigatus, are highly expressed in neutropenic patients [8, 9]. Type I IFNs have been described for their function in macrophage activation. However, the specific expression pattern of type I IFN receptors and the level of regulatory and signaling pathways have not been well characterized.

The canonical signaling pathway of macrophage is not well understood, and the best characterized signaling pathways include the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway, which regulates both transcription and translation processes [10]. The cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is the major cell cycle-dependent pathway in fungi [11]. It involves a series of interconnected events that control a variety of cellular processes, including carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and cell cycle progression [12, 13]. In A. fumigatus, the cAMP and pka cascade activate downstream transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3, which are involved in regulating transcription of genes related to virulence, e.g., the Candida virulence-related gene, CpsA [14].

The dermatophytes used in this study were Malassezia furfur ATCC 90012, Candida glabrata ATCC 90012, and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 90012. The yeast strains used in this study were Candida albicans ATCC 90012, Candida glabrata ATCC 90012, and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 90012. The bacterial strains used in this study were Streptomyces sensu stricto ATCC 6258, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 75034.


## Results
neoformans va. grubii (CF3706) and C. neoformans var. neoformans (CF2304) (Figure 2). PKA signaling is a member of the Leu-B-GTPase cascade that regulates Leu-B transmembrane domain protein 2 (L2D) (19). We tested the PKA signaling pathway in response to C. neoformans var. grubii, and found that PKA signaling pathway is highly regulated in response to both C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans (Figure 2).

PKA is a PKA-independent PKA-GTPase
We next tested whether PKA signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of PKA activity in response to the two different fungal species, C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans. The PKA pathway was demonstrated to be important for the regulation of PKA activity in A. fumigatus (40).

The PKA pathway is a PKA-independent PKA-GTPase that inhibits Leu-B transmembrane domain protein 2 (L2D) (16). We tested the PKA signaling pathway in response to C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. neoformans var. neoformans. Our results showed that PKA signaling pathway was highly regulated in response to C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. neoformans var. neoformans. This suggests that PKA signaling pathway is a key factor in fungal pathogenicity and virulence.

## Discussion
[41. In this study, we now show that PKA activity was increased by <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutants. Pka1 is a conserved enzyme in the PKA pathway, and its transcription factor HapX is required for PKA activity. In addition, <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutants were hypersensitive to the <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutant. The <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutant was significantly impaired in fungal cell wall synthesis and PKA activity. Therefore, <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutants are more susceptible to the <U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka1<U+0394>pka2<U+0394>pka3 mutant.

The PKA signaling pathway is essential for the biosynthesis of proteins, including PKA1, PKA2, PKA3, PKA4, PKA5, PKA6, and PKA7 [27], [29], [31], [33], [54]. PKA4 is involved in the biosynthesis of PKA in fungi, whereas PKA5 is involved in the production of PKA [27], [29], [31]. PKA6 is involved in the biosynthesis of PKA in Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as PKA2 and PKA3 in Aspergillus fumigatus [27], [29], [31].
