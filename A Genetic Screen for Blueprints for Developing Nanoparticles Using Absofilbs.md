## Abstract
The mammalian and eukaryotic microsomal cytoplasmic membrane is the main intermediate between the membrane and the plasma membrane, where the cytoplasmic membrane is a thin and membranous membrane composed of a complex of distinct, overlapping, membrane domains, which are specialized to specific cellular functions. The cytoplasmic membrane is a thin membrane composed of a complex membrane called the plasma membrane, which contains the membrane for the membrane integrity checkpoint, the C-terminal region of the membrane, the second membrane, and a delicate fine coordination of the other membranes, which control the fluid and electroneutral nature of the membrane. The essential membrane is composed of two different subunits: the membrane component and the membrane cross-type component. The membrane component is mainly composed of cysteine, an amino acid, and tryptophan, which form the essential membrane, and numerous other proteins, which are part of the essential membrane. Cytoplasmic membrane is composed of two different membranes: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane, where the cytoplasmic membrane is a thin and membranous membrane, which is specialized to specific cellular functions. The plasma membrane is composed of two different subunits: the membrane component and the membrane cross-type component. The plasma membrane is composed of two different subunits: the membrane component and the membrane cross-type component.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a harmless member of the human microbiota and is the most common cause of superficial, invasive infections. The infection usually occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, oral or vaginal mucosa, or when the microorganisms are in contact with the immunosuppressed host. In such cases, they can disseminate to the bloodstream and cause bloodstream and invasive disease. The clinical manifestations of invasive candidiasis are mainly related to its histopathological features, with Candida being the most frequent agent of candidemia. As a result of the diversity of its morphological features, it is difficult to classify the invasive candidiasis as a cutaneous or mucocutaneous disease, even though the disease is often caused by the same species (Chandra et al., 2016).


## Methods
For these analyses, a poly-lactic acid-lipophilic Absofilbose Tubes (Oxoid Ltd, UK) was used as the templat. The Tubes were incubated in the dark for 1 hour at 20 °C. Subsequently, the Tubes were washed in water and incubated in the dark for 1 hour at 20 °C. The optical density was determined with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus, Thermo Scientific, USA). The percentage of reducing sugars was calculated according to the formula [23]. The blueprints were analyzed with a three-dimensional HIC (high-fluorescent HIC) image detection system (Photometrics, USA). In brief, the abscissa of the blueprints was measured at the center of the abscissa of the blueprints. The blueprints were then assembled using the software Metropolis (version 1.5.2). After the abscissa was measured, the combined blueprints were characterized by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and subjected to hierarchical clustering using the H-INS-i algorithm [24].

Chemistry
To determine the rate of a group of a peptide as released from a non-protein, the same methodology described in previous work [21] was used. The release of the pyrithiamine-phenyl-3-deoxy-1,4-dithiobis-(3-methyloxy)methylidene-1-propyl (3H-DP) from the p-glycoprotein (5H-BP) was measured using a spectrometer (Spectramax, Cambridge, UK) equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (model 1440, Phillips, USA) at a resolution of 1000×.

The excitation and emission spectra were recorded at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 600 nm and 500 nm, respectively. The data was processed by ChromaLite 4.5 (Bio-Rad, USA) software and the data was visualized using the software ChromaLite 5.5 (Bio-Rad, USA).

In order to determine the retention time for the released p-glycoprotein, the same methodology was used. The data was processed by ChromaLite 4.5 (Bio-Rad, USA) software and the data was visualized with the software ChromaLite 5.5 (Bio-Rad, USA).

## Discussion
First, the design of Absofilbs with low toxicity was evaluated for different biological purpose. The biomass was harvested from Absofilbs harvested from Collembia at a constant temperature of 37°C and the surface of the Absofilbs was measured by gas chromatography coupled with ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in order to identify metabolic pathways that are key to the biotransformation of the cellulose-derived cell wall by Absofilbs.

The Absofilbs formed in the presence of cellulose were screened by gas chromatography coupled with ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for their potential use as carbon sources for the production of biofilms. We observed that the carbon sources used in the biofilm were either the cellulose-derived cell wall, the polysaccharide-derived carbon sources or the cellulose-derived carbon sources (i.e., cellulose-derived carbon sources and polysaccharide-derived carbon sources).

The biofilm formed in the presence of cellulose was evaluated by measuring the biomass and the surface area of the Absofilbs, which were also determined by ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In addition, the aeration of the Absofilbs was tested. Aeration was performed in the presence of ammonium sulfate and nitrite, followed by anaerobic digestion with nitrite and nitrite-co-substituted nitrosulfate.

The aeration of the Absofilbs was confirmed by the measurement of the water-soluble compound (WSC) content. The water-soluble compound was considered to be water-soluble by the GC/MS method, because the WSC content of the Absofilbs was higher than the concentration of water. The ^13C NMR spectrum of the WSC revealed that the ^13C NMR spectrum of the Absofilbs was also present in the same region as the carbon source, and the ^1H NMR spectrum was also observed.

The ^13C NMR spectrum of the Absofilbs showed that the compound was present in a ring at d = 7.66 ppm, and the ^13C NMR spectrum was confirmed by the presence of the signal of a mixture of two carbon atoms.
