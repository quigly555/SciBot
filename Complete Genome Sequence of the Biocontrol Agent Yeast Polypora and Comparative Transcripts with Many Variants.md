## Abstract
The ability of a wide range of bacteria to survive the harsh environmental conditions of the human body is attributed to a tandem repeat sequence of a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) located in the transcription start site (TSS) and running through the genome. Despite the importance of the CRD, it is still unclear what role it plays in regulating metabolism in response to various environmental stresses. In this study we show that the CRD not only protects fungal cells from oxidative stress but also drives fitness gains in asexual development and virulence. We also show that overexpression of the CRD has a major effect on the formation of astaxanthin, a carotenoid-related protein in the human mycelia. A low abundance of such proteins in fungal cells suggests that the ability to survive stress is an important factor determining the survival of the pathogenic yeast. The CRD also regulates the expression of a number of genes that contribute to the virulence of a number of environmental strains. Overall, our study indicates that the CRD is a key factor determining the fitness of a wide range of environmental strains and provides a strong argument for a role of the CRD in fungal virulence.


## Introduction
Leishmania are promastigotes that are found ubiquitously throughout the mammalian body and cause visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection with an estimated annual incidence of over 5,500 cases (1). Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease in 80 countries and is considered to be the second most common cause of adult-onset infectious disease in sub-Saharan Africa (2). Leishmaniasis is characterized by the presence of promastigotes on the visceral surface of the infected animal and their persistence in the intestinal mucosa. The parasite can be cleared from the host's gut after treatment with antifungal drugs, and the life cycle of this pathogen is completed (3-6).

While there is a clear correlation between the degree of leishmaniasis and the severity of disease, there is a notable degree of variation in the degree of leishmaniasis between different geographical areas. In South Africa, there is a 2-fold difference in the length of time from 1 year to 5 years (7). There is no indication that the sub-acute phase of the disease is related to the sub-acute onset of the disease.


## Methods
b.ac.uk/ena/en/home/home.html) and accession number PRJEB54990.

Bioinformatics analysis
The obtained transcriptome reads were aligned to the updated version of the Biocontrol-Protection Package (BPS) (Rey et al., 2017) using BioEdit 7.0.5 (Hall 1999). The number of mismatches and bases with an expected error rate lower than 1.0% were removed. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA 5.0 (Kumar et al., 2016) with default parameters. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using the “qt-tools” tool (Lozupone et al., 2010).

The transcriptome data from this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/en/home/home.html) and accession number PRJEB54990.

In order to compare the different transcriptome sequences from the study of Zhang et al. (2016) and the corresponding transcriptome data from Chen et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2019) in order to assess the differential expression between the strains of the pathogenic species, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis. The new strains of B. cinerea (CBS 145912, CBS 13982, and CBS 141924), B. cinerea-3-1, and B. cinerea-3-2, were used in this study.

To identify the genes that were differentially expressed between the different strains of the pathogenic species, the number of homozygous (Hs) and heterozygous (Hs-Hs) genes in each strain were determined. The gene sets in each strain were compared with each other. Hs-Hs gene sets were defined as follows: B. cinerea = CBS 149526-CBS 149526, B. cinerea = CBS 13982, B. cinerea = CBS 13982, B. cinerea-3-Hs = B.


## Results
The gut microbiota of B. bassiana infected by S. pneumoniae was largely dominated by the fecal microbiota of aflatoxin-producing bacteria (Figure 1A). The proportion of total microbiota with total sequences from aflatoxin-producing bacteria was higher in the B. bassiana gut (mean ± SE) than in S. pneumoniae-infected B. bassiana healthy individuals (mean ± SE, P = 0.05) (Figure 1B). The relative abundance of microbial genera in the gut microbiota of the healthy individuals was higher than in the B. bassiana healthy individuals (P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). The microbiota of the B. bassiana infected S.


## Discussion
dermatitidis specie. The comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the B. dermatitidis species contains genes involved in a broad range of biological functions, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, differentiation, and resistance to a wide range of pathogens, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis carinii (Fig 7).

The genes of interest involved in the biocontrol process are the following: transcription factor proteins, including two transcription factors (Fen1 and Cdc42), a high-affinity glucose transporter (Rif), a high-affinity glucose transporter (Slt1), and a non-canonical signal transduction system (Trl2). The transcription factor genes are represented by three homologs (Fen1, Cdc42, and Slt1), one gene encoding a protein kinase (Slt2), and one gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase (Trl2). The protein kinase genes are represented by two homologs (Fen1, Cdc42, and Slt1), one gene encoding a protein kinase (Trl2), and one gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase (Trl3). The non-canonical signal transduction system (Trl2) is involved in controlling cellular functions, including cellular metabolism, cell differentiation, and proliferation. The gene expression of Trl3 is regulated by a transcription factor-encoding gene cluster (Tfh1) that is regulated by the transcription factor Fen1. The transcription factor genes are represented by three homologs (Fen1, Cdc42, and Slt1), one gene encoding a protein kinase (Trl2), and one gene encoding a protein kinase (Trl3). The protein kinase genes are represented by three homologs (Fen1, Cdc42, and Slt1). The Tfh1 protein kinase gene is regulated by the transcription factor Ume6, which is involved in DNA replication and the production of DNA. The Tfh1 protein kinase gene is regulated by the transcription factor Rif, which is involved in regulating cell differentiation and the production of cell wall polysaccharides.
