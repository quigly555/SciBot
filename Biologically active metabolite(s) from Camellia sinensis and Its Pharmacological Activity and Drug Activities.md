## Introduction
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus that causes mucosal and potentially systemic infections, with a mortality rate of up to 70% [1]. C. albicans is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause chronic infections of the mucosa, skin, and nails, as well as on and off-target infections [2]. The incidence of C. albicans infections has increased in the past few decades and is likely to continue to do so in the future [3]. Candida albicans is a major cause of bloodstream infections, particularly those of the skin and mucosa, as well as on- and off-target infections. C. albicans is not only a commensal of the skin but also of the mucosa in the oral cavity, on the skin, and on the mucosa surface [4].


## Methods
% Tween 80, and 100 µl of the cell suspension was spread over the surface of YPD agar plate. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h and afterward, they were examined under a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

The extracts were also examined on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SUN-1000i; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after 1 ml of the cell suspension was added to a 100 µl of a cell suspension containing 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in the dark at 37°C. The optical density of the cell suspension was determined at 570 nm and an optical absorbance of the cell suspension in the dark was measured at 530 nm.

The composition of the extracts was calculated using the formula: %(DMSO/DMSO) % = [(DMSO/DMSO)/(DMSO/DMSO)] × 100.

Antifungal activity of the extracts
The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined using the broth microdilution method. Briefly, the broth microdilution method consists of broth microdilution method with dilution with fresh complete media, followed by a 7-h incubation at 37°C, in a microtiter plate, with agitation. A stock solution of each of the tested compounds was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the wells of the microtiter plate to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The growth of the yeast was also monitored by measuring the optical density of the wells by a plate reader (Model TM-800; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The antifungal activity of the extracts was expressed as a percentage of inhibition. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Antifungal activity of the extracts
The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by using a modified broth microdilution method.


## Results
The PDB entries for the PDB entries of the chemical and biological activities of the compounds are shown in Table .

The activity of compounds was measured against two main fungal pathogenic fungi, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The activity was significantly higher against Candida albicans (P<0.0001) than Aspergillus fumigatus (P<0.0001) (Table 1). In contrast, it was higher against Aspergillus fumigatus (P<0.0001) (Table 1). The activity of the compounds against Aspergillus fumigatus was higher than that of the other tested compounds (Table 1). The lower activity against Aspergillus fumigatus was also observed in the presence of the MIC50 (0.50 µg/ml) (Table 1). The activity of the compounds against Candida albicans was higher than that of the other tested compounds (Table 1).

The PDB entries for the PDB entries for the chemical and biological activities of the compounds are shown in Table 1. The activity of the compounds against Aspergillus fumigatus was significantly higher than that of the other tested compounds (Table 1).

## Discussion

S1 Table shows the total bioactive compounds that were isolated from the mycobiome of the Brazilian soil, which is mainly composed of . sinensis, a species that was detected in this study, and the significant chemical diversity.

In order to determine the possible chemical diversity of the Brazilian mycobiome, and to study the presence of antifungal activity against the isolates, the identified compounds were evaluated against Candida spp. using the extract and the selectivity index (S.p) assay, which are two standard methods of screening for antifungal activity [40].

The results of the chemical diversity analysis of the isolates revealed a chemical diversity of 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol and 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol, which are three-dimensional structures of the same compounds (Table S1). These structures were found to be highly active against the yeast C. albicans, while the antifungal activity of the extracts was not found against the yeast C. neoformans. The results of the chemical diversity analysis revealed a chemical diversity of 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol and 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol, which are three-dimensional structures of the same compounds (Table S2). These structures were found to be highly active against the yeast C. albicans, while the antifungal activity of the extracts was not found against the yeast C. neoformans. The results of the chemical diversity analysis of the isolates revealed a chemical diversity of 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol and 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol, which are three-dimensional structures of the same compounds (Table S3). These structures were found to be highly active against the yeast C. albicans, while the antifungal activity of the extracts was not found against the yeast C. neoformans. The results of the chemical diversity analysis revealed a chemical diversity of 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol and 1, 3-methyl-1,3-diol, which are three-dimensional structures of the same compounds (Table S4). These structures were found to be highly active against the yeast C.
