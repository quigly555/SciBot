## Abstract
This study evaluated the performance of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and computed tomography (CT) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for identification of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with cryptococcal antigenemia. A total of 54 patients with cryptococcal antigenemia were enrolled in the study; 53 had positive CrAg TOC scans and 21 had negative TOC scans.


## Introduction
The ability of pathogenic microorganisms to cause disease is a key factor that has attracted much attention. The most well studied microorganism is the yeast Candida albicans. For many years, C. albicans has been considered as a normal part of the human microbiota, but it has gained special importance because of the high resistance to multiple antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B and azoles, and the emergence of drug-resistant infections. In fact, resistance to the echinocandins and micafungin is rare (Nosanchuk and Van Ende, 2016). C. albicans is a commensal organism and a pathogen of humans. However, the ability of C. albicans to form biofilms is important for pathogenesis, biofilm formation, and biofilm maintenance (Kidd et al., 2014; Karaoglu et al., 2016; Aguileta-Vidal et al., 2018). C. albicans biofilms are comprised of distinct cells embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM) and in biofilm-like structures that form at or near to the attachment point of the biofilm cells. Biofilms are complex structures consisting of cells enclosed in a self-produced extracellular matrix and some of them are recognized by the host immune system (Huang et al., 2017). In the presence of host immune cells, C. albicans can form biofilms and initiate the process of biofilm invasion and the subsequent biofilm maintenance (Troy and Miller, 2007; Liu et al., 2015; Ghedini and Long, 2016).

## Methods
The PDA assay was performed with the modified PDA (PDA-IP) method [29. This method is used in the PDA-IP assay to determine drug interactions with the PDA extract (PDAT-IP). In this study, we used the modified PDA-IP assay (PDAT-IP) to determine antifungal activity of the PDA extract and its derivatives.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of PDA Extracts and Its Derivatives
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the PDA extract were determined as a reference for each of the tested compounds against the strains (Table 1) of the tested fungi. The MIC value of each compound was determined according to the method of Mathur et al. [30].

2.4. Antifungal Activity of PDA Extracts and Its Derivatives
The MIC and FIC index were calculated according to the method of Ushkolov et al. [31]. The FIC index represents the percentage of inhibition compared to the control, and the FIC value represents the lowest concentration that inhibits the growth of the tested fungus. The FIC value of the tested compound is indicated by its FIC index.

2.5. Antifungal Activity of PDA Extracts and Its Derivatives
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the PDA extract were determined as a reference for each of the tested compounds against the strains (Table 1). The MIC of each compound was determined according to the method of Ushkolov et al. [31].

2.6. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) of PDA Extract and Its Derivatives
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the PDA extract were determined as a reference for each of the tested compounds against the strains (Table 1) of the tested fungi. The MICs of the tested compounds were determined according to the method of Ushkolov et al. [31].

2.7. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) of PDA Extract and Its Derivatives
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the PDA extract were determined according to the method of Ushkolov et al. [31].

## Results
albicans, . glabrata, C. albicans, C. krusei, C. krusei, and C. albicans were determined in the current study. The MIC of the glycerol derivative, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives was determined against all Candida strains tested (Table 1). The MICs of citric acid, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives against all Candida strains were determined against all Candida strains, and citric acid was effective only against C. albicans and C. glabrata strains. The MIC of citric acid against all Candida strains was determined against all Candida strains, and citric acid was effective only against C. glabrata and C. krusei strains. The MIC of citric acid against C. albicans was determined against all Candida strains tested (Table 1). The MIC of citric acid against C. glabrata strains was determined against all Candida strains, and citric acid was effective only against C. krusei strains. The MIC of citric acid against C. albicans was determined against all Candida strains tested, and citric acid was effective only against C. krusei strains.

Effect of Acidic Extracts on Candida Germination
The in vitro and in vivo activities of the glycerol derivatives and glycerol derivatives and antifungal compounds against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. krusei, and C. krusei strains were determined in the current study. The MIC of the glycerol derivative, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives against all Candida strains was determined against all Candida strains, and the MIC of the glycerol derivative, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives against all Candida strains was determined against all Candida strains tested (Table 2). The MIC of the glycerol derivative, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives against all Candida strains was determined against all Candida strains tested, and the MIC of the glycerol derivative, citric acid, and citric acid derivatives against all Candida strains was determined against all Candida strains tested.
