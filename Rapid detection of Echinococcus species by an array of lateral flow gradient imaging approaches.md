## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-C. gattii susceptibility profile of A549 cells in the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with cryptococcocal meningitis (CM) or cerebritis (CRAG) and to explore the potential of antifungal compounds for the prevention and treatment of CM and CRAG patients in the absence of CM.

In this study, 79 patients with CM and 48 patients with CRAG were recruited in our hospital. The median age was 40 years, the median infectious calcemia was 1.7 years and the number of patients with cryptococcal meningitis was 11 (10.0%) and 12 (11.3%), respectively. The prevalence of CM and the CSF invasion was 1.7 and 0.7%, respectively. Anti-C.


## Introduction
These methods have been validated to identify . albicans species by qualitative and semistructural analyses, as well as by immunological assays and inflammatory markers. [12, 13] In contrast, less than ten percent of Candida species are recognized by these techniques. [14], [15]

The development of an appropriate and effective treatment for C. albicans is therefore a key step for improving the effectiveness of current antifungal drugs. Although many antifungal agents, including the azoles, are able to inhibit ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane [16], there is still a lack of a mechanism for how ergosterol is synthesized. The synthesis of ergosterol in fungi is largely initiated by two key enzymes, E. coli and Erg11. E. coli produces an NADH-dependent sterol unit via a nonenzymatic reaction catalyzed by the NADH-dependent enzyme Erg11. [17], [18] Therefore, Erg11 plays an important role in the ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi. As a result, C. albicans is able to synthesize a number of important sterols such as ergosterol. The two ergosterol-containing compounds are also transported to the cell by the alternative pathway and then synthesized as two alternative reactions. NAD^+-dependent sterol biosynthesis is a reversible process [19], [20] and is often facilitated by the production of an NADPH precursor. [21], [22] Therefore, an active pathway is required for the ergosterol synthesis in fungi.

In the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, ergosterol is synthesized in the reduction step by the NADPH-dependent enzyme Erg11. The NADPH precursor, ergosterol, is transported to the cell via the alternative pathway by a second NADPH precursor, NADP-ribosyl transferase (NRPS), and finally converted to ergosterol by the prolyl hydroxylase (FHL) enzyme. [23], [24]

The number of drugs available against Candida species is rather limited, but the best studied agents are the azoles and echinocandins.


## Methods

Determination of the threshold for specificity of the . coli VEGFA assay
The methodology used for the detection of E. coli VEGFA is described in [28] and is described in [29]. Briefly, the VEGFA assay is based on the VEGFA method described in [29] and has been validated in a number of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial agents [30]. The specificity of the VEGFA assay is based on the VEGFA assay standard curve and the negative predictive value (NPV) of the assay is 0.005 and the positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.05. The VEGFA method has been validated in the pathogen-host interaction in several clinical studies [31], [32], [33].

Molecular typing of isolates
In order to confirm the specificity of the E. coli VEGFA assay, a previously described method was used with specific primers, namely: ITS1 and ITS4, for the E. coli VEGFA assay, and ITS4 and ITS5, for the E. coli VEGFA assay, respectively. PCR amplification of the primers, which are based on ITS1 and ITS4, was used as the internal standard for testing the specificity of the assay [28]. The amplified PCR products were then subjected to an automated DNA extraction protocol for the VEGFA assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to remove residual DNA.

Molecular typing of isolates
DNA extraction was performed from a single colony of the isolate CBS138 (Table 1) in liquid nitrogen. The DNA was extracted using the MasterPure™ Yeast DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was further subjected to an automated DNA extraction protocol for the VEGFA assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The extracted DNA was subjected to an automated DNA extraction protocol for the VEGFA assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).


## Results
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an extracellular Echinococcus specie. We, therefore, propose that the species described here be transferred to the new genus Ellisia.

The new species is named Ellisia coprophilae (F. Ellis) based on the characteristic light yellow pigmented, compact conidiophores with yellow tips and hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, smooth-walled, cylindrical, non-appendaged, and subglobose to subglobose, 4-8 × 2-4 µm. The conidiophores are smooth-walled and hyaline, with only one or two inconspicuous black protrusions at the apex.

Ellisia coprophilae differs from Ellisia celluloseum (from Cercospora sp.) in having longer, thicker, and more densely developed hyphae with conspicuous black protrusions at the apex (Fig 4). The conidiophores are compact, septate, and often have conspicuous black protrusions at the apex (Fig 4). Conidiophores are solitary, erect, straight, rarely flexuous, cylindrical, unbranched, or often branched, 15-40 × 3-4 µm, 1-2-septate, sometimes slightly tapering towards the apex, often subnodulose, unbranched, or once branched, 10-50 × 4-6 µm, 1-2-septate, hyaline, smooth, 3-5(-6) septate, with a conspicuous black, subnodulose papilla at the apex. Conidiogenous cells discrete or integrated, cylindrical, subnodulose, filiform, obclavate, or lageniform, 8-20 × 3-5 µm, with a single or several apical or intercalary conidiogenous loci, 1-1.5(-2) µm diam, thickened, darkened, refractive, slightly refractive, 1-1.5(-2) µm long, 1-2 µm wide at the base.


## Discussion
In this study, the number of isolates obtained from . bacillaris, P. cablin, and E. geophilum specimens was similar to the number of isolates obtained from S. bacillaris and E. geophilum specimens. E. geophilum and S. bacillaris are commonly found in the environment and can be distinguished by their well-developed black yeasts, which have a yellowish to salmon-coloured surface and have an elongated, capitate-brown, guttulate, and smooth to slightly paler appearance than S. bacillaris [32].

Mannitol, an oleic acid produced by E. geophilum, is a component of the native vegetation and is able to promote the growth of several microorganisms including fungi and bacteria. The production of these metabolites can have a positive effect on the growth of plants as shown by the production of a variety of metabolites in S. bacillaris, S. bacillaris, S. bacillaris-related bacteria, and E. geophilum-related bacteria [33]. Mannitol can be produced by fungi in the form of lactose, xylose, and glycerol [34]. Mannitol and glycerol are the major secondary metabolites in E. geophilum, and they can be produced by fungi in the form of glucose and ethanol [35]. The main metabolites of E. geophilum are xylose, glucose, and ethanol [36]. A study by the group of Chen et al. showed that the production of xylose, glucose, and ethanol by E. geophilum was similar to that of E. biennisquimastigoteana [37]. These results indicate that the main metabolic products produced by E. geophilum are xylose and glycerol.

In addition to the xylose, ethanol, and xylitol, some other compounds such as glycerol and carbon dioxide are produced by E. geophilum. This result has been reported by other researchers [31, 31]. It is well known that the formation of the lipid-laden extracellular matrix is a fundamental step in the fungal growth. It is also a crucial step in the fungal infection processes [38].
