## Abstract
In this study we investigated the occurrence and correlates of the AUS, the MCF-7 subunit, and the IgM antibodies of serum against Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii in Italian population from a cross between two hospitals in Puglia (Italy).

Immunometric methods were performed to determine the antibody prevalence.

In this study, we observed a positive correlation between the AUS, the MCF-7 subunit, and the IgM antibodies (p = 0.023) in Italian population from a random sampling of Italian patients.

Immunometric methods have shown an increase in the percentage of the non-neutropenic infective cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) positive for the CrAg antibody.

## Methods
Sequence mining and analysis
A set of S. cerevisiae gene sequences was used to generate a comprehensive set of S. cerevisiae genomes and to determine their functions. The S. cerevisiae genome was deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE139522) and a dataset of the gene sets was also deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (EMBL-EBI). The gene sets were searched against the following databases: NCBI, Sanger, GeneBank, and the genome databases of S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, and A. fumigatus.

To determine the presence of key genes, a set of gene models were downloaded from the S. cerevisiae genome database. These gene models were used to search the S. cerevisiae genome for the presence of the key genes. These gene models were aligned using ClustalX2 [31] and manually corrected by manual correction of alignment with MEGA 6.0 software.


## Results
To test this hypothesis, we investigated the ability of the pum1<U+0394> and pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> strains to form a pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutant in vitr. As shown in Fig 7A, pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> pum1<U+0394> double mutant formed a double mutant in the presence of 1 M sorbitol. No difference in the number of CFU was observed between the pum1<U+0394> and pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> mutants when treated with 1 M sorbitol or 0.1 M NaCl. The pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> pum1<U+0394> double mutant formed a pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutant in the presence of 1 M sorbitol. The pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> pum1<U+0394> double mutant formed a pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutant in the presence of 1 M NaCl. The pum1<U+0394> and pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutants formed a pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutant in the presence of 1 M sorbitol. No difference in the number of CFU was observed between the pum1<U+0394> and pum1<U+0394> pum2<U+0394> double mutant when treated with 1 M NaCl or 0.1 M NaCl.


## Discussion
erithum va. erinata and the molecular data derived from the genome assembly led to the identification of four genes as well as the characterization of the structure of the genome of A. erithum var. erinata (GenBank accession number: EU7201619) and its derivatives, with three of these as well as the genome sequence of the second generation A. erinata (GenBank accession number: EU7201619). The three genes in this study are highly similar to genes that have been described previously for A. terrestris and A. virens [28, 29, 35, 36]. The best-characterized gene is A019600, which encodes the protein kinase Apt1, which is involved in the gene regulation of sexual development and cell wall integrity [31, 38]. A. terrestris has the same gene as A. virens, and the A. virens-A019600 gene encodes the Apt1 transcription factor and the AnS protein kinase [29]. However, there are many other similarities between the A. erinata genome and A. terrestris genome, including gene duplication and pseudogenization, gene loss and gain, and the gain and loss of repetitive elements [39].

The second largest gene cluster encodes the RNA helicase Apt1, which is involved in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex [40, 41]. Apt1 is a bZIP transcription factor that regulates the expression of a variety of genes in eukaryotic cells and is critical for the proper functioning of cell wall-degrading enzymes in the cell wall. In addition, Apt1 is involved in the transcriptional control of genes that encode important virulence factors in the plant pathogens, such as the P. expansum virulence factors Ste7 and Ste12 [42]. In A. terrestris, genes encoding the RNA helicase Apt1 were identified in the genome of the fungus, and this gene cluster was also present in the genome of A. terrestris var. erinata. This cluster also contains genes encoding the gene for the CCAAT-binding protein (Cbp1) protein, which is required for the expression of virulence-associated genes [43]. Apt1 is required for growth at 37Â°C, and Cbp1 was also found to be upregulated in A.
