## Abstract
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is the leading cause of fungal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A number of approaches are available to treat IFD, but the management of the disease is complicated by the need for antifungal therapy. Calcineurin inhibitors (CIs) have been used successfully in combination with other drugs to control IFD. Calcineurin is a well-known drug for the treatment of candidiasis but its use in combination with other antifungal therapies poses a serious risk for CNS infection due to the difficulty in appropriate drug treatment. Calcineurin is a multifunctional protein with numerous biological activities including multiple targets, itraconazole-like peptide binding, antifungal activity, synergism with Calcineurin and many other well-known drugs. Calcineurin is an important regulator of white blood cell (WBC) production and innate immune cell (eIL)-17A in HIV-infected patients with severe fever and an early-stage granulomatous disease. Calcineurin has several immunomodulatory and synergistic modulatory activities including the ability to increase IL-12 production and to enhance the proliferation of monocytes in infected murine brains. In this review, we will summarize the main functions of calcineurin in the context of different antifungal drug treatments and we will discuss the synergism and impact of different classes of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of IFD.


## Introduction

The work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Union (EU) and by the Wellcome Trust program JCP-10 and JCP-1. The funders had no role at, or for, the study date. The funders had no role at, or for, the study date.

The paper “Africa's natural biodiversity: How does it fit into the broader picture of global change?” was presented at the South African Wildlife Congress, Second African Productful Review (SPR) in Pretoria, South Africa, on 20th March 2019.

The paper “Africa” is based on an African continent study and a study from South Africa (SA). The authors have described a different dataset and compared the data across the continent. The paper is focused on the African continent and the results from the South African study should help the authors on how they can improve their work.

The conclusions from the study are based on the assumption that the available datasets (17,110 total samples) can be used for estimating the biodiversity of the continent. The available datasets are limited to only a small number of samples (at most 10 samples), which is not the case for other studies. The South African study is focused on estimating biodiversity and does not consider changes in the global population of fungi. This study is also based on the assumption that the available datasets can be used to predict the biodiversity of Africa.

The authors are encouraged to address this concern.

In addition, the authors should carefully analyse the results from their study. They should consider whether the results from their study are comparable to those from other studies and whether their study is based on legitimate objectives.

The authors should also consider whether the study is based on sound scientific methodology. This is not a scientific method. The authors should consider whether their study is legitimate. If they do decide to conduct the study, they should consider whether their results are comparable to those from other studies and whether they are able to reach a similar conclusion. If they decide not to conduct the study, they should consider whether their results are comparable to those from other studies and whether their results are able to meet the standard of the European Biogeographic Information Network (e.g. UNITE 2019).


## Methods
2011. The sampling took place in the Sudan Basin (Papuglia et al. 2006; Yoo and Lai 2009; Ng et al. 2014) and in the Western Cape Basin (Papuglia et al. 2006; Taitoni et al. 2009; Jing et al. 2015; Groenewald et al. 2016). Between 2000 and 2012, we sampled the soil, using an automated sampler (Aviv I-II, Beijing, China). From 2011 to 2014, we sampled the soil from 19 sites in Sudan, the West Region and the Northeast (Fig 2), Sudan, South Africa, and Zambia, respectively, from the southern part of Sudan, and from the southern part of Zimbabwe (Fig 3).

Morphology
Morphology of the trees of F. nubica (AFEME, 2017) was studied in the Laboratory of Soil Biotechnical Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. The specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Department of Botany, Faculty of Botany, University of Pretoria (University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa).

For the isolation of mycorrhizal fungi, the material was surface sterilized with 70% ethanol at room temperature and then rinsed with sterile distilled water and mounted on glass slides with gold-palladium. Mycorrhizal fungi were identified by colony characteristics and analysis on the basis of macro- and microscopic structure.

Hyphal structure and morphology
The subclade Mycothrix musae and Pyrenochaetopsis musae is well supported by the phylogenetic analyses (Fig 2). The strains formed the first well-supported clade (BS = 100 %, PP = 0.95) in the Myrotheca clade (Fig 1). The phylogenetic analyses (Fig 2) indicated that these two clades have diverged more recently than the other clades (Fig 1).


## Discussion
In this study, we show that the capsule is a critical virulence factor for the pathogenicity of M. restricta, and that this is not a unique trait to M. restricta. The capsule is also important for the pathogenicity of M. restricta, but not for M. restricta alone. We also show that the virulence of M. restricta is compromised when compared to that of M. restricta alone. These results suggest that the capsule plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of M. restricta.

We have previously reported that M. restricta is less virulent than M. restricta and that this difference is due to the capsule [9]. M. restricta has a significantly longer capsule and larger diameter than that of M. restricta, but the difference is not as dramatic as that observed for the other two pathogenic species (Table 2). The capsule of M. restricta is shorter than that of M. restricta and has more conidial appendages (Table 2). The differences in the shape and size of the appendages of the two pathogenic species may explain our observation. In contrast to M. restricta, which has shorter appendages, M. restricta has longer, more distal appendages. It also has a smaller diameter than M. restricta, which may be due to the longer cell wall.

The length of the capsule of M. restricta is shorter than that of M.
