## Abstract
Since the discovery of the first described structure in 1965, the yeast-like kinase Module Bub Blp from Stenoloma grisea (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes) has been found to function as a key virulence factor in human pathogenic fungi. To understand the life cycle of this yeast-like kinase, we used phylogenomic analysis to identify the ancestral module of the kinase. We found that Bub Blp functions as a master regulator of melanin production in four Stenotrophomonas clavulanense families, including the largest single family containing the largest number of genes of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (CDRs) in Stenotrophomonas sp. The evolution of these Dicer-like modules has driven many evolutionary transitions in fungi, including the emergence of the virulent form of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the first known fungus with a crosstalk between the central hyphae and the nuclei of the host. We propose that the evolution of the Dicer-like module during the evolution of the Vasculare symbiosa system evolved as a direct result of adaptation to the host environment. Our work provides the first evidence for the existence of a remarkable and evolutionarily ancient Stenotrophomonas species complex in the tropical zone.

## Methods

.5. Western Blotting
All spore suspensions were inoculated into 100 ml of V-shaped sterile water and the incubation was performed at 30°C for 16 h. The mycelium was harvested and washed with sterile water to remove the mycelium. The collected spore suspension was added to a 1-ml screw-cap tube and mixed with 100 ml of 1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After homogenization in 1 ml of 1× PBS (pH 7.0), the solution was centrifuged (10,000×g for 5 min), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS and centrifuged again. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS and mixed with 100 ml of 1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged (10,000×g for 5 min), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS and mixed with 100 ml of 1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged (10,000×g for 5 min), and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 1× PBS and mixed with 100 ml of 1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

## Results
albicans actively promotes the spread of spores in human. The results also showed that C. albicans was able to propagate in the guts of animals. Therefore, C. albicans could be used as an effective model for studying the virulence of A. fumigatus in the human host.

A more detailed assessment of the antifungal activity of C. albicans was carried out by the sensitivity assay of the L. stearothermophilus bioassay. The sensitivity of the L. stearothermophilus bioassay was evaluated against A. fumigatus and C. albicans in the assays of the L. stearothermophilus bioassay. The results showed that C. albicans was able to spread in the guts of mice, whereas C. albicans was more sensitive against A. fumigatus. Moreover, the results showed that C. albicans could grow in the intestine of mice.

Oral administration of C. albicans and A. fumigatus with the aim of eliminating fungal spores in mice, showed an antifungal activity against both fungi (Figures 4B,C).

Oral administration of C. albicans and A. fumigatus with the aim of eliminating fungal spores in mice, showed an antifungal activity against both fungi (Figures 4B,C).

In vitro assays showed that C. albicans was able to grow in the colon of mice, while A. fumigatus was more sensitive (Figure 4D).

Interestingly, the results showed that C. albicans was able to grow in the skin of mice, while the fungus was more sensitive (Figures 4B,C).

In vivo experiments showed that C. albicans and A. fumigatus are able to colonize the bloodstream and colonize the lungs of mice (Figure 5).

In vivo assays showed that C. albicans and A. fumigatus were able to survive in the lungs of mice, while A. fumigatus was more resistant to infection (Figure 5).

In vitro assays showed that C. albicans was able to colonize the bloodstream of mice, while A. fumigatus was more sensitive (Figure 6).


## Discussion
virens, in vitro (18, 19. The essential oils isolated from Iriomourella sp. also showed activity against V. virens, in vitro (18). We also performed yeast extract-based screening of compounds present in these extracts against V. virens in vitro, and by integrating a combination of several drugs (e.g., ketoconazole and chlorhexidine), which were previously reported as active against V. virens in vitro (18, 24). In this study, we further identified the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. against V. virens. Our results indicated that the essential oil from Iriomourella sp. was active against V. virens, in vitro (18). In addition, we found that the essential oil of Iriomourella sp. was active against V. virens in vitro (18).

As described previously (18), we have determined the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. against V. virens in vitro (18). The results showed that the essential oil of Iriomourella sp. is active against V. virens, in vitro (18). Therefore, the essential oil of Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp. may be considered as a potent antifungal agent, since the antifungal activity of the essential oil obtained from Iriomourella sp.
