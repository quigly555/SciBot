## Abstract
A 39-year-old man presented with swelling of the right upper thigh, difficulty with supination and myalgia, followed by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain for 2 weeks. He was treated with cyclophosphamide, antibiotics and analgesic medications, and was then treated with cycloeucal gels and itraconazole. He had a favorable skin biopsy and laboratory report for ulcerative symptoms. However, his skin symptoms disappeared completely after 4 weeks of treatment with cyclophosphamide, antibiotics, analgesics and nlphosphamide and his skin lesions disappeared completely after 6 weeks of treatment with itraconazole. He suffered from diarrhea and hemolytic anemia. He had a favorable immune function and had received steroids before the initiation of cyclophosphamide and he had no recurrent bacterial or viral infections. He was treated with cyclopiomib and antibiotics. He recovered fully from the swelling of the left leg after 6 weeks of treatment. However, he had a favorable immune function and had received steroids before the initiation of cyclophosphamide and he had no recurrent bacterial or viral infections.


## Introduction
. de Hoog, A. Rygog, A. W. Dodge, C. M. Harcourt, C. C. Brown, S. C. Dykozyma, J. Babbitt, J. C. de Hoog, C.C.E. Hussey, A.D.A.K. Mah, and others [3, 4].

The genus Sympodiapridus was first proposed by Voglmayr & Jaklitsch [5] and typified by Sympodiamyascus, Sympodiapridia, which was typified by Sympodiapridium, which was typified by Sympodiamyascus-dehydroides [6]. Voglmayr & Jaklitsch [6] established Sympodiamyascus and Sympodiapridia for species which are distinguished from each other by the characters of the ascospores, which are immersed in the leaf, simple and immersed in the root, and the presence of a dry, unbranched, straight or curved pedicel. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that Sympodiapridus is sister to S. nebulis, S. pyogenes and S. syringae, which are separated by the intraspecific variation of the type species, S. pyogenes [7].

Sympodiapridus nebulis is a pyogenetic species and found in the order Pyogenes, Pyogenes, and Pyogenetales. It is a well-known plant pathogen that has a wide host range and is present in all climates, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. It has a worldwide distribution, infecting more than 200 different plant species and causing significant economic losses. In the past, Sympodiapridus was considered as a very small species, but with the recent recognition of this species as a new species, the genus Sympodiapridus is widely distributed and is now considered as a large species.

The genus Sympodiapridus is morphologically very similar to the older genus Sympodiapridus, which was circumscribed based on its ostiolar denticles, which are covered by a thin “pseudoepidermal” layer [8].


## Methods
Taxonomy was assigned to each isolate based on the representative sequence of the taxonomic groups assigned to each taxonomic group of the basidiomycot. Taxonomic assignments were made using the Living Tree Project (http://www.evolve.org/lab/living-tree-project/).

Phenotypic and morphological characterization
Microscopic features were observed on SDA medium with a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a Nikon Eclipse E600 compound microscope. Photomicrographs were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 or a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera using AxioVision 4.6 software. Morphological characterization of the macroconidia were performed with the help of a Nikon TE2000 or a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera using the manual camera. Measurements were made from a 10 × 10 × 10 µm section of the macroconidia mounted on SDA plates. Measurements were made with a Nikon TE2000 or a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera using the Zeiss AxioVision 4.6 software.

DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from fungal isolates using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA was sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Library preparation and sequencing
The raw sequences were submitted to the NCBI database (accession number: SRP05701) for the preparation of the newly generated sequences.


## Results
The type of the type species, Pseudocercospora brumalis, was found in . melinis, but the culture and illustrations are still unclear. The type species, Penicillium gossypii, was found in a specimen of the same family (CBS 123.52) and in a specimen of a new species, Penicillium gossypii.
