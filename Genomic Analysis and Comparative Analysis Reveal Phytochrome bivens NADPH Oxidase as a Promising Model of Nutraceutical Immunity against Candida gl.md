## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a neglected, often life-threatening, infection in humans. The disease is caused by the fungus Sporothrix sclerotiorum, which infects a wide range of hosts, especially cats, dogs, and hematology patients. The treatment is simple and effective, but often requires immuno-regulatory tissue preparations. Here, we describe the development of a 1.5-year-old, non-targeted, non-Sporothrix sp. strain with enhanced sporulation and reduced mycelial yields compared with the parental strain. This strain showed a marked increase in fitness for a wide host range, from chicken embryos to mice, and from a yeast to human keratinome to increase virulence in a murine model of systemic infection. Purified sporotrichosis from S. sclerotiorum (left hand side), obtained at 1.5 years, increased greatly at a much slower rate compared with that from comparable sporotrichosis from other fungi. The strain also showed a marked increase in virulence in a murine model of peritoneal keratitis. Sclerotrichosis from S. sclerotiorum (right side), obtained at 1.5 years, caused a severe reduction in tissue homeostasis, and had a marked effect on the tissue integrity of the keratinome compared with that from other fungi. These findings suggest that S. sclerotiorum from this background has a great potential to become a serious threat to human sporotrichosis.


## Introduction
The above results indicate that oxidative stress is a key determinant for fungal virulenc.

The mechanisms that control oxidative stress and its subsequent generation in fungi, such as the regulated mechanisms, are poorly understood. However, oxidative stress is known to contribute to pathogenicity and virulence [38] and several pathogens have been identified as oxidative stress-activated protein kinases (RASK) [39, 40], which can activate various transcriptional cascades that regulate gene expression, morphology, virulence, and antifungal drug resistance.

RASK pathways are regulated by a large set of transcription factors, which are regulated by the Dtx1 and Dtx2 genes, respectively [41, 42]. Dtx1, which is expressed by most fungi, is an oxidative phosphorylase [43] and requires a co-repressor to control the expression of Dtx1 [44, 45]. Dtx2, which is expressed by most fungi, is a non-enzymic oxidase and plays a central role in oxidative stress response in fungi. Dtx1 and Dtx2 regulate the expression of genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the production of cell wall lipids and cell wall pili. Thus, Dtx1 and Dtx2 can regulate the expression of numerous genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, such as ß-glucan synthase, a- and ß-glucan-coating protein, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes [46, 47]. Previous studies have shown that Dtx1 is involved in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis in C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis [48-50]. However, no study has evaluated the role of the Dtx1 and Dtx2 in fungal virulence.

In this study, we investigated the role of Dtx1 and Dtx2 in oxidative stress response, cell wall biosynthesis and virulence of C. glabrata and C. albicans. We found that C. glabrata produces exogenous ROS to damage lipid membranes and that C. albicans cells display dramatic reduction in the production of cell wall lipids in response to the oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms that regulate C. glabrata and C.


## Methods
The data were used to study the effect of the different phosphatase inhibitors on virulence of the Candida glabrata strain B350.

The binary vector (pBS-1) and the binary vector without the inactive CnCn selectable marker were used as positive and negative control vectors, respectively. The experiment was repeated three times.

The binary vector (pBS-2) was prepared using the same method as the binary vector with the modifications. The pBS-2 was prepared in the same way as the binary vector without the inactive CnCn selectable marker.

The binary vector without the active CnCn selectable marker was prepared in the same way as the binary vector without the inactive CnCn selectable marker, except that the ß-tubulin-coding gene was used as a control. The experiment was repeated three times.

In order to determine the effect of the inhibitors on the virulence of the Candida glabrata strain, the plasmid pBS-1 was transformed into the E. coli strain DH10B-Blue, by the procedure described previously [23]. The plasmid pBS-1 was transformed into DH10B-Blue using the method described previously [23]. The plasmid pBS-2 was transformed into the E. coli strain DH10B-Blue using the method described previously [23]. The pBS-2 vector was transformed into the E. coli strain by the procedure described previously [23].

Fungal Isolates
The pathogen Candida glabrata was isolated from human lung and liver samples, and identified by conventional methods. The fungus was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and inoculated by plating on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 37°C. The fungus was then incubated at 37°C for 2-3 days.

The pathogen Candida glabrata was isolated from human blood by Gram-negative staining and Gram-positive staining. The fungus was grown on YPD agar (0.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose, 2% agar) and the spores were harvested by filtering through a 70 µm filter and centrifugation at 3000×g for 10 min.


## Results
Therefore, the most promising candidate candidate for the oxidative stress response of Candida glabrata is NADPH oxidase (NADPH oxidase) (Supplementary Table S3. In our study, the NADPH oxidase gene is more conserved among the fungi than with any other organism. Indeed, the most conserved NADPH oxidase genes in yeast and mammals were named as NADPH oxidase-E and NADPH oxidase-NADPH oxidase-E (Supplementary Table S3). The two NADPH oxidase genes are also more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism. In addition, the genes encoding enzymes for the metabolism of ROS, and for the catabolism of NADH, were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism. In the case of the catabolism of NADH in plants, the NADPH oxidase gene was more conserved among the fungi than with any other organism (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, the genes encoding enzymes for the metabolism of NADH, were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism.

In the case of the oxidative stress response in Candida glabrata, the putative NADPH oxidase gene was more diverged among the fungi than with any other organism. In contrast, the putative NADPH oxidase gene was more diverged among the fungi than with any other organism. The genes encoding enzymes for the catabolism of NADH, were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism.

Of the genes encoding enzymes for the catabolism of NADH, three genes were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism. The catabolic enzymes for the metabolism of NADH, were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism. The genes encoding enzymes for the catabolism of NADH, were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism. In the case of the NADPH oxidase gene, three genes were more divergent among the fungi than with any other organism.


## Discussion
The predicted NADPH oxidase gene was identified in yeast, and in the genome of human, but not in yeas. In addition, the yeast genome contains a large number of genes encoding NADPH oxidases, such as the FAS1-like gene (FAS1) and the FAS3-like gene (FAS3). However, we have not been able to generate a putative NADPH oxidase gene for human because of the lack of a gene encoding NADPH oxidase in yeast. As a result, we have been unable to generate a putative NADPH oxidase gene in yeast. To verify that the NADPH oxidase gene was present in yeast, we constructed an RNA-seq experiment using the db-rRNA program. The db-rRNA program generated a high number of reads (88,443) in yeast, but to our knowledge, no previous work has been reported using the db-rRNA program to generate a db-rRNA gene in yeast.

In order to identify the genes required for the production of NADPH oxidase, we constructed a second set of proteins based on the db-rRNA program. We were able to identify genes encoding for NADP dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent NADP-dependent protein kinase, and the two NADP dehydrogenase genes in yeast (Table 1). In yeast, these genes are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of NADPH (Table 1). In yeast, two genes, NADP-dependent protein kinase and NADP-dependent protein kinase, are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of NADPH (Table 1). In yeast, one gene, NADP-dependent protein kinase is involved in the biosynthesis of NADPH (Table 1). We confirmed that the two genes in yeast are NADP-dependent protein kinase and NADP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, the NADP-dependent protein kinase and NADP-dependent protein kinase genes are present in the genome of human. However, we could not find any protein genes encoding for both enzymes.
