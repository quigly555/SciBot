## Abstract
Fungal infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening fungal infection, and is estimated to account for ~3% of all deaths annually in the United States. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common life-threatening fungal pathogen causing IA. This study aimed to characterize the genetic diversity and phenotypic variation of clinical isolates of the fungal isolate Fusarium wettigatus from patients with chronic infections in patients with acute or refractory neutropenia. Phenotypic and phenotypic parameters were determined by PCR and biochemistry phenotyping. Phenotypic analysis identified eight novel alleles in F. wettigatus, two novel alleles in F. albicans, and one novel allele in F. niger. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of the isolates, using the Ustilago species-specific barcode, revealed two novel alleles. The two novel alleles were also highly distinct.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection that can lead to a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the respiratory tract to an acute disseminated disease with meningoencephalitis, usually in the absence of drug intoxication. ^1 The fungal pathogens are divided into two varieties, species: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. C. neoformans is found mainly in pigeon droppings and decaying wood.


## Methods
These bacteria were selected based on the identification of . albicans and C. dubliniensis (Table 2) and the identification of Vibrio subsp. tritici and A. fumigatus (Table 2) based on the standardised reference strains.

Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
MICs were determined by broth dilution method using standard bacteriological test strips and agar diffusion tests according to the method of McNabb and Sprague [30]. For the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs), the broth was diluted to the appropriate concentration for each strain. The growth of the bacterial strains was also determined by serial dilution in MHB (2-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) broth. MICs were determined in 96-well microplates using 96-well microplates (Nunc). The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound that completely inhibited growth of the tested organisms (as determined by OD_600) and, where possible, at the end of the test. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The lowest concentration of the compound that completely inhibited growth of the tested organisms was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

Determination of minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs)
MFCs were determined by incubation with diluted C. albicans and C. dubliniensis in RPMI-1640 medium at 35°C and 50 rpm. The MFCs were determined by the method recommended by the CLSI document M27-A3 [31]. MFCs were defined as those that prevented at least one of the following: (1) growth for at least 1 h in the presence of 3% of BSA (bacteria); (2) growth for at least 1 h in the presence of 0.05% of gelatin (bacteria); (3) growth for at least 1 h in the presence of 0.05% of gelatin (bacteria); (4) growth for at least 1 h in the presence of 0.


## Results
No significant difference in the detection rate was found between the two group.

The median age of domestic cats was 46 years, and the mean body weight of domestic cats was 119.4 g (Table 4). No significant difference in the detection rate was found between the two groups.

The mean neutrophil count of domestic cats was 46.7 cells/mm^3 (Table 5). No significant difference in the detection rate was found between the two groups.

The mean number of neutrophils was 3.2 (Table 6). No significant difference in the detection rate was found between the two groups.

The mean neutrophils percentage of neutrophils was 5.4 (Table 7). No significant difference in the detection rate was found between the two groups.

The mean number of neutrophils neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 8) was 12.2 (Table 9) and the mean number of neutrophils neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 10) were 19.3. The mean neutrophils percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 9) was 2.3 (Table 10) and the mean number of neutrophils neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 10) were 2.9.

The mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 8) was 18.4 (Table 9) and the mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 10) was 6.2 (Table 11) and the mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 11) was 9.8 (Table 12). The mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 8) was 6.4 (Table 9) and the mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 10) was 9.8 (Table 12). The mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 8) was 2.8 (Table 9) and the mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 10) was 7.3 (Table 12). The mean neutrophil percentage of neutrophils/mm^3 (Table 8) was 3.


## Discussion
. albicans has been reported to be more virulent in cats than in dogs [25], and most of the cats with C. albicans infections are also more susceptible to infections by the pathogenic fungi. Our results suggest that cats with a high C. albicans burden may be more susceptible to infections by C. albicans.

Fluconazole resistance was not associated with increased mortality in cats with fluconazole sensitivity. Fluconazole is the mainstay of treatment for AIDS and is commonly used for other CNS diseases such as Crohn’s disease, chronic glaucoma, and other fungal infections [25]. There are no data available on fluconazole resistance in cats and there is no consensus on whether or not the fluconazole sensitivity is linked to the use of fluconazole in cats.

C. albicans is an opportunistic yeast and is often found in the skin, mucous membranes, and oral and intestinal tracts of cats and dogs [26]. Humans are susceptible to C. albicans infections in humans, but cats are not. There are no reports of cats with C. albicans infection in humans. However, the cat with the highest fluconazole MIC was 2 µg/mL and the cat with the lowest MIC was 2 µg/mL. The cat with fluconazole MIC of 0.125 µg/mL was significantly more susceptible to C. albicans infections than the cat with fluconazole MIC of 0.25 µg/mL.

The data presented here suggest that cats with high mortality rates may be more susceptible to infections by C. albicans than cats with low mortality rates. However, the cats with fluconazole MIC of 2 µg/mL are significantly more susceptible to C. albicans infections than the cat with fluconazole MIC of 0.125 µg/mL.

Cat exposures to antifungal agents were not associated with decreased mortality in cats with C. albicans infection. Antifungal susceptibility of C. albicans was not associated with increased mortality in cats with fluconazole sensitivity. The cats with fluconazole MIC of 0.
