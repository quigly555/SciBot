## Abstract
The CdU+D4 fusion protein of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis contains two domains that, according to the crystal structure, recombine with a carboxylic acid. The crystal structure of PbD4 in action has been reported for over 20 years now, but information on its N-terminal domains has not been systematically published. In this article, we describe the structure of PbD4 in action. This is an evolutionally complicated, aromatic amino acid domain that, according to the crystal structure, isomerizes at several positions in the residues 520-3. Despite the structural changes, the amino acids remain conserved, and the residues with the characteristic aromatic face-off behavior occur along the N- and C-terminal domains of PbD4. The N-terminal domains of PbD4 have a hydrophobic face that interacts with the a- and ß-carbonic anhydrases at the residues in the aromatic amino acid residue, which provide the structural background for the face-off behavior. The N-terminal domains of PbD4 display a hydroxylated aromatic N- and C-terminal behavior that appears to be related to the hydrophilic face-off. The N-terminal behavior is characteristic of a-a a hydrophilic amino acids.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal disease of humans and animals, affecting mainly meningitis and meningoencephalitis. The disease affects millions of people worldwide, most of them immunocompromised. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is usually confined to the subcutaneous tissue, but can also invade the circulatory system and reach the adrenal glands, the central nervous system, skin and even the central nervous system of the central nervous system (CNS) (Brown et al., 2012; Saha et al., 2012). The disease is also reported to affect a broad range of other tissues, including the adrenal glands, and its incidence has been increasing. The disease is most commonly caused by inhalation of the yeast cells of the genus Cryptococcus, which can be isolated from the environment and is found in tropical and subtropical areas. The pathogenesis of cryptococcosis is believed to involve a combination of opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections. However, the virus is reported to be able to resist the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy. In fact, despite the recent advances, the mortality rate of cryptococcosis remains around 30% despite the use of currently available antifungal drugs (Prusky, 2011). The pathogenesis of cryptococcosis is attributed to two pathways. Firstly, there is a known ability of the fungus to evade the host immune system and, therefore, the pathogen must be able to colonize the host tissues. The second pathway is mainly caused by the metabolic activity of the innate immune system, which can be activated by various stimuli. The natural defense mechanism against infection involves the production of antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, which are able to kill the yeast cells or bacteria. The secretory pathway is responsible for the production of more than 30,000 biologically active molecules. A number of these molecules can be degraded by macromolecules and enzymes, and they are able to mediate the anti-infective activity. In fact, some antifungals are able to inhibit the activity of some of the molecules, such as those that inhibit apoptosis and polysaccharide synthesis.


## Methods
The two strains of Aspergillus fumigatus (AFU_010858) and Aspergillus niger (AFU_002028) were used for the in vitro assay. For the assay, 200 µl of cell suspension was injected into a 5 ml microtube containing 200 µl of RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 200 µl of sterile 0.9% (w/v) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The mixture was incubated at 35°C for 60 min and then the cells were washed with PBS and the number of CFU/ml was determined. The specific activity of Crude Xylosma prokaryotes against Aspergillus niger was determined by plating 200 µl of cell suspension on Xylosma plate.

The antifungal activity of N. canadensis against Aspergillus niger was determined by measuring the number of viable Aspergillus niger cells in 50 µl of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) treated with 1 mM DTT for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were washed with PBS and the number of viable Aspergillus niger in 50 µl of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) treated with 1 mM DTT for 5 min was determined. The experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as means ± SD of triplicate experiments.

## Results
In this study, the ability of Xylosma species to cope with oxidative stress was investigate. Xylosma prokaryotes were subjected to high concentrations of H_2O_2 (30 mM), which can act as a stress inducer [20]. In the present study, the oxidative stress induced by H_2O_2 (30 mM) was significantly reduced by Xylosma species (p<0.05) (Figure 2). Xylosma species exhibited more oxidative stress resistance than those of fungi. In addition, the Xylosma species were more sensitive to high concentrations of H_2O_2 than those of the other fungi (Figure 2). These results suggested that the oxidative stress induced by H_2O_2 is a sensitive stress inducer, which can act as a stress inducer by repressing the oxidative stress resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus.

Xylosma species exhibit higher virulence than those of Aspergillus fumigatus

The virulence of Xylosma species was evaluated by the number of human and animal pathogenic fungi in blood, liver, spleen and brain. Xylosma species were cultured in the blood or brains of mice and they were used in this study. The survival rate of Aspergillus fumigatus was significantly lower than that of the other fungi. In addition, the Xylosma species were significantly more virulent than those of Aspergillus fumigatus. The results showed that Xylosma species were significantly more virulent than those of Aspergillus fumigatus.

The in vivo virulence of Xylosma species was investigated in a mouse model of systemic infection.


## Discussion
However, the TCA cycle also has important effects on other cellular processes and plays a key role in a variety of cell processes, including morphogenesis and differentiatio. The ability to respond to oxidative stress and cope with the reactive oxygen species, such as hypoxia, is dependent on the TCA cycle. In the case of melanin production, which is one of the most important cell morphologies in eukaryotic cells, the melanin biosynthetic enzyme, S. melanus, was found to be required for the TCA cycle [29]. In the case of melanin biosynthesis, the glucosylceramide synthase (GcsA) and the pyruvic acid synthase (PAS) enzymes, respectively, were found to be required for the biosynthesis of this polysaccharide [30]. In addition to the biosynthesis of the TCA cycle, the ß-oxidation of the fungal mycotoxins, including S. commune, T. atroviride, and A. nidulans, were also found to be essential for the production of melanin and related compounds [31]. Therefore, the fungal melanin biosynthetic pathway could be responsible for the elevated production of melanin and related compounds in the ascomycete yeasts.

In the present study, the expression of genes encoding the TCA cycle in the ascomycete yeasts was increased in response to the oxidative stress and hypoxia. The expression of genes encoding the TCA cycle was also upregulated by the cell wall degrading enzymes in response to the hypoxia. This resulted in the increase in the expression of genes encoding the enzymes, such as adhesion molecules and chitin synthase, in the ascomycete yeasts and the basidiomycetous fungi, such as Ustilago maydis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Ustilago maydis, and the pathogenic yeast S. cerevisiae [32]. The expression of genes encoding the TCA cycle in the ascomycete yeasts and the basidiomycete fungi, such as Ustilago maydis and Cryptococcus neoformans, were also upregulated by the cell wall degrading enzymes in response to the hypoxia.
