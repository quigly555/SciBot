## Abstract
The incidence of fungal infections, especially those due to Candida species, are increasing. Antifungal therapy is an important approach in the management of these infections. The use of new antifungal drugs is also needed to decrease the emergence of resistant strains. In this study, we evaluated the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on two clinically used antifungal agents, fluconazole and voriconazole. The effect of AgNPs on Candida morphology was evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively.

Both agents presented a marked reduction in the number of pseudomonas mutants and the morphology of the Candida strains were altered.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus species. The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system (CNS) and skin [1]. While cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is most common in immunocompromised individuals, cryptococcal pneumonia (PCP) also results in immunologically mediated, and often life-threatening, organ dysfunction and death [2].

The pathogenesis of PCP includes both a progressive increase in HIV-associated fungal burden and an increased frequency of CD4+ T cells [3]. CD4+ lymphocytes are recruited to the CNS in a manner that is dependent upon the expression of many cytokine and chemokine pathways, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß).


## Methods

Prior to inoculation, bacterial strains were grown on YPD and buffered at pH = .0 with MOPS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at 450 nm and then diluted with PBS to obtain a final cell concentration of 1 × 10^8 CFU/mL. Cell suspensions were plated onto YPD agar (1% Bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose, 1% Bacto-dextrose, 1% Bacto-sambic acid) plates. Plates were incubated at 30°C and colonies were counted after 3 days. A single colony from a well of a YPD plate was inoculated with 10 µL of the cell suspension and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 30°C. To determine the number of colony forming units (CFUs), colony counts were performed by inoculating the same well with 10 µL of a cell suspension and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 30°C. The number of CFUs was normalized to that of the same well containing the cell suspension.

Ascorbate-like peptides were identified using the program BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [50]. One hundred microliters of each peptide was added to 96-well microtiter plates (TPP Biotechnology, Mumbai, India) and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm. The positive control was formed by growth in PBS. The absorbance of the control wells was measured at 450 nm. The peptides were diluted with PBS to an OD_600 of 0.2, and the reaction was conducted with 0.5% aseptic Dulbecco's phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at pH 7.4. The absorbance of the control wells was measured at 450 nm. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 µL of BAC to each well and the reaction was performed at 30°C. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded after 3 days. The experiment was repeated three times.


## Results
[13], [14], [15]. This is the first report on ABC transporters in a phylum-level organism, where they have been reported from a wide range of organisms (reviewed in [16], [17]), and it has been proposed that they play a role in the establishment and maintenance of diverse metabolic pathways in the endosymbiont of fungi [19], [20]. ABC transporters are functional in most fungi [21], [22]. ABC transporters have been found in all eukaryotes, and a number of them have been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of metabolic pathways in plant and animal pathogens [23]-[24]. The ABC proteins in the T. marneffei genome have not been identified in any other fungi, and their roles in host cell physiology are not yet clear. It is possible that the ABC proteins in T. marneffei are not necessary for the regulation of metabolic pathways. ABC proteins have not been found in the genomes of other organisms, and their functions have not yet been elucidated.

A. fumigatus ABC protein homologs in other fungi were found in the genomes of some of the most diverse fungal species (Fig 1). ABC transporter genes have been found in other fungal species [25]-[27]. We identified ABC transporters in some of the most diverse fungal species, including the yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, and in the genomes of several of the most diverse fungi. ABC transporters have been found in all eukaryotes, and they are essential for the function of the ABC proteins in the host. ABC transporters have not been found in the genomes of other organisms, and their functions have not yet been elucidated.

The ABC transporters are the most abundant ABC proteins in fungal genomes, and they are likely to be a significant source of ABC proteins in other fungal species. The number of ABC transporters in the genome of T. marneffei has been estimated to be around 70,000, and it is likely that these transporters have been present in the last common ancestor of fungal species. The number of ABC transporters in the genome of T. marneffei was found to be around 70,000.


## Discussion
fumigatus protein complex that is not related to its primary function, cell wall integrit. The ABCB_3 (ABCB_5) and ABCB_2 (ABCB_7) subunits are found in all eukaryotic species studied, but not in fungi or plants. In addition, the ABCB_1 (ABCB_2) and ABCB_3 (ABCB_4) subunits are present in only a few fungal species, including Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium chrysogenum, but not in any fungus-specific subpopulations (Figure 2).

The ABCB_5 subunit, which is similar to the human ABCB_3 subunit, was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_2 subunit, which was identified in the present study as a member of the ABCB_3 subunit in A. fumigatus [21]. The ABCB_1 subunit has been found in the fungal kingdom [23], although its exact role in A. fumigatus is unclear [20]. The ABCB_2 subunit was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_3 subunit, which was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_2 subunit in A. fumigatus [21]. The ABCB_1 subunit was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_2 subunit, which was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_3 subunit in A. fumigatus [21].

The ABCB_3 subunit was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_1 subunit, which was identified in the present work as a member of the ABCB_3 subunit in A. fumigatus [21].
