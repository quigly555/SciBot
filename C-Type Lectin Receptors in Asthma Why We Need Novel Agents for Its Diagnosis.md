## Abstract
One of the most important changes in the architecture of the microbiome is the transition from the commensal to the pathogenic state. Mammalian cells, including the intestin microbiota, the spleen, and liver, play a key role in regulating immune responses, protecting hosts from pathogenic microbes, and providing host-derived immunity to the consequences of these changes. The spleen is the main source of cytokines, including myocin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-12, along with several other biologically relevant molecules. It has been proposed that the spleen orchestrates the initiation and modulation of inflammatory responses, thereby influencing the pathology of diseases such as asthma, allergies, and cardiovascular disease. However, the role of the spleen in this dynamic system is less clear. Recent studies indicate that the composition of the spleen microbiota is significantly modulated by environmental factors. The most important is the nutrient availability of different sources. However, the nutrient source of fiber and other foods is also a very important factor in modulation of the spleen microbiota. In this review, the role of fiber and other foods in modulation of the spleen will be discussed.


## Introduction
Because asthma triggers cytokinesine storm in response to airway inflammation and inflammation-induced asthma is characterized by an increased immune cell infiltration of astrocyte. Thus, it is a risk factor for developing asthma. However, the full extent of the immune response against asthma has not been studied.

The majority of patients with asthma will develop chronic inflammatory reactions, but very few develop asthma at the beginning [13], [14]. The severity of asthma varies depending on the pathogenic microorganism, but most asthma patients are chronically immunocompromised, and thus, they are at increased risk of developing asthma. Individuals with predisposition are at increased risk of developing asthma due to the increased infiltration of immune cells [13].

The immunological response against microbes in patients with asthma is complex. Yeast cells are able to infiltrate astrocytes and initiate phagocytosis [15]. The phagocytic pathway is important for controlling inflammation. The phagocytic pathway is initiated by the binding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to phagocytic receptors and the resulting inhibition of cytokine production. The phagocytic pathway also involves activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin (IL)-1ß and TNF-alpha. This leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO) and to release of inflammatory mediators, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO is an essential mediator for phagocytosis. The phagocytic pathway is initiated by the binding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to phagocytic receptors and the resulting inhibition of cytokine production. The phagocytic pathway is activated by the binding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to phagocytic receptors and the resulting inhibition of cytokine production. The phagocytic pathway is activated by the binding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resulting inhibition of cytokine production. The phagocytic pathway also involves activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-17 [16]. This leads to the production of NO and IL-17.


## Methods
The schedule of the KTC drug was established based on a previous study by Vitek .0 (2009). The KTC drug was evaluated in eight different formulations (0.5 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L, 3.0 g/L, 5.0 g/L, 6.0 g/L, and 8.0 g/L) that were previously characterized by Zibunni et al. (2015). In brief, for the KTC drug, the first row in the analysis was used for comparison with the existing ketoconazole drug. The second row in the analysis was used for the comparison of the KTC drug with the KTC compound. The first row in the analysis was used for comparison with the KTC drug with the KTC compound.

## Results
Identification of the M. tuberculosis B cell line MCA1
MCA1 was identified in the M. tuberculosis B cell line by a BLAST search with the BLASTp server, which was performed using the BLAST.MIRE (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.MIRE) database. The BLAST.MIRE database was used to identify the MCA1-related genes (Fig 1). BLAST searches using the BLAST.MIRE database identified a total of 24 MCA1-related genes. Four of these genes, MCA1-1-A, MCA1-2-A, MCA1-3-A, MCA1-4-A, MCA1-5-A, MCA1-6-A, and MCA1-7-A, were also identified by BLAST searches using the BLAST.MIRE database. These four MCA1 genes were identified in the B cell line MCA1 by using BLAST.MIRE and BLAST.MIRE databases.


## Discussion
An important consequence of these pathways is that they can be activated in response to a variety of conditions, including cytokine gradients and host defense mechanisms, such as inflammation and inflammatory responses to neutrophils [29.

The <U+0394>GCSF pathway is involved in astrocytosis, cell proliferation and apoptosis [30]. It is also involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and the immune response to viral infections [31]. In contrast to the <U+0394>GCSF pathway, the GCSF pathway is involved in cytokine production in response to lung cancer and in lung adhesion to various targets, such as epithelial cells and endothelial cells [32]. The <U+0394>GCSF pathway contributes to the degradation of H_2O_2 and to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 [33]. Furthermore, the expression of cytokines, such as IL-10 and TNF-a, was increased in the <U+0394>GCSF pathway, suggesting that the GCSF pathway is important for the infection-induced cytokine production.

In this study, we found that the GCSF pathway is activated in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans. As expected, the GCSF pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fungal infection. Although the GCSF pathway has been reported to be activated in response to various stresses, the involvement of this pathway in the regulation of fungal development, including the development of pulmonary fungal infections, has not been reported previously. For example, a previous study suggested that the GCSF pathway is activated in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans [32]. In our study, we found that the GCSF pathway is activated in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans, suggesting that the GCSF pathway is involved in the infection-induced cytokine production. In addition, the transcription of the GCSF pathway was upregulated in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans, suggesting that the GCSF pathway is involved in the infection-induced cytokine production.
