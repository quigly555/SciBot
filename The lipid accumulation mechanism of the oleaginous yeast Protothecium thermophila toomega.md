## Abstract
In order to understand the role of Hap43 as a new regulator of innate immune responses against bacterial infection in humans, we investigated the cellular basis of this ß-tubulinase and found its deletion by homologous recombination. We found that Hap43 acts downstream of Hap43 in a HAP43-dependent mechanism. Hap43 silencing inhibited the growth of the tested bacterial strains when the <U+0394>hap43<U+2206> mutant was grown on a low background (i.e. out of the blue) or when Hap43 was strongly repressed (e.g. when Hap43 was present at 0.5 mM).


## Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, in 2016 there were 12.6 million cases of fungal infection and 22,700 hospitalizations were associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) (1). The global prevalence of IFIs ranges from 3.7 to 18.1%, with most IFI being seen in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific (1, 2). The global prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in adults is 1.4 to 25.8% (3).


## Methods
The first variable, the mean lipid accumulation of the yeast was subtracted, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was calculate. The second variable, the mean lipid accumulation of the yeast was subtracted, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated. The remaining variables were as follows: 1, lipid accumulation; 2, lipid accumulation; 3, lipid accumulation; 4, lipid accumulation; 5, lipid accumulation; 6, lipid accumulation. The calculated ratios were as follows: 1, lipid accumulation; 2, lipid accumulation; 3, lipid accumulation; 4, lipid accumulation; 5, lipid accumulation; 6, lipid accumulation.

Protein extraction and Western blot
The total amount of OLEG was determined by measuring the amount of OLEG in the supernatant using the QIAamp^TM Protein Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the sample was diluted 1:1000 in TE buffer. The sample was then heated to 95 °C for 2 min, followed by boiling (95 °C for 10 s, 30 cycles of 30 s and 60 °C for 60 s). The samples were then cooled (60 °C for 5 s, 30 cycles of 30 s and 60 °C for 60 s) and the sample was digested with the enzyme at 37 °C for 5 min. The crude product was precipitated by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min) and the supernatant was used for the determination of the OLEG concentration. The crude protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Western blot
The OLEG was separated using a BSA (1% w/v) column and the protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The crude product was precipitated by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min) and the supernatant was used for the determination of the OLEG concentration. The crude protein concentration was measured using the BSA protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).


## Results
In this study, we propose that the lipid accumulation mechanism of the oleaginous yeast Protothecium thermophila toomega was once connected with the lipid accumulation mechanism of Protothecium thermophila toomeg.

A recent work has proposed that the lipid accumulation mechanism of Protothecium thermophila toomega is linked to the lipid accumulation mechanism of Protothecium thermophila toomega [43]. Our results indicate that our hypothesis is confirmed in the data set.

2.2. METH PLB Disrupts Polyol Production and Changes Lipid Production in Oleaginous Yeast
In order to analyze the role of PLB in polyol production, we first analyzed polyol production in Oleaginous yeasts. Oleaginous yeasts produce polyol from their polyols during the growth stage of their life cycle. We found that in the first stage of polyol production, the extracellular polyols are released from the biomass in the endobiotic phase of the growth process, but after polyol is produced, the polyols are not sufficient to satisfy the demand of the extracellular polyol production.

In order to test the role of PLB in polyol production, we supplemented Y. lipolytica with 1.5 mM PLB (Figure 2). PLB is an efficient polyol producer which is present in an oleaginous yeast [4], [19], [19], [40], [42], and is present in the extracellular polyol production. To date, PLB is only found in the extracellular polyol production process in S. cerevisiae [44]. In addition, we found that PLB was present in a very small amount in O. sativus, an oleaginous yeast, which has an important role in the production of polyols [45].

In the second stage of polyol production, polyols are formed by the extracellular polyol production process. After polyol is produced, PLB is not sufficient to satisfy the demand of the extracellular polyol production, which is a precondition for extracellular polyol production. We found that in the endobiotic phase of the growth process, the extracellular polyols are released from the biomass in the endobiotic phase of the growth process. The polyols are not sufficient to satisfy the demand of the extracellular polyol production.


## Discussion
The average molecular weight of C. albicans cell wall proteins is 7.6 kDa, which is comparable to the average molecular weight of other fungi (Figure 1). However, differences in the number of C. albicans cell wall proteins are expected to be much larger than those reported for other fungi. In addition, the number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is smaller than that of the other fungi (Figure 1). The majority of the proteins in the C. albicans cell wall are cell wall proteins (GFP, pfam) which are proteins required for cell wall integrity and growth (13). In addition, the number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is smaller than those reported for the other fungi (Figures 1 and 2). The higher number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is in line with the reported smaller cell wall proteins in other fungi (Figure 2).

The number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is very similar to that of other fungi (Figure 1). The C. albicans cell wall is composed of ß-1,3-glucan (the major cell wall component) and ß-1,3-glucan (the cell wall constituent) (13). The cell wall of C. albicans is composed of polysaccharides, mannoproteins, and chitin. The cell wall proteins in C. albicans are mostly composed of a-1,3-glucan (Figure 1). The number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is similar to that of other fungi (Figure 1). The cell wall proteins in C. albicans are generally composed of ß-1,3-glucan (Figure 1). The cell wall proteins in C. albicans are mainly composed of ß-1,3-glucan (Figure 1). The number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is similar to that of other fungi (Figure 1). The number of cell wall proteins in C. albicans is relatively higher than that in C. neoformans (Figure 1).
