## Abstract
We report a case of invasive candidiasis in a HIV-infected patient, which involved bilateral lower extremities and skin lesions. A 61-year-old immunocompetent woman with HIV presented with symptoms of raised hemoptysis and a low-grade fever. She had been taking oral fluconazole for the last two years and had recently stopped receiving flucytosine. She had a past medical history that included an infection with C. parapsilosis, C.


## Introduction
Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania sp. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the African continent.1, 2, 3 The disease is contracted by the bite of sandflies by the bite of sandflies, which causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is a wide-spread vector-borne infection caused by L. infantum. L. infantum is the most common species of the species, and VL is responsible for 70% of the world’s cases of VL.


## Methods
In these cases, no treatment was performe.

2.3. Selection Criteria for Secondary Health Status in Women
The selection of patients with primary health status, based on HIV status, was based on the existing data, which had been established and a referral review was conducted. The outcome was evaluated by the number of HIV positive cases within the first 24 h of HIV diagnosis. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Second Hospital of the Federal University of Goiás (Proc. No. 259/13/15). The study was carried out under the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Second Hospital of Federal University of Goiás.

2.4. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The antifungal susceptibility of the patients was evaluated by the broth microdilution method of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) [7]. Briefly, the test was performed on C. albicans ATCC 90028. The test was performed in 96-well microtiter plates. The test was performed on C. glabrata ATCC 90028. The test was performed on C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019.

2.5. Clinical Assessment
The diagnostic tests were performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for microbiological tests [7], [8]. Briefly, the test was performed on blood agar for C. albicans ATCC 90028 and on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for C. glabrata ATCC 90028. The test was performed on C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019. The results of both tests were interpreted according to the European Community guidelines [7]. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Second Hospital of Federal University of Goiás.

## Results
There were no differences in severity between patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia and those with disseminated Pneumocystis pneumonia (Table 2. No patient had significant neutropenia, and no patient had a lung lesion (Table 2).

Eighty-two patients were treated with fluconazole and 1 patient received antifungal therapy. In the two patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, there were no differences in duration of antifungal therapy (3.5-24 h). There were no differences in duration of antifungal therapy among patients treated with fluconazole or one-day amphotericin B (5-8 h). In the patient with Pneumocystis pneumonia, survival was not significantly different between fluconazole and amphotericin B (8-24 h, P = .002).

Patient characteristics and clinical features of patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia and other autoimmune diseases
There were no significant differences in the clinical features and the clinical features of patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia and other autoimmune diseases (Table 3).

Of the 3,125 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, 1,824 had CD4 count <500 cells/mm^3 (Table 4). Of these, 1,386 had an elevated CD4 count, and 1,356 had a normal CD4 count (Table 4). Of the 1,824 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, 130 had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture-positive CSF. Of the 1,172 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, 636 had CSF cultures showing cryptococcal antigen (C. neoformans), and 18 patients had CSF culture-positive CSF. Of the 1,535 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, 1,001 had CSF cultures showing yeast-like cells (yeast) and no culture-positive CSF.


## Discussion

Cryptococcal disease has been reported in immunocompromised patients, as well as in patients with chronic renal failure [6, 10. Cryptococcal infection has been reported in patients with lung disease or chronic renal failure [6, 9]. Cryptococcal infection has also been reported in patients with relapsed AIDS [3, 10].

The underlying mechanisms of the immune response to cryptococcosis in the lung and brain have not been previously described. A series of published papers has shown that there is a correlation between a high expression of proinflammatory cytokines and a high degree of a Th2 cytokine response to the infection [11]. In humans, in addition to the Th2 cytokine response, several Th2 cytokines are involved in the inflammatory response to cryptococcosis. For example, IL-4 has been shown to be involved in the clearance of cryptococcal infection in immunocompetent individuals [12]. IL-12 has been shown to be required for the clearance of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with chronic bronchitis and in patients with hematologic malignancies [13]. In patients with HIV infection, the IFN-<U+03B3> cytokine response plays a critical role in the immune response to cryptococcosis [14]. In HIV-associated cryptococcosis, the IFN-<U+03B3>-CRF pathway plays an essential role in the immune response to Cryptococcus [15]. In HIV patients, the IFN-<U+03B3>-CRF pathway plays a critical role in the immune response to Cryptococcus [16]. There is a positive correlation between the presence of the IL-8 receptor and the risk of pulmonary cryptococcosis [17]. In patients with HIV and with hematologic malignancies, the IL-8 response plays a positive role in the immune response to Cryptococcus [18]. In HIV patients, the IL-8 response plays a positive role in the immune response to Cryptococcus [19]. In HIV patients with hematologic malignancies, the IL-8 response plays a positive role in the immune response to Cryptococcus [20]. The balance between Th1 and Th17 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IFN-<U+03B3> in HIV patients with hematologic malignancies, has been described in the literature.
