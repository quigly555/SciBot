## Abstract
Transposable elements (TEs) are one of the major genetic modifications in plants and animals. They play a crucial role in the regulation of genomic stability and genome evolution. However, their role is less well understood in mammals than in plants. In this study we report a detailed approach that uses genetic tools to explore the role of TEs in plant genome evolution. We demonstrate that the genome of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, has a rich source of mobile elements that include mobile DNA elements that can facilitate mobile expansion and gene movement. In contrast to previous reports, our analyses reveal an enrichment of mobile DNA elements in the P. oryzae genome of human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and haploid relatives. Two-tailed positive selection by the nucleotide amplification of the flanking regions of the nrDNA locus and the nuclear exchange factor nro4 was found to have a major role in generating a large number of mobile DNA elements in P. oryzae. We discovered that the SNP number of the flanking regions of the nrDNA locus is not the main driver for mobile DNA in this genome, but the mobile genetic elements are transferred horizontally. Finally, we showed that mobile DNA elements are mobile in P. oryzae and that they are mobile in M. oryzae. We propose that mobile DNA elements have mobile origins in both M.


## Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells have been described as a component of innate immune cells and can be recruited into the periphery via pattern recognition receptors such as Toll like receptors (TLRs) [1,2]. In the setting of HIV infection, NK cells are implicated in the control of many common viral pathogens such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [3], herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), dengue virus, parvul vitritis virus, varicella zoster virus, and disseminated histoplasmosis [4,5,6]. However, despite the potential of NK cells to mediate protection against various viruses, it has been shown that these cells are able to develop robust cytotoxicity mechanisms. Such mechanisms can be defined as the interaction between the interaction site of the interacting molecules and the immune system of the host [7]. This concept has been further refined recently by our group showing that in mice infected with human leukocytes, NK cells are able to directly kill these cells, and that the NK cell cytotoxicity mechanism is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR7 [8].

This review will explore the mechanism of cytotoxicity that NK cells have developed to kill C. albicans.


## Methods
Infections were made using sterile cotton swabs, and wounds were made by cutting the diseased leaf and leaf tissue from the woun. Leaves were wounded at the base of the head and roots of the infected leaf, using a razor blade. After cutting the wounds, the wounds were soaked in 10% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min. The wounds were then observed under a microscope, and the number of lesions was counted using a custom program for counting numbers.

The control of the disease was performed by cutting a small section of the leaf and examining the growth on the leaf surface. The leaf was weighed, and the wounds were made with a sterile cotton swab. The wounds were observed and recorded after the procedure was repeated. The disease incidence of each leaf was compared with the control of the disease, and the disease severity was expressed as a percentage of the control.

Molecular Characterization of the Fungal Strains
To determine the fungal DNA in the leaves of the infected leaves, we cultured the fungus with a single colony from the respective infected leaf. To confirm the fungi in the infected leaves, we harvested the leaves at the end of the experiment and stained them with a sterile solution of chloroform. The cells were suspended in a solution of chloroform (1% w/v) and observed under a microscope. The samples were also stained with the same chloroform, to demonstrate the presence of the fungal cells.

To determine the relative abundance of the fungal strains in the infected leaves, we performed the PCR and Southern analysis of the genomic DNA of the fungus. The PCR products were extracted by using the methods described in the published method [14, 15]. The PCR products were visualized under UV light. The relative abundance of each fungal species in the infected leaves was compared with the control of the disease. The relative abundance of each fungal species in the control of the disease was compared with the control of the disease.

To determine the relative abundance of the fungal strains in the infected leaves, we performed the PCR and Southern analysis of the genomic DNA of the fungus. The PCR products were extracted by using the methods described in the published method [14, 15]. The DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

## Discussion
Since fungi are the most numerous group of eukaryotes, their distributions can be expanded by gene flow, gene conversion, gene silencing, gene duplications, and gene replacemen. The results of our study show that large scale gene flow occurs in eukaryotes, and that gene conversion and gene conversion are driving large-scale gene conversion. The rapid expansion of gene conversion in fungi was further highlighted by the over-representation of the Saccharomycete complex in eukaryotes. The Saccharomycete complex comprises several human-associated fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Several gene conversion events were observed in the Saccharomycete complex, but the complex is not exclusive to fungi. The Saccharomycete complex was reported to be over-represented in reads of fungal genomes from vertebrates, plants, and humans [13, 15]. Although this study did not show significant changes in gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex, gene conversion could be the driver of large-scale gene conversion in eukaryotes. It is possible that gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex is closely related to gene conversion in other fungi. Gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex is most likely related to the genome expansion of the fungi that have undergone gene conversion. The Saccharomycete complex is the only gene conversion group in eukaryotes. Gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex was also observed in the presence of fungal peptidoglycan, a small molecule known to be involved in regulation of genes involved in sugar metabolism [16]. The Saccharomycete complex is also the only gene conversion group that is over-represented in eukaryotes. Gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex was also found to be linked to the increased expression of the gene encoding a serine-threonine protein [17]. These results suggest that gene conversion in the Saccharomycete complex could be a driver of gene conversion in other fungi.

Expansion of the Saccharomycete complex by gene conversion was a major driver of large-scale gene conversion in eukaryotes. Gene conversion is the driving force for large-scale gene conversion in fungi.
