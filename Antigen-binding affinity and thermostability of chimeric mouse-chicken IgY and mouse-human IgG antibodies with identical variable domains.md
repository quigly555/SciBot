## Abstract
The basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans is a highly infective fungal pathogen with a worldwide distribution. The fungus is typically acquired by sexual mating, and its mating loci are subject to concerted evolutionary changes called mating-type (MAT) and sexual recombination. The mating locus (MAT) is comprised of two regions, one for each mating type. The MAT locus of C. neoformans is a meiotic patchwork of two regions, one containing the pheromone/receptor-mediated-synapton (mRNA) loci, and the other the pheromone/receptor-mediated-pheromone-associated locus (rALI). The rALI locus is subject to concerted evolutionary changes called evolutionary plus/minus selection, which resulted in the addition of a second locus (R1) and two arms (R2-R5) to the MAT locus. These results show that the rALI locus is subject to evolutionary plus/minus selection and is a transitory phase in C. neoformans mating between two regions with different mating types. Our results suggest that C. neoformans rALI is a transitory phase in sexual reproduction.


## Introduction
The emergence of drug resistance in microbial pathogens poses a serious threat to clinical microbiology laboratories. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which are resistant to multiple classes of drugs, has attracted attention in recent years due to their high rates of resistance to these drugs [1]. MDR bacteria are generally resistant to the previously described extended spectrum antibiotics, such as penicillin, amoxicillin, colistin, and cephalosporin, with the notable exception of amoxicillin. In addition, MDR bacteria have a wide array of mechanisms of resistance that enable them to spread rapidly from a susceptible host organism to a susceptible and biofilm-reducing environment [2].

Encapsulation, by means of an antibiotic, has been an important strategy in the treatment of various bacterial infections. Currently, the most common mechanism of encapsulation is the attachment of a small molecule carrier moiety of the antibiotic to the antibiotic molecule. This attachment requires the action of antibiotic, which usually disrupts the bacterial membrane and increases its permeability. In addition, the carrier moiety can spread to nearby surfaces or internal organs, or to adjacent cells in the body, causing tissue damage [3].

The evolution of resistance to the traditionally prescribed antibiotics is an enormous threat to the clinical practice of medicine. Drug resistance is the great challenge of modern medicine and it has the potential to devastate human health and the lives of people.


## Methods

DNA binding affinity assay
The binding of the ligands of each mouse-chicken IgY and IgG to mouse-chicken IgY was performed as described in the previous sectio. Briefly, the mouse-chicken IgY and IgG were washed with cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then diluted with a 10:1 ratio of the respective substrate in PBS. The amount of a specific IgY and IgG binding domain was determined by a commercially available fluorochrome-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgY (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) conjugate (pH 4.4) at a dilution of 1:2,000 (10:1) and a rabbit anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) conjugate (10:1) at a dilution of 1:2,000 (10:1) (the absorbance of the substrate) (a standard curve of the human IgY and IgG binding domain, as measured by the ÃŸ-actin fluorescence assay, was used to determine the bound IgY and IgG), followed by incubation with a specific rat IgG binding substrate (Roche, USA). The concentration of the substrate was determined by a commercially available fluorochrome-conjugated rat anti-rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) conjugate at a dilution of 1:2,000 (10:1). The concentration of the control substrate was 1 mM, and the absorbance of the substrate was read at 490 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000, BioTek, USA). The pH was adjusted to 7.5, and the samples were then analyzed in a Waters 4100 HPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA). The amount of a specific IgY and IgG binding domain was determined by a commercially available fluorochrome-conjugated rat anti-rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) conjugate (10:1) at a dilution of 1:2,000 (10:1) (the absorbance of the substrate).

## Discussion
By contrast, in a mammalian IgG2B IgG subclass containing the same variable domains (Fig 5a, b) and chimeric mouse-human IgG IgG2B IgG subclass (Fig 5c, d) (Fig 2b), no chimeric IgG2B IgG could be observed in the human IgG2B IgG (Fig 3b) and IgG2B IgG (Fig 4c) (Fig 3b. This was confirmed by studies with mammalian IgG IgG2B IgG (Fig 4c), which also contain the IgG2B chimeric domain (Fig 5b, c). The fact that the chimeric IgG2B IgG and IgG2B IgG could contain the same IgG2B domain (Fig 5b, c) indicated that the chimeric IgG subclass was a typical IgG subclass and that IgG2B IgG was responsible for the chimeric IgG2B IgG.

The IgG2B IgG subclass was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG, and the chimeric IgG2B IgG was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG. In addition, chimeric IgG3, IgG4 and IgG5 were also enriched in the chimeric IgG3 and IgG4 IgG. These chimeric IgG3 and IgG4 IgG were more sensitive to the thermostable binding to the mouse IgG2B IgG (Fig 2b) (Fig 5c).

The IgG2B IgG subclass was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG, and the chimeric IgG2B IgG was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG. These chimeric IgG2B IgG were more sensitive to the thermostable binding to the mouse IgG2B IgG (Fig 2b).

The IgG2B IgG was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG, and the chimeric IgG2B IgG was enriched in the chimeric IgG2B IgG. These chimeric IgG2B IgG were more sensitive to the thermostable binding to the mouse IgG2B IgG (Fig 2b) (Fig 5c).
