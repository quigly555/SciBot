## Abstract
Candida albicans has an extraordinary ability to escape macrophages and colonize the skin, lung, blood, or lungs, which in some cases are inhabited by “thrombotic” macrophages (TBM). TBM are heterozygous (U:M) for dendritic cells that are less immunocompetent and have significantly reduced genetic variation than normal TBM. TBM are resistant to multiple classes of antifungal drugs including fluconazole (FLZ), voriconazole (VCZ), caspofungin (CASP), and 5-fluorocytosine (FTCF). TBM are the most highly mutated TBM in the biology of human TBM. TBM can develop resistance to multiple antifungal drugs including FLZ, VCZ, FK506, voriconazole, and FK506, which confer resistance to fluconazole, voriconazole, and FK506. TBM are resistant to echinocandins, an emerging effector antifungal class of drugs. TBM are the most highly mutated TBM in the biology of human TBM, and resistance to these drugs has been previously demonstrated. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the genetic resilience of TBM, we previously performed genetic analyses of TBM and native TBM in response to fosmanogepix (FPG), a xenobiotic drug in the treatment of human and murine TBM. To gain insights into the genetic mechanisms that contributed to genetic resilieness of TBM, we performed genetic modeling of TBM and native TBM in response to fosmanogepix. The primary results reported here revealed that the number of TBM clones is significantly decreased in response to fosmanogepix. TBM and native TBM are significantly decreased in response to fosmanogepix.


## Introduction
While no gold standard therapy has been proposed, the use of several currently available antifungals, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, ha. Azoles are used in both routine therapy and for invasive aspergillosis, a life-threatening fungal infection that kills over one million people annually worldwide. Notably, the development of newer antifungals has been accompanied by the emergence of strains that display increased drug resistance, and strains that do not respond to all available antifungals, or are resistant to all known antifungal agents, are becoming increasingly rare.

The current gold standard of antifungal therapy is either a combination of the first-line antifungals with an appropriate antifungal agent and the appropriate azole drug [4]. However, azole drugs are associated with severe side-effects, including nephrotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity [5, 6]. The inevitable consequence of such adverse events is the development of drug resistance, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains [7]. This is particularly true for azole-resistant species, whose emergence has been accompanied by the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains [8, 9].

This phenomenon is referred to as echinocandin resistance. In a recent review, the echinocandin-resistance rate was found to be at an estimated 40% [10]. In addition, the emergence of azole-resistant strains was linked to the very limited number of azole antifungals that are currently available [11]. The increasing number of azole-resistant isolates is expected to further increase the need for further development of new antifungals [12, 13]. The development of new antifungal agents has been accompanied by the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains, which have been associated with echinocandin-based therapy.


## Methods

The FASTQ (http://ww.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/blastq) was used to search the NCBIs GenBank nucleotide database for the existence of common ancestral sequences in fungi. A BLAST search was performed for the homologous sequences of all available fungal sequences, and results were selected for further analysis.

In addition to the genome sequence of M. musculus and M. sympodialis, sequences from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were also included in the FASTQ search, as well as sequences from M. sympodialis, M. mycetomatis, M. sp. MPD, M. pulcherrima, and M. pulcherrima sensu stricto. The sequences were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm [28] using default parameters and the alignments were automatically corrected by manual adjustments.

The raw data were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the taxonomy assigned to each gene was assigned to its closest relative using the E-INS-i method [29].

Phylogenetic Analysis
To determine the evolutionary history of M. sympodialis, a DNA extract was used. The DNA was extracted using a MasterPure™ Yeast DNA purification kit (Epicentre, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

A model of the interaction between M. sympodialis and M. globosa was generated using the ProtTest (http://www.phi.harvard.edu/phylo/) program [30].

The phylogenetic trees were visualized using PyMOL v. 1.6 (http://pymol.org/). The software was run with the following settings: branch support (FBS), and tree length (TL).

The interactions were compared using the JTT (a-ketoglutarate) model [31] and the “M. sympodialis” model.

The evolutionary rates were compared using the MEGA 6 software [32].

## Results
Antifungal strategies in the last decades have focused on the development of new strategies for the treatment of fungal infection. Thus, we developed a novel approach to develop novel antifungal antifungal antifungal agents. The development of novel antifungal antifungal antifungal agents can be complicated by new patient factors, such as drug resistance, genetic incompatibility, or other factors that change the course of fungal infections. In this study, we used a multicenter, multicenter, multicenter, and multicenter model to develop novel antifungal antifungal agents. The development of novel antifungal antifungal agents can be complicated by new patient factors, such as drug resistance, genetic incompatibility, or other factors that change the course of fungal infections.


## Discussion
Both synthetic and natural antifungal drugs were highly effective against Fusarium species and were highly effective in vitro against Fusarium specie. However, the use of synthetic drugs, in combination with natural antifungal drugs, did not show any clear superiority over synthetic drugs in vitro against Fusarium species.

The use of synthetic antifungal drugs in combination with natural antifungal drugs, as well as in combination with natural antifungal drugs, showed no clear superiority over natural drugs in vitro against Fusarium species. The use of synthetic antifungal drugs, in combination with natural antifungal drugs, showed no clear superiority over natural drugs in vitro against Fusarium species.
