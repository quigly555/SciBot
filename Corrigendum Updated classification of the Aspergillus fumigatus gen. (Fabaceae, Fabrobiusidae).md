## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a deadly fungal pathogen responsible for a growing number of deaths among immunocompromised patients, including those infected with HIV, in the Western world. Cryptococcus neoformans, the major agent of cryptococcosis, is typically haploid, and its mating type is determined by two independent mating types (a and a). Recent studies in humans, however, have suggested that these mating types may be related, or at least distinct entities, to Cryptococcus gattii, which thus appears to have emerged as an emergent species. In this study, we analyzed the mating type loci of 23 isolates of the C. gattii mating type complex from HIV-infected patients across Western countries. Our results revealed a complex evolutionary ecology that emerged recently as a consequence of extensive sequencing and phenotypic variation. Our results shed new light on the emergent nature of the C. gattii mating type and suggest that the evolutionary history of this unique species may be running its course.

Invasive fungal infections kill more than 1.5 million people each year, with the majority of these infections occurring in HIV-infected patients in Africa and Southeast Asia. Cryptococcus gattii is the most common cause of adult meningitis in this hemisphere, and the mating type loci are relatively heteroplasastic. The mating type of C. gattii has not been studied in detail, but its mating type locus (MAT) is located at the very center of a cryptococcal complex, the maturing of a C. gattii genome and the emergence of an alternative mating type (a) that has recently emerged as an emergent species. Our study identifies novel mating types and identifies a lineage of C. gattii that emerged as a natural, highly adapted adaptation to its host and to the changing environment of daily life in its human host. The natural adaptation of C. gattii to its host and to its environs is a key step in the emergence of life in the host. The emergence of new infections from the environment of another human host, the host, is another key step in the adaptation of this fungus to its human hosts. The diversity of life-threatening infections caused by C. gattii, including those associated with AIDS, malaria, and the immune response, has been increasing over the last few decades.


## Introduction
as a separate genus and specie. The new name F. oxysporum was revised and introduced as F. oxysporum, with a short description. Changes were made in the name of F. oxysporum from older names such as ‘fumigatus’, ‘fumigatus-cum’ or ‘fumigatus-mania’.

A representative sampling of the distribution of Fusarium spp. on Fusarium plants in Portugal was collected recently (12). These surveys suggested that Fusarium spp. are distributed in many tropical and subtropical countries, including Spain, Colombia, Portugal, and Australia. Fusarium spp. in Brazil are mainly distributed in the north and south, and the species are often confused with other Fusarium spp. or other Fusarium spp. such as F. oxysporum, F. curcuminense, and F. oxysporum.

A taxonomic study on Fusarium spp. from Brazil was conducted (Câmara da Mata et al. 2017) using molecular data from the ITS and LSU rDNA operons, and generated a phylogenetic tree showing the distribution of the Fusarium spp. in the State of Paraíba (Portugal). The Brazilian fusariaceous plant hosts are predominantly F. oxysporum, F. curcuminense, and F. oxysporum-cum-fumigate. The most prevalent species of the genus are F. oxysporum-fumigate. Species in Fusarium oxysporum-fumigate are taxonomically distinct from those in Fusarium oxysporum-fumigatus, and some species are not distributed widely in Brazil. The genus Fusarium is characterized by long-lived, branched conidia, with thick-walled conidiophores, and by the presence of thick-walled hyphae. Fusarium oxysporum-fumigatus is monophyletic, with two subgroups within the group: F. oxysporum-fumigatus and F. oxysporum-cum-fumigatus. Molecular phylogenetic studies based on the LSU rDNA sequence data indicate that F. oxysporum-fumigatus is more closely related to F.


## Methods
The original classification of Aspergillus fumigatus was based on the mycelial morphology and small molecules present in mycelium of Aspergillus nidulans, which were associated with the germination of the myceliu. However, the new classification based on the mycelial morphology of Aspergillus nidulans was based on the spore germination pattern in mycelium. The new classification based on the spore germination pattern was based on the spore germinated from the mycelium and was based on the mycelial hyphae.

For the new classification based on the morphologies of Aspergillus nidulans, the spore germination pattern and spore germination pattern of Aspergillus nidulans were combined and the species classification was calculated using the Coda Score (Table 2) [27]. Spore germination was analyzed using a light microscope (MECH-300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded by using NIS elements AR 4.00 software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Morphology and morphological analysis of the fungi
The fungus was maintained on PDA slant agar (0.7% PDA, 1.6% agar, 1.6% malt extract, and 1.6% yeast extract) at 25°C. The fungal colony morphology was observed on PDA plates. The fungus was incubated at 25°C under aseptic conditions. The fungal structures were examined by light microscopy and examined in 3-D and electron microscopy.

A. fumigatus isolate D1/D2 and D3/D3 were used as negative control. The culture was grown on PDA slant agar at 25°C. The fungal isolate was incubated in PDB at 25°C. The fungal colonies were examined after 2-3 d of incubation at 25°C. The fungal colony size was measured using a digital camera (Tecan, Tecan Germany, Germany) and the colony diameter was measured.

The fungal isolates were cultured on PDA slant agar at 25°C. The fungal colony was examined after 2-3 d of incubation at 25°C.

## Discussion
2015) provides a comprehensive overview of the Aspergillus genus in order to better understand the evolutionary history of this genu. However, based on the limited sequence data, a new taxonomic status has been established based on the construction of seven new genera and three new species (de la Torre et al. 2018).

New species identification in Aspergillus-sporisces
The sequence of two new species, A. sp. (Fig 2) and A. sp. (Fig 3) are reported in the GenBank section of the Apiospermum complex, available at MycoBank. The former species was described from a patient with a type III sinusitis (U. faba) in Argentina. The latter species was described from a patient with a type I sinusitis (U. faba) in Greece (Grisdale et al. 2015). The type III sinusitis described by U. faba was a type III sinusitis that occurred in 100% of patients. The type III sinusitis that occurred in the USA was reported as the type III sinusitis in 50% of cases (Tatebayashi et al. 2012). Based on these two new species, two new species were described as A. sp. (Fig 2) and A. sp. (Fig 3) in the Apiospermum complex, respectively. Although these two species are morphologically similar, they occur in different geographic locations, and their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear.

The phylogenetic placement of these two new species, A. sp. and A. sp. (Fig 2) is currently unclear. However, the results of phylogenetic analyses are consistent with those of the previous three species, based on the phylogenetic species-level phylogenetic analyses of the S1 and S2 alignments (Pereira et al. 2017). In addition, the sequence of the newly described A. sp. (Fig 2) and A. sp. (Fig 3) is deposited in GenBank.

New species identification in A. fumigatus
The sequence of two new species, A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus (Fig 3) were reported in the Apiospermum complex, available at MycoBank. The former species was reported from an immunocompromised patient in Austria (Jäger and Günther 2018).
