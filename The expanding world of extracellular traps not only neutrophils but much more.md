## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected disease that has been gaining attention from public health professionals in the last years. However, there is still need for more PCM patients to be targeted for earlier diagnosis and treatment.

The aim of this study was to obtain an opinion on the best treatment for PCM, based on clinical experience and knowledge about the disease from various stakeholders, in order to improve the patient’s treatment and reduce the costs associated to the healthcare provider.

A total of 101 patients were included in this study, of whom 55% were male, 25% were females and 55% were children. The majority of the patients were treated with antifungal drugs (78% of the patients were treated with fluconazole [60%]) (Table 1).


## Introduction
The antifungal activity of vitamin D is often ascribed to its activity as a defensive product and not as an essential nutrient. The vitamin D biosynthetic enzyme, vitamin D receptor (DCR) is a subunit of the vitamin D receptor family [1].


## Methods

Cell culture
The . albicans strain, Pb18 was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37 °C for 24 h in a shaking incubator. The culture supernatant was then collected, and a 1:1 mixture of culture supernatant and culture media was added. The cell culture was centrifuged at 13000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were collected, washed, dried, and stored at -80 °C.

Transcriptional analysis
Total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit and treated with DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized using a RevertAid™ (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and oligo-dT primers. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX-96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the results were corrected for the standard error.

For the quantification of mRNA levels, RNA was isolated from yeast-like fungi using the RiboMinus™ Kit (Ambion, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and treated with DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to eliminate non-specific DNA contamination.


## Results
In addition to intracellular chlamydospheres, chlamydospheres also can trap fungi and other organism. Intracellular chlamydospheres are one of the most common extracellular traps found in nature [18], and they can be found in many fungi and bacteria, but not in mammals or yeasts. Intracellular chlamydospheres also trap fungi and other organisms, including bacteria and other eukaryotes.

Chlamydospheres are not only one of the most commonly found intracellular traps in nature, but also have been shown to be a very effective anti-fungal agent. In fact, they have been shown to be the most effective anti-fungal agents used by researchers, which may explain the increase in fungal resistance to the anti-fungal agents used in the present study.

The effect of chlamydospheres on the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans was evaluated in liquid cultures. The growth of the fungus was inhibited by 50% for 5 days at 30°C. The growth was also inhibited by 50% at 37°C and 50% at 50°C. The growth of C. neoformans was inhibited by 50% at 30°C at 5 days and 50% at 37°C at 3 days.

In addition, chlamydospheres also inhibited the growth of C. neoformans (Table 1). The growth of C.


## Discussion

Our results provide a first report of extracellular traps in a . neoformans and C. gattii species complex. We show that extracellular traps in C. neoformans are not only structurally similar to other fungi but also to a common lineage of fungi, including the closely related Candida albicans and Saccharomycetales spp. It is tempting to speculate that the fungal-fungal interaction may be similar in C. neoformans and C. gattii, but a fungal-fungal interaction is not. C. gattii is the most common human fungal pathogen, responsible for killing millions of infected individuals in the United States and Europe [41], [42]. It has been proposed that C. gattii is the only fungal pathogen to infect humans [42]. Here we provide the first evidence that fungal-fungal interactions are conserved in C. neoformans and C. gattii. We also show that C. gattii might be a better model for studying the interplay of fungal and fungal intracellular traps.

Our results provide the first evidence that fungal-fungal interactions are conserved in C. neoformans and C. gattii. We propose that C. neoformans and C. gattii are two distinct species that are genetically distinct. Our results show that C. neoformans-C. gattii interaction is very similar to that in C. albicans, C. neoformans-C. gattii interaction is very similar to that in C. albicans, and the presence of both species in C. neoformans is quite similar to that in C. albicans. These results are very interesting, since C. neoformans-C. gattii interaction is very similar to that in C. albicans, and C. neoformans-C. gattii interaction is very similar to that in C. neoformans. It is interesting to speculate whether C. gattii-C. neoformans-C. gattii interspecies interactions are similar or even more similar to the intraspecific interactions between C. neoformans and C. gattii.
