## Abstract
The mechanisms by which extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced in cells are not well understood. We here report that EVs from the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans drive the transformation of the yeast cell, as cells are considered to release large numbers of EVs (EVs/ml) upon cell fusion. EVs were only detected from hygrophilic cells and were not detected in cells treated with EVs/ml from cells lacking a known type of integron. EVs/ml from hygafmunoblasts were non-functional and were defective in two specific phenotypes: a high density-lipid glycoprotein (NLGYP) was released in the fusion capsule, which was defective in cells treated with EVs, and a low density-lipid glycoprotein (IL-35) in the hygaspical region. Our data suggest that EVs from C.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an emerging global health threat, and the number of confirmed cases of the disease is on the rise. ^1 The global TB incidence was estimated to be more than 2.4 million cases and 10 million deaths between 1980 and 2013, and the annual global health burden for 2015 was estimated to be US$ 57 billion. ^2

In South Africa, tuberculosis accounts for more than 70% of the total burden of tuberculosis in South Africa and more than half of these cases were caused by TB. ^3,4 In West and Central Africa, there is a high prevalence of TB in HIV-infected patients with HIV infection. ^5 The burden of HIV-associated TB is estimated to be over 100,000 cases and 2.5 million deaths in the country in 2015. ^6 This country has the highest HIV prevalence in the world and the highest rates of TB in Africa. ^7,8

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that in 2015 there were 11 million new cases and 23,700 deaths among HIV-infected patients in the world. ^9 In South Africa, approximately 50% of the HIV-infected patients in South Africa are diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is an AIDS-defining illness. ^10 The majority of these patients are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and most of them are diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa. ^11 In South Africa, approximately 80% of all HIV-infected patients in South Africa are diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.


## Methods
. Animal Isolates
The A. fumigatus strain ATCC 32069 was isolated from blood of a healthy human volunteer in the Bijou District of the French province of Alsace-Nesunde, France. The isolate was isolated in the Culture Collection of the Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Alsace-Nesunde (UF-Alsace-Nesunde). The patient was identified as M. (S) Bragouti and was identified as M. (D) Fontanay. The isolate was cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 28 °C.

2.2. Isolates
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The initial culture of A. fumigatus was grown at 28 °C in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 200 g/L.


## Results
 per 100 person-years (95%CI: .4-28.2). Overall mortality was 16.7 (95%CI: 3.6-75.0).

The overall mortality rate was 9.3 (95%CI: 2.2-27.1). In the animal model, mortality was 12.3 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 1.7-17.3).

The overall mortality rate was 23.3 (95%CI: 4.7-60.7) per 100 person-years.

Efficacy of eugenol and nifedipine in the development of cryptococcal meningitis
The efficacy of eugenol and nifedipine in the development of meningitis was evaluated. At 1 week, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 10 of the 14 patients. No clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 6 of 14 patients. In 5 patients, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in any of the 3 groups. There was a significant difference in the outcome between the groups. The overall mortality rate was 7.4 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 1.1-15.1).

Efficacy of nifedipine in the development of meningitis
At 1 week, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 6 of 14 patients. No clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 2 of 14 patients. In 3 patients, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in any of the 3 groups. No other clinical signs or symptoms were observed in the 2 groups. The overall mortality rate was 12.9 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 5.1-18.4).

Efficacy of siroconazole in the development of meningitis
At 1 week, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 10 of 14 patients. No clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 5 of 14 patients. No other clinical signs or symptoms were observed in the 2 groups. The overall mortality rate was 13.3 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 3.6-21.2).

Efficacy of a-amino-substituents on the development of meningitis
At 1 week, no clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 10 of 14 patients. No clinical signs or symptoms were observed in 6 of 14 patients.


## Discussion
The initial signs and symptoms of meningitis are usually indolent with only mild changes in the inflammatory respons. Some patients may show focal neurological deficits, such as paraplegia, seizures, and seizures can occur with very little clinical improvement [7]. The use of anticonvulsants is an alternative treatment for meningitis [8].

The patient with meningitis in our case did not present a fever and an ocular mass lesion. The patient was diabetic at presentation. All the patients with meningitis in our case had a history of diabetes mellitus. In addition, the patient with diabetes had no history of diabetes.

Fungal infections in humans include Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Pneumocystis jiroveci [9]. The patient in this case had a history of Histoplasma pneumonia and had a history of Candida pneumonia. The patient in this case had a history of Histoplasma pneumonia and had a history of Cryptococcus pneumonia. The patient in our case had a history of Cryptococcus pneumonia and had a history of Cryptococcus pneumonia.

In the course of infection, patients can also present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, cranial nerve palsies, and anemia [10]. The patient in our case had a history of cranial nerve palsies and cranial nerve palsies were present in this case.

The patients in our case had a history of traumatic brain injury and had a history of traumatic brain injury. The patient in our case had a history of traumatic brain injury and had a history of traumatic brain injury. The patient in our case had a history of traumatic brain injury and had a history of traumatic brain injury.

The patient in our case had a history of multiple sclerosis and had a history of multiple sclerosis. The patient in our case had a history of multiple sclerosis and had a history of multiple sclerosis. The patient in our case had a history of multiple sclerosis and had a history of multiple sclerosis. The patient in our case had a history of multiple sclerosis and had a history of multiple sclerosis. The patient in our case had a history of multiple sclerosis and had a history of multiple sclerosis.
