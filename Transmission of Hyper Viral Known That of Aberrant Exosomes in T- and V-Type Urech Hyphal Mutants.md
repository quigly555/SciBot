## Abstract
The Sanger Assessment of Bipolaris sorokiniana Heffernanose (CSB) is the first report to evaluate the antifungal activities of this plant species in the antifungal susceptibility assessment of this plant species. This study is a step towards the detailed characterization of the antifungal mechanism of action of this plant species.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immunity [1]. The most common fungal pathogens, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis, cause as many as 8 million life-threatening infections each year worldwide [2,3]. Despite the availability of antifungal agents, mortality from ILD is not significantly reduced in patients with impaired immunity [4,5].

One of the most significant risk factors for the development of ILD is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [6,7]. IRIS is characterized by the alteration of self-control, characterized by an increased ability to mount effective immune responses against invading pathogens, but ultimately is associated with the alteration of immune responses to these invaders. The syndrome is characterized by the alteration of immune responses to invading pathogens, with a leading characteristic being the increase of inflammatory responses to invading pathogens [8]. In both human and animal models of ILD, immune reconstitution inflammatory reactions (IRIS) have been associated with the alteration of immune function and dysregulation of host defense mechanisms [9,10].


## Methods
The lysates were prepared as previously described (Korner et a., 2005). The virulent and nonvirulent mice were obtained from the BALB/c breeding colony, and the wild-type mice were obtained from the BALB/c breeding colony. The cells of the wild-type mice were grown on YPD (0.67% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30°C, and then washed twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml. The cells were then diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml in sterile water. The cell suspension was plated on YPD agar. The number of colony forming units (CFU) was determined after incubation for 7 days at 30°C. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

In the histopathology assays, BALB/c female mice (weight: 20 to 22 g) were used for the histopathological analysis of the virulent and nonvirulent mice, respectively. The mice were divided into four groups: i) Untreated (control), i.e., infected mice were infected with hyphal forms of the pathogenic hyphae, and ii) Uninfected (uninfected). The mice were sacrificed after 24 h and the mice were sacrificed at 72 h after the infection. The mice were humanely euthanized and the organs were weighed. The histopathology was performed with the help of a dissecting microscope. The animals were observed with a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse TE-m1) and an Axiocam MRM digital camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).

Histopathology analysis
Histopathology was performed on the hindbrain and right side of the left lobe of the hindbrain. The brain was fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Sweden) for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 µm, using a surgical blade. The tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Sweden).


## Results
maydis strain H99 are largely devoid of intracellular vesicles, and the T- and V-type Urechs of . maydis are found in the vicinity of the vacuole (20). Therefore, we examined whether T- or V-type Urechs are produced by the T- and V-type Urechs of U. maydis. To test the hypothesis that T- and V-type Urechs may be present in the T- or V-type Urechs of U. maydis, we made the T- or V-type Urech strains P2 and P3, respectively. After washing the T- and V-type Urech strains with PBS, they were lysed and then lysed again for 10 min to remove the lysed T- or V-type Urech strains. We did not observe any visible difference in the number of T- and V-type Urech cells in the P2 or P3 strains when lysed (Fig 1A). However, the numbers of T- and V-type Urech cells in the P2 and P3 strains were not significantly different (p = 0.27; Fig 1B). However, the numbers of T- and V-type Urech cells in the P2 and P3 strains were significantly different when lysed (Fig 1B).

To test whether T- and V-type Urech cells can be detected in the T- or V-type Urechs of T. islandicus, the T- or V-type Urech strains were lysed and then lysed again for 10 min to remove the lysed T- or V-type Urech strains. After washing the T- or V-type Urech strains, we observed a total of three T- or V-type Urech cells in the P2 and P3 strains, and three T- or V-type Urech cells in the P2 and P3 strains (Fig 1C). However, no T- or V-type Urech cells were detected in the P2 and P3 strains when lysed (Fig 1C).


## Discussion
We first examined hypervirulence between the two Urech types and discovered that the hypervirulence was independent of hypermutation and that hypermutation resulted in hypervirulence of both Urech type. Next, we examined hypervirulence between V-type Urech cells that had been genetically differentiated and re-introduced to the mating type chromosome. We found that both V-type Urech cells were hypervirulent in comparison with the other Urech types and that V-type Urech cells had a larger size chromosome than the other two Urech types. Additionally, hypervirulence was more prominent in V-type Urech cells than in V-type Vch cells. We then looked at the relationship between hypervirulence and virulence in a T- and V-type Urech cell. We found that the hypervirulence of both T- and V-type Vrech cells was independent of hypermutation. However, hypervirulence was more prominent in V-type Vch cells with a larger chromosome than in V-type Vch cells with a smaller chromosome. In contrast, V-type Vch cells were hypervirulent in comparison to V-type Vrech cells with a smaller chromosome. Finally, we examined hypervirulence in V-type Urech cells with both V-type Urech cells and V-type Vch cells with V-type Urech cells. We found that V-type Vch cells were hypervirulent in comparison to V-type Urech cells with V-type Vrech cells. These results suggest that hypervirulence in T- and V-type Urech cells is not an independent property of hypermutations or V-type Vch cells have an enlarged chromosome than in V-type Vrech cells.

Preliminary analysis of the genome structure of the T- and V-type Urech cells and V-type Vch cells revealed that the hypervirulence of both V-type Urech and V-type Vch cells is independent of hypermutation. This is further supported by the results that V-type Urech cells had a larger chromosome than V-type Vch cells.
