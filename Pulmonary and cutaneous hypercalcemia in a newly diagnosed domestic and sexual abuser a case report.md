## Abstract
Fungal disease affects nearly all vertebrates, and therefore, invertebrates need to be constantly vigilant against fungal attack. In this study, we identified and characterized a new regulator of the mycobiome in the mycobiome of the brown alga Ectocarpus konstantinosus. Disruption of the mycobiome led to profound changes in the mycoflora including the mycotoxin and mycotoxin-producing fungi. A new phosphorylated protein, PIX3, is essential for controlling the mycoflora including the mycotoxin-producing fungi and mycotoxin- inhibiting and antagonistic bacteria. Interestingly, the phosphorylated protein was also essential for the growth of the mycoflora and antagonistic fungi, suggesting a novel target for future research for these mycoflora. Interestingly, we found that the fungal polyketide phosphate pathway is also regulated by the mycoflora and that this contributes to the mycoflora-mycotoxin response. Furthermore, the effects of the mycotoxin on the growth of the mycoflora and antagonistic fungi were also evident by the production of toxic polyketide compounds. Our results demonstrate that the mycoflora depend on PIX3 as a novel regulator of the mycoflora and of the antagonistic fungi.


## Introduction
Infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised population, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or those with experimental candidiasis [1-4]. P. aeruginosa colonizes the skin, mucosal surfaces and other organs and develops in the form of a biofilm in the environment, which can grow and divide in various physiological and pathological conditions. It is often found in the environment in small quantities in bird droppings, rotting vegetables, decaying woods, soil, and soil contaminated by insects, and decaying wood [5,6]. It is a ubiquitous pathogen and the most common fungal pathogen in nosocomial skin infections. In the past, it was believed that the presence of P. aeruginosa in the environment was not necessarily associated with its virulence; however, this notion has been challenged by the success of several studies showing that P. aeruginosa is not only pathogenic to the skin but also a commensal of the human skin [7,8]. In fact, P. aeruginosa has been shown to be a commensal of the skin of humans and the epidermis of animals [9].

The host immune response to P. aeruginosa is largely controlled by the complement system [10,11]. In general, the body's innate immune system recognizes P. aeruginosa to produce the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are activated upon P. aeruginosa recognition. The PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [12-14]. The recognition of P. aeruginosa by TLR2 or TLR4 is initiated by the recognition of the bacterial cell wall component ÃŸ-(1-3)-glucan.


## Methods

Case definition and morphological study
Tuberculosis was characterized according to the standard microbiological methods [11. The patient was classified into three groups based on the clinical features and laboratory findings: (1) healthy; (2) severely and (3) severely malignant.

The diagnosis of tuberculosis was based on the clinical findings and laboratory findings. The diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis included: (1) confirmed and (2) probable.

Gastrointestinal infection was defined as bacterial peritonitis (bacterial peritonitis) or peritonitis of the tracheal endometrium, esophageal endometrial bleeding, chest radiography or in situ peritonitis of the tracheal endometrium, esophageal endometrial bleeding, chest radiography or in situ peritonitis of the tracheal endometrium.

For the diagnosis of CNS infection, the diagnostic criteria used were (1) probable, (2) non-fatal and (3) non-tragic.

Histopathology
Histopathology was performed using standard methods [12].

Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Use (CEUA-CEUA-02/23) of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, and was performed according to the Declaration of Animal Rights of the Declaration of Helsinki by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Federal University of KwaZulu-Natal (UFU-KRZU) [13].

Parasites
K. pneumoniae was isolated from a patient in whom P. pneumoniae was present and clinically confirmed in the laboratory [14]. The isolate was subcultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) (Merck, Germany) to obtain K. pneumoniae suspension. For the determination of immunosuppression, the isolate was subcultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Merck, Germany) to obtain K. pneumoniae suspension. The assay was carried out with the following modifications: one tube of the assay was used for the inoculum dilution with sterile distilled water to obtain K. pneumoniae suspension.


## Results
.N. Kaminsky) [45]. When the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were absent in the newborn, we continued our study. Although the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were improved after exposure to 0.25 mg/kg V8 and 0.2 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were a combination of low blood glucose (5-10 g/L) and fever (hyperglycemia), and it was not possible to determine the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia after exposure to 0.25 mg/kg V8 and 0.2 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, and a combination of low serum glucose (5-10 g/L) and fever (hyperglycemia). However, the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were improved with 0.2 mg/kg V8 and 0.2 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg, the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were improved with 0.25 mg/kg V8 and 0.2 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg, and the clinical signs of pulmonary hypercalcemia were improved with 0.2 mg/kg V8 and 0.2 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg V8/0.25 mg/kg V8/0.5 mg/kg V8/0.
