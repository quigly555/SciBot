## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are life-threatening but under-recognized complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of Amphotericin B, Voriconazole and Voricon-sulbactam (VPZs) against a panel of 15 isolates of clinically relevant SLE, 5 isolates of non-SLE and 3 isolates of SLE of the etiologic agents Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Cryptococcus neoformans. Amphotericin B, Voriconazole and Voricon-sulbact (VPZs) were tested as well as voriconazole and amphotericin B alone, alone and in combination with fluconazole, itraconazole or caspofungin against the 15 isolates and 5 SLE of the etiologic agents. Amphotericin B and voriconazole were tested as well as caspofungin and flucytosine.


## Introduction
Wood is a complex mixture of organic materials (mostly organic matter) that are often used as building materials for processing a variety of foods and beverages (Nijman et a., 2017). In recent years, a number of new natural products have been isolated from plants grown in forested areas (Dhillon et al., 2014). The conversion of wood to bio-synthetic compounds has been widely applied in various applications including chemical industries, including pulp and paper industry, pulp and paper manufacturing, and bioethanol and biofuels. Among these new natural products, natural products from plants are still mainly obtained from plant biomass (Nijman et al., 2017).

Among the main natural products from plant biomass, endophytic fungi, which belong to the genera Epiphynum, Mucor, and Phialophora have attracted considerable attention due to their significant economic and scientific benefits, including potential as plant growth promoters and bio-synthetic compounds (Dhillon et al., 2014). Endophytic fungi are members of the family Diaporthales and are abundant in the leaves and stems of many plants (Jin et al., 2016). These fungi are known to produce a variety of bioactive compounds and natural products, including growth promoting bio-synthesizers and antagonistic compounds, which have important applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and physical industries (Jin et al., 2016). Among these natural products, endophytic fungi are mainly obtained from dead leaves or stems. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce specific compounds, which are active against their host plant and therefore, promote the plant growth (Dhillon et al., 2014).

In the past two decades, the number of natural products obtained from wood has increased enormously. The number of synthetic products obtained from wood has increased by more than 50% (Chaudhary et al., 2016). According to the World Resources Report (World Resources Report 2016), more than 10,000 bio-synthesizers have been obtained since 2000. The plant growth promotion products obtained from wood have been divided into more than 50 categories (Figure 1). Among these, glucosinolates and polysaccharides, which are glucosinolates, have been obtained from wood (Jin et al., 2016).


## Methods
The participants were screened for the following reasons: (i) they are eligible for the study; (ii) they have shown the ability to participate in research in a relevant field of interest; (iii) they have shown the ability to participate in research in a research settin. The participants were randomly selected from the five sites in China in order to be randomly chosen from the five sites. All participants provided their informed consent for their participation in research. All participants gave written informed consent for the study in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki.

In order to ensure that the study did not introduce bias, the participants were asked to complete three quantitative surveys (Q1, Q2, and Q3) after taking the time to write the responses. In order to provide a balanced data set, one question was needed to identify the interest groups of the participants, and one question to identify the limitations of the study. The Q1 and Q2 groups were randomized to allow for a balanced data set; the Q3 and Q3 groups were randomized to allow for a balanced data set; and the Q4 and Q4 groups were randomized to allow for a balanced data set. In order to identify the methodological aspects of the study, the data set was divided into five main types.

The qualitative survey asked participants to complete an online questionnaire. The qualitative survey asked them to complete an online questionnaire. The research was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the National Institute of Biotechnology (NIB) and of the Agricultural Research Service of China (IRB: Investigation of Research Integrity of Research).

After the completion of the questionnaire, the participants were asked to write a brief note to the next researcher (Q1). The next researcher was the primary investigator. The next researcher was the one who completed the questionnaire. The next researcher was the third researcher. The next researcher was the first researcher. The third researcher was the last researcher. The third researcher was the third researcher. The next researcher was the last researcher. The last researcher was the first researcher. The last researcher was the last researcher.

The study was conducted with the participants in the five participating sites.


## Results
oryzae and . cinerea and found no significant differences in gene expression between the two fungi. To examine the possible association of B. cinerea and B. cinerea in the B. cinerea genome, we performed a Blastp analysis using the B. cinerea gene sequence as a query. The B. cinerea gene has a predicted coding region of 11 bp and the B. cinerea gene has a predicted 5'-UTR of 35 bp (Table 2). The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the genes encoding ribosomal protein, nucleosome and translation machinery (Table 1). The B. cinerea gene had 2,047 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B. cinerea gene had 2,372 bp of predicted GPDs. The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the gene encoding GPD-binding protein (Table 2). The B. cinerea gene had 1,224 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B. cinerea gene had 2,412 bp of predicted GPDs. The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the gene encoding the nuclear factor (Nfp), nucleosome and translation machinery (Table 2). The B. cinerea gene had 1,236 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B. cinerea gene had 2,094 bp of predicted GPDs. The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the gene encoding the cytoplasmic protein (Table 2). The B. cinerea gene had 1,306 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B. cinerea gene had 2,192 bp of predicted GPDs. The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein (Table 2). The B. cinerea gene had 1,148 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B. cinerea gene had 2,811 bp of predicted GPDs. The most highly expressed gene in B. cinerea was the gene encoding the zinc finger protein (Table 2). The B. cinerea gene had 1,103 bp of predicted CDSs, and the B.


## Discussion
However, Candida species have a wide range of host range, and are often resistant to numerous antimicrobial agents, including amphotericin B, itraconazole, and caspofungin (1. For several of these species, the use of antimicrobial agents is increasingly important, and so a different approach is required. In this study, we used a noninvasive method, i.e., i.v. transformation of monocultures, to evaluate the effect of different C. albicans strains on the growth of C. albicans.

Our results show that a C. albicans strain isolated from bamboo in this study, C18.20, increases the growth of C. albicans in the presence of fluconazole, and it also increased the susceptibility of C. albicans to caspofungin, and it also increased the MICs of fluconazole, a standard drug for the treatment of candidemia.

The results of this study showed that C. albicans strain C18.20 is susceptible to fluconazole, a standard drug for the treatment of candidemia. The results of this study also indicated that a C. albicans strain isolated from P. berghei in Taiwan, was resistant to caspofungin, a standard drug for the treatment of candidemia. This study also showed that C. albicans strain was resistant to fluconazole, a standard drug for the treatment of candidemia.

The use of a noninvasive method to evaluate the effect of different strains of C. albicans in the treatment of Candida infection was proposed in the previous section. In this study, we found that the fluconazole treatment in this C. albicans strain increased the growth of C. albicans in the presence of fluconazole, but the results of this study also showed that fluconazole treatment did not increase the activity of the antimicrobial peptide, the antifungal peptide.

The results of this study showed that a C. albicans strain isolated from C. albicans in this study, C18.20, increases the growth of C. albicans in the presence of fluconazole, and it also increased the susceptibility of C.
