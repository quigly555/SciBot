## Abstract
A prospective study was performed to evaluate the clinical response to efavirenz (EFV) in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) by determining the incidence and mortality rates of different response rates. Patients were prospectively included in the study group and received EFV therapy within 7 days of diagnosis of PC. The study included 46 patients who were diagnosed with PC by clinical and laboratory criteria. The study included included 20 patients who were hospitalized and 9 patients who were not diagnosed with PC by clinical and laboratory criteria. The study group included 41 patients who were receiving antifungal therapy. The study group included 41 patients who were receiving fluconazole therapy. The study group included 40 patients who were receiving other antifungals. The study group included 11 patients who were not diagnosed with PC by clinical and laboratory criteria. The study group included 11 patients who were hospitalized. The study group included 5 patients who were not diagnosed with PC by clinical and laboratory criteria. These patients were analyzed as follows: 1) histomorphs of Cryptococcus neoformans in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by molecular and immunohistochemical methods, and 1) the immunohistochemical finding of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection in the CSF (IH) and in the blood.


## Introduction
The family Toxoplasma are obligate blood coagulants with a wide range of genomes, known as the mosquito vector, in which they can infect a variety of vertebrates, including humans, horses, cats, and domestic pigs (Singh and Ramakrishnan, 2006; Khan et al., 2009; Zumsteg et al., 2015). The parasite is carried in the blood stream and transmits directly to the lymph nodes via the lymphangiectasia, a form of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and subsequently to the draining lymph nodes, where it is taken up by phagocytic cells and released into the circulation where it remains for further dissemination (Al-Maqtoofi et al., 2011). There, it can parasitize most tissues, including placenta, colon, skin, heart, liver, and prostate gland (Jansons and Boukal, 2015). During infection, the parasite can breach the innate and adaptive immunity, causing a wide range of inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, allergic diseases, and hypertension, which in turn lead to significant morbidity and mortality (Al-Maqtoofi et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2009; Zumsteg et al., 2015).

As an intracellular parasite, the parasite can survive within the cell of its host for a long time. As a facultative intracellular bacterial, the pathogen can replicate in extracellular or intracellularly, and the cell can survive and replicate in the extracellular environment. The intracellular life cycle of Toxoplasma is initiated when the parasite surface is ruptured. The free-living form of Toxoplasma enters the extracellular environment by secretory vesicles (EVs) (Kasumi and Kubo, 2010; Kubo, 2012). Vesicles are formed by the interaction of a prolyl hydroxyl hydroxyl and a sugar hydroxyl with the endo-membrane protein Fpr5, which in turn enters the extracellular environment, where it is transported to the intracellular niche (Sharma et al., 2009).


## Methods
Reagents and reagents
All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Saint Louis, MO, USA). The reagent cocktail was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Isolation of secreted proteins
Cell-free supernatants were obtained by passing through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Proteins were purified by centrifugation (10,000× g, 5 min) and then stored at -80°C until use. For DNA purification, proteins were extracted from cell-free supernatants by a different method. The supernatants were concentrated to 0.5 g with ammonium sulfate and the organic phase was dialyzed against 1 mL of MilliQ water and the dialysate was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The supernatants were concentrated to 0.


## Results
The mortality rate in the ICU was 1.7% (0/20) at 24 weeks and 26.4% (0/26) at 48 weeks. All the patients were in the ICU at the end of the observation period, with the median survival time being 8 days (IQR: 9-17 days) [30]. We further evaluated the impact of diagnosis by assessing the median survival time at presentation.

The median survival time at presentation for these patients was 15 days (IQR: 3-21 days) [30]. We observed no difference in the median survival time between the cases with A1 type and those with the C1 type. We did not observe differences in the median survival time between the cases with C1 type and those with the C2 type. However, our analysis revealed a difference in the median survival time between the patients with A1 type and those with the C2 type. The median survival time was 17 days (IQR: 6-20 days) in the ICU from the day 3 of the observation period (9-24 days) in the ICU from the day 1 of the observation period (24-28 days) in the patients with C1 type.

A1-type and C1-type cryptococcal meningitis
We did not observe a difference in the median survival time between the patients with A1 type and those with C1 type. However, we observed a difference in the median survival time between the patients with A1 type and those with C1 type. These findings are consistent with the finding that cryptococcal meningitis can be fatal. In a follow-up study, we found that cryptococcal meningitis was significantly more common in the patients with a C1 type than in those with a C2 type (P < 0.05) [31].

The median survival time was 10 days (IQR: 6-14 days) in the ICU from the day 3 of the observation period (9-12 days) in the patients with a C1 type. We observed no difference in the median survival time between the patients with C1 type and those with C2 type. However, we observed a difference in the median survival time between the patients with C1 type and those with C2 type.


## Discussion
The deacetylation of the PgPDB (PDB1) is important for its functional and cellular function. This is in line with the description of T. cruzi, in which the PgPDB1 is deacetylated to the Asn-Cys residue [15]. The PgPDB1 is an O-methylated deacetylated PgPDB1 with the phenyl group forming the PgPDB1-5 residue [13]. This is similar to the role of the PgPDB1 in Leishmania species, where the PgPDB1 plays a role in the virulence of these species [14]. In addition, the role of PgPDB1 in the pathogenesis of Leishmania spp. has been observed [15]. Moreover, PgPDB1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of many pathogenicity factors, including cytokines and chemokines [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Therefore, the function of PgPDB1 in Leishmania infection appears to be related to virulence and virulence.
