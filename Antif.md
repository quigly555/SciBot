## Abstract
In this study, the in vitro antifungal activity of amphotericin B (AMB) and fluconazole (FLC) against a range of pathogenic yeasts, filamentous fungi and other primarily Ascomycetes were evaluated. The results showed that AMB was more effective than FLC in inhibiting yeast compared to ATC. AMB also better than FLC was able to improve the activity of amphotericin against Aspergillus spp. In particular, AMB was more effective than FLC against dermatophytes compared to other Aspergillus spp. with phenotypic alterations. Furthermore, the results showed that the combination of AMB and FLC with high doses was able to improve the activity of FLC against A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. terreus, especially against A. niger. Additionally, the combination of AMB and FLC with high doses caused toxicity and decreased cell integrity. The results of the present study suggest that AMB and FLC could be considered as potential broad-spectrum antifungal agents against yeasts and filamentous fungi, with a potential wide spectrum of therapeutic potentials.


## Introduction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, mainly in the pediatric population. However, in the elderly, the incidence of COPD has been increasing, and is currently estimated to be 2.5-3.6 million cases annually, and approximately one-third of patients have pulmonary fibrosis [1].

A large number of studies have investigated the association between asthma and COPD, with a few studies reporting on the association between asthma and COPD [2,3,4,5]. However, the association between asthma and COPD is not well understood, and data about the association between asthma and COPD are lacking. Herein, we report a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that was diagnosed in the elderly population.


## Methods
albicans strain ATCC 76685 was used as a control in this stud. For susceptibility testing, 100 µL of the suspensions were mixed with 20 µL of an antifungal drug solution, and then mixed well using a sterile pipette. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h, and then 100 µL of solution containing 0.2% of sterile water was added to each well. The results of MIC values were read after 24 h. All the assays were repeated in triplicate.

C. albicans cell wall analysis
C. albicans strains were cultured on YPD at 30 °C for 24 h, then inoculated into 100 ml of YPD broth, and then incubated at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended at the concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The cell wall contents were harvested by centrifugation, and the suspensions were adjusted to 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL. Serial dilutions of the suspensions were plated on YPD agar, and the plate was incubated at 30 °C for 48 h.

C. albicans conidial suspension and stress response assays
C. albicans conidia were inoculated into 100 ml of liquid YPD broth and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and then collected by centrifugation. Total cellular conidial counts were done by counting the number of conidia in each well, and the number of conidia in each strain. The assay was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The inoculated and untreated yeast cells were treated identically.

C. albicans cell wall analysis
Conidia were harvested and washed with sterile PBS, and then resuspended in sterile PBS. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and then adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^7 CFU/ml. The cell wall contents were harvested by centrifugation, and the suspensions were adjusted to 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL. A serial dilution of the suspensions was plated on YPD agar, and the plate was incubated at 30 °C for 48 h.

## Results
Identification of Mycobacterial Species
A total of 739 fungal OTUs were identified in the samples, of which 745 were from the air and the soil (Table 1). In addition, 41 OTUs were identified from the soil by both methods. The average number of OTUs per sample was 52.6 (Table 1). The results of the analysis are presented in Table 1.

Cloning and Sequence Analysis
The ITS2-FLP hybrid sequence showed that the fungal ITS sequences of the samples belonged to 41 fungal OTUs. Each fungal OTU was identified by the two methods using the same primer and sequencing results (Fig 1). The ITS sequences of the mycobacterial OTUs were found to be clustered together with the ITS sequences of the ITS sequences of the other fungi (Fig 2). The fungal ITS sequences of the ITS sequences of the other fungi were found to be clustered together with the ITS sequences of the other fungi (Fig 2).


## Discussion
The antimicrobial activity of . expansum against C. neoformans was very strong. The MIC values against C. albicans were ranged from 8.2 mg/ml to 250 mg/ml. The MIC values against C. neoformans ranged from 2.3 mg/ml to 18.1 mg/ml and the MIC values against C. neoformans ranged from 0.04 mg/ml to 1.25 mg/ml. MIC values against C. guilliermondii were similar to those reported by Babesini et al. [12]. The MIC values against C. guilliermondii were also higher than those reported by Babesini et al. [12] and less than those reported by Babesini et al. [12].

P. expansum PbsA was found to be active against P. expansum, a major pathogen of fruit bats and bark beetles in Europe [25]. PbsA was also active against P. expansum in vitro and in the wild. The MIC values for P. expansum against P. expansum were 4.2 µg/ml and 12.5 µg/ml, respectively. This is similar to the values reported by Babesini et al. [12] and is in line with the values reported by Babesini et al. [12] who also showed that P. expansum was a potential source of antifungal compounds.

P. expansum was found to be resistant to azole antifungal drugs. This is in line with other studies in which it was found to be resistant to azole antifungal drugs [26]. The MIC values for P. expansum against P. expansum were also lower than those reported by Babesini et al. [12].

The antifungal activity of P. expansum was similar to that of other azole antifungal drugs. This is in line with the findings of other studies in which the MIC values of P. expansum against P. expansum were lower than those reported by Babesini et al. [12].

The MIC values for P. expansum against P. expansum were also higher than those reported by Babesini et al. [12].
