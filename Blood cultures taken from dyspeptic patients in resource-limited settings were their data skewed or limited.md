## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina is an important food insect and food-producer for many industrial applications. To understand the genetic basis of regulation of sexual reproduction and development in this fungus, we analyzed a subunit of Mucor circinelloides (Mucor necrolata) in order to gain insights into its genome control using its promoter sequences. We also compared Mucor gene structure with the genome size of its opportunistic pathogen, Penicillium spp.

Conserved and expressed genes were identified in all Mucor strains analyzed, but distinct patterns of differentiation were observed in some cases. The Mucor genome sequences showed high similarity with known pathogen regulators but showed little similarity with those of other fungal pathogens. The genetic structure of the P. spp. chromosomes was similar to that of other fungi and the gene sequences were similar to those of bacteria. This suggests that distinct genetic mechanisms are involved in regulating the organization of the chromosomes in Mucor necrolata compared to other Mucor species. Strikingly, we found the gene sequences of a P. spp. isolate in concordance with the genome size of the closely related species Cryptococcus neoformans. The genomic organization of Mucor necrolata was similar to that of other fungi. Interestingly, we found no similarities in the genes encoding transposases and in promoters of sex-related and non-sex-related genes among the P. spp. chromosomes.

Comparative analyses of the Mucor genome sequences suggest that the genetic architecture of the necrotrophic pathogen is similar to that of other fungal pathogens and that its regulation is connected to a conserved regulatory circuit. The similarity in the P. spp.


## Introduction
Fungi are the leading cause of human infections and are estimated to cause more than 1.5 million deaths annually [1]. Fungal diseases are considered to be among the most complex and life-threatening diseases. Despite the availability of adequate treatments, mortality from invasive fungal infections is associated with mortality rates as high as 50-80% [2]. The mortality rate of invasive fungal infections is much higher than the mortality associated with bacterial and viral infections [3]. Moreover, the number of infections caused by fungi with drug resistance is increasing rapidly [4]. Although the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is crucial to the outcome of the disease, inadequate treatment is a major obstacle to clinical treatment. This is especially true for invasive fungal infections, which are often fatal if not promptly diagnosed [5].

The importance of fungi as pathogens in the complex interplay between human and animal health has long been evident [6,7]. Fungi are known to cause diseases that are associated with a broad range of clinical manifestations, including skin, soft tissue, oral, and vaginal infections [6]. Fungi have been reported to be a source of many infectious diseases, including respiratory, cutaneous, and systemic infections, in immunocompromised patients. In fact, immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to fungal infections [8]. Fungal infections are caused by a range of species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis [9]. In fact, Candida, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis fungi are the most common fungi isolated from the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals, whereas the number of other species in the body such as from the soil, birds, and mammals are relatively few [10].

We report a case of an immunocompromised patient with onychomycosis, which was diagnosed early and treated with empiric therapy. The patient was found to have onychomycosis and treated with corticosteroids. After the empiric therapy, the patient was successfully treated with fluconazole and oral itraconazole.

## Results
The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be .1% (95% CI: 1.4-45.6%). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.1% (95% CI: 0.6-1.1%), which was similar to the incidence in the population of the same size population (0.8%). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.6-0.5%). The incidence of meningitis in the rural area was estimated to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-0.8%). However, the incidence of meningitis in the urban area was estimated to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.5-1%). The incidence of meningitis in the rural region was estimated to be 0.1% (95% CI: 0.2-1%). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.5-1%). The incidence of meningitis in the urban area was estimated to be 0.1% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) and the incidence of meningitis in the urban area was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) (Table 1). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.1% (95% CI: 0.3-0.9%) (Table 2).

The incidence of meningitis in India was estimated to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) and the incidence of meningitis in the urban area was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) (Table 3). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) and the incidence of meningitis in urban India was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.5-1%) (Table 4). The incidence of meningitis in rural India was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.


## Discussion
We were able to collect information about patients' travel history, clinic and HIV statu. However, some of these patients were in the same clinic where the patient was receiving care and our data was not sufficient to assess the risk of infection. We also used a single center in the same location to collect data on patient status. We also did not collect HIV status information, which is a common feature of HIV in HIV-uninfected patients [15]. This could have been a source of bias, and in-patients may have been mistakenly enrolled in care. In our study, patients were excluded from care because of their HIV status. However, all patients were likely to have been discharged from the hospital in a timely fashion and their case was not reviewed by the carer. We also did not collect the patient’s clinical information and we did not collect any patient-level information on the patient’s health status.

We also used two non-targeted assays for the measurement of the risks of infection: blood cultures and RNA. Blood cultures have been used in HIV-uninfected patients in the past, but this has not been performed in a large cohort of patients. In this study, blood cultures were performed in the presence of a positive blood culture in 4 patients. Blood cultures were performed in all patients with an infection, but only in two patients. We did not perform blood cultures in the presence of another infection. This is likely because the patient had a previous history of infection with Cryptococcus, which may have been acquired by the patient's previous travel. In this study, the patient’s blood cultures were not collected in the presence of a positive blood culture. Therefore, blood cultures in the presence of a positive blood culture are not possible in this patient.

We also used two other assays, which were not available in this study. Blood cultures were performed in the presence of a negative blood culture in 4 patients. Blood cultures were performed in the presence of a positive blood culture in 2 patients. The patients were likely to have been discharged from the hospital in a timely fashion and their case was not reviewed by the carer. Blood cultures in the presence of a negative blood culture in 1 patient were not performed. The patient’s blood cultures were not collected in the presence of a positive blood culture in 1 patient. Thus, blood cultures are not possible in this patient.
