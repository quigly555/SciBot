## Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are classically expressed proteins with diverse functions. They are effective at preventing the decay of microbial biofilms by disrupting membrane fusion and assembly, and they are effective at preventing the growth of plant cell walls. To date, the main mechanism of AMP biosynthesis in land plants, mainly by mutual interaction between soil- and plant-borne bacteria, is poorly understood. Our previous study, by using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol, showed that the frequency of the ‘ancient’ AMP protein Pb01 (now classified as Malthous) is gradually increasing, while that of Pb18 (Pbfalse) was probably in decline.


## Introduction

The pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans va. grubii in humans is unknown [8]. In addition, the pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans in humans is unknown [9]. The pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii in rats is unknown [10].

Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans have a range of clinical and environmental sources of infection and cause a wide range of clinical diseases. Two groups of serotypes with different molecular types can cause disease in humans [11]. Serotype A, serotype D, and AD hybrids are the most common, and each may cause different clinical manifestations in different individuals. The most common clinical presentations are pulmonary disease, central nervous system disease, cerebral disease, central nervous system infection, and central nervous system infection [12]. Infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. gattii are most common in immunocompromised patients. Virulent Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii strains are more virulent than strains from serotype A strains [13]. The most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis is meningoencephalitis, with a prevalence of 37% in HIV infected patients and 40% in non-HIV patients. In patients with other immunocompromised conditions, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and lymphopenia, the prevalence of cryptococcal disease is as high as 30% [14]. The disease is more common in patients with HIV/AIDS [15].

A major concern in clinical diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal disease is the rapid development of resistance to amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole [16]. Amphotericin B, an extended-spectrum polyene amphotericin B, is effective against most serotypes of C. neoformans [17]. Amphotericin B is a weak polyene, is less toxic than amphotericin B, and has fewer side effects compared to amphotericin B [18]. However, amphotericin B has an increased risk for nephrotoxicity and toxicity in vivo.

## Methods
Shirazi was a recipient of a gift from D. J. Alvi, from Dr. A.V. Muthapalli, Dr. Z. Rajagopal, and Dr. R.A. Sharma, and was presented at the University of Zimbabwe Hospital. The patient was a white patient with a white skin colour, and had a history of systemic mycosis. Two months ago, he underwent lumbar puncture and he was diagnosed with rheumatic disease. Three months ago, he received a four-month treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy for systemic mycosis.

4.2. Prognostic Test
Prognosis of rheumatic disease was confirmed by the presence of a monochromatic zone on the clinical examination. According to the results of the three-month treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy, the patients' rheumatic symptoms were better than those of the control group.

4.3. Clinical Data
Surgical procedures of the chest, thorax, abdomen, and hands were performed according to the procedures described in the previous section. The total body temperature was measured at the beginning of the treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy. The weight was recorded on the chest, abdomen, and hands.

4.4. Laboratory Method
The subculture was performed in accordance with the standard clinical culture procedure. The samples were cultured in Sabouraud’s dextrose broth (SDB) at 37°C for 72 h. The cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 10^6 cells ml^-1. The cells were counted, and the cells were diluted to the concentration of 1 × 10^4 cells ml^-1. The culture was performed on a shaker at 37°C for 48 h. The cells were then diluted to 10^4 cells ml^-1 in RPMI (Invitrogen) and adjusted to 10^6 cells ml^-1. The samples were stored at 4°C. The samples were observed by a light microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (X-3050, Olympus) and recorded by an automatic camera (X-5050, Olympus).


## Results
coli virulence in a pneumococcal co-infection mode. The R. oryzae-specific proteome analysis revealed that the R. oryzae virulence profile was similar to that of C. neoformans infection, with the exception of the susceptibility of the serotype A strain of C. neoformans to VNI.

The E. coli strain G2 showed the highest virulence in the immunocompromised group, followed by the serotype A strain JEC21. In the immunocompromised group, E. coli had the highest susceptibility to the human microsomal MRSA, followed by C. neoformans (Table 2). The MIC_90, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the E. coli virulence index (EIC) were comparable in the immunocompromised group and the serotype A strain JEC21 (Table 2). The MICs of VNI and VNII were lower in the immunocompromised group, suggesting a lower role of the virulence factor in this group.

Biological and Biological Characteristics of E. coli Vaccine
To evaluate the role of E. coli as a pathogen in the immunocompromised pneumococcal pathogen, we compared the immunocompromised and immunocompromised serotype A strain JEC21 with the serotype A strain of C. neoformans.

The immunocompromised JEC21 was less susceptible to H_2O_2 than the serotype A strain of C. neoformans, while the serotype A strain was less susceptible to H_2O_2 than the serotype A strain of C. neoformans. The serotype A strain of C. neoformans also was more susceptible to H_2O_2 than the serotype A strain of C. neoformans. The differences in the susceptibility of the E. coli strain JEC21 to H_2O_2 were more pronounced in the immunocompromised group, with a mean MIC_90 of 5.5 µg/ml in the immunocompromised group, and 5.5 µg/ml in the serotype A strain.

The E. coli strain G2 also was less susceptible to H_2O_2 than the serotype A strain of C.


## Discussion
Based on the results of the molecular typing, the clinical manifestations of Tetrahymena Virus in this patient were similar to those reported in previous studies, where the clinical manifestations of Tetrahymena virus in . cruzi patients have been reported to be the same as those in other viruses [28], [29], [30].
