## Abstract
Human eumycetoma is a disease that causes severe, life-threatening, aggressive liver diseases in immunocompromised patients. There are about 1.5 million cases of eumycetoma annually, and about 1 in 10 patients will present with neurologic and mycological problems. Despite the increasing number of reported cases, their exact causes remain elusive. The research on eumycetoma is still ongoing, and our understanding of the complex pathology is improving. The main goal now is to unmask the clinical, immunological and clinical aspects of this devastating disease and gain insights into the differential diagnosis.


## Introduction
This disease is mainly caused by the genera Candida, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis, which have been identified as the etiological agents of these infection. However, the infection is also caused by non-Candida albicans species, which may cause the same infection. CGM, in contrast, is an immunosuppressive disease caused by opportunistic yeasts such as Candida, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis. More than 300,000 deaths annually due to CGM are caused by these species, and it is currently estimated that approximately 300,000 people die of this disease (1). There are two types of Candida species: C. albicans and C. glabrata. Candida albicans is the most common species in both clinical cases, but C. glabrata is rarely isolated. However, C. albicans is found in a variety of environmental conditions, and it can cause superficial mucosal infections, in particular on the skin, nails, mucocutaneous tissues, and especially on the joints. The presence of C. albicans in the skin is of great clinical relevance, and treatment is often limited to synthetic antifungals and topical corticosteroids. Nevertheless, in recent years, the use of multiple drugs with different modes of action has become a widespread trend. Among these, benzimidazoles, which are antifungals, are considered as a promising option. However, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, there is a need for new therapies. However, benzimidazole derivatives have limited in vitro activity against the pathogenic fungi C. albicans and Candida krusei, which is a common species of the skin, nail, and hair.

Several groups have evaluated the efficacy of benzimidazoles as antifungals against C. albicans, such as dimethylamino-methyl derivatives (MbDs), the imidazole derivatives, the miconazole derivatives, the triazoles, the cephalosporins, and the imidazoline derivatives (2, 3). However, the efficacy of imidazole derivatives against C. albicans is not well-appreciated, and the pharmacological activity of miconazole against C.

## Results
Patient was a female, age 35 years, with a history of steroids use, and started treatment with oral prednisone and prednisolone in a stable dosage of .50 mg/day. As a result, she developed a chronic fulminant inflammatory disease that was exacerbated by oral prednisone and steroids. The patient also developed Ulcerative Colitis and developed a mild papilledema that was exacerbated by oral prednisone and steroids. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and steroids for a median of 7.5 months. The patient was still receiving oral prednisone and steroids. Her diastolic blood pressure was measured. The patient was on oral prednisone and steroids at a median of 29 mmHg (median 32 mmHg); she was receiving prednisone and steroids at a median of 30 mmHg (median 32 mmHg) and an increase in her diastolic blood pressure of 15 mmHg (median 13 mmHg). She was receiving oral prednisone and steroids at a median of 24 mmHg (median 24 mmHg) and an increase in her diastolic blood pressure of 40 mmHg (median 36 mmHg) and had a serum creatinine of 104 mg/dL. Her blood glucose was measured. The patient was receiving oral prednisone and steroids at a median of 21 mmHg (median 22 mmHg) and an increase in her diastolic blood glucose of 6.8 mmol/L (median 6.5 mmol/L) and had a serum creatinine of 98 mg/dL. Her serum potassium was measured. The patient was receiving oral prednisone and steroids at a median of 20 mmHg (median 20 mmHg) and an increase in her diastolic blood potassium of 6.9 mmol/L (median 6.8 mmol/L) and had a serum creatinine of 77 mg/dL. Her baseline levels of potassium and creatinine were 864.0 mg/dL and 53.7 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was receiving oral prednisone and steroids at a median of 22 mmHg (median 22 mmHg) and an increase in her diastolic blood potassium of 6.


## Discussion
In this study, we investigated the characteristics of invasive Lichtheimiasis in a patient with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Abdominal Mercuriculatio. As expected, invasive Lichtheimiasis was found in this patient.

There was no significant difference in the levels of CD4 counts in this patient with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Abdominal Mercuriculation. The patient’s CD4 counts were decreased in the presence of Lichtheimiasis. The patient’s CD4 counts were decreased in the presence of CpG, but not in the presence of Mg^2+. This suggests that this patient had an invasive infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response. Our results suggest that this patient’s CD4 counts may be low.

Infection is a very serious disease, and the importance of the proper management of infections and the prevention of infection are imperative. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of infection in a patient with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Abdominal Mercuriculation. In this patient, we found that the patient had an invasive infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response. Our results suggest that this patient had an infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response. The patient’s CD4 counts were decreased in the presence of Lichtheimiasis. This suggests that this patient had an infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response. The patient’s CD4 counts were decreased in the presence of CpG, but not in the presence of Mg^2+. This suggests that this patient had an infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response. Our results suggest that this patient had an infection, which may be associated with the mucosal inflammatory response.

Infections are very common in patients with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Abdominal Mercuriculation. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of infection in a patient with Ulcerative Colitis Treated with Abdominal Mercuriculation. The patient’s CD4 counts were decreased in the presence of CpG, but not in the presence of Mg^2+.
