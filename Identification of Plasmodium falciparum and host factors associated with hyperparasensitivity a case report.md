## Abstract
The presence of rhabditi in fungi is associated with virulence traits. In the pathogenic fungus, the rhabditi protein fold lies upstream of the large G-protein family that includes the Rho GTPase and the Fag domain family. Here we show that the rhabditi homolog is also associated with virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen. The growth of rhabditi-deficient mutants was severely impaired in iron-uptake mechanisms and in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. Moreover, rhabditi was found to accumulate at higher rates in the presence of iron than in wild-type strain. Moreover, rhabditi expression was found to be upregulated in iron-deprived mutants when compared to in Fe-depleted control strains. In addition, rhabditi was found to be a stronger competitive inhibitor of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis than iron oxides. Our results suggest that rhabditi is involved in virulence, growth, iron metabolism, and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in C. neoformans.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a leading cause of death in immunocompromised patients, with Candida being the most frequently isolated pathogen. [1] Fungal infections are the most common cause of respiratory and urinary tract infections and are associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. [2] Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an uncommon infection, and is caused by Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida kefyr and associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. [3], [4]

Common clinical features of IA include erythema, myositis, pulmonary, and systemic. [5], [6] Histoplasmosis is a less common entity, and is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which causes pyogranulomatous inflammatory lesions, and is associated with high rates of mortality. [7]

Cryptococcus neoformans is a major fungal pathogen, and is responsible for more than 600,000 infections a year worldwide, resulting in about 600,000 deaths annually. [8] Cryptococcus neoformans is a common environmental fungus, and is responsible for 15% of all AIDS-related deaths. [9]

Numerous studies have investigated the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of IFI. The risk factors associated with mortality include erythema, myositis, and pulmonary.

The congenic A.


## Results
However, in the case of the VFV1 isolate, the virulence-associated protein (VE-1) was absent in all strains except one strain that was susceptible to fluconazole, indicating that the VFV1 gene may have been lost in the strai. In the present study, we detected the presence of the VFV1 gene in all strains except one strain that was resistant to fluconazole (Table 2). However, in the case of the VFV1 isolate, the gene was present in all strains except one strain that was susceptible to fluconazole (Table 2).

Taken together, our results suggest that VFV1 gene in some strains may be lost in other strains, whereas in other strains, the VFV1 gene may be present in all strains except one strain that was resistant to fluconazole. Thus, the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to fluconazole may be attributed to its resistance to fluconazole.

The A. fumigatus virulence-associated proteins are not associated with the host immune system
The virulence of Plasmodium falciparum is associated with the host immune system and we found no association between the A. fumigatus virulence factors and the host immune system in this study.

Plasmodium falciparum virulence factors are associated with the CNS immune system
The results of the analysis of the C. neoformans var. neoformans (neoformans var. grubii) and A. fumigatus virulence factors (vesicules) in the brain were consistent with the results of the previous study. Therefore, we performed a genetic analysis to identify the loci that are differentially expressed between the two pathogenic strains.

We analyzed the microarray data to determine the microarray protein expression profile of the six S. cerevisiae virulence factors. For each of the six virulence factors, the expression profiles were compared between the two strains (Table 3). The expression profiles were highly correlated with the protein expression profile of the virulence factors (Table 3).


## Discussion
It is the first report of this fungus in a human immunodeficiency virus patien. It has been reported previously in immunocompetent individuals, in a patient with HIV infection. [7] Furthermore, in a study of HIV patients in Uganda, we found that the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum in HIV patients was higher than in HIV patients in the general population. [8]

Pleurotus species have been reported as primary causes of hyperparasensitivity in HIV patients. [9] P. falciparum has been reported in HIV patients in Tanzania, [10] but not in non-HIV patients in our setting. [11] In this study, we found that the P. falciparum infection was associated with hyperparasensitivity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient. The patient was a male with a mean age of 44.9 years. He had no apparent immunodeficiency and no history of organ transplantation or recent use of corticosteroid therapy. The patient did not present any other diseases or immunodeficiencies, which were consistent with P. falciparum.

Pleurotus falciparum is considered a member of the subspecies of P. falciparum. [12] In our setting, P. falciparum has been reported in immunocompetent patients, [7] but not in immunocompromised individuals. [7] The patient had a serum CD4+ T-cell count of 166 cells/µL and a CD4+ lymphocyte count of 97 cells/µL. He had been immunocompromised for a long time. The patient had no known immunodeficiency, and the patient had no previous immunodeficiency. In addition, the patient had no previous immunodeficiency and no history of organ transplantation.

Pleurotus species have been reported as the cause of raised intracranial hypertension in HIV patients in Uganda. [7] The patient had a normal BMI and was healthy with no obvious comorbidities.
