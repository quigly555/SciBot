## Abstract
The study was conducted between January-December 2014 in Patients with Disseminated hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy, transplantation, radiotherapy or any other immunotherap. The subjects were 312 hematology patients, mainly on immunotherapy or immunotherapy for hematological disorders. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with Candida albicans (95% vs 65%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (99% vs 62%). The comparison between the S. aureus and C. albicans populations was statistically insignificant. Patients with hematological diseases with candidemia or disseminated hematological disease (H = 9.3, P = 0.008, F = 5.5, P = 0.005) were more likely to have cryptococcal meningitis (P = 0.038). The incidence of disseminated hematological disease in the study population (n = 62) was higher than in the non-HIV patients (n = 39). Cryptococcus neoformans infection was associated with higher odds of having disseminated hematological disease (P = 0.038). Patients with hematological diseases with disseminated hematological disease were more likely to have pneumococcal meningitis (P = 0.045). The association between hematological diseases and disseminated hematological disease is independent of the presence of disseminated hematological disease.

Cryptococcus neoformans infection was associated with higher odds of disseminated hematological disease and higher risk of having pneumococcal meningitis and pneumococcal pneumonia. These findings support the importance of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans in determining the host susceptibility to disseminated hematological disorders.

Immunology is increasing, but patients with hematological disorders still face a significant risk of developing disseminated hematological disorders. We examined the role of the immune response and its response against cryptococcosis.

A retrospective review of 68 patients with hematological disorders was performed.


## Introduction

Cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogen that causes meningitis in immunocompromised hosts, is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is ubiquitous in the environmen. In immunocompromised patients, the development of meningitis is associated with the exposure of the central nervous system (CNS) and lungs, which are the organs most commonly affected by the disease. The development of brain-deadening meningoencephalitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans is typically associated with a disturbed blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, which increases the risk of developing cryptococcal meningitis, which is often fatal [2]. Although the BBB is the major site of inflammation, its permeability and fluidity can be affected by several factors. For instance, the blood-brain barrier is altered in patients with cryptococcal meningitis [3]. In contrast, the CSF barrier is present in the CNS in individuals with other diseases such as other neurodegenerative diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, and multiple sclerosis.

Current studies have demonstrated that the CSF barrier is a barrier that has a direct impact on the pathogenesis of cryptococcal meningitis [4]. In general, the CSF is enriched in proteins involved in proteins involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular transport [5]. However, the CSF barrier has also been shown to be a barrier that is affected by other factors, such as antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and signaling pathways [6]. The immune response of the CNS has been shown to be affected by the CSF barrier [7].


## Methods
neoformans was described previously [15. Briefly, the susceptibility of the human clinical isolates to C. neoformans was assessed by the broth dilution method [16]. Briefly, the C. neoformans isolate was diluted to a concentration of 2 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The fungal suspension was then diluted to 100 µL/mL. The final concentration of the diluted C. neoformans was 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. The test was performed with a sterile swab. The control was performed with sterile swabs. The test was performed on a slide slide and with a sterile needle and after the method was performed, the cells were aspirated from the slide. The number of CFU/mL of the control was defined as the number of CFU/mL of the test substance. The results were expressed as the ratio of the viable number of the tested substance to the number of CFU/mL of the control. The determination of the inhibitory effect of the tested compound on the test substance was performed by the method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [17]. Briefly, the concentrations of the tested compounds were determined by the following tests: (1) the MIC of the tested compound was determined by broth dilution assay with the test substance diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL in RPMI-1640 medium; (2) the MIC of the tested compound was determined by the dilution assay with the test substance diluted to a concentration of 0.1% in RPMI-1640 medium; (3) the MIC of the tested compound was determined by the turbidity of the medium using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA) [18]. The test was performed in 96-well microtiter plates with a concentration of 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL in RPMI-1640 medium.


## Results
neoformans in the mouse model, the virulence factors involved in . neoformans virulence were tested in the murine model of cryptococcal infection. As shown in Fig 5, the MICs for all the virulence factors tested were significantly lower in mice infected with C. neoformans than in mice infected with C. baumannii, demonstrating that C. neoformans is able to cause a host-protective immune response in the murine model.

C. neoformans Is More Susceptible to Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy with Methylprednisolone than C. baumannii Infection
In order to investigate the susceptibility of C. neoformans to Methylprednisolone and to chemotherapy with Methylprednisolone, the median age of mice infected with C. neoformans was significantly increased (P < 0.001). The median age of mice infected with C. neoformans was also significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in comparison with the 2-month-old controls (Figure 6A). The median age of mice infected with C. baumannii was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) than the 2-month-old controls (Figure 6B). The median age of mice infected with C. neoformans was also significantly decreased (P < 0.001) than the 2-month-old controls (Figure 6C). The median age of mice infected with C. baumannii was also significantly reduced (P < 0.001) than the 2-month-old controls (Figure 6D).

Comparison of the Adverse Events of C. neoformans Infected with C. baumannii and C. baumannii Infected with C. baumannii in the Mouse Model
The demographic data of mice infected with C. neoformans and the mortality rate of mice infected with C. baumannii are presented in Table 2. The mortality rate of mice infected with C. neoformans was significantly higher than that of mice infected with C. baumannii. The mortality rate of mice infected with C. baumannii was also significantly higher than that of mice infected with C. neoformans. The death rate of mice infected with C.


## Discussion
This means that acute infections must be considered as an important first-line treatment for suspected cryptococcal infection [4. The first-line treatment is fluconazole 800 mg orally twice daily, followed by 5-7 days of fluconazole maintenance therapy. In the case of pulmonary cryptococcosis, Amphotericin B is used for maintenance therapy [4]. The Amphotericin B used in our patient was a 48 mg/m^2 fluconazole (1.75 mg/kg) dose, which is the lowest dose that the patient has been given in the setting of acute onset HIV infection. Amphotericin B is an inert drug that can be used in the treatment of mild to moderate cryptococcal infections [5].

Our patient had low CD4 count of 39 cells/µL, which is the maximum that a clinical microbiologist would have recommended for this patient. The patient had a mild respiratory distress, pyrexia and a mild fever that were worse than normal. The patient responded to Amphotericin B therapy with a good response and no clinical signs of infection.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a rare disease which affects predominantly immunocompromised individuals [6]. It is a severe pulmonary infection that can cause a severe pulmonary edema, obstructive cough, fever, and chest pain [7]. It is uncommon in AIDS patients [6]. The patient was a 16- to 36-year-old woman with a history of respiratory distress. She had a mild fever, cough, fever, chest pain and the chest radiograph was negative. The patient was not well and the radiographic findings were negative.

The patient's case report highlights the importance of considering pulmonary cryptococcosis in the setting of acute onset HIV infection and the need for a pulmonary biopsy. The biopsy of the patient showed a pleocytosis of pulmonary nodules with an enhancement of pulmonary edema. The pleocytosis was confirmed with bronchoscopy and a mononuclear predominance of mononuclear pleocytosis. The patient was not positive for any other infectious etiology.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a rare disease which can manifest as lung disease, pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion, or pneumonia. It is a rare disease that affects immunocompetent individuals and is associated with a poor prognosis [8].
