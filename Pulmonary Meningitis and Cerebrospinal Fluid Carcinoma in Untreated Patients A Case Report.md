## Abstract
Candida albicans is the most common cause of nosocomial fungal infections in humans, with Candida albicans being the most common cause of mucosal infection in immunocompromised individuals. The development of invasive candidiasis is closely associated with the immune status of the host. In this study, we found that Candida glabrata, a species of yeast, is significantly associated with invasive candidiasis in humans. We found that Candida parapsilosis was associated with increased susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole. In addition, the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines, gene expression and in vitro fungal burden were significantly altered in Candida cells. In vivo, Candida glabrata infection was associated with increased survival of infected mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Candida glabrata is an important pathogen of human invasive candidiasis, with enhanced fungal burden associated with enhanced virulence.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a growing problem that is becoming more prevalent in the past decade, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. In the literature, there are approximately 500 reported cases of IFIs, which are classified according to the species of the genus: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus gattii, and Sporothrix schenckii [1,2,3,4]. The most common manifestation of IFIs are aspergillosis and mucormycosis. IFIs are caused by members of the Aspergillus genus, and Cryptococcus neoformans and Sporothrix schenckii are responsible for the majority of the cases. Cryptococcus neoformans and Sporothrix schenckii are responsible for most cases of cryptococcal meningitis, which is most common in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is the most common manifestation of cryptococcosis. In the United States, nearly half of all cases of cryptococcal meningitis are reported in individuals with no history of immunosuppression. The most common manifestation is aspergillosis [3].

The incidence of IFIs in the general population has increased dramatically over the past decades due to the widespread use of immunosuppression and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the developed world. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 80% of HIV/AIDS patients present late presentation with severe cryptococcal disease, there is still a high mortality rate [5,6,7]. The current cost-saving approach is to treat cryptococcal meningitis with oral drugs, but this strategy requires adequate treatment [8].

Meningoencephalitis is a common clinical presentation in HIV/AIDS patients, which is often caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, respectively [9]. The cryptococcal antigen capsular antigen (CRAG) has been identified as a major opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients [9].


## Methods
These aerosol-treated patients had been treated with aerosol-free lavage for 24 h at a dose of .5 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) before aerosol-free lavage. For aerosol-free lavage, the patients were treated with aerosol-free lavage at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a sub-study of aerosol-free lavage. The aerosol-free lavage was performed in a volume of 1 mL (2 mL) of aerosol-free lavage, and was performed in a room of a sterile room with controlled lighting at a temperature of 28 Â°C. At the end of aerosol-free lavage, patients were transferred to a sterile room and transferred to a polyethylene bottle. After aerosol-free lavage, the patients were placed in a sterile chamber, covered with a piece of sterile gauze, and placed in a deep chamber to recover from aerosol-induced bronchitis.

Methods
The aerosol-free lavage was performed in a volume of 1 mL (2 mL) of aerosol-free lavage, and was performed in a room of a sterile room. The patients were initially treated with aerosol-free lavage at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 48 h. After aerosol-free lavage, the patients were treated with aerosol-free lavage at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 h.

## Results
We found that 84% (8/9) of the patients had disseminated candidiasi. Among patients with disseminated candidiasis, 14% (1/9) were atypical for acute or chronic pulmonary disease, and 26% (4/9) were atypical for a variety of causes (Table 1).

Concerning the predisposing factors of CNS infection, we found that of 14 patients with disseminated candidiasis, 14 had a murine infection of C. albicans, 11 had a pulmonary infection of C. albicans, and 5 had a disseminated infection of C. albicans. Of the 8 patients with disseminated candidiasis, 4 were atypical for acute or chronic pulmonary disease, and 9 were atypical for a variety of causes (Table 1).

Neurological Trichocomplexis Syndrome and the Hypersensitivity of Maternal Factors
Pulmonary trichocomplexis was found in 10/20 (72%) patients, and brain trichocomplexis in 7/20 (43%) patients (Table 2).

The first etiological factor was the porin T1D. There were no patient with a congenital T1D in whom C. albicans was the primary cause of cerebral toxoplasmosis. In the other 12 patients, the congenital toxoplasmosis was not suspected. However, congenital toxoplasmosis was suspected in one patient with a congenital trichocomplex disease and in one patient with a congenital trichocomplex disease. In addition, two patients with congenital toxoplasmosis had congenital trichocomplex disease and one patient with a congenital trichocomplex disease had congenital trichocomplex disease.

In a population of 1,439 patients, we found a total of 775 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis, of which 725 were confirmed by clinical and radiological culture results. We found that 32% (6/775) of the congenital toxoplasmosis cases were confirmed by clinical and radiological culture results. Among the 977 congenital toxoplasmosis cases, 689 were confirmed by clinical and radiological culture results, and 302 were confirmed by clinical and radiological culture results.


## Discussion
(2018)

In our patient, a hemophagocytosis was observed in a patient with a serum CrAg of >5 mg/d. This finding is consistent with CrAg screening, which is more specific in patients with immunosuppression and high levels of CD4.8/CD8 ratio, which was 1:4 in this patient. This finding is also in agreement with the fact that C. albicans serogroup B (serotype B) seropositivity was reported to be rare, even in patients with severe immunosuppression (Bond et al., 2017). However, a higher CrAg titers in this patient were not found in serotype D (serotype A), whereas in our patient, the serotype A serotype was found in the blood plasma (serotype D), which is in agreement with the other authors who described serotype D in patients with CrAg (Kano et al., 2019). Although, serum CrAg titers in patients with hematologic malignancies have not been reported in patients with cryptococcosis, serum CrAg titers have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies such as neutropenia and central nervous system (CNS) encephalitis (Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, serum CrAg titers of C. neoformans have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies such as cancer, as well as in patients with sepsis (Kano et al., 2019).

An autoimmune response to Cryptococcus infection can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies (Havilea et al., 2019). The patient in this case did not have an anti-GM-CSF (GM-CSF) autoantibodies, which is consistent with previous reports that show a significant cross-reactivity between anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies and the HIV infection (Kano et al., 2019). Although this patient did not have an anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies, it was interesting to note that the serum CrAg titers were higher in patients with a high serum C. neoformans titers than those with low serum GM-CSF autoantibodies. This observation is also consistent with the fact that serum CrAg titers are higher in patients with HIV infection than those with the autoantibodies (Havilea et al., 2019).
