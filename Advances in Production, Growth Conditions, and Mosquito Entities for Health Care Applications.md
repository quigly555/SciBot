## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viability of a novel, Streptomyces strain (S. suberosa) for growth on a wide range of substrates, such as aluminum (a strong substrate for downstream transcription), iron (A2), iron chelators (deoxynucleotide), manganese (HMG) and organic acids. The S. suberosa strain also exhibited a higher viability when grown on non-fermentable (e.g. 0.5 mM) or Fermentable (e.g. 0.25 mM) aluminum salts. Furthermore, the S. suberosa strain exhibited growth at much higher (32-74 µg/mL) concentrations of iron, H2O2, Cu, Ni and Zn iron compared with the control. Our results show that S. suberosa strain was a growth-factor-using bacterium, able to metabolise Cu and H2O2. The growth-factor-using S. suberosa also showed higher concentrations of Zn iron compared with the control strain. Overall, our results suggest that S. suberosa strain has a higher ability to metabolise metals compared to other species of fungi and supports its role as an important source of iron and copper for the generation of cellular energy.


## Introduction
491-604; doi:1.1016/j.ppb.2018.09.012). In the United States, the most common route for A. boulardi to be introduced to the market is by the purchase of commercial or agricultural products. The commercialization of these drugs is expensive and may lead to drug-resistant strains. To reduce this cost, A. boulardi uses a number of different routes to reach its target market. These include: a) delivery using implanted devices or hollow, non-conductive (e.g., bio-surveillance devices), and b) delivery using solid (e.g., disposable catheters or catheters without implanted devices) devices (e.g., catheters without implanted devices) (Tables 1 and 2).

A. boulardi is a human pathogen that has been recognized as a vector for the development of new antineoplastic and antimicrobial agents, such as the antibiotic fluoroacetol (FA), the peptidoglycan (PG) toxin, and the polyene antibiotic (e.g., trifluoperazine, amikacin, pyrazinamide, and metronidazole). Additionally, A. boulardi has been implicated in the development of new drugs and antiviral agents (e.g., iprodione, chloroquine, miltefosine, and fluconazole) (Tables 3 and 4).

The complexity of the antineoplastic agent formulation enables the therapeutic delivery of compounds with low toxicity and great efficacy in vitro, as well as in vivo (e.g., in mice and humans, with a subcutaneous delivery) (van der Meijer et al., 2017). Administration of a single dose of a drug to the skin or the lung results in a transient inflammatory response that is temporary and does not resolve after prolonged exposure (Woudenberg and Holmgren, 2011; Holmgren et al., 2016). Thus, the clinical development of antineoplastic agents has increased attention over the last decade (Gow and Davies, 2017). In the United States, A. boulardi has been identified as a vector for the development of new drugs, as well as antiviral agents, including the triazoles (e.g.


## Methods
100-2013. The methodologies described in this study were based on the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 100-2012). In brief, the two methods were implemented in an R package (http://cran.r-project.org/) with the following packages: “Statistics” (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), “GARLIPS” (Gartner Inc., St. Louis, MO), and “GARLIPS” (Gartner Inc., San Diego, CA). To quantify the relative importance of infection time, the use of the “Preparation” method was chosen for this analysis. To assess the correlation between mortality and the use of antimalarial agent, we analyzed the data from the R package. We performed all tests in triplicate. To identify a correlation between infection time and the use of antimalarial agent, we used the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test is one of the most important statistical approaches to conduct experiments with this methodologies. When nonparametric data, such as the data on antimalarial agents were present, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was performed. To identify a correlation between mortality and the use of antimalarial agent, we performed the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test is used to evaluate the performance of a statistical approach in a data set. For this purpose, we performed a multiple logistic regression to identify the variables associated with mortality and use of antimalarial agent. We performed the univariate and the multivariate analysis in the R package. To identify a correlation between mortality and use of antimalarial agent, we performed a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc test using the factorial and nonparametric variables. We performed all tests in triplicate.

## Results
 2008. Further, multiple studies have reported the impact of fungal species on the fungal community in health care systems (Meyer and Levin, 2007; Stolz et al., 2010). It is therefore important to determine the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health care facilities. There are two main approaches to this question. First, we can use the literature on fungal species in health care facilities as a source of information that may be helpful to assess the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health care facilities. Second, the use of the literature on fungal species in health care facilities to assess the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health care facilities may have the potential to provide more information about the health care systems that are in use and to improve the quality of health care. For example, a recent study by Boesewon et al. (2011) reported that fungal species can affect the fungal community of health care facilities, and that the fungal community can be a threat to health system. For this reason, we will also be focusing on the use of the literature to evaluate the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health care facilities and to identify any other aspects of fungal species that may be beneficial to health system.

The key to the data analysis is the assessment of the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health care facilities. If species of the genus Aspergillus are able to influence the fungal community of health facilities, the difference between the fungal species that are commonly found in the health care facilities and those that are commonly found in the private health facilities may not be insignificant. However, if fungal species are able to influence the fungal community of health facilities, the differences between the fungal species that are commonly found in the health care facilities and those that are commonly found in the private health facilities may not be insignificant. Therefore, we will be focusing on the use of the literature to evaluate the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health facilities. For this reason, we will be focusing on the use of the literature to evaluate the impact of fungal species on the fungal community of health facilities.


## Discussion
Among the phylum compositions, the bacterial phylotypes were not as abundant as in the healthy patient. This could be due to the fact that the patients were not used for long-term medical care, but the patients were healthy. For the bacterial phylotypes, the phylum composition of the three patients was similar to the healthy patients. The bacterial phylotypes of the three patients were significantly different from those of the healthy patients. The bacterial phylotypes of the patients were also different from those of the healthy patients, but the phylum compositions were still different than those of the patients. The phylum compositions of the three patients were similar to the patients, and the phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from the healthy patients. It is possible that the variation in the phylum compositions is due to the different environment in the two patients.

The phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from the healthy patients, and the phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from those of the patients. It is possible that the variation in the phylum compositions is due to the different environmental conditions in the two patients. In addition, the environmental factors may play a role in the variation in the phylum compositions of the three patients. For example, the concentration of organic acid in the air in the hospital may be a factor for the variation in the phylum compositions of the three patients.

In summary, the results of the present study demonstrated that the microbiota of the three patients is diverse and that the phylum compositions of the three patients are significantly different from the healthy patients. The phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from those of the healthy patients, and the phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from those of the patients. The phylum compositions of the three patients were significantly different from those of the patients.
