## Abstract
Many plant species are subjected to extreme agricultural practices, which result in significant inputs of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Fungal infection and death are frequent causes of global economic and environmental losses. Exacerbating the losses are diseases caused by microorganisms, such as diseases caused by pests, bacteria, and fungal strains. This review discusses the effects of fungal and bacterial pathogens on plant infection and disease. We discuss the possibility that fungal diseases could shape plant disease management and the impact of these diseases on the incidence of plant diseases.


## Introduction
However, this evolutionary scenario does not fit the model proposed by the previous wor. Indeed, the method presented in this paper is based on a classical "low-complexity" method, which is very similar to the classic "high-complexity" method used to detect coding sequences with high similarity in metagenomes.

The authors introduce the “HMAS method”, which is based on a higher-dimensional modeling approach and has been widely used to study the influence of mRNA expression on the evolution of organisms (Schoch et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015). The method can be used to analyze evolutionary processes such as the evolution of adaptation, selection or mutation (Li et al., 2015). The authors demonstrate the power of using HMAS to study the evolution of adaptation and mutation rates in eukaryotic organisms.

The authors also present the work of Zhang et al. (2015) and presents the results of an EST-based screening strategy for screening C. elegans for virulence and antifungal drug resistance. However, it is unclear how and to what extent the target gene prediction method used in this study is correct.

The authors demonstrate that the method can be used to study the evolution of gene expression in C. elegans and, therefore, the potential of this method to identify orthologs of putative proteins involved in virulence and antifungal drug resistance.

The authors also introduce the GSK cloning and cloning technique, which can be used to clone DNA in whole organisms (Cao et al., 2017). This technique is very fast and can clone DNA from a wide variety of organisms (Cao et al., 2017). The method uses a DNA-specific DNA-binding oligomerization technique, which is very fast and can clone DNA from a variety of organisms. The cloning process is well described in great detail in the Methods section. However, the description of the cloning method is not very straightforward. For example, the method has to be explained in two different ways: the method explaining the cloning method in two different ways; and the explanation of the cloning method in three different ways.

The cloning method can be efficiently performed by a microorganism and its performance is discussed in the following section. However, the cloning method can be performed by a microorganism that is not a producer of virulence-related proteins.


## Methods
albicans (ATCC 750) was incubated for 18 h in 10 ml of methano. The bacterial cells were washed and resuspended in 10 ml of methanol. The extracts were incubated for 1 h at 25°C in a water bath. The cell suspension was vortexed for 15 s and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000× g. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of TE buffer and further centrifuged at 10,000× g. The pellet was washed with 50 µl of TE buffer and further centrifuged at 10,000× g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of TE buffer and further centrifuged at 10,000× g. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of TE buffer.

RNA Extraction and qPCR Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from fungal cells using the RNAiso™ Plus (Takara) and RNAiso™ Plus (Takara) kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies). The quality of RNA was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit. The cDNA libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2. Newer sequences were assembled using QIIME v1.8.1. The cDNA sequences were compared against the GreenGenes database (version 15.0) using the BLAST algorithm. The statistical significance of the results was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% identity level using the USEARCH v8.0.9-SNP-ANOVA software. The operational taxonomic units were named after the fungal species using the BLAST program (version 2.1.14). The taxonomic classification of the sequences was based on the taxonomy of the taxonomic unit. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used as a reference gene. The taxonomic annotation of the bacterial sequences was done with the NCBI database and was verified by searching against the database. The sequence similarity between the different bacterial taxonomic groups was determined using the NCBI database and was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.


## Results
albicans could be a natural consequence of adaptation to thermal stress, we compared the transcript levels of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and maintenance, including cell wall degrading enzymes, the glyoxylate cycle and the glyoxylate cycl. We found that the transcript levels of some genes in the glyoxylate cycle were higher in C. albicans when compared to other strains. A key component of the glyoxylate cycle is glucose, which is a known substrate of glyoxylate synthase [12]. These data suggest that adaptation to thermal stress is a mechanism by which C. albicans responds to thermal stress.

The transcript level of several genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and maintenance were significantly higher in C. albicans when compared to other strains (Fig 3). These data suggest that adaptation to thermal stress is a mechanism by which C. albicans responds to the thermal stress.

C. albicans responds to temperature stress by depleting glyoxylate from the glyoxylate cycle
We next sought to understand whether C. albicans responds to temperature stress by depleting glyoxylate from the glyoxylate cycle. We performed time-series experiments to investigate whether the response to thermal stress could be a mechanism by which C. albicans responds to thermal stress. The response to thermal stress is mediated by the glyoxylate cycle, which is characterized by the accumulation of free fatty acids in the glyoxylate cycle [19]. We found that the transcript level of several genes involved in the glyoxylate cycle was significantly higher in C. albicans when compared to other strains (Fig 4). These data suggest that the response to thermal stress might be a response by C. albicans to the glyoxylate cycle.

The transcript levels of several genes in the glyoxylate cycle were significantly higher in C. albicans when compared to other strains (Fig 4). These data suggest that C. albicans responds to thermal stress by depleting free glyoxylate from the glyoxylate cycle.

## Discussion
However, TEMs are expensive and are not accessible for most laboratory strains [29], [30. In this study, we used EST cells in the majority of the experiments, but also used the host cells, which are often used for DNA sequencing analysis. In our previous study [30], we used an olive oil-based approach, which was highly cost-effective and limited in terms of the time and energy required for the detection of microbial DNA and gene expression. In the present study, we used a non-invasive technique, which is typically employed to detect genes involved in pathogenicity, but also to detect genes involved in response to stress and disease. The detection of a gene is performed by using the RNA-seq technique, which can generate probes that include a high number of nucleotides, and a small amount of DNA [31]. Although the RNA-seq technology is not widely available in most of the countries, we used the EPR technique, which was able to generate probes that included more nucleotides, and that is capable of detecting genes involved in pathogenicity [32]. The EPR technique detects gene expression patterns in the EST population, and it can also be used to detect gene expression in other populations [33], [34]. We used the same approach to detect genes involved in response to stress in our study, which has not been evaluated for its utility in other studies.

The species of the pathogenic fungi tested were classified into four subfamilies based on the tree constructed using the concatenated alignments of the sequences obtained from the GenBank databases. Three of these are represented by the Ascomycota, and four by the Basidiomycota. The other six are represented by the Ascomycota, and three by the Basidiomycota, and one by the Basidiomycota. The fungi of the Ascomycota are mainly represented by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, whereas those of the Basidiomycota represent by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The Ascomycota is represented by Aspergillus spp. and Bysodontia spp.

Based on these results, we grouped the sequences of the four subfamilies into the subfamilies of the fungal phylotypes.
