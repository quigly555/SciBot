## Abstract
Endobronchial carcinoid tumors are rare and difficult to treat, and they are usually diagnosed in immunodeficient patients. This was the case of a 57-year-old immunocompetent Han Chinese woman who was treated with infliximab, and who was finally diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and malignant choroidal tumor. She had been on statins for 1 year and had a good prognosis. However, she had a recurrence 1 year after the administration of infliximab. She was treated with infliximab for nephrotic syndrome and malignant choroidal tumor. She had an excellent outcome with complete and prolonged disability disability-free control.

Many cases of endobronchial carcinoid tumors in immunocompromised patients are due to nonspecific changes in the fungal microbiota and/or lack of overt carcinoid pathology. We present here a case of nephrotic syndrome and malignant choroidal tumor in a Han Chinese immunocompetent patient who was successfully managed by infliximab.


## Introduction
. They are composed of many hydrophobic moieties, which are coated with a hydrophobic molecule and able to interact with different types of molecules in the biological environment (Boudette and Macfadol, 2005). The hydrophilic moieties can bind with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and enzymes (i.e., enzymes with antimicrobial activity) in order to make the peptide inactive and inactive against a more common class of antimicrobials (AMPs), namely multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDR). Many AMPs and MDR enzymes have been isolated from bacteria, plants, insects, and fungi (Goodwin et al., 2012). These enzymes are active against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. However, the antibacterial activity of AMPs depends on the type of enzyme and the source of the AMP or AMP-producing bacteria (Garcia-Vela et al., 2007). The major classes of AMPs and MDR enzymes are represented by the peptide bond structures and domains (Figure 1). The major class of AMPs and MDR enzymes is represented by the amino acid sequence motifs (Figure 1). The amino acid sequence motifs (TMs) are involved in peptide bond formation and function (Garcia-Vela et al., 2007). The peptide bonds are mainly composed of conserved amino acid residues (for example, C5, C10, C12, C14, and C16) and are not easily identifiable due to their very small size and the absence of an aminoglycoside motif (Goodwin et al., 2012).

The C5/C10 group is responsible for the most active peptide, which is a highly hydrophilic peptide. This group is a part of the MDR enzymes, and the conserved amino acid sequences of this group are important in peptide bond formation (Goodwin et al., 2012). The C12/C14 group is responsible for the most active peptide, which is a hydrocarbon with an amine group at the C-6 position, and the C-6 group is responsible for the most hydrophobic peptide, which is a water-soluble peptide.


## Methods
chrysosporium spores were isolated from Aspergillus furfur strain NAPL (ATCC 32069), a clinical isolate of . chrysosporium, at the National Center for Medical Research (Nanchang, Republic of Republic of Republic of Republic of Thailand). The isolate was isolated from a clinical isolate of P. chrysosporium (Sporopronaria pacificus) from the mainland. It was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28 °C and used in the antimicrobial susceptibility test. For the antibiotic susceptibility test, the isolated P. chrysosporium spores were suspended in sterile water at a concentration of 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. The suspension was then applied to the surface of a PDA plate and the plates were incubated at 28 °C and examined daily. The susceptibility to the antibacterial compounds was determined as previously described [11].


## Results
albicans specie. The purified C. albicans C. albicans C. albicans-II was subjected to susceptibility testing (Figure 3A). The MIC values are shown in Table 1. The C. albicans-II MIC value was 0.06 µg/ml (Table 1).

## Discussion
A search of the ITS1-.8S1 region revealed that it belongs to the group Microbotryomycetes and is phylogenetically closest to the genus Bacillus (fig 1). Bacillus has been observed in various environments and species of Bacillus have been isolated from various habitats including the soil, fruits, fish, reptiles and amphibians (Dalhelm et al., 2006, Amm et al., 2012, D’Souza et al., 2014, Ajello et al., 2016). The genus Bacillus is a group of yeasts isolated from the environment (Ishida et al., 2005). The type species of this genus are B. pseudomallei, L. kristinae and S. aureus (fig 2).

The genus Bacillus is composed of two subgroups. The first group comprises species with a wide range of fruiting body sizes and also comprises species with yeasts such as S. cerevisiae, A. pullulans, A. niger and S. floccosum (fig 3). In contrast, the second group comprises the species S. bacillisporum and S. eubayanus. The species S. bacillisporum has been isolated from the environment (Ding et al., 2014). The species S. eubayanus has been found in the soil (fig 3). The species S. bacillisporum and S. eubayanus are closely related to B. pseudomallei, a species of the genus Bacillus (fig 1). In addition, the genus S. bacillisporum has been isolated from plants (Ishida et al., 2005).

The genus Bacillus is a group of yeasts belonging to the order Tiscales, which are mostly found in freshwater (Sánchez et al., 2007). The type species of this group are S. cerevisiae and S. guilliermondii (fig 3). The species S. cerevisiae has been isolated from the environment (Ding et al., 2014).

The genus Malassezia has been identified in several locations. The type species of this genus are B. pseudomallei, L. kristinae and S. aureus (fig 3).
