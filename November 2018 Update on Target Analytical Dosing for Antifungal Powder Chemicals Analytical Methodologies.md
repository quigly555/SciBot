## Abstract
Sporotrichosis is a severe infection caused by Sporothrix spp. Here we report the first case of a rapidly fatal case of sporotrichosis in a critically ill patient with pulmonary involvement.

A 57-year-old man with diabetes presented to our facility with a three-month history of progressive dry cough and a three-month history of coughing that progressed to pneumonia. Computed tomography angiography showed multiple nodules in both lungs with a 1.6 × 1.5 cm mass size difference. A biopsy of the stromal cells in his stroma revealed budding spore structures consistent with sporotrichosis. He was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 2 weeks. However, upon cessation of the drug, he became unresponsive and was euthanized.

This case suggests that a rapid and fatal presentation of sporotrichosis can occur in patients with conditions such as pulmonary or solid sclerosis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immunity, especially those with hematologic malignancies [1-3]. The recent introduction of immunosuppressive regimens, such as the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) drug regimens, is associated with an increased incidence of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV infection, and disseminated IFI (DWI) [4-7]. In this context, it is important to consider the risk that the immunosuppressive drug regimen may generate to patients.

The risk of acquiring IFIs by fungi from a patient is likely to be higher than the risk of developing IFI by other causes. Furthermore, IFIs are typically diagnosed after a number of opportunistic infections. IFIs are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. Among these, IFIs can be categorized as (i) invasive candidiasis (IC), (ii) asymptomatic candidiasis (SI), or (iii) asymptomatic and potentially refractory systemic fungal infection (SOF) [1, 2, 4].

ICI are defined as a fungal infection with an encapsulated yeast phase within the gastrointestinal tract of a healthy individual, usually caused by Candida albicans. It generally presents in yeast forms (below 0.5 cm) [2, 3, 5-7].


## Methods
aucu.edu/vapors/vapors.php) and added a new reference case of candidiasis, as well as a clinical reference case of systemic mycosis.

In a first step, all three clinical reference cases (n = 4) were evaluated by a one-to-one interview for each of the three drug classes (C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, and C. parapsilosis). For the reference case, the case was classified as “nonsignificant” and the control case as “unknown”. All three clinical reference cases (n = 3) were considered as “treatment failure” and the control case was considered as “no treatment at all times”.

The exclusion of the control case was based on the observation of a significant difference between the data of the two groups, the comparison of the treatment failure and the treatment success of the treated group, and the comparison of the treatment success of the control group with the treated group. For the second step, all the data obtained from the three clinical reference cases were combined with the data of the control case. The statistical analysis was performed by the computer analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the log-rank test was used to compare the two groups. The two groups were treated as one continuous variable, and the data were analyzed by the log-rank test, as described above.

Protein abundance and staining for Candida spp.
C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. dubliniensis ATCC 35218 were used as the experimental and control samples, respectively. C. albicans ATCC 90028 was cultured in YPD liquid medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30°C. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS. The cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber and then diluted to a final concentration of 2 × 10^3 cells/mL.

For the quantification of the Candida spp., the Candida spp.


## Results
dahliae isolates and the general trends of clinical data are presented in Table . A total of 17 isolates were determined to be V. dahliae in their four-day culture (Table 1). Two isolates, V. dahliae 19A and 19B, were used as positive controls for both drug classes in order to determine their drug activity. The other four isolates were used as negative controls to determine the antifungal activity of a yet unidentified drug in combination. The MIC_50, MIC_90, and MIC_90s of all isolates were 4 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml, and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

The MIC_90 of V. dahliae 19A and 19B was 4 µg/ml and 2 µg/ml, respectively, while the MIC_90 of V. dahliae 19A was 0.25 µg/ml and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1). MIC_90 values of V. dahliae 19A were higher than those of the other V. dahliae isolates (1-5 µg/ml), but were comparable to those of the other V. dahliae isolates (1-5 µg/ml). The MIC_90 values of all V. dahliae isolates were 4 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml, and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

The MIC_90 values of the other V. dahliae isolates were 0.25 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

The MIC_90 values of the V. dahliae isolates were 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

MIC_90 values of the V. dahliae isolates were 4 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

Determination of MICs of the other antifungal drugs
The MIC_90 values of V. dahliae isolates were 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively (Table 1).

The MIC_90 values of V.


## Discussion
We call this system, T-CDA, or ‘Target Analytical Dosing Monitoring. The ‘T-CDA’ system provides improved monitoring of drug concentrations in plasma. We refer to this system as ‘Target Analytical Dosing Monitoring’ if a drug is detected in plasma.

Target analysis of the T-CDA system is shown in Fig 3. We compared the ‘T-CDA’ system with ‘Target Analytical Dosing Monitoring’ in order to evaluate the T-CDA’ system for the remaining therapeutic dose. The ‘T-CDA’ system detected the drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.2 µg/mL. The T-CDA system in Fig 3 also detected a drug concentration in plasma at a median of 3.2 µg/mL. We then compared the ‘T-CDA’ system with ‘Target Analytical Dosing Monitoring’ in order to evaluate the ‘T-CDA’ system for the remaining therapeutic dose. The ‘T-CDA’ system detected the drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.2 µg/mL. The T-CDA system in Fig 3 also detected a drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.2 µg/mL. We then compared the ‘T-CDA’ system with ‘Target Analytical Dosing Monitoring’ in order to evaluate the ‘T-CDA’ system for the remaining therapeutic dose. The ‘T-CDA’ system detected the drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.2 µg/mL. This T-CDA system was also found in the plasma of a patient with a history of multiple organ rejection and had a median drug concentration of 1.9 µg/mL (Fig 3).

The ‘T-CDA’ system detected the drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.2 µg/mL. The ‘T-CDA’ system detected the drug concentration in plasma at a median of 3.2 µg/mL. The T-CDA system in Fig 3 also detected a drug concentration in plasma at a median of 2.
