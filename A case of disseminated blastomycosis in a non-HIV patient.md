## Abstract
The use of biologic agents for the treatment of infectious diseases is increasing, as a result of the successful human examples of the art against this disease. The use of metagenomic, genotoxic and other agents for the treatment of experimental fungal diseases have been reported in clinical trials, as well as in the literature. The aim of this review is to compile the current knowledge about fungal agents and their applications for the treatment of experimental infections in order to describe their advantages and limitations. A special emphasis is placed on their use for the treatment of experimental infections in order to describe the possible side effects and to give an example of the most appropriate approach in order to explain the experimental approach in fungal medicine.


## Introduction
The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) fungal pathogens has been described in recent years and, as a result of their expanded host range, many species are now causing serious nosocomial infections in both humans and veterinary animals (Kluger et al., 2016; Steinbach et al., 2016). Of these, most are caused by Candida species (Kleps et al., 2015) and are associated with high mortality rates (Kleps et al., 2015).

Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause mucosal and invasive infections, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and nails (Kleps et al., 2015). It is a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and the oral cavity, and it is also a commensal of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts, and it is also the most common microorganism in the skin (Kleps et al., 2015). It is estimated that more than one million people in the United States are susceptible to C. albicans infection annually (Chen et al., 2012; Steinbach et al., 2016). In hospitalized patients, C. albicans can cause hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (Buchanan et al., 2012; Steinbach et al., 2016). In the United States, the incidence of C. albicans bloodstream infections has increased 20-fold since 1999, when the incidence of C. albicans was estimated to be 7-fold higher (Kleps et al., 2015). However, C. albicans is still a common pathogen in hospital settings and the mortality rates of these infections are not due to Candida disease, but to the high frequency of C. albicans infections in the environment (Kleps et al., 2015).

The increasing number of non-albicans Candida species, and the fact that they can cause infections in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals (Kleps et al., 2015), have attracted increasing attention and attention from researchers. These species are now being recognized as human pathogens, and some of them are associated with hospital-acquired infections (Jemal et al., 2013; Klamb et al., 2016; Steinbach et al., 2016). In fact, more than 300 human-pathogenic species have been identified as human pathogens (Schrettl et al.

## Results
There were no patients with a systemic infection, and one patient was receiving corticosteroid. Her primary diagnosis was a disseminated candidiasis, and her AIDS-defining condition was confirmed by culture-proven serum reactive with human serum albumin (HRRA). She died in hospital, but was found to be in excellent health, and was receiving chemotherapeutic treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. Her clinical features and laboratory findings are described in Table 1.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is reported to cause an acute pneumonia, and it is considered a life-threatening bacterial infection. There are few reports on mycobacteria in the USA, but the mycobacterial strains isolated from infants are considered sensitive, and may cause limited symptoms and signs of pneumonia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is most frequently found in the respiratory tract of infants, and was isolated from a 1-week-old infant (Table 2).

Meningoencephalitis and disseminated disseminated tuberculosis are the most common causes of pneumonia in the elderly. Meningoencephalitis is more common in the male population, with 29 cases of meningitis reported in 2012 and 37 cases reported in 2013. Meningoencephalitis and disseminated tuberculosis are both very common, with 25 and 11 cases of disseminated tuberculosis, respectively. In the HIV-negative population, the most common causes of pneumonia are pulmonary tuberculosis, which is not fatal in most people [4,44,46,47].

Table 2 shows the risk of disseminated pneumonitis and disseminated pneumonitis in the elderly, the use of corticosteroids and the use of non-sterile methods.

Mycobacteria
Pneumonia is present in nearly all cases in the elderly, and it is considered the most common cause of pneumonia. The pneumococcal antigen (Pneumococcus) is a non-sterile agent that is used by immunosuppressed patients to control pneumonitis [48,49]. It is mainly used to control pneumonia [50]. There are two types of pneumococcal antigen: the mild type and the non-severe type. The mild type is pneumococcal antigen, and it is used in many different ways in the immunosuppressed population [51]. The non-severe type is the most common pneumococcal antigen, and its use in immunosuppressed patients is considered to be non-sterile [52].


## Discussion
The patient had a previous history of disseminated blastomycosis and was immunocompromise. After exposure to T. mentagrophytes, a case of disseminated blastomycosis was reported in an immunocompetent patient (12).

Our patient had a previous history of disseminated blastomycosis and was immunocompromised. After exposure to T. mentagrophytes, a case of disseminated blastomycosis was reported in an immunocompetent patient (12).

We identified three other cases of disseminated blastomycosis in the literature (13, 14). All three cases were immunocompromised and presented with disseminated blastomycosis in the absence of other factors. Two of these cases presented with severe neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. Two of these patients had lymphadenopathy and a history of lymph node biopsy. The third case had a history of lymph node biopsy and presented with disseminated blastomycosis. The first case had a history of disseminated blastomycosis and had a history of lymph node biopsy. The second case had a history of lymph node biopsy.

In this case, the patient had lymphadenitis, a common lymphadenopathy, and had a history of lymph node biopsy. The patient had a history of lymph node biopsy, but had no neutropenia and was immunocompromised. The patient had a history of lymph node biopsy, but had no lymph node biopsy.
