## Abstract
The key players of cytokinesis are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae and S. pombe both use intracellular signalling pathways similar to human macrophages. However, S. pombe has a distinct pattern of pattern release from solitary tract cells and the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase II subunit DnaR has been proposed to play important roles in this process. Using RNA-Seq data, we further identify a role for DnaR activity for meiosis and spermatogenesis. These results provide insight into the fundamental role of DnaR that is likely to be dispensable for normal and cytokine-dependent maturation but might be necessary in S. pombe.

In this study, we further characterize the role of DnaR in the process of sexual reproduction and the independent role of S. pombe DnaR in this process.


## Introduction
Some studies on dermatophytes have focused on the association of microbial species and the use of plant extracts as plant extracts. However, studies about the antifungal activity of plant extracts are much more complicated and involve different plant organs and organs of the plant’s life cycle. For instance, fungal species may act as biofilm cells on the surface of agricultural equipment, crop plants and weeds, and they may also act as opportunistic pathogens of human and animal health [1,2]. Fungi are of interest because they cause a number of life threatening infections which are often difficult to treat, and with such a high mortality rate [3]. Fungi are not only a source of human disease but also a source of significant economic loss worldwide [4]. As a consequence, there is a need for discovery of new antifungal drugs, and as an alternative to the existing drugs, natural products have emerged as a promising source of new drugs against microbial diseases [5].

Natural products are a rich source of molecules that are promising candidates for the development of new drugs against microbial diseases [6,7].


## Methods
novo strains isolated from foodborne contamination, dust, waste, dead animals, and even food in humans were used in this stud. Each strain was isolated and subcultured from fresh P. novo in sterilized flasks containing 10 ml of sterile nutrient broth (SBS) broth in 96-well plates at 37°C for 6 h. The yeast cells were then filtered through sterile Miracloth (Calbiochem) and subsequently diluted 1:10 into SBS-S buffer (0.1 M citrate, 0.15 M sodium citrate, and 0.02% Tween 80) to reach a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/ml. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The number of CFUs per ml was counted.

To identify the specific activity of the proteins, the MTT activity assay (Dupont et al., 2018) was used as previously described (Borenfreund et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018). The assay was performed using 10 µM of the tested enzymes at the MIC, for each test group, and then the MTT activity was calculated using the following equation: (MIC = MIC-MIC) × 100×(MIC-MIC) = 100× (MIC-MIC_MTT) × 100× (MIC_MIC_Biotec) × 100× (MIC_MIC_Biotec) × 100× (MIC_MTT_MTT). The MTT values obtained from the assay are expressed as the percentage of activity in which the MTT value is above the MIC value.

Antifungal Activity of Candida novelerensis and C. albicans
The antifungal activity of Candida novelerensis and C. albicans was measured using the MTT assay as previously described (Borenfreund et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018).


## Results
noannanum and . neoformans, we performed a comparative analysis of the total and proteomic data (see Material and Methods). We generated proteomic profiles of the non-redundant (nr) fungal sequences using the C. neoformans ExPASy pipeline, and identified several proteome features that could be used to assess fungal community composition in P. noannum and C. neoformans. In addition, we used a BLASTX analysis tool to identify additional protein-protein interactions (see Material and Methods).

To test the extent of co-expression of the candidate fungal fungal genes, we performed a co-expression experiment in which each of the three P. noannum and C. neoformans strains co-express one or more of the three PASyme genes (Fig 1a). We found that co-expression of both genes resulted in significant enrichment of the proteomic profiling data, which was further validated by a co-expression assay (Fig 1b). The enrichment of co-expression for each of the three PASyme genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig 1b). The co-expression assay revealed that the two PASyme genes were able to express their respective proteomic profiles in a parallel manner (Fig 1c).

The co-expression of both PASyme genes produced significant enrichment of the proteome data when compared with co-expression for both the P. kudriavzevii and P. brasiliensis populations (Fig 1d). In addition, co-expression of both PASyme genes resulted in significant enrichment of the proteome data for P. brasiliensis (Fig 1d). In summary, the co-expression of both PASyme genes resulted in significant enrichment of the fungal proteomic data for both fungal species.

In silico Interactions between PASyme and Cryptococcus
We next wanted to test whether PASyme-C. neoformans co-expression could influence the fungal community structure in poultry. To test this, we analyzed the co-expression of the two PASyme genes using the C. neoformans ExPASy pipeline. After performing real-time RT-PCR, the co-expression assay revealed significant enrichment of the proteome data for both PASyme genes for both the P.


## Discussion
While this genus was previously considered as a separate genus from that of . cerevisiae (Gogoi et al. 2009), the genus is also known as a distinct genus in Salmo, since there is no discernible species in Salmo. The fact that this genus is present in Salmo suggests that it may be a distinct genus, or even species, in Salmo.

The genus Cryptococcus contains the type species, C. krusei, which is a relatively common species in the Salmo region (Figs. 2 and 3). This species has been isolated from salons in Salmo, but not from Perna, so that could be because of the salinity in this region. The type species of the genus Cryptococcus is the type strain, C. krusei. However, this strain is more closely related to S. cerevisiae than to Cryptococcus neoformans (Fig 2). Cryptococcus, as the type species of Cryptococcus, is more commonly found on human skin (Gogoi et al. 2009). However, in our study, this strain was isolated from a Salmo chicken, and not from Salmo pigs. Therefore, it is possible that this strain is actually a strain isolated from pigs, which is not rare in the Salmo region.

The genus Malassezia is a polyphyletic family of Malassezia. This family comprises strains of Malassezia (namely Malassezia and Malassezia complex) that are multinucleate, multiseptate, multiseptate, multilateral, and multilobulate, with a single cyst (Bandoni et al. 2002). Malassezia (Malassezia) is considered to be a multicellular organism, and Malassezia spp.
