## Abstract
The first case of pulmonary cryptococcosis with pulmonary oedema due to Cryptococcus sp. is reported from a patient who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal cramps. A computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed multiple ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe. The patient was started on empiric antifungals, but succumbed to his illness. This case illustrates the importance of a prompt diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis and a careful patient's medical history, as well as the possibility of coinfections with the filamentous fungus Cryptococcus spp. in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries (Van de Veerdonk et al., 2017). Though many fungal pathogens can cause life-threatening diseases, fungal pathogens are the third leading cause of deaths in the United States (Park et al., 2009).

One of the most common invasive fungal infections is candidiasis, which is defined as a fungal infection that causes systemic or mucosal tissue infections in the bloodstream and the central nervous system (Powett and Diekema, 2006). Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive candidiasis in the United States (Park et al., 2009). This species can cause a life-threatening disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS, hematological malignancies, diabetes, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and other patients with immunodeficiency disorders (Buchanan et al., 2012).

The incidence of candidemia has increased substantially over the past decades due to a dramatic increase in the number of patients with hematological malignancy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and organ transplantation (Johnson et al., 2002).

Currently, the most common invasive fungal infection is candidiasis. The main agents of candidemia are Candida albicans (C. albicans), Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis.


## Methods
The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with .2% gelatin. The assay was performed in duplicate and three biological replicates per condition. The assay was performed in a final volume of 50 µL in RPMI-1640 with glucose (Gibco) as the carbon source, and 1.0% of the pH of the medium was used as a negative control. The final assay volume was adjusted to a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate in 96-well plates in triplicate wells. The results were evaluated with the microplate reader at a value of the median absorbance of the wells relative to that of the control.

The method of Murashige and Skoog (1959) was used to evaluate the anti-Candida potential of Berberine Derivatives. This method is known to be accurate in detecting the anti-Candida potential of a given product, such as in vitro inhibition of keratinocyte formation, inhibition of the yeast growth, and inhibition of the growth of Candida spp. [16]. The assay was performed in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates in triplicate wells. The results were evaluated with the microplate reader at a value of the median absorbance of the wells relative to that of the control.

The method of Brown et al. (1999) was used to evaluate the anti-Candida potential of Berberine Derivatives, following the recommendations in the CLSI guidelines [16]. The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates in triplicate wells. The results were evaluated with the microplate reader at a value of the median absorbance of the wells relative to the control.

In Vivo Evaluation of the Anti-Candida Potential of Berberine Derivatives
The antifungal activity of Berberine Derivatives was evaluated in 96-well microtiter plates in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 0.2% gelatin. The assay was performed in triplicate and three biological replicates per condition.


## Results
albicans activity against the two . aureus strains (CBS 135414 and CBS 135421) and for their anti-fungal activity against C. albicans. In this study, Berberine (1.25 µM) was used as a positive control for the evaluation of the anti-fungal potential of the tested Berberine derivatives. The preliminary antifungal activity of Berberine derivatives against C. albicans strains was shown in Figure 3. Berberine (2 µM) and the berberine-resveratrol (Aralycin) showed better anti-fungal activity than the respective compounds (Figure 3). Berberine (1 µM) showed a better antifungal activity than the respective compounds (Figure 3).

The activity of Berberine derivatives against C. albicans was also evaluated by the anti-fungal activity of the crude extracts from the three S. aureus strains. No activity was seen against the C. albicans strains at the concentration of 10 µM (Figure 4). Berberine derivatives also showed better antifungal activity against S. aureus strains at concentrations of 10 and 20 µM, respectively (Figure 4).

The antifungal activity of Berberine derivatives was also evaluated by the anti-fungal activity of the crude extracts from the three S. aureus strains. The crude extracts were evaluated for their antifungal activity against all three strains (Table 1). Berberine derivatives showed a better anti-fungal activity than the respective compounds against all the three S. aureus strains. The crude extracts showed better antifungal activity than the compounds that were tested against S. aureus strains (Table 1).

Berberine (1 µM) and the berberine-resveratrol (Aralycin) were also evaluated for their antifungal activity against C. albicans. No activity was found against C. albicans (Figure 5).

Berberine (2 µM) and the berberine-resveratrol (Aralycin) were also evaluated for their antifungal activity against C. albicans.


## Discussion
The in vitro activity of the probed probed compounds was inversely proportional to the dose of the tested compound (Figure 1A. The anti-Candida compound was inversely proportional to the dose of the purified probed compound. The concentration of the tested compound in the serum of mice was significantly higher than that of the tested compound in the in vitro test, suggesting that the probed compounds may be active in vitro against the human fungal pathogen C. neoformans. The in vitro activity of the probed compounds was inversely proportional to the dose of the tested compound. The in vitro activity of the probed compounds was inversely proportional to the dose of the purified compound. In addition, the in vitro activity of the probed compounds was inversely proportional to the concentration of the purified compound (Figure 1B). In addition, the in vitro activity of the probed compounds was inversely proportional to the concentration of the purified compound (Figure 1C). The in vitro activity of the probed compounds was inversely proportional to the concentration of the purified compound (Figure 1D). These results suggest that the probed compounds may be active in vitro against C. neoformans, although the compound is not fungicidal.
