## Abstract
Endobronchial masses are a rare but devastating complication of endoscopic cutaneous leishmaniasis.

We report the case of a 25-year-old woman with endobronchial masses at the fifth cranial nerve, bilateral pleural effusion, and bilateral pleural effusion inoperational chemotherapy. She had a past medical history that included liver failure, diabetes mellitus, and transplantation. She was diagnosed with endobronchial masses syndrome (ES) and treated with an anti-nocita agent. She had a normal pregnancy and achieved normoglycolic levels of 6 months of weight loss in the first and last trimester, and she had no systemic rashes.

The ES is a rare complication of endobronchial masses and may be caused by several pathogenic fungi, including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Candida, Rhizopus, and Malassezia species. It is still poorly understood what the causative fungus is, and whether it is a virulence factor or a mycoplasmic contagion factor. This study highlights the need for an accurate and comprehensive clinical diagnosis for these patients, and for future prospective studies that will better understand the pathogenesis of these complications.


## Introduction
Moreover, they may be associated with other infections such as skin and nail infections (4.

Since the first reported Candida albicans reference isolate was published in 1985, more than 1000 fungal species have been described since then. Currently, there are approximately 200 Candida species (5).

The life cycle of Candida albicans consists of three stages: adhesion, invasion, and escape. The adhesion stage is triggered by yeast attachment to host cells or tissue, followed by invasion and tissue invasion of the host tissues (6). The escape stage is triggered by hyphal cells, and the escape of the organism is triggered by hyphal morphogenesis. The transition from the yeast cell to the hyphal cell, or the transition from yeast to hyphal cells, is a complex process. The transition from yeast to hyphal cells, or the transition from yeast to hyphal cells, is a complex process. The yeast cells can invade and escape from the host cells (7). Candida albicans grows as a yeast cells and hyphal cells under different environmental conditions (8). The hyphal cells can fuse with the host cells, and the spores can reach the blood vessels of the host. Infected individuals may die from infection. The choice of the proper treatment depends on the route of inoculation. The first and last steps of the hyphal cell- invasion, invasion, and escape- are associated with the C. albicans hypha (9, 10). Therefore, an in vitro study of the infection process in the infected mouse and human host cells is useful to determine the levels of the immune response and the degree of the damage.

The morphology of the yeast cells varies depending on the species of the genus. Some species, such as Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei, can form true hyphae. However, other species, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei, are formed by cells of the ascomycetous yeast genus. The yeast cells can be divided into two morphological types: yeast and hyphal cells. The yeast cells form in the form of yeast cells. In contrast, hyphal cells are not in the form of hyphae and form in the form of hyphae only.


## Methods
fumigatus (AF10), . flavus (AF12), and A. niger (AF36). The clinical isolates were obtained from healthy patients, previously on the diagnosis of infection with Aspergillus, and were identified by the Pathogenic Fungi Bacterial Reference Laboratory (PERL) and Candida Genome Center (CGC) (Table 1).

Histopathology
The samples were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 µm and 3 µm. For histopathology, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining for Aspergillus, Asp, and Asp-like fungi. The samples were observed under a light microscope (Leica DM1000) and the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Immunohistochemical staining of the lesions was performed by a 4-µm-thick filter (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) using an isofluorane staining solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, United Kingdom) for fungi. A latex agglutination solution (Cambrex, São Paulo, Brazil) was used for Aspergillus. The cells were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for Asp, Asp-like fungi, and periodic acid Schiff staining for Asp-like fungi. The cells were observed under a light microscope (Leica DM1000) and the stained cells were characterized by silver staining.

The histological analysis was performed with a 3-µm-thick filter (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) using a standard culture procedure [49]. The stained cells were analyzed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The stained cells were examined under a light microscope (Leica DM1000) and the cells were analyzed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The staining was observed by light microscopy.

Statistical analysis
All the analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, USA).


## Results
In vivo susceptibility of C. albicans to B6B
For the first time, we have shown that B6B has potent anti-B. cinerea activity in vitro. Our previous study has shown that B6B has anti-B. cinerea activity in vitro against a wide range of filamentous fungi (2). In our model of infection, we have used B6B in the treatment of a group of patients with C. albicans infection with a bimodal systemic infection (9). To characterize the effect of B6B on the pathogenicity of C.


## Discussion
This result was suggested by the results of our study, which showed that the administration of 5 mg/kg of BK in the first trimester of pregnancy caused significant increases in the production of IL-12 and IL-13 in the IL-10-producing cells and significantly increased the production of IL-23 in the IL-13-producing cell. IL-12 and IL-23 are produced by the human PBMCs during the early stages of pregnancy and are considered to be markers for the development of the immune response to infections caused by fungi. In addition, IL-12 production by the phagocytic cells in the follicular and vagina during the first trimester of pregnancy can be considered to be a marker for the development of the inflammatory response to the infection caused by fungi. IL-12 is a major cytokine that plays an important role in the development of the Th17 response in the host, which is involved in the development of anti-microbial immunity. The production of IL-12 by phagocytic cells and the induction of Th17 responses can be considered to be markers for the development of the immune response to infection caused by fungi. IL-12 was also found to be an important cytokine that plays an important role in the development of the inflammatory response to infections caused by fungi. IL-12 can stimulate the Th1 and Th17 responses in the immune cells and induce the production of IL-22 and IL-23 by the T cell preconditioning cells. The cytokine IL-22 stimulates the production of IL-23 by the Th17-producing cells and the production of IL-33 by the Th1-producing cells. IL-33 is a key cytokine that plays an important role in the development of the immune response to infection caused by fungi. In addition, IL-33 is a key cytokine that plays an important role in the development of the immune response to infection caused by fungi. IL-33 can also induce the production of IL-22 by the T cell preconditioning cells and the induction of Th17 cells. IL-23 is produced by the phagocytic cells in the follicular and vaginal tissues during the first trimester of pregnancy.
