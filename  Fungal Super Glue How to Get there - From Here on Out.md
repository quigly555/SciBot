## Abstract
Fungi are important human pathogens because of their wide host ranges and the limited number of suitable available natural products. The high cost of production and the difficulty of controlling the proliferation of fungi and the emergence of resistance make many of these fungi attractive targets for development of new therapeutic approaches. Natural products and their synthetic derivatives constitute a great source of drug candidates that can be used to combat fungal infections. The synthesis of single-partic products and the availability of information on their biological activities make them ideal candidates to treat fungal infections.

Here, we introduce the first derivatives from the genus Thielavia, a member of the Neurospora, and evaluate their antitumor and anti-fungal activity. These compounds were isolated from the culture filtrate of a Neurospora crenarcha strain. The compounds were characterized by mass spectrometry and mass-ubiquitination atrines. Furthermore, by using SDA-based assays.


## Introduction

For the field-grown fungal species, there is a huge number of data availabl. The field is able to aggregate and rank data on data from various sources and from different habitats (air, soil, animals, plants, and microbes) [9]. As a result, a great deal of work has been undertaken in order to develop bioreactors able to aggregate data from the various habitats in the fungal kingdom and separate the most significant from other strains. Among the various substrates used for the analysis of the data are media, sources and media. For the purpose of this review, the substrates used are as follows: (i) the plant as a whole (i.e., plant-associated fungi) and (ii) soil as a habitat. In this review, we will focus on the most relevant substrates for fungal-associated plant-fungal interactions. The next sections will cover fungal-associated plant-fungal interactions as well as other aspects related to fungi. The study of soil fungal-associated interactions will be discussed in the following section. The work presented in this review will also be considered as an overview of fungi-associated plant-fungal interactions.

The soil environment is one of the most important components of the fungal life cycle. It is dominated by micro-organisms, which are present throughout the soil. Most studies have focused on the fungal-root system, but there are studies focusing on the root system of fungi. The root system of the plant is under cultivation in the field, where they grow as micro-organisms. These micro-organisms produce substances called mycelia that are used by the fungi to produce their compounds (i.e., metabolites). Therefore, the mycelia of plants can provide nutrients to the fungi and thus, the fungus can use these metabolites as energy for growth and for producing secondary metabolites. Furthermore, the fungal mycelia can produce metabolites, which are beneficial for the fungi and the plant. It has been shown that, in addition to metabolites, the mycelia also provide many other compounds, such as amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, sugars, alkaloids, or alkaline hydrocarbons, which are needed for the synthesis of secondary metabolites [10]. Therefore, the mycelia of plants can provide beneficial compounds for the fungi.


## Methods

Fungal Transformation
As we have already seen, the amino acid sequence for the pathogenic fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae was changed to the “1” in a previous study (Dowle and Lo, 2018. The transformed fungus was kept on a 70% glucose agar plate at 28 °C. On the first day, the plate was inoculated with a single colony of the fungus on PDA plates. The resulting colony was inoculated with PDA plates containing 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% dextrose, 1% NaCl, 1% KCl, 0.001% CaCl_2, 0.002% MgSO_4, 0.001% ZnSO_4, 0.001% FeSO_4, 0.001% MnSO_4, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, and 1% glucose. On the second day, the plates were placed on PDA plates containing 1% glucose. On the third day, the plates were inoculated with the fungus on a PDA plate containing 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% dextrose, 1% KCl, 0.001% MgSO_4, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% MgSO_4, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% MgSO_4, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_3, 0.001% CoCl_3, 0.001% CoCl_3, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_3, and 1% glucose. On the sixth day, the plates were inoculated with the fungus on a PDA plate containing 1% glucose. On the seventh day, the plates were inoculated with the fungus on a PDA plate containing 1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% dextrose, 1% KCl, 0.001% MgSO_4, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.001% CoCl_2, 0.


## Results
The first one was collected from an infected wheat field and the other two were collected from the same location and time of the fiel. The final samples were collected in a separate and distinct manner and were processed. The overall DNA content of the isolates was as follows: 0.25 g L^-1 (n = 3) in total lysates and 0.25 g L^-1 (n = 3). The most prevalent species in the wheat rusts was Aspergillus spp. Aspergillus spp. was more common than Aspergillus spp. in all samples, but in the wheat field, Aspergillus spp. was found in the most common culture. A number of Aspergillus spp. were also found in the different regions of the wheat rusts. Aspergillus spp. was found in the N6, N7, and N8 samples, but Aspergillus spp. was found in all the N5, N6, N7, and N8 samples. The most common Aspergillus spp. in the wheat rusts was Aspergillus niger, but Aspergillus spp. was found in the N4, N7, and N8 samples.

In addition, most Aspergillus spp. were found in the different regions of the wheat rusts. In the N6, N7, and N8 samples, Aspergillus spp. were found in the N4, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, N5, and N5 samples, but Aspergillus spp. was found in the N3, N4, N5, N5, and N5 samples. The most common Aspergillus spp. in the wheat rusts were Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus spp., and Aspergillus niger was found in the N4, N5, N5, N5, N5, and N5 samples. The most common Aspergillus spp.


## Discussion
This case highlights the importance of early detection of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. When patients develop symptoms, signs or symptoms suggestive of invasive fungal infections, the need to perform a complete autopsy, is of great importance. In this case, the autopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis of the infection, and the patient's autopsy was able to complete the diagnosis.

Atypical features of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with HIV are seen in less than 5% of cases. Although cryptococcosis is not rare in immunocompetent hosts, the diagnosis is important in the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Histological examination is not always available to diagnose cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients.
