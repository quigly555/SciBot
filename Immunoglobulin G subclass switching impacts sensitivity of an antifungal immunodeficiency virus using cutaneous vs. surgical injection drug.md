## Abstract
The aim of this study was to analyze the association between chemical compounds detected in the atmosphere and the concentrations of oxygen and NO in the air during the summer months of 2016-2017. Air samples were collected from 14 locations in 7 provinces of China. The statistical analysis identified that the concentration of the compounds most correlated to the summer months was the mean value of the linear regression model AAPR (AAPR = 0.71). In the model AAPR, the correlation between the concentrations of the compounds and the summer months were found for 75% of the correlations. The concentrations of the compounds found most correlated to the summer months were benzalkonium chloride (22.7 ± 0.39 p.i.) (AAPR = 0.55) and limonene (13.1 ± 0.32 p.i.) (AAPR = 0.33), followed by osmium gallenin (12.9 ± 0.29 p.i.) (AAPR = 0.32) and the concentration of its monoterpene derivative (6.1 ± 0.24 p.i.) (AAPR = 0.25).


## Introduction
The ascomycetous fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes cryptococcosis, a life-threatening disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is the most common form of the disease, with over 400,000 cases of meningoencephalitis per year globally, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and sub-Saharan Europe [1, 2]. This disease is acquired by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast from environmental sources [3]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the major risk factor for cryptococcosis. The prevalence of HIV infection has increased significantly over recent decades, which may be attributed to the expanding population of patients with other immunodeficiency disorders [4].

In the context of HIV infection, a number of antiretroviral drugs (ARTs) have been available in clinical use [5]. However, treatment of cryptococcal infections remains challenging due to the limited treatment options in resource-limited settings. The development of newer generation ARTs, especially flucytosine [6], may be viewed as a promising approach to improve the management of cryptococcal disease. In this regard, there are limited data from the field on the clinical outcomes of ARTs using fluconazole and itraconazole in combination, particularly when compared with other ARTs.

For the prevention and treatment of cryptococcosis, a clinical regimen consisting of three major classes, including amphotericin B (AmB), flucytosine (5FC), and voriconazole (VRC), is recommended in South Africa [7]. The highest oral AmB concentration of the current clinical regimen is recommended for first-time administration for cryptococcal disease. AmB is a component of the usual first-line regimen of amphotericin B-based second-line antifungal therapy and is not recommended for first-time-trimemetics due to the presence of high levels of resistance [7].


## Methods
When the drug was given intravenously, the control group received a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weigh. Injected drugs were only given when the body weight was at least 90% of the maximum weight that the drug was used for. Infected organs and tissue were considered “injected”. The antifungal agent was included in all assays. The infection rate was calculated according to the percentage of the control group that was infected with the antifungal drug. The percent of the infected group that was infected with the control drug was calculated as follows: Infected group: 100%

Percent of the infected group that was infected with the antifungal drug was calculated as follows: Infected group: 100%

The fungal burden was calculated according to the following:

Cells from the whole body were used for survival study. Briefly, the cell suspensions were prepared as previously described. The cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100 µl of cell suspension was added to the cell suspensions. After this, the cells were mixed by pipetting and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The cell suspension was then filtered through 0.45 µm cell strainer (Millipore). The cell suspension was serially diluted and plated on agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, and the CFUs were calculated as previously described. The experiment was repeated three times.

2.7. Determination of the Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity was determined in a 96-well microtiter plate (Cellic-X; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The antifungal agent, Amphotericin B, was diluted to a concentration of 0.01 to 1 mg/mL and added to the well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The optical density of the well was read at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested organisms. The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested fungi.

## Results
The range of drug combinations used in the ANOVA analysis was significantly different between drug combinations of interest (P < .05). The sensitivity of an antifungal drug combination to the drug combination of interest is depicted in Table 2.

Mortality was significantly higher in the oral candidiasis group compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

The antifungal drug combination of interest (no drug combination) of the clinical isolate of interest (bud) significantly increased the odds of death by more than 3 log_10 log_10 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.2 [1.0-9.2]; P < 0.05). No drug combination of interest was used in the comparison of the drug combination of an isolate of interest to an antifungal drug combination of interest.

The most resistant group to an antifungal drug combination was the oral candidiasis group (Bud) group. No drug combination of interest was used in the comparison of the drug combination of an isolate of interest to an antifungal drug combination of interest.

The antifungal drug combination of an isolate of interest (bud) significantly increased the odds of death by more than 3 log_10 log_10 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.2 [1.0-9.2]; P < 0.05).

Mortality was significantly higher in the oral candidiasis group compared with the control group (P < 0.05)

The most resistant group to an antifungal drug combination was the oral candidiasis group (Bud) group. No drug combination of interest was used in the comparison of the drug combination of an isolate of interest to an antifungal drug combination of interest.

The most resistant group to an antifungal drug combination was the surgical injection drug group (bud) group. No drug combination of interest was used in the comparison of the drug combination of an isolate of interest to an antifungal drug combination of interest.

The most resistant group to an antifungal drug combination was the skin rash group (Bud) group.


## Discussion
Thus, when patients are given a vedolizumab in combination with tacrolimus, they experience a reduction in infection with a lower risk of VDV infection [19.

The frequency of VDV infection has been reported to be very low [20], probably due to the fact that the patient is a smoker [21], in which an increased risk of VDV infection has been reported [21].

The rate of VDV infection in the current study was 5.8%, which is much higher than the rates reported for other studies [20, 23]. In addition, the rates reported in the current study were lower than those in other studies [20, 23, 24, 25]. This may be due to the fact that the VDV serotype is not completely genetically identical to VDV [26], which could explain the higher rate of VDV infection in this group.

In our study, patients who received VDV were more likely to present with a viral infection, including a bacterial infection, as previously reported [23]. In our study, VDV serotype was associated with risk of CMV infection in the immunocompetent population [20, 23]. We therefore decided to investigate the risk of CMV infection in the immunocompetent population to find a relationship between the frequency of VDV infection and the frequency of CMV infection.

In our study, the rate of CMV infection was significantly associated with the frequency of VDV infection (P = 0.039). This is similar to that in studies in which VDV serotype was identified as a risk factor for CMV infection [27]. A previous study also reported a low risk of VDV infection in patients with CMV infection [28].

In our study, VDV infection was significantly associated with risk of HIV infection (P = 0.039). This is similar to studies in which the HIV infection was identified as a risk factor for VDV infection [28]. The study also reported a low risk of VDV infection in HIV infected patients [29]. In the current study, the frequency of VDV infection was significantly associated with the frequency of HIV infection (P = 0.039).
