## Abstract
The fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a common human pathogen and causes paracoccidioidomycosis, the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. The fungus is commonly found in the environment, human and animals, and the food and drink industry. However, sporacrolides are an important group of fungi that are known to be able to survive in various environmental niches, such as the food industry. The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in survival strategies and virulence factor expression in P. brasiliensis. Using a microarray approach, we identified the putative transcript activators, transcription factors and regulators of P. brasiliensis. The identification of these genes may have wider application in the study of the fungus and its virulence factors.


## Introduction
The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is commonly found in the soil, air, and water and is referred to as the most common opportunistic pathogen in humans. Invasive aspergillosis is a very rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, the treatment of invasive aspergillosis relies mainly on the use of antifungal agents that have a low incidence in clinical practice. In order to avoid life-threatening invasive aspergillosis, the fungus is usually induced by the production of factors such as mycotoxins, mycosporin, or fungal keratitis. The production of fungal factors is mainly induced by A.


## Methods
cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table . Yeast strains were grown overnight in YPD at 30°C and then washed in 1xPBS (pH 7.0) to remove mycelial plugs. The cultures were inoculated on a PDA plate and incubated at 30°C for 1-2 weeks. Inoculated PDA plates were then incubated at 30°C and examined periodically for fungal growth. Growth of S. cerevisiae isolates was assessed by observation of colony morphology, following the method described by Mears et al. (2008).

Morphological analyses of S. cerevisiae S-cad was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to assess the morphological changes observed in wild type and mutant strains. The S-cad spore suspensions were prepared in YPD at 30°C and inoculated onto PDA plates and incubated at 30°C. Colony colour was observed after 2 weeks.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
S. cerevisiae strains were grown overnight in YPD at 30°C and then washed in 1xPBS and transferred to PDA for 4 days at 30°C. The cells were then scraped from the cellophane membranes and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose for 1-2 h at 4°C. The samples were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose and post-fixed in 0.1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose for 1 h at 4°C. The samples were then washed with 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose for 1 h at 4°C. The samples were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose for 5 h at 4°C. The samples were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate-glutarose and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.


## Results
 1998; Jeffries et a., 2002). The Pectinoxylase and Pectinoxylase genes in the Pectinoxylase superfamily were characterized by proteomic analyses, including protein-protein interactions (Kim et al., 2008), transcriptional regulatory systems (Wang et al., 2008), and molecular genetics (Chakraborty et al., 2012). In the Pectinoxylase gene family, the transcriptional regulation of the Pectinoxylase gene cluster is controlled by P2P2 (Kim et al., 2008). The P2P2 transcription factor (P2P2-TAP) is the only Pectinoxylase gene in the Pectinoxylase superfamily that was recently characterized (Haddadi et al., 2014). In the Pectinoxylase gene family, P2P2 is the only Pectinoxylase gene that was recently characterized (Haddadi et al., 2014). The Pectinoxylase gene cluster also includes the Naphrinoxamine Phosphatase (Naph) gene (Haddadi et al., 2014). Naphrinoxamine Phosphatase (Naph-TAP) is a Pectinoxylase enzyme, a P2P2-TAP protein, and a P2P2-TAP protein that has a common paralog in the Pectinoxylase superfamily (Kim et al., 2008; Jeffries et al., 2002).


## Discussion

In this study, the identification of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of pectin, a common component of oleic acid, and the inhibition of oleic acid synthesis in . fumigatus was investigated.

The presence of pectin and its receptors has been found in various plant species (15, 16). The a-1,2-glucan synthase (AFUB_00573.1) involved in pectin synthesis in A. fumigatus, was shown to be upregulated by the PEP treatments, and the A. fumigatus PEP inhibited pectin synthesis (16). The a-1,2-glucan synthase (AFUB_00572.1) involved in pectin synthesis in A. fumigatus was shown to be upregulated by the PEP treatments, and the A. fumigatus PEP inhibited pectin synthesis (16). In addition, the a-1,2-glucan synthase (AFUB_00572.1) involved in the synthesis of pectin in A. fumigatus was shown to be upregulated by the PEP treatments, and the A. fumigatus PEP inhibited pectin synthesis (16). The a-1,2-glucan synthase (AFUB_00572.1) involved in the synthesis of pectin in A. fumigatus was shown to be upregulated by the PEP treatments, and the A. fumigatus PEP inhibited pectin synthesis (16).
