## Abstract
Our previous studies indicated that Cncommensaliae melanin performs a role in host-pathogen interactions. To investigate its significance, the genome sequences of ten Malassezia restricta and Cncommensaliae strains were sequenced and compared with the Malassezia globosa and Plasmodium virens genomes. The genomes of the ten Malassezia strains differed significantly in four major gene clusters: genes related to photosynthesis, genes involved in photoynthesis and a-pheromone metabolism and secreted enzymes. The Malassezia genomes encoded genes that encode mainly secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, but also showed significant gene rearrangements that indicate they are pathogen-targeting protrusions. Analyses of Malassezia genomes revealed a large number of homologous genes that are absent from the genomes of Malassezia species. In addition, we identified several novel genes that appear to be under differential selection in the Malassezia clusters. These included malate dehydrogenase, key virulence determinants of Malassezia globosa, and aspartyl proteases.

## Methods
 has been identified as M-C as a greenish/white coloratio. A single colony of the plant was sampled and placed on Fava Netto’s agar medium for 3-4 days. The culture was harvested by filtration, washed with sterile water and then streaked onto fresh medium. The M-C production was estimated as 2 g·L^-1 after drying. The liquid broth was harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 30 min and the liquid phase was then partitioned using a sterilized cotton swab. The resulting conidial suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10^5 conidia·mL^-1 and used for the development of a strain of M-C as a white powder. The virulence of the strain was determined by incubating the M-C as a white powder in a 7:1 ratio for 2 h. The experiment was performed three times.

Biological Analysis
The spores were obtained from the frozen cells of the commercial strawberry (Rabotiella mellea) using a rapid freezing method (Nest Media, Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA). The frozen cells were suspended in 1 mL of RPMI 1640 media (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with sterile PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of RNase-free RPMI 1640 media and then the cells were lysed with 1 mL of RNase-free RPMI 1640 media. The total RNA was isolated using the RNA Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The concentration of the RNA was calculated using the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

The RNA-Seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE74948) [21].

Biological Analysis
The genomic DNA was extracted from the pep8-8 and pep8-12 genome assemblies using a CTAB protocol [22].


## Results
The most active compounds isolated from strawberry plants were amylacrid, gentamicin, penicillin, laminarin, and aminoglycoside (Table 1. However, all the antibiotics were well-established in the literature for their broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against C. albicans and C. neoformans [11,12]. We also found that the antibacterial activity of a wide range of antimicrobial compounds isolated from strawberry plants was highly diverse, with different antimicrobial compositions. For instance, most antibiotics were active against C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans (Table 1). Other antimicrobial compounds were highly active against most of the species examined (Table 1). For instance, aminoglycoside, gentamicin, laminarin, aminoglycoside, and aminoglycoside were well-established antimicrobial compounds against most of the organisms examined (Table 1). In addition, we found that most of the antibacterial compounds were active against all of the fungi examined (Table 1). We also found that the antimicrobial activity of a wide range of antibiotics from strawberry plants was highly diverse, with different antimicrobial compositions. For instance, some antimicrobial compounds were highly active against most of the fungi examined (Table 1).

Table 2 shows that the antimicrobial activities of the a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from strawberry plants were highly diverse. For instance, the antimicrobial activities of all of the antibiotics were highly diverse, with varying degrees of inhibition of C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans (Table 2). Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of some of the antimicrobial compounds isolated from strawberry plants were well-established antimicrobial compounds (Table 1).

Table 3 shows that the antibacterial activities of some of the antimicrobial compounds isolated from strawberry plants were highly diverse. For instance, all of the antimicrobial compounds isolated from strawberry plants were active against most of the organisms examined (Table 3).

## Discussion

The aflatoxin ring attached to the fungal membrane is known to be involved in different functions in the plant pathogenic proces. The aflatoxin ring of the fungal pathogens such as A. flavus and A. fumigatus are both involved in the conidial development, pathogenesis and virulence, but only in A. flavus it has been found to be involved in the response to adverse environmental conditions and in the development of plant disease (de Almeida et al. 2008; Zuccaro et al. 2013). The inhibition of aflatoxin ring of A. flavus by the azoxystrobin derivative azopyrogamycin (AFC) has been shown to decrease the fungal growth in vitro (Vazquez et al. 2000). Another study reported that the aflatoxin ring attached to fungal membrane, was also found to be involved in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus (de Almeida et al. 2008). The role of the fungal membrane as a barrier against the external environment is also related to the formation of a complex polysaccharide capsule, and the conidiation of the fungal cells in the presence of AFC (Vazquez et al. 2000).

In conclusion, our results provide a new information about the aflatoxin ring in A. flavus that is involved in the biosynthesis of flavan-3-ols, which has previously been reported to be the major aflatoxin of A. flavus, in planta. Our results showed that A. flavus possesses aflatoxin ring, and that this flavan-3-ols are involved in the biosynthesis of aflatoxin, and the biosynthesis of aflatoxin is regulated by the presence of aflatoxin ring. In addition, the metabolites of A. flavus produced by these two species are of interest.

The biological activity of flavan-3-ols is considered as a result of their antioxidant activity (Punis et al. 2011). The antioxidant activity of flavan-3-ols was shown to be related to the inhibition of the aflatoxin production by A. fumigatus. This was confirmed by the inhibition of aflatoxin production by Fusarium oxysporum.

In conclusion, this study provides new information about aflatoxin ring in A.
