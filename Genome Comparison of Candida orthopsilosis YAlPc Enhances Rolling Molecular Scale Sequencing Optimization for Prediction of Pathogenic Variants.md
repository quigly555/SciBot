## Abstract
To determine the prevalence of opportunistic infections and the risk factors for opportunistic infections in patients with metastatic cancer and its treatment, we performed a cross-sectional study among metastatic patients attending an Endocrine Cancer Center (CLCC) in Bogotá, Colombia. A total of 5,070 patients were enrolled: 1,940 of the 5,066 who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer and 1,880 of the 3,050 who were diagnosed with tuberculosis. The most common pathogens were bacteria (n = 825 [56.6%]) (n = 637 [27.4%]) and fungi (n = 5 (11.8%)). The most common co-infections was Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 637 [37.4%]) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5 (11.8%)). In the co-infection, 50.8% of the patients had an opportunistic infection, with the majority of this infection being the lungs. Candida was the most common organism (n = 529 [56.6%]) followed by Pseudallescheria (n = 25 [11.6%]) and dermatophytes (n = 20 [11.6%]). Overall, 194 patients were enrolled and 64 were male and 63 female, with a median age of 59 years (IQR: 40-84). Most patients (n = 98) were treated with oral fluconazole (64.7%) and restructuring oral fluticasides (RFL) (n = 20 [11.6%]) as effective regimens. Among the restructuring RFL, Candida albicans (n = 6.5%) was the most common pathogen (n = 20) followed by Candida dubliniensis (n = 5) and Candida glabrata (n = 3). Among the restructuring RFLs, Candida albicans (n = 2) and Candida tropicalis (n = 1) were the most common pathogens (n = 1). Among the restructuring patients, 114 (65.


## Introduction
Lignocellulose-derived dyes are a family of antimicrobial compounds, which include flavonoids, triterpenoids, chiralones, polysaccharides, glycosides and fatty acids.1,2 Their production, distribution and chemical structures are largely unknown. Their production in plants has been investigated mainly for the production of bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, triterpenes, glycosides, glycolipids, sponges, mushrooms, beeswax, silage and antibiotic compounds.3,4 In traditional Chinese medicine, the production of triterpene dyes was first studied by Huan et al.5 They first identified the glycoside hydroxamido group (GH) and the carotenoid carotene-ß-d-glucopyranoside glucoside glucoside (CDG) as major flavonoids. These compounds are used in traditional Chinese medicine as antihypertensive, antiulcer, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agents.6-8

CDG is a naturally occurring plant that is produced from rhizomes of the herb Eucalyptus stolonifera, which is used as a food source.9-11 The rhizome of Eucalyptus stolonifera contains glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and flavonoids.12,13 The glucosylceramide has various antimicrobial properties. GlcCer is generally considered to be a strong antimicrobial agent, as it has been reported to exhibit bactericidal and fungicidal effects.13-15 The mechanism of glucosylceramide action has been widely investigated.

Identification of the Key Metabolic Metabolites in C. albicans
We used a previously described dataset of the metabolic pathways in C. albicans. It was obtained from an open-access database of metabolic pathways, comprising metabolic pathways (e.g. protein kinase and peptide metabolism), metabolic pathways (e.g. phospholipase and phospholipase-dependent kinases and the metabolic pathway to the cell wall and cell membrane), and metabolic pathways (e.g. transesterolase and transporters and transporters). Based on the published metabolic pathway data, we used the following settings: in addition to those mentioned above, we ran the following analyses: metabolic pathway rate was set to 2.0, and the percentage of homologs of the metabolic pathway was set to 50%.

## Results
lipolytica, YALPc was first performed by measuring the expression of genes from different infection stages of . lipolytica. We selected 19 genes in which the YALPc obtained high transcript levels in the first step of the infection (stage 1) and identified the expression of most of them at stage 3 (stage 4). Based on this criterion, we then mapped the expression profiles of 19 genes to YALPc. Interestingly, among the selected genes, 17 genes exhibited higher transcript levels in stage 1 than in stage 3 (Figure 4A). Among them, two genes, MDRH1 and ITO1, showed higher transcript levels in stage 1 than in stage 3 (Figure 4A). A large number of genes with high transcript levels in stage 1 and stage 3 were also found in the promoter regions of YALPc genes, such as PRA2 and PLB1, which were targeted to the promoter regions of the genes with the highest expression in stage 1 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, we found that the expression of genes with high transcript levels in stage 1 was higher than that in stage 3, in terms of the number of promoters and the number of different types of promoters. These results indicated that the microsatellite sequence and the microsatellite data did not affect the transcript levels of YALPc genes in the previous study.

In the present study, we focused on the expression profiles of the 19 selected genes in the first stage of infection and evaluated the impact of the microsatellite sequence on microsatellite gene expression in Y. lipolytica. First, we investigated the microsatellite-specific expression profiles of the selected genes in the first stage of infection. We found that the expression profile of the selected genes was very similar in the first stage of infection (Figure 4C). For instance, at stage 1, the transcript levels of the selected genes were high in YALPc and similar to those in stage 3, in terms of the number of promoters and the number of different types of promoters. Conversely, the expression profiles of the selected genes were highly different in the first stage of infection (Figure 4C). For instance, the expression profile of the selected genes was high in YALPc, and the expression profiles of the selected genes were highly different in the first stage of infection (Figure 4C).


## Discussion
The MDP-MS is a non-acid-sensitive MDP-MS that has been widely used in medicine, as an antipsychotic, anti-paracrine, antipyramidal, and antidiabetic drugs [18,19,20]. Since MDP-MS has been used as a diuretic and anti-inflammatory agent, it has been considered as an effective therapeutic drug for post-transplant patients [21,22,23,24]. In this study, we have demonstrated that MDP-MS could increase the inflammatory responses in the CNS of patients with cryptococcosis and that this cytokine could enhance the immune system of the patients. Furthermore, the effects of MDP-MS on neurogenesis and disease progression in C. neoformans infection were similar to those of the anti-paracrine MDP-MS, and the anti-inflammatory drug MDP-MS has been reported to enhance the neurogenesis in C.
