## Abstract
 2013) and with different parasite strains (Viral et a., 2009). Clinical, laboratory, and serological data were collected, analyzed, and discussed. Discussion included: (i) recent seizures, (ii) the induction of destructive pancytopenia, (iii) the process of cerebral malaria, and (iv) the cross-talk. The results indicate that recent seizures and parasite strains are drivers of paradoxical neurosyphilis in young HIV-infected adults. Moreover, the cross-talk may be related to the neurosyphilis process.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection is a well-recognized complication in HIV-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between HIV coinfection and cerebral malaria.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV coinfected patients with and without cerebral malaria. Patients were classified as HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's definitions of “HIV-covers suspect of cerebral malaria” (n = 813). Patients without cerebral malaria were classified as either HIV-covers suspected of other infectious causes (n = 335), including Chagas' disease (n = 16), Bartalin's encephalopathy (n = 5), or other infectious causes (n = 12). Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the covariates.

Results: Among HIV-infected patients, the mean age of the study participants was 41.6 ± 9.3 years (inter-quartile range [IQR]: 33-51.6) and the median CD4 count was 207 cells/µL (IQR: 34-411). Among HIV-covers suspected of Chagas disease, HIV co-infected patients had a higher median CD4 count (median: 67 versus 90 cells/µL [IQR: 45-579]) and a higher HIV viral load (317.8 copies/mL [IQR: 179.4 to 312.7)] as well as CD4 count (317.8 vs. 331.9 cells/µL: -128 vs. -102 copies/mL [IQR: 151.0 to 386.7).


## Introduction
The ACI-IAM is a 3D structure with two lobed intracellular protrusions, where two divergent protrusions form at the intracellular en. The first intracellular protrusions are formed by the formation of the second protrusion by the formation of the first protrusions. The second intracellular site is formed by the formation of the first protrusions. Figure 1 illustrates the membrane association between the first and second protrusions of the ACI-IAM. This structure was described for the first time in 1992 by Goh and colleagues [23] and was described in 2008 by Newman and colleagues [24]. The first ACI-IAM was described in 2013 [25]. The two new protrusions formed by the first and second intracellular intracellular protrusions were described by de Goffau et al. [26]. The three new protrusions are illustrated in Figure 2, with the first protrusions formed by the formation of the second intracellular protrusions and the second intracellular site formed by the formation of the first protrusions.

The mechanisms that confer ACI-IAM parasitism are not yet clearly understood but the mechanism by which this parasite acquires nutrients from its host is not yet clearly established. The ACI-IAM is a complex, multi-facilitated process and one that is dependent upon host nutrient availability, metabolic flux, and the activity of immune cells [27]. Furthermore, the host is also confronted with the ability of the parasite to escape from its host by entering the host's body and establishing an infection [28]. Parasite-specific factors are involved in the host-parasite interaction. Several factors are involved in the infection process. The parasite acquires nutrients from its host; these nutrients include nutrients from the host and nutrients secreted by the parasite. There is a role for the host-parasite interaction in the nutrient acquisition process, which is mediated by the host immune response [29]. The host response is comprised of several different signaling pathways, which are categorized in four categories. Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DC) migrate to the site of infection to present antigen to T lymphocytes [30].


## Methods
We reviewed the review of the relevant literature and searched the databases through PubMed and Googl. Search terms used were: “CNS^®,” “CNS^®^®”, “Cryptococcus^®,” “Diseased”, “GFP”, “Hematocytic”, “Vaccine-Induced Cytotoxicity”, “Meningitis”, “Hypokalemia”, “Histoplasmosis”, “Hepatocellular Endothelial Peritoneal Fludiation”, and “Pneumocystis jirovecii infection”. All of the reviewed articles were included in the analysis.

Clinical and Epidemiological Studies
Patients were included in the present study if they were admitted to the ICU between 1 January 2008 and 30 January 2010 and had no identifiable cause of death (probable or possible). Patients were included in the present study if they had no identifiable cause of death (POCD) and did not have any other underlying diseases and were considered to be at risk for being at risk for developing CNS. They were also included in the present study if they were HIV negative and had no underlying diseases and were classified as at risk for CNS.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A two-tailed t-test was used to analyze the data. Continuous variables were analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and Student’s t-test.

The outcome of the present study was compared with the “informed consent” requirement. The outcome of the present study was compared with the “treatment success” requirement.

Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (Comité de Ética em Pesquisa del Recursão-UNESP-Portugal). The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.


## Results
Strain Characteristics
We screened 652 isolates (median age 34 years) from the entire Indian subcontinent, with various species, from different countries, from different geographical areas, from different provinces and from different geographical areas, and their mean and standard deviations were compared for their prevalence in the Indian subcontinent (Table 1). We observed that the average number of isolates per country ranged from 0.30 (India) to 0.


## Discussion
In this study, we showed that H. capsulatum could enhance the intracellular production of chitin and conidiation in C. neoformans and increase the intracellular production of the superoxide anion. Although the induction of these intracellular metabolites in the hyphae of H. capsulatum-treated H. capsulatum cells has been demonstrated in a previous study [14], we did not observe such induction in H. capsulatum treated with H. capsulatum L-17F-1, which is a murine cell wall-associated cell wall-associated protein that induces chitin and conidiation in C. neoformans [17]. It is possible that C. neoformans is more sensitive to the C. neoformans surface and cell wall-associated cell wall-associated metabolites than H. capsulatum and therefore is more sensitive to C. neoformans and other fungi.
