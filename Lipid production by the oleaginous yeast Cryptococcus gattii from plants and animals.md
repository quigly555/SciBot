## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. The cell wall of C. gattii is a dynamic network of connected, highly structured polysaccharides that includes a glycoprotein called the cell wall glycoprotein glycosylation (Gly). To understand the contribution of GlyTPases to virulence, we examined the roles of a- and ß-linked glycoproteins in C. gattii. To identify GPI-I, we constructed an insertional mutant (<U+0394>GlypI) and <U+0394>GlypI mutant (<U+0394>GlypI) and assessed its virulence in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Our data indicate that GlypI is essential for viability and that, in addition, GlypI interacts with CgCycGlyp to form a complex with cytoplasm-localized cytoplasmic proteins. The ß-glucan structure of the ß-glucan mutant was similar to the wild type strain, but a complete rearrangement was not observed in the <U+0394>GlypI and <U+0394>GlypCycGlyp mutant strains. The ß-glucan structure of the <U+0394>GlypI strain, however, showed remarkable structural integrity alterations, including the presence of cytoplasmic filaments, presence of hyphal elongations, and expansion of Golgi-like proteins. Our findings reveal that GlypI is required for viability and that, during infection, the GlypI-dependent protein interaction is required for the morphological transition that is virulence. Collectively, our data suggest that GlypI is essential for viability in C.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a commensal fungus of humans, as well as a harmless component of the human microbiota. It is one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans and can cause superficial and invasive disease in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients, patients with haematological disorders, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy [1-3]. The importance of C. albicans in the human microbiota and in particular the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract has been well established [4,5]. The gut microbiota is highly dynamic and varies depending on the environmental niche it inhabits. In healthy individuals, the microbiota is comprised of members of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Eukarya), followed by the most prevalent members of the Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria.


## Methods
Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with PBS (pH .4) prior to omitting the medium. The mycelia were lyophilized. The mycelia were then filtered using 0.22 µm filter paper and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium. The resulting mixture was inoculated into 5 mL of YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium. The resulting mixture was then inoculated into 5 mL of YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium. The resulting mixture was then inoculated into 5 mL of YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium. The resulting mixture was then inoculated into 5 mL of YPD broth at 30°C for 24 h. Finally, the mixture was passed through a 0.22 µm filter paper, and then the filtrates were filtered with 0.22 µm filter paper, and the resulting mixture was again added to the medium. The resulting mixture was then passed through a 0.22 µm filter paper and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium. The resulting mixture was then passed through a 0.22 µm filter paper and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) prior to addition of oleaginous yeasts to the medium.

The oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus gattii from the oleaginous yeast Coccidioides fragrans was cultured in liquid YPD at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with PBS (pH 7.


## Results
In this study, the strains used in this study produced the lipids of .05 g/L (Fig 1).

Thus, lipids of 1.05 g/L were obtained as pure lipids (1.35 g/L), but as triglycerides (1.36 g/L) in the presence of plant-derived polysaccharides. Lipids of 1.05 g/L were found to be insoluble and unsuitable for food [16]. The high lipids content of 1.05 g/L could be attributed to the low soluble content of polysaccharides and soluble solids of polysaccharides.

2.2. Lipid Fractions
The lipid fractions of lipids were prepared as described in the methods section. The fractions were prepared as described in the Materials and Methods section. The results are presented in Table 1. The fractions were obtained from the prepared fractions in good yields.

2.3. Lipid Growth
The lipid growth of the oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus gattii was studied in YM broth under the optimized conditions (2% CO_2) at 37°C. The results are presented in Fig 2. The lipid yield was as follows: 51.1% (w/w) in the case of 1.05 g/L lipid from the cultures.

2.4. Lipid Binding Activity
The binding of lipids to the lipids was determined by ELISA with a specific amount of lipids of 1.0 g/L. The lipids bound to the lipids were dissolved in the elution buffer for the reaction, and the elution precipitates with the lipids were visualized by ELISA.

The binding of lipids to the lipids was examined by ELISA with a specific amount of lipids of 1.0 g/L and the binding was determined by ELISA. The ELISA results showed that the binding of lipids to the lipids was significantly lower than the binding to the polysaccharides and solids (P < 0.05) (Fig 3).

The binding of lipids to the lipids was also evaluated by ELISA with a specific amount of lipids of 1.0 g/L and the binding was determined by ELISA. The binding was found to be significantly lower than the binding to the polysaccharides and solids (P < 0.


## Discussion

The major virulence factor of Cryptococcus is its ability to secrete lipid peroxidation in the vacuole (VAP) and cell wall (CBW) of cell. It is also an important virulence factor in the host-pathogen interactions, which are mainly mediated by the action of opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms [36]. The lipid peroxidation ability of Cryptococcus is thought to be due to the ability to degrade bioactive lipids [37]. It has been reported that high concentrations of the lipid peroxidation products of lipid metabolism in Cryptococcus are able to decrease the activity of two lipid peroxidation enzymes: peroxiredoxin and peroxiredoxin-1 (PEP1) [38]. The pathogenic Cryptococcus species is also known to produce lipids, namely, mannitol and mannose, by a lipase enzyme. The lipid peroxidation of lipids of C. albicans is commonly used in cell-free-bioactive enzymes production and production. The results of the current study showed that the production of mannitol and mannose by C. albicans was significantly decreased by 25.4% and 15.2%, respectively, in the presence of extracellular lipids. In addition, the production of ß-carotene by C. albicans was significantly increased by 24.2%, 14.4% and 13.4% in the presence of extracellular lipids, respectively.

The occurrence of a significant increase in the production of C. albicans lipids by C. albicans was previously reported by Zhang and He [15], but the results of this study and the current study are still in the current state of being reported. The increase in the production of ß-carotene, which is one of the main components of C. albicans lipids, by C. albicans in this study could be attributed to the secreted fatty acid synthase of C. albicans (Sf-Lig-1) [39]. The results of this study showed that the C. albicans secretion of ß-carotene could be attributed to the presence of cellulose. The fatty acid synthase activity of C. albicans, and the enzymatic activity of C.
