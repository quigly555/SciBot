## Abstract
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of IFI using a multi-stage prospective clinical investigation design (PSCO) at a tertiary hospital in South Africa.


## Introduction
In addition, it was demonstrated that lipid rafts are involved in fungal morphogenesis and virulence [26], [27], [28. Moreover, the lipid rafts are involved in the interaction of lipid rafts with other molecules, including carbohydrate-binding proteins, mannosyl transferrin, and acyl-CoA binding proteins [29], [30].

Cryptococcal lipid rafts are mainly composed of proteins and nucleic acids. However, this group of molecules can be also constituted with other macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, chitin, and mannan, which are important substrates for many processes, such as cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface remodeling, and cell-surface signaling [31], [32], [33]. The lipid rafts can also be represented by other proteins, such as endo-membrane proteins and mitochondrial intercellular adhesion molecules [34], [35], [36]. The structure of the lipid rafts is dependent on the subcellular location, which can be different between lipid rafts. The structure of the lipid raft is dependent on the subcellular compartment, which can be different between lipid rafts. The formation of the lipid raft can be controlled by a number of different components, such as the cationic sugar, which is important in both lipid rafts and the cationic carbohydrate-binding proteins. In addition, the cell membrane proteins, such as Phe2 and Cph1, can be involved in the lysis of the lipid raft [37]. Cell membranes are important for the communication between the cell and the extracellular environment, which is important for the cell to maintain cell-cell adhesion, conidial attachment and cell-surface morphology [38]. The main cell surface receptors for fungal pathogens are the carbohydrate-binding proteins Cbp1 and Cbp2, which can bind the carbohydrate-binding proteins of fungal pathogens, such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. The C-terminal glycoconjugates can bind the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins, such as C3 and C4, which belong to the GPI class proteins, which can be separated into four groups, according to their molecular mechanism [39].


## Methods
The capsule-dextrinsic agents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich C. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in distilled water and extracted by saturated methanol with EtOH [22] to obtain the crude capsule-dextrinsic drug capsule-1.1. to 4.0. The purified capsule-dextrinsic compound was dissolved in distilled water to afford the compound capsule-2.1. The isolated capsule-dextrinsic compound was further used as a standard to evaluate the inhibition of capsule-dextrinsic activities of the capsule-dextrinsic compounds [23].

2.3. Dextrinsic Activity
The Dextrinsic Activity of Capsule-Dextrinsic Compound was evaluated using the method reported by Aiwari et al. [24] with modifications. The capsule-dextrinsic compound was dissolved in distilled water to obtain the crude capsule-dextrinsic compound capsule-3.0. The addition of the crude capsule-dextrinsic compound to the culture broth was performed by using a micro stirrer at speed of 5-10 rpm for 7-14 s. The cultures were allowed to settle for 30 s. The resulting peptide was diluted with distilled water to obtain the final concentration of 100 µg/mL. The cultures were incubated at 30°C for 48-72 h. The cell suspension was filtered through a 0.45-µm polyethylene glycol (PEG) filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and washed with distilled water. The pellet was suspended in 0.9% (v/v) non-ionic surfactant (PAS) and diluted with distilled water to obtain the final cell density of 1.0 × 10^5 cells/mL. The standardized dilutions of peptides were prepared in DMSO, and the compounds were added to the culture broth. The initial cell density of the culture was 5.0 × 10^6 cells/mL. The final cell density of the culture was 2.0 × 10^5 cells/mL.

## Discussion
virens was determined by the lipid degradation of lipid hydrolysate. The X. virens lipid hydrolysates were prepared using three different conditions. As shown in Fig 3, the X. virens lipid hydrolysates were purified by following the protocol used by Maruoka et al. [19]. The purified purified X. virens lipids were prepared using the same reaction as that of the X. virens cells, but with different concentrations of chitin. The purified lipids were then further purified by using a different reaction.
