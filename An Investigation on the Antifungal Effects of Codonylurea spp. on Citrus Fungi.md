## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a common pathogenic fungus causing life-threatening pulmonary and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. The current study aims to evaluate the presence of two Cryptococcus species in patients with conditions such as viral meningoencephalitis and immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS).

Two patients with viral meningoencephalitis and immune reconstitution syndrome were enrolled in the study. IRIS criteria for IRIS were older than 65 years, infected with Cryptococcus species before transplantation and infected with C. gattii before that. All patients were treated with Amphotericin B, Fluconazole or Voriconazole, and all had successful follow-up.

Two patients with viral meningoencephalitis were enrolled in this study. IRIS criteria for IRIS were older than 65 years, infected with Cryptococcus species before transplantation and infected with C. gattii before that. All patients were treated with Amphotericin B, Fluconazole or Voriconazole, and all had successful follow-up. In the case of IRIS, all patients had viral meningoencephalitis and they had productive and non-productive infections.

In the present study, the results of this study add new information about the presence of Cryptococcus species in patients with infectious diseases and it is recommended that the correct management of these two patients should be followed whenever possible.


## Introduction
Proteolytic enzymes, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are a group of extracellular polysaccharides which are synthesized from lysophospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and diacylglycerol (DG) (1,2). GAGs can be divided into three major types: Pheb, Laur, and Pheb. The Laur group is the major class of isoforms with different properties, such as high biodegradability, low catalytic efficiency, and low thermal stability (3). Pheb isoforms are often found in the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and glycosylinositol (GILs) class, which are very similar proteins and may have different structures, enzymatic properties, and catalytic properties (4). Laur and Laur-Pheb isoforms, however, are more common in the GAGs and glycosylinositol (GILs) class (5,6). These isoforms can be found in both polysaccharides and proteins, and can be synthesized by various enzymes such as glycosylinositol (GIL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).

Pheb and Laur are the most common isoforms, with some exceptions, such as Laur and Pheb (7,8). However, in some cases, the two isoforms can be combined to produce a variety of other glycosylinositol (GIP) proteins, which are produced from a different fractionation process, such as acylation and esterification (9).


## Methods
on citrus fung. A subgroup analysis was carried out for the comparison of the antifungal effects of Codonylurea spp. on Citrus Fungi, with the same in vitro plant properties as for the in vivo analysis. We used the in vivo experiments to determine the influence of the in vitro components of the plant on the in vivo effects of the Fungi on the Fungi. We used the in vitro plant properties of Fungi to determine the influence of the in vitro components of Fungi on the in vivo effects of the Fungi.

4.6. Antifungal Effects of Codonylurea spp. on Carp-Induced Lung Injury
The antifungal effects of Codonylurea spp. on carp-induced lung injury was examined with three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the lung tissues from the patients with pulmonary fungal infection. We used a noninvasive 3D model of the lung tissue model to evaluate the antifungal effect of Codonylurea spp. on the carp-induced lung injury.

4.7. Effect of Codonylurea spp. on the Control Lung Disease
For the in vitro studies, a 3D model of the control lung was constructed by testing the in vitro effects of Codonylurea spp. on the control lung disease. The model was a 4-D model with a selected number of cells from each of the three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions. The model was displayed with three-dimensional data sets. The effect of Codonylurea spp. on the control lung disease was evaluated by comparing the 2D model with the 3D model, in which the number of cells is represented by the number of cells of the control. The control lung disease was assessed by comparing the 3D model with the 3D model of the control lung.

4.8. Effect of Codonylurea spp. on the Lung Injury of C. albicans
The antifungal effects of Codonylurea spp. on the lung injury of C. albicans was evaluated with a noninvasive 3D model of the lung tissue model.


## Results
on Citrus Fungi was evaluated by its antifungal effects on the growth of . albicans and C. neoformans using a compound MIC50 of 5 Âµg/ml for all three species tested. In the first assay, the MICs of Codonylurea spp. were determined by the isolation of the compound using an assay protocol in which compound MICs were determined by the isolation of the compound using a confocal fluorescence assay. As shown in Table 3, the MIC values for Codonylurea spp. were much lower than those for C. albicans, and the MICs for C. neoformans were significantly lower than those of the other three tested yeasts.

Codonylurea spp. Inhibit C. albicans Growth and Its Effects on C. Neoformans Growth
The growth of C. neoformans and the effects of Codonylurea spp. on the growth of C. albicans were also tested using different conditions, including complete darkness, constant light, and complete darkness, and the MICs of Codonylurea spp. were determined. The MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were lower than those for C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, and the MIC values of C. neoformans were significantly lower than those of C. neoformans and C. albicans.

The growth of C. neoformans and the effects of Codonylurea spp. on the growth of C. albicans were also evaluated in a dimmerization assay. As shown in Figure 2, the growth of C. neoformans and the effects of Codonylurea spp. on the growth of C. albicans were significantly inhibited when the growth medium was diluted into the bottom of the flask containing the liquid codonylurea spp. concentration for 24 h. The MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were higher than those of C. neoformans, C. neoformans, and C. albicans, and the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were higher than those of C. neoformans and C. albicans. The MIC values of Codonylurea spp.


## Discussion
on the genus Citrus fusiform fermenting on its own and that of the strains on Citrus fruit, the genus Citrus was investigated in the present stud. The results of MIC determination and the MIC range for Codonylurea spp. are presented in Table 1. The results obtained were similar to those of previous studies (5, 8, 9, and 12) where the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. against Citrus cinnamomata were higher than those of previous studies. However, these MIC values were lower than those of previous studies where Codonylurea spp. were active against Citrus fruit (Table 1).

The MIC values of Codonylurea spp. against Citrus cinnamomata (Table 1) were not higher than those of the previous studies (5, 8, 9, and 12) where the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were higher than those of the previous studies (5, 8, 9, and 12). This indicated that the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were in good agreement with the previous studies.

The MIC values of Codonylurea spp. against Citrus cinnamomata (Table 1) were also higher than those of the previous studies where the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were higher than those of the previous studies (5, 8, 9, and 12). This indicated that the MIC values of Codonylurea spp. were in good agreement with the previous studies.
