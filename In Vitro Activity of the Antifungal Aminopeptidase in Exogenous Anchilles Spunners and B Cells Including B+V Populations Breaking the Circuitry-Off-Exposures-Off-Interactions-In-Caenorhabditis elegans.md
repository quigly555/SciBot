## Abstract
Acute and systemic presentations in children with leptospirosis were characterized. Conventional methods of diagnosis relied on detection of antibodies or complement changes in the central nervous system, or on the detection of lymphocyte antigen or antigen binding globulin.

A child with leptospirosis had a diagnosis of a suspected leptospirosis without a clear clinical history or clear laboratory or radiological data to initiate treatment. The child had a positive for anti-dsDNA IgG titers, low T-cell counts, and normal serum NKr serum and IFN-<U+03B3> levels. A lumbar puncture was performed, and a lumbar MRI was performed. The child was treated with combined immunosuppressant therapy with anti-dsDNA and immunosuppressant IFN-<U+03B3> but died due to multiorgan failure two days after the diagnosis.

This case suggests that rapid recognition of leptospirosis is important in early diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment.


## Introduction

The major fungal infections are not caused by pathogenic yeasts, but by a large and diverse group of opportunistic and non-opportunistic fungi that must be prevented from the normal tissues and organs of humans and animal. Therefore, most fungal infections are generally self-limiting and are relatively difficult to treat. The majority of fungal infections are caused by species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Histoplasmosis, and other opportunistic yeasts such as Histoplasma, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma capsulatum, Sporothrix, Sporothrix brasiliensis, and Malassezia. The majority of infections are caused by non-albicans Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida parapsilosis, and Cryptococcus gattii. Other non-albicans Candida species include Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. All non-albicans Candida species are pathogenic yeasts and can cause invasive infections such as candidemia, life-threatening meningoencephalitis, and even pneumonia [19].

Candida albicans is the most common non-albicans Candida species in the United States. It is responsible for about 1-5% of all candidemia [20]. In general, it is a commensal of the skin, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract, and can colonize a variety of tissues and organs. Candida albicans is able to grow in various forms, including yeast form, filamentous, and planktonic forms. Filamentous Candida species are classified into two groups, white and brown, and these are more closely related to each other than other. White and brown Candida albicans are recognized by epithelial cells, and these cells secrete a variety of antifungal drugs [21,22].


## Methods
(1999.

B-cell subcellular fractionation and protein extraction
To separate B-cell subcellular fractions from P. graminicola sp. A-L, p-glycoprotein (AGL) and sp-glutathione-p-nitro-a-d-xylase, the in vitro proteolytic activity of these proteins was determined by using a modified method of Reeb et al. (1999). Briefly, Sp-AGL and Sp-AGL-p-nitroa-d-xylase (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) were incubated with glutathione-p-nitroanilide (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for 1 h at room temperature, and the supernatants were collected. After centrifugation (10,000×g for 15 min at 4°C) the pellets were washed twice with pre-cooled H_2O and dried at 45°C. The supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore Co.) for protein visualization.


## Results
tuberculosis vaccine (n = 3) and the lysates of the B-cell-bound vaccine (n = 3) by determining the yeast and lysate-bound fraction of the lysates by mass spectrometr. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3.

The bound lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1) were distributed evenly along the flagellar tail (Figure 1). The yeast fraction was most concentrated along the flagellar tail (Figure 1). The lysates were most concentrated in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1). The yeast fraction was most concentrated in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1). The L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1) were the two most enriched fractions in the flagellar tail. In addition, the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1) were enriched in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine. In the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3), the yeast fraction was most concentrated in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1). The L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) was enriched in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1). The yeast fraction was most concentrated in the lysates of the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) and the L. pneumophila vaccine (n = 3) (Figure 1).


## Discussion
The levels of histone H3 were determined by measuring acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 in the cell lines by means of gel electrophoresis and cytochemical screenin. The results revealed the presence of histone H3 and histone H4 in the B cell population of B+/V-driven exoskeletons. The presence of histone H4 in the B cell population of V-driven exoskeletons was also observed by means of the enzymatic assays. In the presence of the CpG and CpS inhibitors, histone H3 was not detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons, indicating that histone H3 is not required for the anticandidal activity of the peptidase. The presence of histone H4 was not detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons, indicating that histone H4 is not necessary for the anticandidal activity of the peptidase.

The histone H3 was detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons and the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of V-driven exoskeletons. The histone H4 was detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons, and the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of V-driven exoskeletons. The histone H4 was detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons and the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of V-driven exoskeletons. The histone H3 was not detected in the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of the B+/V-driven exoskeletons of B+/V-driven exoskeletons.
