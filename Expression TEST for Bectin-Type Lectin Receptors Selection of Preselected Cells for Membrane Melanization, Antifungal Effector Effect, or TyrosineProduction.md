## Abstract
Glycans are the major constituent of the fungal cell wall, which protect the yeast from UV-C and ionizing radiation. To understand the contribution of the three-partiator propionic acid in the biosynthesis of glycerol, the action of these lipids on the ergosterol content was investigated. propionic acid was reduced in propyl gallate, the major component of the yeast cell wall, by mutagenesis of the E2-aA cleavage loop. Proic acid mutants were more sensitive to the antifungal drugs fluconazole and voriconazole, but mutants deficient in ergosterol synthesis or in genes involved in the biosynthesis of unsulfur mono-glycerol were more sensitive to the azole drugs amphotericin, caspofungin and terbinafine. The reduction in the erg11<U+0394> cells caused a rapid increase in fluconazole sensitivity. The increased sensitivity of the proic acid mutants to amphotericin and terbinafine was due to the synthesis of both sterol and choline, not the other fatty acids. Antifungal drug treatment of the proic acid mutants also caused a reduction in the tolerance to voriconazole.


## Introduction
Mollusks are generally well adapted to living in low-oxygen environments (i.e., low availability of carbon sources and pH), and their metabolic flexibility has the potential to influence their survival, development, and reproductive success. In addition, they are equipped with a wide range of metabolic activities, including the production of siderophores, photosynthesizing organisms, and fatty acids. The presence of these organisms in marine habitats is of special interest because of their potential to produce biofuels, which would be beneficial to society.

The genus Helminthosporium (Mollusca; Osmundra & Hawksworth 2007) is found in the tropics, temperate and sub-tropics (Niemel et al. 1999; Hermisson et al. 2005; Cech & Lindquist 2005; Krokene & Schubert 2006; Spangenberg & Fluck 1985; Spangenberg & Fell 1995; Cech & Lindquist 2005; Müller et al. 2006). In addition to these important taxa, the genus also includes some important plant pathogens (Krokene & Fell 1995). Helminthosporium is one of the most important plant pathogens, and it is also one of the major causes of root and leaf diseases in many economically important crops, such as maize, pea, and sugarbeet (Müller et al. 2006; Hermisson et al. 2005; Cech & Lindquist 2005; Spangenberg & Fluck 1985; Spangenberg & Fell 1995).

In the past two decades, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the biodiversity of Helminthosporium species, but only a few are focused on the distribution of the genus in marine environments.


## Methods
brasiliensis yeast. In order to assess this, Bectin-Type lectin-like lectin synthesis was performed as described previously [17].

The bacterial strains used in this study were Bectin-Type lectin-like lectin (Bectin-Type) “Bectin-Type” and “Bectin-Type”, and the growth was carried out in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) broth at 37°C for 48 hours.

For the digestion of Bectin-Type lectin, the yeast cell suspension was inoculated in a 5 ml flasks of Sabouraud Dextrose (SD) broth, and the culture was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 2 ml of SD broth. The concentration of Bectin-Type lectin was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml by dilution to 1 × 10^3 CFU/ml in 1 ml of SD broth, and 1 ml of the resulting cell suspension was added to each well of a 96-well round bottom microplate. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the number of bacteria was counted.

The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). For Bectin-Type lectin-like lectin synthesis, the cells were inoculated in SD broth, and the culture was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of SD broth. The cell suspension was then re-suspended in 1 ml of SD broth, and the number of bacteria was counted.


## Results
dermatitidis to produce a lipas. This enzyme, which is a cytosolic exocytosis-associated protein, was found to be highly abundant in both wild-type and B. dermatitidis cultures. The average yield of B. dermatitidis lipase was more than 3.4% (SD = 1.6) with a yield of 4.4%. The yield was higher than that of a lipase produced by the hemichuronic fungus Candida albicans (8.6%) (Table 4). To test the ability of B. dermatitidis to produce lipase, we incubated B. dermatitidis cultures with the human antifungal drug fluconazole (fluconazole-sulfate, 5-flucytosine, or kanamycin, which are shown to inhibit fungal growth in vitro), a model drug that inhibits fungal growth in vitro, and a lipase from a Penicillium species (Penicillium spp.). Fluconazole activity was found to be low in all cultures, whereas B. dermatitidis cultures had high activity (Table 4). The percentage of cells expressing fungal-specific B. dermatitidis lipase was about 2.7 times greater than that of a wild-type strain (Table 4). Thus, the ability of B. dermatitidis to produce a lipase was dependent on the pH of the culture medium. The pH of the culture medium was found to be very acidic at pH 5, and a relatively high pH at pH 7, which is conducive to fungal growth [31]. In addition, a pH of 6.5 was found to be a more favorable environment for fungal growth [32]. These results indicated that B. dermatitidis could produce a lipase from a fungal host during growth on agar, indicating that it could be used as a drug target.

B. dermatitidis and B. deneoformans Are Phosphatase and Lipase Enzymes in Vitro
To determine the potential role of B. dermatitidis lipase in B. dermatitidis’s lipid metabolism, the lipase activity of wild-type and B. deneoformans strains was examined by measuring the amount of lipase protein in their culture supernatants.


## Discussion
maydis? [12], [13] and have been found in many strains of . maydis, but not in other pathogenic fungi such as A. fumigatus, C. neoformans, or A. fumigatus, and some of the “good” strains (M2-M8) of U. maydis (S1 Fig). Additionally, HGT (human homologous recombination) is known to be one of the factors causing dimorphism in U. maydis, and U. maydis strains expressing the HGT gene have altered phenotypes and altered virulence. We speculate that the HGT gene might also be expressed in U. maydis, and that HGT might be one of the determinants of virulence. Our finding of HGT in U. maydis, in contrast to A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus strains, suggests that HGT is not essential for growth in vitro, and that this gene might be expressed in U. maydis.

It has been shown that a number of functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development are associated with cell differentiation in U. maydis [24]-[28]. Additionally, cell cycle regulators are associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [29], [30]. Expression of the cell cycle regulator gene, cdc24, was found in U. maydis, and it was downregulated in U. maydis strains expressing the hdaA-T1 mitogen in addition to the hdaB-T1 cell cycle regulator gene. These findings are consistent with the results of a previous study on C. neoformans, where cell cycle regulators were shown to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation [24]. Consistent with this, a number of cell cycle regulators were downregulated in U. maydis, and this is consistent with the findings of the current study.

The results of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of cell death in U. maydis, which has been reported previously [24]. We have found that the cell cycle regulators expressed in U. maydis, HdaA, and hdaB, are associated with cell death, while those that are expressed in A. fumigatus, C. neoformans, and A. fumigatus, and those that are expressed in U. maydis and C. gattii, respectively, are not.
