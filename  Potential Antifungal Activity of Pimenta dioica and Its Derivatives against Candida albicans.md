Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The antifungal activity of the essential oils of four wild mushrooms, Pulsedronias pannui, Pulsedronias japonica and Pulsedronias psychrophila, were analyzed. The concentration of the major constituents were determined using gas chromatography - time-of-flight (GC-Frazing) mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.


## Introduction
Disease prevention, control and treatment have attracted great interest as promising alternatives to the use of synthetic pesticides [1]. Naturally occurring bacteria have been regarded as a major source of problems in the fields of natural antimicrobial agents [2,3]. Some of them, such as Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, are resistant to a variety of antimicrobials [4-6]. The use of antibiotics in bacterial infections is of great concern due to the possible occurrence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The existence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is of particular concern because of their risk of prolonged treatment, high mortality, and development of resistance [7]. The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a growing threat to public health worldwide and requires the development of new antibiotics and antimicrobials [8]. In recent years, new antibiotics, such as the echinocandins, were developed to treat fungal infections. However, the use of these agents, which are not orally bioavailable, can cause health problems, and there is a high risk of drug resistance [9]. The use of drugs that can be used orally to treat bacterial infections has been increasing [10,11].

The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous extracts of phenolic fractions against B. cinerea, and to evaluate the possible mechanisms behind this activity. We found that phenolic fractions exhibited potent antibacterial activity, but the antimicrobial effect of phenolic fractions against other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was less clear. Moreover, the efficacy of phenolic fractions was not dose-dependent.


## Methods
The MIC values of Pimenta dioica were defined as the lowest concentration of Pimenta dioica that caused no discernible growth on solid media [11.

2.7. Effect of Pimenta dioica on Candida albicans and C. glabrata Growth
The MIC of Pimenta dioica was determined in 96-well plates in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) containing 0.25% gelatin and 1% sodium chloride. The inoculum was prepared by adding 20×10^4 CFU/ml of C. glabrata, C. albicans or C. glabrata cells to the well in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.25% gelatin. The media was removed from the wells and the volume was adjusted to 10×10^5 cells/ml. Then, 200 µl of Pimenta dioica was added to each well. The Pimenta dioica-modified medium was prepared by mixing Pimenta dioica-modified medium with Pimenta dioica-modified medium and incubating for 24 h at 37°C. The amount of Pimenta dioica that could not be separated by the addition of Pimenta dioica medium was calculated by the following formula:

2.8. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Pimenta dioica on C. glabrata Growth
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pimenta dioica was determined according to the method of Canseco et al. [12]. In this assay, three different concentrations (0.25 to 0.5% gelatin, 0.25 to 1.0% gelatin, 0.5 to 2.0% gelatin, and 0.25 to 2.0% gelatin) of Pimenta dioica were used in order to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pimenta dioica on C. glabrata growth.


## Results
As shown in Table 2, it was found that the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (.8 mg/mL) was highly active against all tested Candida species and almost all tested Candida strains.

The MIC-1 assay was used to determine whether the extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) was able to exert antifungal activity against C. albicans. As shown in Table 2, it was found that the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (0.8 mg/mL) exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans (Table 2).

The MBC-1 assay was used to evaluate whether the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (0.8 mg/mL) could exert antifungal activity against all Candida species and tested the MIC-1 assay against several Candida species. As shown in Table 3, it was found that the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) displayed antifungal activity against all Candida species tested.

The MIC-1 assay was used to evaluate whether the extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) could exert antifungal activity against C. neoformans and tested the MIC-1 assay against C. neoformans. As shown in Table 4, it was found that the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) was highly active against C. neoformans and almost all tested C. neoformans strains tested.

The MIC-1 assay was used to evaluate whether the extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) could exert antifungal activity against all Candida species. As shown in Table 5, it was found that the crude extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) was highly active against all tested Candida species tested.

The MIC-1 assay was used to evaluate whether the extract of Pimenta dioica (0.2 mg/mL) could exert antifungal activity against all Candida species.


## Discussion
The results of the antifungal activity against . albicans and C. tropicalis were not surprising given the known antifungal activity of Pimenta [44], [45] and the antifungal activity of the fungicidal compound amphotericin B against C. albicans and C. tropicalis [45], respectively. However, a recent study by Nakase et al. [46] showed that amphotericin B was not active against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and P. ipaque (Table 1). The results of this study are similar to those of previous studies by Nakase et al. [46], who reported that amphotericin B is active against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and P. ipaque. In addition, the antifungal activity of the essential oils of A. lulangense, A. guilliermondii, and A. sydowii against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and P. ipaque (Table 1) and against C. albicans and C. tropicalis (Table 1) and C. albicans and P. ipaque (Table 1) (Table S1) [45], [47].

As stated above, Pimenta possesses a strong antifungal activity against the pathogenic fungi and many of them were previously reported as active compounds. However, the current study focused on the effect of Pimenta on the effects of Pimenta on the toxicity of Pimenta.

Pimenta inhibits the growth of the pathogenic fungi of fungi (Table 1) as well as C. albicans (Table 1) (Table S1) and C. albicans (Table S1) (Table 1). Both fungal species were previously reported to be able to grow at 37°C (Table 1). C. albicans is the most frequently reported fungal species and the other species was previously reported to grow at 32°C (Table 1). P. ipaque and P. albicans were previously reported to be able to grow at 35°C (Table 1). Pimenta was previously reported to grow at 37°C (Table 1).
