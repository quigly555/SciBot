## Abstract
Mycobacterium smegmatis is the causative agent of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a leading cause of death in immunocompromised patients. Treatment strategies for IA include immunotherapy, surgical intervention, and surgical debridement. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is the cornerstone of the management of IA. Several recent studies have shown that the in vitro activity of amoxicillin, but not pneumococcal, is the main cause of resistance to antibiotics. Studies from the Far East do not support the use of antibiotics against IA due to the differences in the populations studied. However, many antibiotics used in the treatment of IA, such as amoxicillin, are well tolerated. The treatment of bacterial infections after infection with IA is very effective. However, the resistance generated by the use of antibiotics should be considered when developing resistance to new antibiotics as well as the possibility of drug resistance. In addition, the use of antifungal therapy in the treatment of IA should be guided by clinical success. A number of studies have been published on the effect of certain antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B, on IA.


## Introduction

In the present study, we developed a simple and efficient, non-toxic, cryoprotectant-based system for the plasmodium production using conventional and cryoprotectant-based method. The plasmodium plasmin (pP) system, which utilizes a non-toxic and non-toxic reaction reaction mechanism for the generation of pP, is widely used in a large number of applications, such as cryoprotectant and biological control [15,16,17,18,19]. This plasmodium plasmin has also been proven to be a good option for conventional and cryoprotectant production [20,21]. The plasmodium plasmin has been developed based on two components: a linear polymeric substrate, such as polyethylene glycol (PE), and a polystyrene matrix (PS) with a phospholipid carrier such as Poly(dimethylsiloximine) [22]. The PPS has been shown to be a useful material for the pretreatment of various inhibitors of pP, such as Pdr-1, Pdr-2, and KX3-2. Despite the high efficiency of the PPS, the formation of a highly reactive compound by the PPS is not always efficient due to the large surface area of the PPS and the need for a suitable medium for the generation of this reactive compound. Therefore, several alternatives are used to generate a stable compound that is easy to control and to scale-up.

The PPS is a complex mixture of polymers, such as PLA (polyethylene glycol) and sponges. PLA has been used as a solid-state polymer since it is easy to use and makes it ideal for a variety of applications, such as the production of porous plastics, matrix plasticizers, and transducers [23,24]. The major drawbacks of PLA are its recalcitrance point instability, which can cause a shortening of the reaction cycle, and the production of short structures, such as pores. These drawbacks can be overcome by the use of sponges. Recently, several sponges have been developed and are being used to manufacture plasmodium plasmin. These sponges are derived from a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide chain of pP chain is synthesized by the P proteins.


## Methods
% Tween 80 in .0 ml of methanol) was pipetted into a 24-well plate. The test sample contained 0.2% Tween 80 in 1.0 ml of methanol, with the reference sample of 0.2% Tween 80 in 0.2 ml of methanol. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the mycelial mats were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with water, and the pellets were resuspended in 1.0 ml of 0.5% Tween 80 in 0.5 ml of methanol. For the RNA isolation from the mycelia, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 µg of total RNA with RevertAid H minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (ThermoFisher). The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and the quality of the cDNA was assessed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Statistical analysis
For each experiment, we analyzed the mean values of the independent samples. For the individual samples, we compared the difference in the relative abundance of specific genes between the control and treated groups with the DESO 2.0 program [54]. The gene abundance data were normalized to the endogenous gene expression data of the DEGs. We compared the difference in the relative abundance of the genes of the control and treated groups with the DESO 2.0 program.

## Results
The molecular ion peak data of the NMR spectra of the two-hybrid complexes are shown in Table . The spectrum of the two-hybrid complexes was similar to that of the two-hybrid complexes and the two-hybrid complexes are characterized by the three-dimensional structure of the three-dimensional structure. The chemical structure of the two-hybrid complexes has been established by the ^1H-^1H COSY, HMBC and HMQC chemical shifts. The IR spectrum showed that the two-hybrid complexes have an overall IR peak at m/z 757 (4.4 Hz), 781 (4.2 Hz) and 786 (3.1 Hz) with the corresponding broad band at m/z 782 (3.8 Hz), 791 (3.2 Hz) and 799 (3.2 Hz). The IR spectrum of the three-hybrid complexes showed that the three-dimensional structure is characterized by the strong absorption band at m/z 786 (3.8 Hz), 783 (3.8 Hz) and 799 (3.2 Hz), and the weak band at m/z 783 (3.8 Hz), 791 (3.2 Hz) and 799 (3.2 Hz).

## Discussion

In the present work, our study utilized two cryoprotectants, the PDI and liquid-phase PDI, to study the effects of cryoprotectants on . vivax-L. in vitro. In the liquid-phase PDI, the decrease in TvL production by TvL cells was greater than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. However, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was lower than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. As expected, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was significantly greater than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. The recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was more than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. In contrast, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was more than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. The recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was more than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. Thus, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was independent of TvL by liquid-phase PDI.

In our study, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was significantly greater than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. Therefore, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was independent of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. However, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was significantly greater than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. Thus, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was independent of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. The recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was also independent of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. However, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was significantly greater than that of TvL by liquid-phase PDI. Therefore, the recovery of TvL by liquid-phase PDI was independent of TvL by liquid-phase PDI.

In our study, we employed cryoprotectants with low molecular weight and high stability, to study the effect of cryoprotectants on TvL production in liquid-phase PDI.
