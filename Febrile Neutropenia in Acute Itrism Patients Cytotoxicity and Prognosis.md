## Abstract
Hemocyanin, the smallest member of the green population, is not only a component of the green microbiota but also has various beneficial effects on human health and aging. Hemocyanin is produced by fungi, plants, and bacteria through a well-characterized sugar metabolism mechanism. The mechanism by which fungi can metabolize this polymer, termed cyanidinylation, has not been fully understood. Here, we report the first example of cyanidinylation in a human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans. Using fluorescent mutants, we found that cyanidinylation occurs in higher abundance in the early stages of the growth of C. neoformans. Although the reason for this cyanidinylation appears to involve conserved signaling modules, we found that the mutant produces more cyanidinylated mutant strains. Thus, our data suggest that the fungal cyanidinylase is not involved in essential trace nutrients, and that this process is independent of the major virulence factors Cpk1, Spk1, and Skp1. Overall, our work provides a mechanism for the initial colonization of the human gut and supports the notion that C. neoformans can use cyanidinylation as a strategy for virulence.

Cyanidinylation occurs in a range of organisms. Cyanidinylation in human pathogen-associated fungi has not been completely understood. Here, we report the first cyanidinylation case in a human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans. The data presented here suggest that the fungal cyanidinylase is not involved in essential trace nutrients, and that this process is independent of the major virulence factors Cpk1, Spk1, and Skp1.


## Introduction
In the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients, mainly due to AIDS, solid organ transplantation, immunodeficiency, hematologic disorders, neoplasms, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus (1). The majority of patients with these diseases have been diagnosed with idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphopenia (ITL) (2). There are some major risk factors for ILC, such as HIV infection (e.g., receipt of haemod off-patients) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., diabetes mellitus) (3). Moreover, patients with idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphopenia are at increased risk of opportunistic infections and severe autoimmune diseases (4). It is clear that ILC are at high risk of developing mycoses and other opportunistic infections and that the treatment of ILC is urgently needed (5).

Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphopenia is characterized by the presence of CD4+ T cells with increased T-cell activity (6). In contrast, non-mycotic infections such as invasive candidiasis (IC) and cryptococcosis are less common causes of ILC (7). ILC are generally more susceptible to antifungal agents than non-mycotic infections (8).


## Methods
Data were extracted from the databases using a program developed by the National Center for Statistical Computing (CCLS) and the database version of CCLS, Version 1.02 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ccls).

The prophylactic action of the potential cytotoxic agent was assessed by comparing the number of CFU per ml of the blood with that of the control. The data were extracted from the CCLS databases.

In this study, the cytotoxic activity of the potential cytotoxic agent was evaluated in 96-well microtiter plates with 100 Âµl of the tested sample.


## Results
nebulosa in patients with acute hepatitis, and that the cytotoxicity of compounds was seen in all the cases in patients with moderate acute hepatitis, and that the involvement of the cytotoxic effects of the compounds in the HepG2-. Pneumocystis jirovecii in Acute Itrism Patients: Cytotoxicity and Prognosis
The cytotoxicity of the compounds in the HepG2-H. Pneumocystis jirovecii patients were seen in all the cases. The cytotoxic effects of compounds in the HepG2-H. Pneumocystis jirovecii patients were seen in all the cases. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the compounds in the HepG2-H. Pneumocystis jirovecii patients was seen in all the cases. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of compounds in the HepG2-H. Pneumocystis jirovecii patients were seen in all the cases.

Hematologically confirmed human hepatomegaly is the most severe case of human hepatitis in patients with acute hepatitis. The highest level of hemoglobin in hepatitis C is 6 g/L, and the highest level of hemoglobin in hepatitis E is 0.5 g/L. The most severe case of human hepatitis in patients with acute hepatitis is 6 g/L, and the highest level of hemoglobin in hepatitis E is 0.5 g/L. The hemoglobin level in patients with chronic hepatitis is 8 g/L, and the hemoglobin level in patients with mild acute hepatitis is 0.3 g/L.

In acute hepatitis, the percentage of liver cirrhosis (percentage of liver cirrhosis, liver cirrhosis =1.9%, which is the highest in patients with acute hepatitis) was very high in patients with acute hepatitis and moderate in patients with severe acute hepatitis. The percentage of liver cirrhosis in patients with acute hepatitis and severe acute hepatitis was 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively.

In the HepG2-H. Pneumocystis jirovecii, the percentages of liver cirrhosis and liver cirrhosis in patients with acute hepatitis and mild acute hepatitis were very high in patients with acute hepatitis and moderate in patients with severe acute hepatitis.


## Discussion
A typical case is typically with pleural effusion and pneumonitis, followed by pneumonitis and endophthalmiti. In severe cases, the pneumonitis is preceded by fever, chest pain, and/or hemoptysis, but not with pleural effusion or pneumonitis. Common underlying conditions of lymphopenia and lymphadenitis are lymphopenia, chronic non-healing chronic bronchitis, chronic non-healing chronic bronchitis, and chronic non-viral bronchitis. Cytokines, including cyclophosphamide, pyridine dihydrochloride, nystatin, and echinocandins are not effective in treatment of IRIS. Asymptomatic exposure of Cryptococcus neoformans to environmental components such as alcohols, nicotine, or tobacco does not cause any adverse effects on healthy individuals. Patients with chronic non-healing chronic bronchitis may have a predisposing factor for IRIS.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that causes infection in humans. It is characterized by the presence of yeast-like cells on the cell surface and cell walls of epithelial cells, and can survive inside of macrophages and inflammatory cells (25). The organism can grow inside the host and cause infections in humans. Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous yeast, with 1,400 species described in the environment and the human body (26). The organism can also be isolated from clinical samples and cause respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasculitis (26). However, there are no reports of cryptococcal infection in humans (5, 19). In the present case, the patient presented with a mass effect on his chest, chest pain, and hemoptysis, and a large pneumonitis. The patient had only mild pleuritic pleuritic pleuritis, but the pneumonitis did not appear to be life threatening.

Cryptococcus neoformans is considered a pathogen in immunocompetent hosts (27). There is no case reported of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent hosts. However, the patient had a history of having cryptococcal meningitis, which may be due to immunosuppression.
