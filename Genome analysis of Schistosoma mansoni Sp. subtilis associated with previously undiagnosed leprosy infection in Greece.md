## Abstract
Acanthamoeba, the most common and pathogenic Acanthamoeba complex, is one of the most heterothallic fungal parasites. It harbors several putative ascomycete genie(s) on the molecular machinery of the immune system, including on genes involved in immunity, immunity to environmental stimuli, perception and memory, production of anti-inflammatory mediators and signal transduction molecules. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that are controlled by this organism, we investigated the genes and protein-protein interactions associated with the expression of a putative pleiotropic gene (DP) of the causal agent A. fumigatus in the absence or presence of an amyloid/deglachin/neurosyntin (BDNF) complex. These genes were identified by similarity search and analysis of EST genes from different genomes.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematological disorders. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are not only a challenge in managing these patients, but they have a profound influence on public health by increasing isolation frequency, dissemination, and efficiency of therapy [1]. Of these, invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most prevalent IFI, and mortality due to candidemia and mortality are high. The rate of mortality due to other fungal infections is unknown and is estimated at between 1.5 and 3.7/1000 patients, and has been estimated at 5% of all reported cases of invasive candidiasis [2].

The clinical course of IFI can be influenced by several factors, including fungal morphology, host immune status, and underlying diseases [3]. For example, in patients with hematologic malignancies, invasive candidiasis can be classified into “proven” and “probable” IFI, and these can be defined as: (1) IFIs due to Candida albicans; (2) non-C. albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata IFI; (3) intrapill non-C. albicans (C. glabrata) IFI; and (4) non-Candida albicans yeasts, such as Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis.

There are different clinical manifestations of C. albicans IFI, and the most common manifestation is candidemia. The clinical presentation of C.


## Methods
Sample collection and isolation of fungi
Two to four ml of spore suspension (100 µl) of each of the yeast strains from our collection (Table 1) were dropped on a microscope slide and then were placed on a slide in a sterile dish with 10 ml of sterile water. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 weeks. After the first week, the fungus colonies were collected from the plates and the total fungal counts were determined by microscopy using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1. The average number of spores per milliliter of spore suspension was counted every 24 h. The number of sporangia per milliliter of spore suspension was calculated after counting the number of spores in the spore tubes. The fungal colonies were subcultured in 10 ml of sterile water in a shaker at 37 °C for 3-4 weeks. The results were analyzed by colony-PCR and the corresponding primers used for the identification were listed in Table 1. The resulting sequences of the flanking sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. The data obtained from the PCR analysis were subjected to a BLAST search to identify fungal phylogenies.

Fungal strains were identified as follows: Schistosoma mansoni, ATCC14052, Schistosoma lycopersicum, ATCC10509, Schistosoma interrogans, ATCC34199, Schistosoma spp., Schistosoma phomosome, Schistosoma monocytogenes, Schistosoma spp. and Schistosoma spp.


## Results
mansoni genom. After excluding homologous proteins in non-stressing liquid medium, we found that the percentage of proteins associated with spore-associated proteins in Sp. mansoni was significantly higher than that in non-stressing liquid medium (P < 0.001) (Fig 4A). Furthermore, the percentage of proteins associated with non-stressing liquid medium was significantly higher than that in non-stressing liquid medium in all cases (P < 0.05) (Fig 4B). These results suggest that spore-associated proteins have a greater impact on the host immune response than non-stressing liquid medium proteins.

Spore-associated proteins were enriched in the F-actin promoter of S. mansoni in response to Leptospira infection
In the majority of organisms, bacterial pathogens, the expression of the protein and the promoter regions of the F-actin regulatory proteins are characterized by the expression of several F-actin regulatory proteins, including F-actin-1 (F-actin-1), F-actin-2 (F-actin-2), F-actin-3 (F-actin-3), and F-actin-4 (F-actin-4). However, in a recent study, we found that the F-actin-3 promoter region was enriched in Sp. mansoni infection-associated proteins [28]. In the current study, we found that the Sp. mansoni F-actin-3 promoter region was enriched in Sp. mansoni Sp. mansoni Sp. mansoni and Sp. mansoni Sp. mansoni infection-associated proteins (Fig 4C). This suggests that the Sp. mansoni F-actin-3 promoter was enriched in Sp. mansoni Sp. mansoni and Sp. mansoni Sp. mansoni infection-associated proteins.

We next analyzed the F-actin-1 and F-actin-4 genes, F-actin-3 and F-actin-4, respectively, in the Sp. mansoni infection-associated proteins. F-actin-1 and F-actin-4 were significantly up-regulated in both Sp. mansoni infection-associated proteins (P < 0.05) (Fig 5A). Furthermore, F-actin-3 was significantly up-regulated in both Sp.


## Discussion
The majority of previous publications on the impact of HIV infection on HIV-1 infections are focused on the effects of HIV infection on the immune system. This study is the first to investigate the effects of HIV infection on the development of the immune system. Our results show that HIV infection increased the production of IL-6 and TNF-a. These results are similar to the results reported by others [4, 5]. We also found that the production of IL-6 and TNF-a increased in the infected mice. These results are also consistent with those reported by others [6, 7]. Furthermore, the increase in the production of IL-6 and TNF-a is similar to the results reported by others [8, 9].

It is possible that HIV infection stimulates IL-6 production by T cells. This is also consistent with previous reports [10, 11]. Furthermore, an increase in the expression of IL-6 and TNF-a and an increase in the expression of IL-6 were also reported in HIV-1 infected human leukocytes [12].
