## Abstract
The Cryptococcus gattii VGIII VGIIIa VGIII species are known fungal pathogens causing ~150,000 new deaths per year worldwide. Current therapeutic options for treating cryptococcosis are based on the use of animal protein antifungal drugs, including the human oral mycobacterium ceftriaxone used in treatment. In this study, we investigated the activity of the bioactivity-in-time (AIT) from the VGIIIa, GII, and GIII clinical strains against the mycobacterial pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii.

AIT analysis revealed that the isolates were highly effective against the tested fungi, and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were low enough to use a therapeutically relevant drug. To distinguish the species, we detected four VGIIIa and four VGIIIg species. The mycobacterial strains were resistant to caspofungin, amphotericin, and flucytosine, were non-typhoidal, and contained small amounts of amino acids.


## Introduction
Peroxidases (EC3.5.1.1) are enzymes that convert acetamido groups into oxygen. Peroxidases are grouped into two main classes, the metalloenzymes and the metalloacyl groups (EC3.5.1.1) (Clark, 1996). The two main groups are: catalase (EC3.5.1.1) and peroxidases (EC3.5.1.3). Catalases are a group of enzymes that were originally described in yeasts and have since spread to all eukaryotes.

Peroxylases (EC3.5.1.1) catalyze the oxidation of acetamido groups into oxygen (Kaur and Manjith, 2001). In addition, peroxylases are sometimes referred to as myristoyl peroxidases (EC3.5.1.1) because of their role in the regulation of the conversion reactions (Wang et al., 2002; Clark, 1996; Clark and Keller, 2000; Clark and Keller, 2003). Myristoyl peroxylases are found in all eukaryotic organisms, including yeasts, fungi, and animals.

## Results

In this patient, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was higher than the rate of cryptococcal candidiasi. However, the incidence of cryptococcal candidiasis in this patient was lower than the rate of cryptococcal candidiasis in patients with other cryptococcal infection (Figure 1A). The median time to develop cryptococcal meningitis was 3 months (range, 1.5-5.5 months). The median duration of cryptococcal meningitis was 9 days (range, 3-21 days) in the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis. The patient with cryptococcal candidiasis had a lower median CD4 count (3 cells/mm^3), a lower median CD4^+ T-cell count (2 cells/mm^3), and a lower median CD4^+ T-cell count (4 cells/mm^3) than the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis. Patients with cryptococcal candidiasis had a higher median CD4 count (30 cells/mm^3) than the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis. In the case of cryptococcal candidiasis, the median CD4 count was 37 cells/mm^3 (range, 5-105 cells/mm^3). The median duration of cryptococcal candidiasis was 3 months (range, 2.5-6 months).

In this patient, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was significantly higher than the rate of cryptococcal candidiasis in patients with other cryptococcal infection. The median duration of cryptococcal meningitis was 13 days (range, 1.8-31 days) in the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis. The median duration of cryptococcal meningitis was 12 days (range, 1.3-14 days) in the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis. The patient with cryptococcal candidiasis had a lower median CD4 count (4 cells/mm^3) and a lower median CD4^+ T-cell count (4 cells/mm^3) than the patient with cryptococcal candidiasis.


## Discussion
The present study evaluated the effects of amphotericin B, fluconazole and caspofungin treatment on the outcome of CM in HIV-infected adults with CD4+ cell counts below 200 cells/ÂµL. A total of 111 patients received amphotericin B or fluconazole and 101 received caspofungin, with a median duration of 62 days. The data show that the cumulative effect of amphotericin B and fluconazole was additively or additively (p < 0.05) enhanced in the case of CM and in the case of non-CM patients. The additive effect of caspofungin and amphotericin B was independent of the use of amphotericin B alone or in combination with fluconazole. In addition, we found that the cumulative effect of amphotericin B and fluconazole was additively or additively (p = 0.02) increased in the case of CM and in the case of non-CM patients. This synergistic effect could be due to the synergistic effect of amphotericin B and fluconazole in combination with fluconazole, fluconazole alone or in combination with caspofungin, which are effective in the treatment of CM.
