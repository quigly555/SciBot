## Abstract
A new species of Phylloporus, Leptoporiaboccusmarneae, is described and illustrated from leaves of a single solitary gram-old tree, Gnocchiops dasylospora. Phylloporus is characterized by its long, thinned stalk, robust conidiomata and presumed long, smooth, smooth, pale brown conidia. This study confirmed that the genus Phylloporus was recently acquired from a common host tree.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause pulmonary and central nervous system cryptococcoma, with a risk of pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and death [1]. The initial pulmonary infection can lead to the clinical deterioration and mortality, however, a larger number of cases occur in immunosuppressed patients with disseminated disease, most commonly lymphatic and non-lymph lymphatic diseases [2]. The most common of these diseases is cryptococcal meningitis, with a risk of mortality of up to 60% [3]. While the disease is typically caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, opportunistic yeasts like Cryptococcus gattii, and Cryptococcus laurentii have also been identified [4,5]. Most cases of cryptococcal meningitis are caused by Cryptococcus gattii, although some cases can also be caused by Cryptococcus neoformans [4,5]. Although the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has declined significantly in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), most cases of cryptococcal meningitis result from Cryptococcus neoformans [6].

Cryptococcosis can be caused by two varieties of the pathogenic species, Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, which are both found in the soil and in human body fluids. The pathogenicity of the other species is restricted to a limited number of species, including C. gattii, C. neoformans, and C. laurentii, which are most frequently isolated from environmental sources, such as bird droppings, soil, and trees [7,8]. The former species cause diseases in humans and animals, such as cryptococcosis due to C. gattii (85%) and cryptococcosis due to C. neoformans (75%) and the latter species C. gattii (75%) and C. neoformans var. neoformans (85%) [9]. C. neoformans var.


## Methods
This study was performed according to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Federal University of São Paulo (protocol No. 2018-07-09). All samples were processed according to the laboratory and laboratory policies of the Federal University of São Paulo and were obtained from the blood bank of the Federal University of São Paulo (Protocol No. 452/2015).

This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Brazilian National Council of Animal Experimentation (Rodrigues et al., 2008). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (Protocol No. 2014-0113).

The population included all adult female wild-type (WT) and <U+2206>CYP51D mutants of C. neoformans. The initial screening strategy was performed in the laboratory of the Federal University of São Paulo (Protocol No. 2018-07-09). In addition, the mutants were tested in the animal models. The mutants were obtained from the inoculation of “selective-media” and “free-feeding”. All strains were maintained at -80°C in 5% CO_2.


## Results
Demographics are shown in Table . A positive CSI result was obtained in 67% of patients (n = 3) (Table 2).

A comparison of CSI results with serum cryptococcal antigen results was performed in 44% (n = 4) of patients. However, in 32% (n = 1) of patients, CSI results were negative in 7% (n = 1) of patients (Table 2).

Characteristics of the study population and demographic characteristics of the study population
A total of 92 patients were included. Of these, 19 patients (6%) had a CD4 count of =120 cells/µL and 13 patients (7%) had a CD4 count of =60 cells/µL. Of the patients, 14 patients (33%) had a CD4 count of =60 cells/µL and 8 patients (17%) had a CD4 count of =60 cells/µL.

Characteristics of the study population and demographic characteristics of the study population
Of the patients, 11 patients (44%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 38 years (range, 3-75 years). There were no significant differences in gender, age, BMI, alcohol intake, duration of ART, cryptococcal meningitis, HIV infection, and CSF opening pressure.

Characteristics of the study population and demographic characteristics of the study population
Of the patients, 8 patients (21%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 38 years (range, 3-75 years). There were no significant differences in gender, age, BMI, alcohol intake, duration of ART, cryptococcal meningitis, HIV infection, and CSF opening pressure.

Characteristics of the study population and demographic characteristics of the study population
Of the patients, 10 patients (47%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 38 years (range, 3-75 years). There were no significant differences in gender, age, BMI, alcohol intake, duration of ART, cryptococcal meningitis, HIV infection, and CSF opening pressure.

Characteristics of the study population and demographic characteristics of the study population
A total of 49 patients (24%) were male.


## Discussion
H. uvarum, which belongs to the order Chaetothyriales, is a typical opportunistic pathogen in humans [14,16,17,18,21]. This fungus was first reported in Korea in 1999 and has been isolated from the skin of humans and dogs [18]. It is a common agent of skin disease in humans [21]. Although it is a typical opportunistic pathogen, it is also a opportunistic pathogen in dogs and humans [21,22]. A report by an environmental researcher described the isolation of H. uvarum from the soil of a pigeon [18].

The presence of H. uvarum on the skin of dogs has been reported previously [16,17,18,21]. In this study, the species was isolated from both dogs and humans. Although most species of H. uvarum are not in the Chaetothyriales order, H. uvarum was isolated from human skin [16]. The isolation of H. uvarum from human skin was also reported in the study of an unidentified patient [16]. The isolation of H. uvarum from the skin of dogs was also reported in a case of a second dog [16]. The isolation of H. uvarum from the skin of dogs was also reported in the case of an unidentified patient [16].
