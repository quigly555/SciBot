## Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of flucytosine (FL) and the safety of antifungal drugs remain uncertain. Isolates of opportunistic yeast infections, such as candidiasis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are frequently reported. We analyzed the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment outcomes in a large colleufunctional clinical study, to investigate the prevalence, mode of action, and predictive value of each antifungal drug.

112 patients were included in the study. All were male, constituted adult, and the median age was 52 years.


## Introduction
The genus Paracoccidioides is a phytopathogenic fungus causing paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic granulomatous mycosis, a systemic mycosis endemic to Latin America (Santamaría et al., 2009; Martins-Alvarez et al., 2015). PCM is the most severe and life-threatening disease caused by this fungus (Martins-Alvarez et al., 2015), which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion annually worldwide (Alvarez et al., 2015).

Paracoccidioides spp. are thermally dimorphic fungi that grow as mycelia in the environment, and as mycelia in soil. Paracoccidioides spp.


## Methods
brasiliensis strain Pb18 were purchased from D. Y. K. Sinyat, Hospital of Fudan University, in the Yunnan region of China. The larvae were maintained on the surface of the surface of the Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate, in a growth chamber at 28°C for 7 days. After the larvae were placed in sterile plastic tubes, the medium was removed from the bottom of the tubes and the larvae were placed in a plastic bag. The insects were collected by exposing the whole abdomen, including the abdomen, and placed on the sterile filter paper. The insects were observed and the identification of the larvae was made by morphological characteristics of the larvae. The larvae were maintained in the dark at room temperature for 1-3 days and the number of dead larvae was recorded. The number of dead larvae was recorded as the number of larvae in the control group.

Identification of the Leukocyte Isolates
Lungs from the control group and the test group were removed and washed with sterile distilled water, then resuspended in PBS. The tubes were vortexed for 30 s and then, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 8000× g for 15 min at 4°C and then, the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was then resuspended in PBS and centrifuged again at 8000× g for 15 min at 4°C, and then, the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were washed with PBS, and then resuspended in PBS. The cells were counted by hemocytometer. The number of leukocytes was calculated by using the following formula: the number of leukocytes was calculated in the control group and the test group, and the number of leukocytes was calculated in the control group and the test group. The cell count was interpreted according to the following formula: the number of cells in the control group and the test group, and the cell count in the control group and the test group, were calculated in the control group and the test group.

The determination of the antifungal activity of the tested fungi
The antifungal activity of the tested fungi was analyzed using the method of Feng et al. [24]. Briefly, five groups of four insect larvae were used for the antifungal assay. In the first group, the insect larvae were treated with antifungal drugs.


## Results
For each test, we analyzed the mice brain biopsies (n = 8) by using confocal microscopy and confocal microscopy to measure the intensity of the immune cell infiltrate in the brai. We observed that inflammatory cells were found in the brain of mice with a significantly greater number of inflammatory cells in the brain (p < 0.05) (Fig 2A).

As we are able to observe that inflammatory cells in the brain were found in the brain, we next evaluated the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of these mice using the confocal microscopy and confocal microscopy techniques. We observed a significant difference in the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of the mice with a significantly higher number of inflammatory cells in the brain (p < 0.05). In addition, we observed a significant difference in the inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of mice with a lower number of inflammatory cells in the brain (Fig 2B).

To further evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Botrytis cinerea infertility, we evaluated the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of mice with a previously described method to evaluate the number of inflammatory cells in the brain using confocal microscopy and confocal microscopy (Zheng et al., 2018). We observed a significant difference in the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of mice with a lower number of inflammatory cells in the brain (p < 0.05) (Fig 2C).

To further evaluate the involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Botrytis cinerea infertility, we next evaluated the intracellular inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of mice with a previously described method to evaluate the number of inflammatory cells in the brain using confocal microscopy and confocal microscopy (Zheng et al., 2018). We observed a significant difference in the intracellular inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brains of mice with a significantly higher number of inflammatory cells in the brain (p < 0.05) (Fig 2D).


## Discussion
In this study, we describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of the mouse model of cryptococcosis and the contribution of an infection model to the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis in C. neoformans var. grubii. The data presented here suggest that the presence of a cryptococcal strain in a mouse model is not sufficient to account for the high mortality of infection. Instead, the mouse model has additional potential roles in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans var. grubii, including fungal replication and the ability to cause disease.

The success of C. neoformans var. grubii infection is known to be associated with a dysbiosis in the immune system, and the emergence of a large number of fungal strains in this species has been shown to be associated with an increased mortality in the immunocompetent hosts. While these findings are consistent with previous studies, their significance lies in their detection of a subpopulation of the pathogenic strain that is not associated with the initial infection, the C. neoformans var. grubii strain. Consistent with this, the vast majority of mice infected with this strain died within 24 hours of infection. Consistent with the assumption that the infection of mice with C. neoformans var. grubii is more severe than the infections of C. neoformans var. neoformans, the mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii had a significantly lower fungal burden and a lower mortality compared to mice infected with C. neoformans var. neoformans.

The mortality of mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii in our study was a moderate to severe disease, but the overall mortality was comparable to the death of mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii, and this was associated with an increased risk of severe cryptococcal infections. Although mortality was high in the lung, the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii showed significant fungal burden, but there was no significant increase in fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii. We believe that this is because the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans var. grubii have a greater capacity to phagocytose the fungus.
