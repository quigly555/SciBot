## Abstract
We report a case of a 62-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) being treated with hydrochlorothiazoline (HdT+ for 5 days). She had a good appetite, and she was given high-dose dosing of hdT+ at once hydrochlorothiazoline (HdT+ for 3 days). She was started on the treatment with 1,200 mg HdT-replenish once daily for 7 days. She also received a 400 mg dose of rituximab. On the second day of treatment, she developed severe abdominal pain, and she had a good appetite for the next day for the next day. The patient was discharged after 3 days. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain showed a solitary lesion, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was elevated in the left parietal lobe, in addition to the bacterial and fungal community detected postmortem. The patient was started on a treatment with high-dose dosing of hdT+ at once hydrochlorothiazoline for 5 days, but she died after 1 month. Our findings indicate that hydrochlorothiazoline use during pregnancy is likely a risk factor for AI.


## Introduction
 2012.

A wide range of pathogens, including parasites, pathogens of plants, fungi and animals, can cause infections in humans and animals, in part, through the inhalation of contaminated air, mainly contaminated with fungi. Some of these can cause disease in humans and animals, and others in some cases are responsible for outbreaks in highly immunocompromised patients. Indeed, immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of opportunistic fungal infections and even in those with uncontrolled diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and autoimmune diseases (Castlebury et al., 2012; Sorrentino, 2013).

Most fungal diseases are caused by fungi, and their incidence has increased dramatically during the past several decades, and continues to increase. For example, the number of infections caused by Aspergillus spp. has increased from more than 400 in the early 1980s to over 1,500 in the early 1990s (O’Brien and Eisman, 2008). The number of cases caused by Candida spp. has also increased, reaching over 400 in 2010 and again ~300 in 2010 (Castlebury et al., 2012). Other opportunistic fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus spp. and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are also increasing, and are increasingly prevalent in patients with chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, transplant recipients and patients receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroid therapy (O’Brien et al., 2009; O’Brien and Eisman, 2010).

The symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis can be very confused with more general symptoms, such as cough, expectoration and exercise problems, which can be very difficult to recognize with conventional histological tests. The treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis depends on the degree of infectious propagules and the species of the pathogen. Pulmonary tuberculosis is classified as class B infectious, non-infectious and contagious. Class B pathogens include, but are not limited to, pneumonitis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, etc. The classification of pulmonary tuberculosis is based on the degree of the infectious propagules and the infecting microorganism (class B or high pathogenic fungi). Class B pathogens are divided into four subtypes, namely, those that cause pneumonia (spirochetes), those that cause meningitis (other), and those that cause pneumonia (hyphae). The pneumonitis type is a variant of the pneumococcal infection.


## Methods
The following diseases were considered: dermatomyositis (. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. lusitaniae, C. rugosa, C. guilliermondii), dermatomyositis (C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii), dermatomyositis (C. lusitaniae), dermatomyositis (C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii), dermatomyositis (C. guilliermondii), dermatomyositis (C. lusitaniae), and dermatomyositis (C. rugosa). The histological features were recorded on microscopic examination of fungal structures and the presence of a number of microcolonies in the samples was recorded using a 4-mm-diameter plug of a healthy sponge and a slide. The degree of dermatomyositis was graded from 1 to 4, and the degree of dermatositis of C. albicans was graded from 1 to 4. The oral symptoms were recorded on the basis of oral swabs. The hystric and mucormyositis were recorded on the basis of the urease (S. cerevisiae, C. albicans), mucormyositis (S. cerevisiae, C. tropicalis, C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii), and hystric and mucormyositis (S. cerevisiae, C. lusitaniae).

4.3. Antimicrobial Activity of the Spores on the Fruit
A typical commercial sugarcane is used for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity, which is based on the results of its antimicrobial activity in the presence of various concentrations of drugs. The solution of the test compounds, which has been shown to be effective against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. guilliermondii, and C.


## Results
The gut bacteria may also play a role in the pathogenicity of the pathoge. However, despite their contributions to the pathogenicity of tropical and oceanic mammals, the gut bacteria can also play a role in the control of colonization by pathogenic fungi. The gut bacteria may also control the pathogenicity of the bacterial and fungal pathogens. As shown in Table 1, the gut bacteria significantly influenced the growth of the pathogen of the two pathogens, however, the gut bacteria did not significantly affect the growth of the pathogen of the other. The gut bacteria could also influence the pathogenicity of the two pathogens, but the differences in their growth may not be statistically significant.

Antimicrobial resistance of the gut bacteria
In order to investigate the antibacterial activity of the gut bacteria, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the gut bacteria was investigated by the MIC, MIC and MFC values. Table 2 shows the MIC, MFC and MFC values of each antibiotic. The MIC value of gentamicin was higher than that of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and kanamycin, which were higher than that of ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, which were higher than that of ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MFC value of gentamicin was higher than that of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and kanamycin, which were higher than that of ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MFC value of ciprofloxacin was higher than that of ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and kanamycin, which were higher than that of ciprofloxacin and kanamycin, respectively.


## Discussion
capitatus, . falciparum, P. donovani, and A. gambiae [26].

The molecular pathogenic potential of the microsporidia is not well understood, but several studies have been published in this field [26,27,28]. A literature search showed that the sreA mutant is highly resistant to several antibiotics including penicillin [29], chloramphenicol [30], streptomycin [31], and amoxicillin [32], suggesting a more virulent role of this gene in these fungi. Moreover, some studies have shown that, apart from their genetic basis, microsporidia differ in their virulence factors, such as biofilm formation and survival in the environment [33]. Moreover, gene disruption mutants of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe also show reduced virulence in animal models [34]. Similarly, in the present study, we found that the sreA mutant has increased resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including penicillin, chloramphenicol, and amoxicillin. The phenotypic characterization of this mutant also showed that the mutant had a reduced ability to tolerate penicillin, chloramphenicol, and amoxicillin, which indicates that these antibiotics might be implicated in the phenotypic changes.

The role of the sreA gene in pathogenesis has been reported in other fungal species, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus nidulans, and Cryptococcus neoformans [35-37]. In addition, the strain of P. willei that showed a high virulence in vitro [38] also showed reduced ability to colonize the human body and cause disease. It was reported that the sreA gene has the potential to enhance the virulence of a wide range of fungi in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the phenotype of the sreA mutant in this study is similar to other strains of this species.

In this study, we showed that the sreA gene encodes a ribosomal protein. Ribosomal proteins are highly conserved among the fungi studied. They play crucial roles in the biology of the fungi and are involved in many aspects of the cellular and developmental processes [39,40]. Recently, it has been reported that the sreA gene encodes a protein with a conserved domain.
