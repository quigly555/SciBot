## Abstract
Genetic changes have resulted in the emergence of diverse phenotypic traits, including the rarefication and loss of virulence, which are associated with virulence in other fungal pathogens. Among fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus is a typical causal agent of the fatal invasive disease A. fumigatus. Here we report a novel mutation in the main regulator of hyphal size in the gene encoding A. fumigatus CYP51A. A. fumigatus CYP51A is a large metal-binding protein and a downstream target of the transcriptional repressor Aft1 that regulates hyphal size. The Aft1 deletion mutant is hypervirulent in murine models of invasive aspergillosis and in the mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis. We also report that Aft1 plays a role in asexual reproduction in A. fumigatus. In comparison with the wild type strain, the Aft1 deletion mutant has fewer cell separation and is hypervirulent in a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis. We show that Aft1 is essential for virulence, and Aft1 deletion mutants also have fewer cell separation and are hypervirulent in a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis. The mutant is also less sensitive to iron than the wild type strain. Finally, we show that Aft1 is required for normal growth in a human mycelium under hypoxic conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that the Aft1 regulator Aft1 is essential for the growth and virulence of A. fumigatus.


## Introduction
These include a function for the inducible Fc<U+03B3> receptor (FcRII), an important regulator of gliotoxin biosynthesis in . graminearum and the transcriptional activator of the EFG1 (EGFR1) protein, as well as the Gcn5 orthologue, Gcn7p. The Gcn5 orthologue Gcn5p is a GcnII/GcnIII complex component that contains the GcnII and GcnIII domains, and binds to the epigressins and GcnIII/GcnIV domains. GcnII and GcnIII are required for survival in the absence of other regulators. GcnIII/GcnIV are required for growth in the absence of GcnII and GcnIII but not GcnIII/GcnIV. In addition, GcnIII/GcnIV can modulate the expression of cell surface genes and effector proteins, and the GcnIII/GcnIV interaction is required for cell growth in the absence of GcnII and GcnIII. The GcnIII/GcnIV interaction is the key factor for cell survival within the host.

In addition to GcnIII/GcnIV, a second G protein (G protein-coupled receptor) is required for cell growth in the absence of G protein-E. G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs) are generally found in eukaryotic cell types and have a conserved domain with conserved cysteine residues with two conserved conserved cysteine residues. GPCRs are expressed by a large number of eukaryotic cell types, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human peripheral blood mononuclea, mouse umbilical vein endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human liver fibroblasts, as well as in the model yeast and human pathogenic fungi, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum [5,6,7,8,9,10]. However, little is known about the role of G proteins in fungal infections.


## Methods
In the supernatants, sequences of the four individual transcripts from each transcript of interest were aligned using Clustal Omeg. In the alignments, the non-redundant region of each gene was removed and a single list of the top ten most abundant genes was selected. A gene of interest was assigned to a gene if its N-terminal codon was detected by GeneMark-ES [53].

Variant conservation and phylogenetic analysis
Variant conservation was analyzed in Mothur v3.6 [54] with default parameters. In Mothur, variables that can be grouped together, and if at least one of them is unique, were clustered into clusters and subjected to a global BLAST search [55]. A dataset of the four strains and seven genes (Table 1) was constructed for this analysis. Each strain was analyzed individually. Variant conservation between the strains was determined by the method of Thierry et al. [56]. Each strain was analyzed in the same way, and the information about its variation was analyzed by the Mothur online tool. Mothur is a statistical software for the molecular methods of phylogenetic analysis and to determine the distribution of microorganisms, as well as the phylogenetic relationships. The data of the data were analyzed in Mothur online.

Phylogenetic analysis
The evolutionary distances were computed using the neighbor-joining method of the MEGA 6 software [57]. The sequences of the species of Micrococcus anomala were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database [58]. The phylogenetic relationships between the six genera of Micrococcus and three species of Micrococcus were obtained from the results of a comparative analysis of the genomes of these species [58]. The phylogenetic relationships were analyzed in MEGA 6 software with default parameters. The phylogenetic trees were obtained from a neighbor-joining tree of the four species in Mothur. The neighbor-joining tree was generated in MEGA 6 software, and the phylogenetic relationships were analyzed in the online tool MEGA 6 online.

Bacterial strains
The strain from which the mycelial suspension was obtained was obtained from a Brazilian College of Pathology (CPT)  [59]. The inoculum was prepared from an inoculum of a T.


## Results
We analyzed the regulation of these genes in the context of the pathogen-host interaction (PHI) pathway using RNA-seq dat. The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

The protein kinase (PKC) subunit, PiK1, was found to be the most regulated gene in our data. PiK1 is a MAPK and its cognate subunit, PiK2, is a phosphatase. PiK2 is a typical S. cerevisiae-like protein that binds to epimin and its phosphatase [45]. Although it is known that PiK2 is required for proper virulence [45], we found that PiK2 was also found to be responsive to various stimuli. PiK2 is a vacuolar heat shock protein (VSP) that is important for proper temperature regulation [46]. PiK2 has been shown to bind to various heat shock proteins including heat shock proteins from the heat shock protein heat shock [47]. PiK2 has been shown to be required for proper temperature regulation and for yeast-like growth [46]. These results suggest that PiK2 may be involved in the regulation of temperature-regulated transcription factors and may also be involved in the regulation of host-pathogen interactions.

The yeast-like cell wall biosynthesis pathway was shown to be required for virulence [48], and we found that PiK2-deficient strain was more virulent than the wild type in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis [49]. We therefore tested whether PiK2 also is involved in the filamentous growth pathway. As the PiK2-deficient strain was less virulent than the wild type in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis, we also tested the virulence of the PiK2-deficient strain in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis [50]. The PiK2-deficient strain was more virulent than the wild type in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis [50].

The adhesin-1-like transcription factor (Adh1) and the CCR4 gene are critical for the virulence of the fungus [51]. The CCR4 gene was previously shown to be required for C. neoformans virulence [52].


## Discussion
fumigatus genome, which is comparable to the genome of . neoformans. Furthermore, three transcription factors, TF1 (Afu-gli1) and Tch2 (Afu-ppi2), were found to be present in the A. fumigatus genome, which is similar to the genome of C. neoformans. The second transcription factor, Gsc1, was found to be present in the A. fumigatus genome, which is similar to the genome of C. neoformans. The third transcription factor, Tsc2, was found to be present in the A. fumigatus genome, which is similar to the genome of C. neoformans.

Although the gene functions of the three TFs were clearly different, the results of this study clearly show that the three TFs are highly conserved in A. fumigatus. The A. fumigatus TFs are transcriptionally related to TF1, Tsc1, and Tsc2, suggesting that the three TFs are involved in the A. fumigatus complex. The transcriptional TFs were predicted to contain several genes that were found to be involved in the growth, development, and stress responses of A. fumigatus. Among them, two genes, TF2 and TF3, were found to be involved in the growth and virulence of A. fumigatus. Another gene, TF4, was found to be involved in the growth and the stress responses of A. fumigatus. TF5 and TF6 were found to be involved in the virulence of A. fumigatus. The TFs are involved in the fungal pathogenicity and the mycelial growth of A. fumigatus.

The TFs in A. fumigatus are involved in a variety of different biological processes, such as metabolism, cell proliferation, and stress responses, such as cell-cell fusion and appressorium formation. The TFs are also involved in various developmental processes, such as transcription, mRNA processing, and protein trafficking, among others. The TFs are involved in different cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and apoptosis-related proteins.
