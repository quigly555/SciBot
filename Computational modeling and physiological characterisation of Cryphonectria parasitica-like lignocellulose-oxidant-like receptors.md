## Abstract
Itraconazole, the main azole drug used for the treatment of symptomatic, haemolytic and cutaneous mycoses in developing countries, is recommended for use in neonatal and paediatric patients with skin ulcers. A shorter duration of treatment (12-18 days) is preferred over longer, more prolonged and expensive drugs. We conducted this study to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and major cytotoxic mechanisms (main activities) of azoles at different duration from two different patient groups.

We analyzed data from 196 neonatal and paediatric patients who treated with oral or corticosteroid therapy in a two-year period by our hospital. We used a multistage design and multiple time points to find correlation between time groups. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-info.

We found that the treatment duration for all the patients in the two-year period was longer than for the period for all the patients in the non-group period. The majority of the patients treated with azoles for extended periods in groups were older adults and the median age was 35 years (range: 17 to 50 years). The median ICU admission for patients treated with fluconazole for the extended-spectrum azoles therapy was 22 days (range: 1 to 50), with an average of 25 days for patients with hemoeopathy.


## Introduction
Although there are many biological properties related to the presence of pigments in eukaryotic cells, only a few molecules of pigment can be considered as the major molecules participating in the interaction between the cells of the pigments [27. However, for example, it was recently reported that the release of the pigments from eukaryotic cells is regulated by the activity of the pigmented molecules [28]. Pigment molecules also participate in the interaction with the cell wall of fungi, bacteria and viruses [29], [30].

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a central role in the regulation of many biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival of cells, such as fungi, plants and animals [31], [32]. The cAMP-PKA pathway consists of two catalytic subunits, which are activated by various substrates, e.g. amino acids, nitrogen sources and oxygen [33], [34]. The cAMP-PKA response is initiated by two downstream serine/threonine kinases, phosphodiesterases (PDTs) and phosphatases, which are responsible for the phosphorylation of target proteins and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling cascades [35]. The cAMP-PKA pathway is also activated by several non-cytoplasmic proteins, e.g. cAMP-binding protein-encoding genes (ABCs), membrane proteins and cell wall proteins [31]. Besides cAMP-PKA, other signaling cascades, including MAPK cascades and the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade, are involved in the regulation of many biological processes, e.g. development, immune response, development and tumor progression [36], [37].

The roles of the cAMP-PKA pathway in the control of cell wall integrity are still not clearly understood. The roles of the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade are still not clear, however, cAMP-PKA activation and subsequent phosphorylation of the cell wall proteins, which are important in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and cell morphology, have been demonstrated in some cells, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell wall integrity [38-40].

We previously reported that the cAMP-PKA signaling cascade is involved in the control of cell morphology, e.g.


## Methods
Study design
We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the clinical and laboratory data of patients with cryptococcal meningitis who underwent ART in Seoul National University Hospital (Sungwon-Chung Memorial Hospital) in South Korea.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of South Korea (No. 03/11/2012).

Study design
We reviewed and approved the relevant articles and abstracts of the Medline and the Cochrane Library of Science, and of the Joint Clinical Research Committees of Korea General Hospital (KGDH) in South Korea, as well as the Korean Cryptococcal Association (KGCA) in Japan.

Study design
We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who were admitted to our hospital in Seoul National University between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. We used a case definition of cryptococcal meningitis (a = 6-digit cryptococcal antigen) to identify cases with definite clinical syndrome. The demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded.

Study design
We analyzed data from four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PubMed Central, and Scopus. We extracted articles from the PubMed database and searched the databases using the following search terms: ‘Cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘Cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘cryptococcal meningitis’, ‘cryptococcal meningitis’ and ‘Cryptococcus meningitis’. We excluded articles on the basis of low quality and/or language barriers.

Study design
We performed a literature review of the published reports of cryptococcal meningitis among patients admitted to our hospital in Seoul National University between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. We used a case definition of cryptococcal meningitis to identify cases with definite clinical syndrome.


## Results

Our previous studies have shown that in the absence of xylose, the inactivation of TNF-a by 30-min xylose induces the activation of the distinct thioredoxin (T3) signaling pathway [11,12. The T3-dependent TNF-a production in response to xylose is a key component of T3-induced TNF-a production and further evidences the importance of this pathway in T. parasitica [13]. We used a mouse model in which T3 is constitutively expressed in the CNS, and TNF-a expression is activated by xylose [14]. Since thioredoxin is the primary inducer of TNF-a production in the CNS [14], we wanted to evaluate the induction of TNF-a in the brain using the mouse model. The brain was stained with PBS and xylose-containing medium for 2 h, and brain sections were examined every 2 h. The images in the sections of the thioredoxin-expressing cells were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in which all cells were stained with FM4-64-labeled proteins and/or antibodies against TNF-a, and were used to evaluate the brain morphology.

All thioredoxin-expressing cells were found to be normal and did not show signs of morphologic alteration and in some cases, the brain was also stained with antibodies against TNF-a (Figure 1). However, T3-induced TNF-a production in the thioredoxin-expressing cells was significantly reduced compared with that in the control cells (Figure 1). These results indicate that T3 may activate the distinct Th2 and Th17 pathways, which in turn induces TNF-a production.


## Discussion
Two C-3-containing lectins, C-1 and C-3-2, have been found to be expressed in the Cryphonectria-like receptors and the cell membrane-associated receptors (CLRs) in human lymphoma cell lines [46. These C-3-containing lectins were identified by high-throughput and high-throughput amplicon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The C-3-containing lectins, C-1 and C-3-2, were identified by comparing the high-throughput amplicon sequencing results with the phylogenetic analysis.

The molecular architecture of the C-3-containing lectins is complex and their structure is highly conserved among the different types of lectins. For instance, the lectins C1 and C-2 are 1,3-ß-glucan-binding lectins, whereas C-3 and C-4 are 1,3-ß-glucan-binding lectins [47]. The C-3-2-glucan receptor is a C-3-linked lectin (C2H^GlcNAc) that belongs to the family C3-H3 family [48]. It has been shown that C-3 and C-4 glucan receptors have the same pattern of regulation, and the interaction is mediated by the C-4 glucan receptor [49]. In this study, we found that the lectin C-3-H3 family has the highest number of members in the C-3-H3 family, which were similar to those in the CMC, CMC-1, CMC-2, and CMC-3 family, which were similar to those in the CMC-2 family, which were similar to those in the CMC-3 family.
