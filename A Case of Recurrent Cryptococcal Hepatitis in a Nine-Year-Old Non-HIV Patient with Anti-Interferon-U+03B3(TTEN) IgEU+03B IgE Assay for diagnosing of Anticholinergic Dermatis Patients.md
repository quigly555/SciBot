## Abstract
One of the most important characteristics of Cryptococcus neoformans is their ability to form biofilms. Biofilms are complex structures consisting of a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). MAbs isolated from the fungus Cystobasidium sinensis can significantly contribute to the development of cryptococcal biofilms. However, the potential of mAbs isolated from C. sinensis in producing biofilms does not appear to be relevant. In this study, we generated C.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella includes 10,615 species described from more than 70 genera of eukaryotic and prokaryotic branches, and 10,615 of them are cosmopolitan, representing infections of various organs [1,2]. This genus comprises a vast range of plant pathogenic fungi that cause superficial and potentially lethal infections in plants. Microscopic studies on mycosphaerella have revealed a wide variety of biological characters that are not found in other genera, including the presence of hemibiotroph and mycosphaerella-like photopigments [3,4], the presence of melanized mycelia on the conidia [5], and the production of spores, hyphae, conidia, and conidia with a distinctive cell morphology [6]. Many mycosphaerella-related fungal species have been reported to cause diseases in animals, plants, insects, or even plants themselves [7]. Thus, the genus Mycosphaerella is recognized as an important and complex ecological system with a wide range of biotechnological, pharmacological, and health benefits, which together make this genus one of the largest assemblages of pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi known to date [8].

The genus Mycosphaerella is a polyphyletic group, consisting of about 30 species, and some of them are regarded as saprophytes, whereas others are parasitic or mutualistic [9]. Approximately 100 of these species of the genus are found in tropical and subtropical countries and several of them are found in temperate regions, such as Papua New Guinea, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, South America, and South Africa [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. Some species of Mycosphaerella are important plant pathogens, such as F. graminearum, which infect maize and can cause food- and insect-borne diseases, and F. oxysporum which causes soft rot disease on several plant species [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31].


## Methods
The protocol for the ELISA of IFIs in a Cohort of HIV-infected Patients with Anti-IFIs Assays (CIFI-HIV) was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, and Washington University, S. Louis, MO, for the use of humans and animals, respectively.

The initial ELISA was performed with a standardized sandwich ELISA with a data-dependent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Waters). An aliquot of the sample was stored at -20°C in micro-centrifuge tubes until use. The diluted samples (1 µl) were mixed with 10 µl of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 µl of Tween 80 (20 µl/ml). The diluted solutions were transferred to a 2 ml syringe and an aerosol barrier (Pac-Flow™ EZO-EASY) was used to make a single-line. The endotoxin level in the sample was determined using a commercial colorimetric assay (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA).

The development of the antitumoral activity of the compounds was performed in accordance with the methods of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A3, as follows. Briefly, the compounds were diluted in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration of 2.5×10^4/ml and serially diluted with RPMI-1640. The negative control was included in the experiments. All the drugs were diluted in RPMI-1640 at a concentration of 10% (v/v). The lower limit of detection was 50% of viable cell counts.

The antifungal activity of the compounds was determined by using the method of the CLSI document M27-A3 with modification. The results were obtained by using a 5-µl aliquot of the drug solution (10 µl) in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. The assay plates were incubated at 35°C and reading at the wavelength of 485 nm. The lowest concentration of the drug that produced no inhibition of growth was considered the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).


## Results
Construction of the Tricornin-dependent RNAi Membrane
In silico analysis of Tricornin-dependent RNAi mRNA mRNA expression using an N. crassa wild-type strain showed that the Tricornin-dependent RNAi protein was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of C. albicans cells growing in the presence of Tricornin (Fig 1A). However, the expression of the Tricornin-dependent RNAi mRNA in the presence of Tricornin was weak and did not occur at the same level as in the presence of the known Tricornin resistance factors. The Tricornin-dependent RNAi protein was detected by western blotting with a probe specific for the Tricornin-dependent RNAi protein (Fig 1B).


## Discussion
Blood cultures were negative for fungal element. We suspected that the patient had a high infectious burden with multiple CNS infections. The patient was on a prednisone and anti-inflammatory treatment, which might have prevented the development of ADEM. This might have been a risk factor for the development of ADEM in our patient.

As in our case, our patient also presented with a severe acute encephalomyelitis. This might have been a risk factor for the development of ADEM. The patient with the most severe acute encephalomyelitis had a CD4 count of 100 cells/µl, which is more than that of the non-infected patient with ADEM. However, ADEM is rare, and it is often present in patients with a previous history of viral meningitis.

An autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a rare disease that can occur in patients with HIV infection, and it is rarely associated with viral meningitis. Our patient had a history of herpes zoster (HHZ-a, herpes-2), and viral meningitis. We suspected that the patient had a previous history of viral infection. However, the patient was on a prednisone and anti-inflammatory treatment, which might have been a risk factor for the development of ADEM.

The patient with ADEM had a high viral load with a CD4 count of 100 cells/µl, which was less than that in our patient. These findings may have been due to the low CD4 count in our patient.

Our patient had a history of viral hepatitis, and we suspected that this was a cause of ADEM. The patient had an increased frequency of fever and neck stiffness, and there were no signs of leukocytosis. The patient had a history of viral hepatitis. It has been reported that, in HIV infected individuals, the immune system is weakened, and a high viral load can result in a high risk of infection with hepatitis C virus [10]. The patient had a history of viral hepatitis and a history of viral encephalitis. Our patient had a history of viral hepatitis, and viral hepatitis was not a risk factor for the development of ADEM.

The patient had an immunocompromised status, and we suspected that this was a risk factor for the development of ADEM.
