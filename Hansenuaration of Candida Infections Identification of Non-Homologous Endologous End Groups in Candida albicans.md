## Abstract
Epilepsy is a recognized diagnostic tool used for the early diagnosis of endocrine malignancies and could be considered an independent factor in the identification of endocrine abnormalities in the endocrinologist’s chart. In recent years, the number of cases of endocrine malignancies has increased with the increase of women coming to the clinic to receive hormone replacement therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Epi-EGG test in endocrine cancer patients.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Child and Adult Surgery Department of Zhejiang University Hospital between March 2013 and June 2014. Endocrine charts were extracted from 30 patients and selected from the clinic for both rapid and stable testing. Endocrine charts were processed using a Java program for Mac and PC (javax.com).

Use of the Epi-EGG test was very reliable in detecting breast cancer in patients with advanced disease. The performance of the Epi-EGG test was comparable between patients with BRCA B40 and those with advanced cancer (BKD 2052 and KS 2527). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of the Epi-EGG test were 93.7% and 85.4% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the Epi-EGG test were 92.4% and 85.8% respectively.

The results of this study indicated the use of the Epi-EGG test to be a reliable method for the early diagnosis of endocrine cancer in patients with advanced cancer.

## Introduction
 2013. They are difficult to treat, and are associated with high costs, significant mortality, and difficult to diagnose (Pfaller and Diekema, 2006). In the past decade, numerous new antifungal agents have been introduced into the market (Hajishengallis et al., 2018; Cho, 2013). These agents have broad-spectrum activity against yeasts, filamentous fungi, and other pathogens (Kumar and Das, 2012; Kumar and Das, 2016; Kumar et al., 2018). For example, it was reported that azoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole) can effectively inhibit C. albicans growth and the hyphal growth of C. albicans (Kumar and Das, 2012). However, the antifungal properties of these drugs are not well defined. Recently, it has been reported that various antifungals, including polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B), polyenes (e.g., itraconazole), and echinocandins, are affected by different Candida species (Tisserant et al., 2013; Kumar and Das, 2016; Kumar et al., 2018). The mechanism(s) by which azoles inhibit the growth of C. albicans include: inhibition of the fungal cell cycle, by the azole, through the accumulation of ergosterol, or by the inhibition of cell wall integrity (CWI) (Kumar and Das, 2012; Kumar et al., 2018). It is likely that azoles have many mechanisms of action by which they can affect fungal cell wall biosynthesis, such as: inhibition of glycosylation, inhibition of cyclobutyl-dependent enzymes, and, in addition, inhibition of fungal cell wall biosynthesis (Tisserant et al., 2013; Kumar and Das, 2016).

The role of membrane-bound sterols
Several types of membrane bound sterols have been found in fungi, such as ergosterol and ergosterol, and these molecules are recognized by proteins that bind sterols in different ways, including by binding to sterol-binding proteins (SBPs) (Otsumi et al.


## Methods

Antibody production
The different mycelial morphologies of Candida albicans were evaluated by immunocytochemistr. Briefly, Candida albicans cells were grown overnight in liquid YPD at 30 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and the number of yeast cells (cells/mL) was calculated. The cells were then adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.

Evaluation of antigens in the cell lysates of Candida albicans
To analyze the antigens production of Candida albicans, the cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI medium. The medium was then carefully removed, and the supernatant was removed by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The lysates were then centrifuged again to remove non-specific antigen from the cells, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again to remove non-specific binding sites from the cells. The supernatant was then removed and the pellets were resuspended in 100 µL of 1% Triton X-100, and the amount of antigens in the supernatant was determined using the EZ proteomics assay kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the experiments.

Lipid extraction
The extraction of lipid was performed as previously described [41]. Briefly, Candida albicans cells were grown overnight in liquid YPD at 30 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS. The cells were then diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in PBS.


## Results
The resulting data are used as queries in a query search in the CLUSTALM database and the resulting search results are annotated with the terms “endogeneously expressed” and “endogenously expressed. The results from the in silico analysis are presented in Figure 3.

The results from the in silico analysis showed that the results from the in silico analysis resulted in the identification of non-homologous end groups in Candida albicans, especially in the TCA cycle. In addition, the in silico analysis results also demonstrated the identification of non-homologous end groups in Candida albicans. In order to determine the presence of non-homologous end groups in the non-homologous endogenously expressed genes in Candida albicans, we further investigated the PIC (parametric test) in the PIC_GST and PIC_TIP models.


## Discussion
 2014. In this study, we aimed to identify non-homologous end proteins in this fungus. This may be achieved by the use of a recombinant, non-homologous endogenes and the use of a fixed amount of recombinant DNA. This approach would be more efficient than the use of recombinant DNA or other recombinant methods (Zhou et al., 2012). Our approach was also successful in the identification of non-homologous end proteins in Candida albicans (C. albicans ATCC 23344) (Figure 5). In addition, the use of recombinant DNA resulted in a similar identification rate.

The number of non-homologous end proteins in Candida albicans was only about 10 in C. albicans, compared to about 70 in C. neoformans (Figure 2). This difference may be related to the relatively smaller number of non-homologous end proteins in this fungus. In this study, we found that C. albicans contains 4 non-homologous endogenes, and the number of these proteins varied from 1 to 4 in C. neoformans, while the number of non-homologous end proteins in C. albicans was 6 (Figure 3). This result suggested that the number of non-homologous end proteins in C. albicans might be lower than in C. neoformans.

In the current study, we found that non-homologous endogenes were the major group in the non-homologous end protein sequences in C. albicans. It is noteworthy that the number of non-homologous end proteins was not significantly different in C. albicans and C. neoformans. This may be due to the fact that C. albicans contains 2 non-homologous endogenes, but the number of non-homologous end proteins is very small.

Non-homologous end proteins were found in almost all the non-homologous end proteins sequences in C. albicans, C. neoformans and C. albicans. The number of non-homologous end proteins was found to be about 8 in C. albicans, and only about 2 in C. neoformans.
