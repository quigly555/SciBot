## Abstract
Current data regarding the prevalence of C. auris infections in Africa and Asia are still scanty. This study was intended to investigate the risk factors for invasive candidiasis in infants born in either tropical or sub-tropical Asia, using culture-dependent and -independent methods. We performed a retrospective review of published articles pertaining to C. auris, including articles published in the English language of 26 relevant studies until August 2011. We also searched for abstracts of relevant referendums, and a full text review of the literature was included in this review. The estimated incidence of candidiasis was estimated at 6,377,259 cases in 2000. Of the 6,377,259 cases, 4,928 (62.1%) were C. auris susceptible. Factors associated with the occurrence of candidiasis were: birth cohort birth cohort birth cohort = 0; = 1; = 2; = 3; = 4; = 5; = 6,324,489, and = 7,223,198 = 8,026,825 treated the same as in the previous study. Candidiasis was more frequent in infants born in sub-tropical Asia than in the rest of Asia, especially in infants born in India, the Middle East, and Africa. Fewer infants in sub-tropical Asia died from candidiasis in 2011 than in the rest of the world. Therefore, we conducted this study to estimate the incidence of C. auris causing fatal disease in infants born in sub-tropical Asia.

We included all articles describing the incidence of candidiasis in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the articles, we included other potential risk factors, such as infections with drugs, for which we included the mortality rate. We estimated the incidence using the most recent estimation by using the most recent estimate from the World Health Organization (WHO). We estimated the risk of infection according to the most recent estimate from the time series for tropical and temperate Asia were 10.0%, 10.0% and 10.0%, respectively.

Although there was a slight increase in the number of articles describing the incidence of candidiasis in the region compared with the last estimate, the mortality rate remained unchanged. Our estimate of the risk of infection was similar to the estimates from previous studies.

We found a moderate tendency for the emergence of C. auris from non-natural causes of infection.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients, especially cancer patients and transplant recipients, as well as in apparently healthy patients (1). In the context of immune recovery, C. albicans has evolved several different immune evasion strategies, including the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and the secretion of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [reviewed in (2-5)]. In addition, C. albicans has evolved distinct genetic and physiological systems to evade the host immune system, such as the aberrant cell wall composition, the ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts of polysaccharides, and the ability to synthesize and secrete lytic enzymes and polysaccharide toxins. These mechanisms of evasion allow C. albicans to thrive in different environments, such as biofilms, where it can spread through specialized extracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (6-8). The fungal cell wall is essential for its own synthesis, which is controlled by the complex, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell wall glycoproteins (CWGs) (9). CWGs are formed by a core moiety of GPI-anchored glycoproteins that are attached to the asparagine residue in the N-terminal glyceraldehyde-3-phascule (GAS) domain of the N-terminal proteinase superfamily (GAS-N) glycoproteins (10).


## Methods
fijiensis and Pseudomonas syrhamicu. The bacterial isolates were isolated from venison, aseptically placed in 1 mL of sterile distilled water and stored at -20°C until use. The concentration of DNA isolated from venison was determined by the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The genomic DNA from a single isolate of Pseudomonas syrhamicum was also extracted by PCR and sequencing using primers P1 and P2 (Table S1). Primers P1 and P2 were used to amplify the ITS2 region of the bacterial isolates, and P1 and P2 were used to amplify the ITS region of the Pseudomonas spp. isolates. The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µL using a total volume of 25 µL of DNA extract from each isolate (Table S1). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, 30 s at 72°C and 30 s at 72°C, followed by a final elongation step of 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels. The PCR products were purified with the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR products were stored at -20°C. The purified PCR products were sequenced using a BigDye^® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences obtained were deposited in the GenBank (Table S1) and their accession numbers are shown in Table 1.

2.3. Gene Expression and Analysis
The mRNA of the two fungal species was extracted from the whole gut of the tested animals using the RNAiso Plus Kit (Tiangen, Shanghai, China). The mRNA was purified using a DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNA of the two species were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq-2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).


## Results
The meat batzella produced by the Petri dishwasher in the slaughterhouse was processed with or without the use of DSC, DSC and DMEM (Table 1. The time needed for preparation of meat from the DSC-and/or DMEM-free food was estimated at three days for preparation of meat and two days for processing. The meat Batzella fijiensis is produced after five days in the slaughterhouse. The meat Batzella fijiensis (at least once) was firstly analyzed by histochemical examination of the meat batzella. The histological analysis showed a pattern of thickened and darkened blood vessels in the tissue and was accompanied by a slight increase in the number of inflammatory cells and the presence of blood clotting cells and lymphocytes. In addition, the number of necrotic cells was lower in the tissue (Table 1). The number of the inflammatory cells was increased in the meat Batzella fijiensis (Table 1). The number of blood cells was greater in the meat Batzella fijiensis (Table 1). The blood clotting cells were small and there were no large blood clotting cells in the tissue.

The production of blood clotting cells in the meat Batzella fijiensis is more evident in the image of a blood clotting cells (Figure 1). In the meat Batzella fijiensis, the blood clotting cells were extremely abundant (Figure 1). The blood clotting cells were mainly stained by mycobacterial species and blood-derived red blood cells. In the meat Batzella fijiensis, the blood clotting cells were stained by a red blood cell stain but also by red blood-derived red cells (Figure 1). The blood clotting cells were highly abundant (Figure 1). The blood clotting cells stained by red blood cells were very weak (Figure 1). The red blood cells stained by red blood cells were also highly abundant in the meat Batzella fijiensis (Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows the histopathology of the meat Batzella fijiensis in the meat Batzella fijiensis compared with that of the other three species. The meat Batzella fijiensis had the typical appearance of the domestic cat.
