## Abstract
Fungal infections are of particular concern because they are often associated with unfavorable therapeutic outcomes. This review aims to collect information about the most important fungal pathogens and their susceptibility patterns to antifungal agents, as well as their optimal treatments. A common underlying disease or condition that is commonly associated with high mortality rates is the presence of a causative agent. Alternative treatments are excluded from this population, while supportive measures are suggested. Therapeutic outcomes of fungi in dire need of new, alternative and/or complementary agents. We aim to synthesize the best published data regarding fungus-fluconazole interaction and treatment, as well as information on optimal and treatment of resistant fungi.

A search was carried out using abstracts, articles, literature or clinical case studies, January-December 2016. Results were analyzed using Mann Whitney ANOSA II, January-December 2016.

Forty-four (83.3%) fungi were included in this study, in which 18 isolates from 28 different pathogens were identified as the main cause of mortality. Among the 18 excluded fungi, 11 species were resistant to amphotericin B and fluconazole, while six were resistant to caspofungin.


## Introduction
Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive diseases in rice and causes substantial economic losses worldwide. In rice, the fungus causes large-scale yield losses and is estimated to cost up to $5.7 billion in the United States alone (Brown et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). During the past decades, the emergence of rice as an opportunistic pathogen has promoted a plethora of new fungal pathogens (Tsao et al., 2012). Many of these new pathogenic fungi are increasingly identified as opportunistic pathogens of other crops and animals, such as wheat, maize, and soybean, causing serious economic losses for global grain storage (e.g., Cramer et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008; Joffe and Zhang, 2010). In addition, the emergence of invasive fungal pathogens in plants is a threat to human health (e.g.


## Methods
This study was conducted in a local field with permission from the local administrative office of the Department of Biotechnology and Biotechnolog. For the evaluation of the spore production, mycelium and basidiospores of Paracoccidioides spp. in different soil conditions, samples were collected from two sites in the north and south of the island (Fig 2 and Fig S1). Spores were cultured on solid potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 24-48 h at room temperature. After incubation, the mycelium was removed and transferred to the fresh PDA medium at room temperature. The mycelium was harvested by filtration on a 0.22-µm pore size filter, the collected spore was filtered through a 70 µm pore size membrane and washed with distilled water. The collected spore was air-dried at ambient temperature for 24 h. The collected spore was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 h. After sample preparation, the mycelium was placed on a glass slide and covered with a wet-paper layer. The top of the slide was dried over night and placed in a moist chamber. The dried spore was placed in a rotary shaker for 24 h at the desired temperature and the lower phase was stored at 4 °C for further use. The spore was placed in a moist oven for 4 h to allow the growth of spores and then stored at 4 °C for further use.

2.5. Antimicrobial Assays
Antimicrobial activity was determined as the percentage of fungi that were able to cause a single colony to grow on the test substrate. The test was performed in triplicate. The test was performed on a scale of 0-4 and three replicates were performed for each concentration. The bacterial colonies on the test substrate were counted and compared with the control. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and the fungal colonies were counted. The turbidity of the fungal colonies was measured using a spectrophotometer at 540 nm.

2.6. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activities of the tested compounds were determined in the same manner as described before with slight modifications (3).


## Results
Lamellar and crenate organelles are typical of the suborder Cucurbitariacea. The Cladosporium genera are placed in Cladosporium cladosebriae, the genera Cucurbitariaceae and Hypocrespora. The genera Hypocrespora and Cucurbitariaceae are placed in the cladosporioid group, while Cucurbitariaceae and Cladosporium cladosporioides are placed in the gliotoxin and gliotoxin genera.

The cladosporium-specific Cladosporium lividans clade formed by the cladosporium-specific Cladosporium lividans clade was also supported by phylogenetic analyses, but not in the Bayesian analysis (Fig 1). The Bayesian analysis of the LSU rDNA sequence data indicated that the cladosporium clade was closely related to Cladosporium cuniculi (Fig 1).

Cladosporium vinacea was proposed by Wikee (1988) as a novel species of Cucurbitaria and Cucurbitaria in the genus Cucurbitaria. He described four different species, including the genus Cucurbitaria. The type species of Cucurbitaria, C. vinacea, was a member of the Cladosporium clade (Fig 2). The phylogenetic analyses indicated that C. vinacea was closely related to the cladosporium clade (Fig 1). The cladosporium-specific Cladosporium cladosporium clade was nested in the cladosporium clade with Cladosporium vinacea as sister taxon. The cladosporium clade was supported by the Bayesian and NJ trees, but not in the NJ tree (Fig 2).

Cladosporium vinacea was proposed by Wikee (1988) as a new species of Cucurbitaria and Cucurbitaria. He described six different species of Cucurbitaria, including the species C. vinacea. The type species of Cucurbitaria, C. vinacea, was a member of the Cucurbitaria clade (Fig 2). The phylogenetic analyses indicated that C. vinacea was closely related to C. vinacea and C.


## Discussion
Most of the extracellular Vesicles were chitin-binding domains that were found in the extracellular vesicles of most lichenicolous lichens [58.

To our knowledge, there are no reports of extracellular vesicles in lichenicolous lichenicolous species. However, it has been shown that extracellular vesicles of lichenicolous species are produced from extracellular material [59]. Our results suggest that the extracellular vesicles could be produced from the extracellular material of lichenicolous species. This finding is not unexpected, as there has been a study by Barata et al. [60] that reported extracellular vesicles produced from a large number of lichenicolous lichenicolous species. This finding is in line with our results, as the authors used an extracellular material of a lichenicolous lichenicolous species and obtained vesicles. However, our results indicated that the lichenicolous lichenicolous species, Cry1, could not produce extracellular vesicles. Although our data suggest that the lichenicolous lichenicolous species does not produce extracellular vesicles, we believe that the existence of extracellular vesicles in the lichenicolous species would be expected. The lichenicolous species, Cry1, could not produce extracellular vesicles. It seems that the lichenicolous species could not produce extracellular vesicles.

The extracellular vesicles of lichenicolous species were not produced in vitro. However, they could be produced in vivo by lichenicolous lichens. According to the study by Smith et al. [61], extracellular vesicles are produced from the extracellular material of lichenicolous lichenicolous species. However, the authors also found extracellular vesicles in other lichenicolous lichenicolous species. This suggests that extracellular vesicles could be produced from the extracellular material of lichenicolous lichenicolous species.

The extracellular vesicles of lichenicolous species were produced in vitro. However, they could be produced in vivo by lichenicolous lichens.
