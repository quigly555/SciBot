## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of essential oils from Cymbopogon winterianis (L.) Koselnya (Myrtaceae) against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis isolates. The essential oils were prepared by the dilution method in phosphate-buffered saline and identified by GC-MS. The antifungal activity of the essential oils was evaluated by the broth serial method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using microdilution methods.

The essential oils from Cymbopogon winterianis (L.) Koselnya (Myrtaceae) showed activity against both species. MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 µg/mL and from 1.25 to 1.63 µg/mL for C. albicans, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and A. fumigatus, respectively. The antifungal activity of the essential oils were dose-dependent and ranged from 1.25 to 7.04 µg/mL for A. fumigatus, 1.98 to 2.


## Introduction
The human body is inhabited by diverse microorganisms that thrive in a wide range of habitats, including, but not limited to, the gastrointestinal tract (GL), skin, oral mucosa, respiratory tract, and central nervous system.1, 2 The estimated global incidence of opportunistic fungal infections is 1.5 million annually, and the most common opportunistic fungal infection is invasive aspergillosis, a disease that causes severe, life-threatening and frequently fatal systemic infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients.3, 4, 5, 6 The most common opportunistic fungal pathogens are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii.2, 6, 7

C. albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes infections in the skin, mucosal surfaces, oral mucosa, and other tissues. C. albicans is also responsible for a wide range of other infections, including meningoencephalitis, and is also responsible for a large number of deaths in the immunocompromised patients.2, 8

The most common forms of C. albicans infection are asymptomatic and asymptomatic forms. However, in immunocompromised patients, C. albicans can cause life-threatening mucocutaneous infections, termed biofilm infections.2, 9, 10 The pathogenicity of C. albicans has evolved in tandem with the emergence of drug resistance.2, 11, 12, 13 In recent decades, C. albicans has emerged as an important pathogen of humans, with the emergence of resistance to benzodiazepine, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin, itraconazole, and isavuconazole as well as to flucytosine.


## Methods
graminearum genome (Genome-Wide Identification and Assay of Mutational Analysis in the Caspase-11 Factor in Aspergillus fumigatus) and the genomic sequence of . oxysporum (Genome-Wide Identification and Assay of Mutational Analysis in the Caspase-11 Factor in Aspergillus fumigatus was used as a reference sequence for gene annotation. Reads of Aspergillus fumigatus were aligned with the F. graminearum genome sequence using the STAR aligner [22]. Reads of Aspergillus fumigatus were aligned to the genome sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. Reads of F. oxysporum were aligned to the genomic sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. Reads of Aspergillus fumigatus were aligned to the genome sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. Reads of Aspergillus fumigatus were aligned to the genome sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. Reads of Aspergillus niger were aligned to the genome sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. Reads of F. oxysporum were aligned to the genome sequence of F. oxysporum using the STAR aligner. The following settings were used for all alignments: -cM -Mn -N -C -Mv. The F. oxysporum genome was used as reference sequence for gene annotation.

Molecular Structure and Functional Analysis
The genome sequence of F. oxysporum was obtained from GenBank (accession number PRJNA536196). The sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus was obtained from the F. oxysporum genome sequence (Genome-Wide Identification and Assay of Mutational Analysis in the F. oxysporum F. graminearum) using the default settings. The F. oxysporum F. graminearum genome was used as a reference sequence for gene annotation.

## Discussion
As a result, the number of genes in the cluster was similar to the number in the other fungi (Fig S2A. These genes were assigned to 4 subfamilies (Table S1). Four subfamilies of the Caspase-11 factor were assigned to a small number of genes in A. fumigatus (Fig S2B). The gene set of A. fumigatus involved in the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus was assigned to the same subfamily (Table S2).

The Caspase-11 factor gene cluster was divided into subfamilies (Fig S2B). The subfamily URA1, the main component of the Caspase-11 factor gene cluster, was divided into two subfamilies (Fig S2A and B). The genes involved in the pathway of biosynthesis of the Caspase-11 factor in A. fumigatus were assigned to the same subfamily (Table S2).

The other six genes were assigned to the same subfamily (Fig S2C). The A. fumigatus gene cluster was divided into four subfamilies. The Caspase-11 factor gene cluster was divided into the genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2D). The genes involved in biosynthesis of the Caspase-11 factor in A. fumigatus were also divided into three subfamilies (Fig S2E and F). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2G and H). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2I and J). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2K and L). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2M and N). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A. fumigatus (Fig S2O and P) were divided into two subfamilies (Fig S2P and S2Q). The genes encoding the three major phenotypes of A.
