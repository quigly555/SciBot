## Abstract
Biofilm-forming fungi are important contributors to fungal community divergence and community collapse in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The PNW has one of the highest HIV prevalence and highest rates of drug resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Aspergillus species are the most frequently isolated major causative agents of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). We analyzed 1,280 clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp.


## Introduction

The compounds included in the aforementioned study were tested for their antifungal activities against . albicans and Candida albicans (infected by C. albicans and Candida dubliniensis), and for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against C. tropicalis and C. glabrata (infected by C. glabrata and C. tropicalis), respectively. The compounds were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activity, as well as in vitro antifungal activity. The main constituents tested for the in vitro antifungal activities were the major components of terpenes: ß-glucose, mannose, glucose, and ethanol; and o-acetyl-d-glucosamine, acetyl-d-glucosamine, and ß-d-mannose. The most active compound, N-(1,2-dimethythiazoline-1-yl)methoxy)benzothiazoline-1-yl)-piperazine, inhibited the growth of the most active strain of C. albicans (C. albicans). The most active compound, N-(1,2-dimethythiazoline-1-yl)methoxy)benzothiazoline-1-yl)-piperazine, inhibited the growth of the less active strain of C. glabrata (C. dubliniensis). The compounds included in this study were tested for their antibacterial activity against C.


## Methods
. fumigatus was used as an inoculum control in this study.

4.2. Antifungal Activity
A. fumigatus (Ace) was used as an inoculum control. A. fumigatus was cultivated in the dark at room temperature. The mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed three times with sterile distilled water, and then diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 × 10^6 CFU ml^-1 and used for antifungal activities. A. fumigatus was inoculated in 7.5 ml of 0.5 M sodium citrate and 0.5 ml of 0.5 M sorbitol. The suspension was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU ml^-1 with distilled water. The antifungal activity was determined according to the method of A. Fumigatus bioassay.

4.3. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
A. fumigatus (Ace) was grown in a 96-well plate at 28 °C with shaking. The A. fumigatus suspension was diluted with distilled water to obtain a final volume of 10^6 conidia ml^-1. The A. fumigatus suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 × 10^6 conidia ml^-1 with sterile distilled water and the final inoculum concentration was 1 × 10^4 conidia ml^-1. Then, the inoculated wells were sealed with a moist paper towel and incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. The MIC of the microorganisms was defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited growth of the fungus compared with the control.

4.4. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oil was determined by a previously described method [20]. The essential oil was diluted in ethanol to a concentration of 0.2% (w/v). The essential oil was diluted in 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) with distilled water to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v) essential oil in a final volume of 1 ml.


## Results
albicans and . dubliniensis bioactive compounds were as follows: Amphotericin B (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml); caspofungin (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml); Amphotericin B (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml); caspofungin (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml); caspofungin (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml); caspofungin (MIC = 62.3 µg/ml)
