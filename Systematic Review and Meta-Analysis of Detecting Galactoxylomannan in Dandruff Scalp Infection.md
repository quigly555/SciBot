## Abstract
While the host immune response against infection depends on the cell to recognize pathogens, the immune pathway also encounters pathogens to target other cells and the environment, including plants and fungi. Studies of pathogenic fungi have found that the glyoxylate cyclins (GC) are the initial steps of the immune response against these pathogens. In this review we focus on glyoxylate transcripts from both the innate and adaptive immune system, and their role in the pathogenesis of Dandruff. We also describe the phylogeny of glyoxylate transcripts and the biogenesis of their homologous states and the glyoxylate cyclins that comprise GCs. Furthermore, we discuss the evolution of glyoxylate transcripts in Dandruff, and their ability to provide protection against phagocytosis and invading pathogens.


## Introduction
Microbes are essential components in the microbiota of a number of biological tissues including the skin, lungs, liver, spleen, lungs, and bronchi. The presence of microbiota in the respiratory tract is most frequently observed in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In these patients, respiratory tract colonization by microorganisms is often influenced by their individual risk factors and immune responses. Some of these microorganisms may cause disease in healthy individuals, while others may cause disease in diseased individuals [1,2,3]. There are two major types of colonization by microbes: microorganisms associated with chronic inflammation and bacteria associated with respiratory tract disease. The two main types of microbial colonization are systemic and localized. Systemic colonization is found in the context of inflammation. Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is associated with most types of chronic inflammation, have increased susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infections, including fungi [4]. In COPD, fungal colonization by fungi has been associated with increased risk of mortality [5]. In addition, the association between systemic and localized fungal colonization has been suggested to be due to the increased mortality of these patients [6]. It has been shown that the oral bacterial microbiota is associated with death in patients with COPD, which could be associated with the infection of the respiratory tract [7]. The fact that the respiratory tract is a site of primary fungal colonization has led to the suggestion that the presence of fungi in the respiratory tract may contribute to COPD [8]. Microbial infections have also been shown to be associated with severity of respiratory disease and mortality in COPD patients. The interplay between fungi and bacteria has been found to be important for the pathogenesis of these diseases [9,10].

The purpose of this study was to determine the composition and abundance of fungal and bacterial species in the respiratory tract of patients with COPD. We hypothesized that the fungal microbiota of the respiratory tract is highly variable.


## Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the University of Ljubljana.

Cell culture
The human keratinocyte line, H-2K2/K2-mCherry, was isolated from a patient with non-infectious hematological malignancies. The keratinocyte culture was performed as described by Daum et al. [22] using 100 µl of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. H-2K2/K2-mCherry cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 10^5 cells/well in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS. On the day of the experiment, cells were treated with 10 µg/ml of H-2K2/K2-mCherry and cells were incubated at 37°C. After 24 hours, culture media was removed from the wells and the cells were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove non-internalized H-2K2/K2-mCherry cells.


## Results
This procedure is typically performed by spraying a thin film of water onto the scalpel blade and applying it to the blad. The film provides the scalpel blade with a greenish tint and is applied to the blade with the blade needle. The scalpel blade is then sprayed with water. This procedure is called the “water injection” technique and is usually performed by spraying water on the blade. Water is used to bring the scalpel blade into the wound. The water injection technique is a very effective method. It is described in the literature (Carrion and Lackner, 1993; Vánky et al., 1994; Harrison et al., 1994; Li and Lang, 1996) and was originally reported by Tomilin et al. (1988) for use of water injection on C. albicans.

The mechanism of action of water injection in Dandruff scalpel blade infection
A recent study has reported that water injection can be used to bring in the scalpel blade into the wound (Carrion and Lackner, 1993). The model developed in this study was developed by JF Ginn et al. (2008). It was based on a study done by Ginn et al. (2008) using water injection with the bone marrow-derived model of systemic Dandruff scalpel infection. This model was used to demonstrate the mechanism of action of water injection with Dandruff scalpel in blood.

The results of the in vitro model are shown in Figure 1. The blood samples collected at the point of blood injection were positive for Dandruff. The blood samples collected from the bottom of the wound were negative for Dandruff. The blood samples collected from the top of the wound were positive for Dandruff. The blood samples collected from the bottom of the wound were positive for Dandruff. The blood samples collected from the top of the wound were positive for Dandruff.

The in vivo study was conducted in mice. The in vivo model of Dandruff scalpel wound infection was used in mice and mice received Dandruff injection, followed by administration of Dandruff. The in vivo model of Dandruff scalpel wound infection was used in mice. Dandruff injection was used in mice. Dandruff injection was administered as an aerosol, or intravenous.


## Discussion
This study revealed that the average fungal load in the Indian context of dandruff was lower than in North America (.5/100 participants). This suggests that dandruff in India may be a consequence of a combination of human factors such as geographically restricted climatic conditions, and human factors such as climate change and the increasing use of antibiotics.

Our study revealed that the fungal burden in the Indian context of dandruff scalps was higher than that in North America (3.5/100 participants). This implies that dandruff is a result of human factors, such as climatic conditions, which may have led to the higher fungal load in the Indian context of dandruff scalps.

Gastrointestinal tract infection (GI tract) is a rare entity in which a patient has a rare illness, such as diabetes mellitus, that does not require corticosteroid treatment. It is caused by a wide range of organisms including fungi, bacteria, parasites, and viruses. It has been reported that GIs are more susceptible to infection by Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis jiroveci than by C. gattii and Nocardia spp. [17]. It is also associated with lower risk of sepsis [18] and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [19]. In this study, the fungal burden in the Indian context of GI tract was higher than that in North America (3.5/100 participants). This suggests that GI tract infection may be a result of a combination of human factors such as geographic restricted conditions, climate change, and human factors such as climate change and the increasing use of antibiotics.

In this study, the most common infection was Dandruff scalps. The patients had a significant difference in the frequency of infection by species, including C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and N. meningitidis. This suggests that the patients were colonized by different species of these fungi.

The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in the Indian context of dandruff scalps was 17.5% in this study. The prevalence in the Indian context of IA in this study is higher than that in North America (4.4%), and in Europe (1.3%).
