## Abstract
Phagocytosis is a signaling molecule involved in immune cell homeostasis. In response to infection, macrophages and dendritic cells are recruited, leading to the production of various cytokines and other compounds, among which several potent candidates are employed. In this study, we used whole-genome transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the differential expressions of transcripts in the human peripheral blood dendritic cells following acute and sub-injuncture of macrophages and dendritic cells using a panel of cytokines and chemokines that include interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, IL-21 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. In addition, we compared the transcriptomes of dendritic cells, macrophages and dendritic cells treated with mac-TNF-a or IL-12. Our results demonstrated that the differential expression of transcripts in the macrophages and dendritic cells following mac-TNF-a stimulation was increased, suggesting a role of this receptor in the induction of immune cell responses. Moreover, our transcriptome data revealed that many of the molecules included in the current manuscript have regulatory roles in macrophages and dendritic cells.


## Introduction
The species Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii cause approximately 1 million life-threatening infections annually worldwide, with an estimated 600,000 deaths (1, 2). The environmental reservoir of C. neoformans and C. gattii in humans is the soil and bird droppings, and the majority of infections occur in the first months of life (3, 4). After inhalation, C. neoformans and C. gattii rapidly disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS), where they cause disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts (3, 5, 6). Individuals with compromised immune systems are more susceptible to cryptococcal meningitis (7, 8), a common infection that is most commonly associated with immunosuppressed hosts such as patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (9). Individuals infected with HIV/AIDS are more susceptible to cryptococcal meningitis (7, 9-11). In contrast, individuals who have a normal immune system are largely susceptible to cryptococcal meningitis, although cryptococcal meningitis is not usually diagnosed until after the second presentation of meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients (12).


## Methods
. Fungal Growth
All strains used in this study were routinely cultured in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB; BD Difco) at 37°C. Yeast cells were grown in 25 mL of Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD; BD Difco) at 30°C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove un-adhered yeast cells. The cells were resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was transferred into a 1 mL round-bottom tube and mixed with 50 µL of sterile PBS. The cell-free supernatant was removed, and the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellets were washed three times with PBS to remove the yeast cells, and then resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. The cell-free supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS.


## Results
sclerotiorum polyphenolic extracts against . albicans was evaluated by a murine model of disseminated candidiasis [21], [22]. C. albicans isolates were inoculated with polyphenolic extracts (6.0 µg/ml) and then used to infect mice, which were then infected with one of the three fungi of interest, C. neoformans (Figure 3). The data for the antifungal activity of polyphenolic extracts (6.0 µg/ml) against C. neoformans were not statistically significant.

The N. sclerotiorum polyphenolic extracts were evaluated for the antifungal activity of the triazoles triazoles (fluconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) and flucytosine against the three Candida species (Figure 4). The MIC values for triazoles against C. neoformans were 0.016-0.125 µg/ml, and for flucytosine, 0.125 µg/ml, for triazoles against C. albicans (0.016 µg/ml) and C. parapsilosis (0.016 µg/ml). Fluconazole was more effective at inhibiting C. neoformans growth and was less effective against C. parapsilosis. The MIC values for triazoles against C. neoformans were 0.016-0.125 µg/ml, and for flucytosine, 0.125 µg/ml, for triazoles against C. albicans (0.016 µg/ml) and C. parapsilosis (0.016 µg/ml). For the triazoles against C. parapsilosis, the MIC values for triazoles against C. neoformans were 0.015 µg/ml, and for flucytosine, 0.125 µg/ml, for triazoles against C. albicans (0.015 µg/ml) and C. parapsilosis (0.015 µg/ml). For the triazoles against C. parapsilosis, the MIC values for triazoles against C. neoformans were 0.015 µg/ml, and for flucytosine, 0.


## Discussion
neoformans was successful, and the percentage of CSF recovered with a viable organism was high (19%, 23%) in both groups, and the percentage of dead or viable C-Livid mice was higher in C-Livid mice infected with . neoformans than in C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii (Fig 3A). Notably, the percentage of viable C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans was higher in C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii than in C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans, which is consistent with previous studies in humans [26], [27].

Interestingly, as seen in Fig 3B, the percentage of viable C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans was higher in C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii than in C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans. In contrast, the percentage of viable C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii was higher in C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans than in C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii. Similar to that reported in a previous study in humans [26], [27], [48], the percentage of viable C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii was lower in C-Livid mice infected with C. neoformans than in C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii. The reason for this difference between studies is unclear, but may be due to different experimental setups and different mouse strains used in the studies. In the study using mice with different ages [49], we found that the percentage of viable C-Livid mice infected with C. gattii increased from 19% to 59% in 20-25% of the mice, which was similar to the findings in a previous study in humans [26]. In addition, our previous study using mice with different ages and geographic location also reported that C. gattii could cause increased mortality in C-Livid mice [27].

In addition, we observed that C-Livid mice exhibited increased fungal burden in the brain as compared to C-Livid mice. In a previous study by Zajc et al. [27], C-Livid mice were infected with C. gattii and C.
