## Abstract
Plant-based aquaculture can be a sustainable way to generate biofuels from renewable material. However, it has been reported that the management of the cost of biofuels is mainly determined by the relations between producers and end users. Thus, an integrated approach to energy, land use, and technology (e.g., biofuels from sugarcane, biodiesel, or olive oil) were investigated as an alternative to fossil fuel. Oleaginous yeasts were used to generate biofuels using submerged biomass hydrolysates and they produced lipids, fatty acids, and chlorogenic acids as their main component. Biofuels were generated from glucose, xylose, n-hexadecane, methanol, and oleic acid. They were aromatic, cationic, and alcoholic. The most promising technology to utilize biofuels was the use of yeast strains with high lipid content and the existence of enzymes to synthesize lipids, fatty acids, and aromatic compounds. This review highlights the ecofriendly, biotechnologically friendly, economical, and effective use of yeast strains and yeast lipids. The use of yeast lipids as feedstock for biofuel production and yeast strains with high lipid production could be a completely different technology from fossil fuel.


## Introduction
The pathogenic fungi of the genus Candida are among the most common human fungal pathogens and are responsible for more than 500,000 infections each year [1]. They are known to be pathogenic to healthy individuals but can also cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients [2]. In fact, Candida albicans is the most common species isolated from bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of 40-60% [3, 4]. The Candida genus contains over 200 species, including the most common species C. glabrata and C. tropicalis [5].


## Methods
This strain is an opportunistic yeast of . lipolytica, originally isolated from an unrelated animal by the European Collection of Fungal Cultures (ECF-EMC). In this study, we used this isolate to investigate the pathogenicity of yeasts and fungi on animals. Y. lipolytica PC-37 was isolated from blood obtained from mice, after treatment with the antifungal drugs amphotericin B deoxycholate and 4-flucytosine, from the gallbladder of mice. The yeast was isolated from a blood sample taken from one of the animals. The treatment was performed as per the protocol of the manufacturer. It was confirmed that the yeasts were isolated from the gallbladder of the mice. The animals were used in a sterile environment.

Preparation of yeast isolates
The yeast isolates were prepared by inoculating 10 µl of 10^6 conidia ml^-1 on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) at 37°C for 48 h. The culture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The cells were washed with sterile saline and then re-suspended in 5 mL of sterile saline at a ratio of 2:1 in a sterile microtube. The yeast cultures were incubated for 2-3 days at 37°C in a rotator shaker at 250 rpm. The cell suspension was removed from the plate and the cell number was calculated. Then, the number of yeast isolates per gram of body weight (BMW) was calculated.

Characterization of yeast isolates
The yeast isolates were selected based on previous studies in which the killing of bacteria and fungi were observed by different methods. The yeast isolates were characterized by the growth of colony morphology, and for the identification of the strains, the same cultures were used. For identification of yeast isolates, the culture of yeasts were grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose, and 1.5% agar) at 37°C for 24 h, and then diluted in a saline solution and then inoculated into a 96-well round-bottomed plate. Then, the inoculated cultures were inoculated into the upper wells of the 96-well microplate and the final volume was adjusted to 5 mL with sterile saline.


## Results
Identification of SNPs in the Community
The ITS region of each of the 16S rDNA amplicons was amplified by PCR using a primer pair of ITS-determining primers. The primers were designed to amplify a region of high identity between the isolates CBS131 and CBS131-1. The primer pair was designed to amplify a region of high identity between the isolates CBS131 and CBS131-2.


## Discussion
The fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans, is a very virulent and rarely reported pathogen of huma. The mortality rate of C. neoformans infection is 20% [16]. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was the second most common fungus isolated from human and has a high virulent rate (52.2%). The patient was treated for Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii infection at the time of the diagnosis. No other studies have been done to date.

The third common fungal infection in dogs was mucormycosis. Human mucormycosis is a rare but serious disease of dogs. Dogs infected with mucormycosis develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with severe pulmonary involvement, increased chest pain and an altered mental status. Dogs with normal immune function can be neutered and treated. Dogs with uncontrolled allergic reaction to mucormycosis can be neutered and treated [17].

The fourth common fungal infection was parasitic infection. This species causes a chronic infection in dogs. The disease usually occurs in the environment, which is a result of physical trauma or trauma itself. In a study conducted in a veterinary hospital in the United States, 29.7% of dogs infected with this species had a history of trauma or trauma. [18] The cause of infection is not clear. An autopsy study showed that 50% of cats with this species had a history of trauma or trauma. In the United Kingdom, this species was found in animal feces. The source of infection is unknown.

The fifth common fungal infection was cryptosporidium. This species causes a lung infection that can affect the lungs. It is a commensal fungus that occurs in the environment, and typically occurs in birds. The infection can occur in the environment, such as in a pet store. The patient was treated for Cryptosporidium parvum infection. Cryptosporidium parvum is a parasite that is difficult to treat and can cause life-threatening disease in humans [19]. The patient had a history of birding and was diagnosed with this infection. The patient was treated for Cryptosporidium parvum infection. The diagnosis was made by the histological analysis of the patient's lungs. The patient had a history of birding and had a history of lung infection. The diagnosis was made by the histological analysis of the patient's lungs. The patient had a history of lung infection.
