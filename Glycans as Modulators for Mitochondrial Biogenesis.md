## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis, the most common invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, is characterized by the presence of a single large cavity surrounded by multiple smaller, surrounded pockets. This type of pulmonary cryptococcosis is usually presented in immunocompetent hosts. The presence of distinct pulmonary foci affects the clinical course of this disease. The pulmonary foci are not simply located in the pulmonary tissue; they are permelicetically defined. Here, we describe two distinct pulmonary foci of Aspergillus fumigatus in comparison with visual examination alone. These differences are significant not only for the difference in location, but also for the differences in presentation of the two pulmonary foci in different patient populations.


## Introduction
Furthermore, the mitochondria of fungi contain highly conserved elements that allow the control of mitochondrial activity and organosystems during the replication of respiratory chain. These conserved elements include the core motif, cytochrome oxidase, pyrin, and cytochrome b. In fungi, this conserved element is often used as a target to control the replication of the respiratory chain. This element is termed the cytochrome pathway element. The majority of the cytochrome oxidase element is present in the cytochrome pathway (Figure 1). The target protein for the cytochrome oxidase element is the Trp-Glycans binding protein Trp-Glycans, which interacts with the cytochrome oxidase and other proteins. In yeast, Trp-Glycans binding proteins can be classified into two types, type I and type II. The type I proteins are extremely important in the control of the transport of trp-Glycans and in the response of fungi to environmental stress. The type II proteins mainly interact with the Trp-Glycans protein. Trp-Glycans are highly expressed in the lung and are found in the cytoplasm of fungi, such as S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (34). The Trp-Glycans protein interacts with the trp-binding protein Trp-A and with the Trp-binding protein Trp-G, which can promote the sphingolipid production. The Trp-Glycans binding protein is essential for fungal survival in the host. Additionally, Trp-A and Trp-G can interact with the Trp-binding protein to control the oxygenation state of the organelle. However, Trp-G protein is not involved in the control of the hypoxic environment of the respiratory chain in the respiratory chain. The Trp-G protein has been shown to control the oxygenation state in several fungi. For example, it regulates the respiratory chain by acting on the TcnB protein (37). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Trp-G protein is responsible for the regulation of the hypoxic response (38). In C. albicans, the Trp-G protein is responsible for the regulation of the hypoxic response (39).


## Methods
Plant and inoculum
All plant and animal experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 3 facility at the Institute of Microbiology, University of Londrina. Plant material was cultivated at 16 °C in Londrina, South Africa. The inoculum was obtained from fresh and sterile aerial parts of S. apiospermum. The leaves of S. apiospermum were harvested from the field near the Research Center of Plant Protection (RCP), Government of South Africa, in November 2009 and, after collection, were dried at room temperature (22 °C). The dried samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and extracted with phenol-chloroform (4:1) at room temperature. The extracts were dissolved in methanol, and the mixture was subjected to a high-speed centrifugal filter (10,000 × g, 10 min). The filtrate was used as the blank control. The extract was further concentrated using a rotary evaporator (3200 rpm, 30 °C) and the residue was used as the blank control. The organic layer was collected by evaporation, dried in a rotary evaporator (3200 rpm, 40 °C), and then subjected to a vacuum filtration column (300 × 2.5 µm, 250 × 15 mm, and 60 g, 1.5 L) in methanol.


## Results
H_2O_2 affects mitochondrial membrane potential, and the . cerevisiae mitochondria mutants lacking mitochondrial membrane potential transporters are hyper sensitive to H_2O_2 (11). To examine the effect of H_2O_2 stress on mitochondrial oxidative stress resistance in a H_2O_2-susceptible mutant, we supplemented the cells with the ROS-generating agents 1 M sorbitol and KCl, which are lethal in the murine model of systemic infection (18). The <U+0394>mucorubr1 and <U+0394>mucorubr2 strains were treated with 10 µg/ml of 1 M sorbitol, KCl, and KCl, respectively, to produce <U+0394>mucorubr1 and <U+0394>mucorubr2, respectively. These strains were then treated with 10 µg/ml of KCl for 15 min and then treated with the ROS-generating agents KCl, KCl-susceptible, and H_2O_2-susceptible 2 M sorbitol. These ROS-generating agents have been shown to cause severe mitochondrial stress in the murine model (18, 19). In the H_2O_2-susceptible strain, the ROS-generating agents had no effect on mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in a H_2O_2-susceptible background (Fig 2A). Therefore, H_2O_2-susceptible mutants are hyper sensitive to H_2O_2 stress and cannot grow under such conditions.

Mitochondrial Damage in the H_2O_2-Susceptible Mutant Is Resistant to ROS-generating Agents
Mitochondrial damage in the H_2O_2-susceptible mutant is hyper sensitive to ROS-generating agents (Fig 2A), and it was measured by the SDS-PAGE assay to determine the proportion of total ROS produced. The SDS-PAGE signal from H_2O_2-susceptible mutant cells was significantly reduced in the absence of ROS (Fig 2B). This reduction in ROS was also evident in the SDS-PAGE assay (Fig 2B).


## Discussion
The first two categories, as well as the third category, are known as the stress responses of the first categor. A previous study showed that in N. crassa, the interaction of N. crassa with the organism can be enhanced, thereby regulating the expression of a major stress response gene, Sre1 (Nrg1), and mitotic survival [52]. In contrast, N. crassa does not respond to stresses, and this is not the case in N. crassa [53]. In contrast to N. crassa, the development of yeast cells in which the same strain is self-repetitive is not dependent on the expression of the same stress response gene, Sre1, but rather depends on the survival of the second strain [52]. The first category is well known as the stress response of the second category, and this phenomenon has been found in several strains of Cryptococcus neoformans [54]. The second category, the self-repetitive category, was found in the strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii, which all belong to the same genetic background as N. crassa. The strain C. gattii also showed the presence of the two stress response genes (Nrg1 and Sre1) [52]. The second category, the self-repetitive category, was found in the strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii, and it was present in C. neoformans-infected and N. crassa-infected strains [52]. The first category, which is well known as the stress response of the second category, was found in C. neoformans-infected and N. crassa-infected strains, and it was present in C. gattii-infected strains [52]. The second category, the self-repetitive category, was found in the strains of N. crassa-infected and N. crassa-infected strains and it was present in N. crassa-infected strains [52]. The third category, the self-repetitive category, was found in the strains of N.
