## Abstract
The prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased dramatically in recent decades, especially in immunocompromised patients. With the growing incidence of fungal diseases, the identification of novel agents is an important priority. The antimicrobial stewardship toolkit developed in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EMA) focuses on the development of a robust and integrated surveillance and control strategy in the Schengen area. The EMA had a clear evaluation of the necessary and sufficient ECR-related activity against IFIs, and all other relevant agents, in order to identify novel agents resistant to public health, antimicrobial stewardship and public health. The target populations were selected by the MEP; these were manually curtailed by the third person every two weeks. The activity levels of all the agents tested in the EEA were equivalent or lower than those for the control. The EEA did not contain antibiotics and neither antimicrobial stewardship nor any other antibiotic-based measures showed adequate measures. This suggests that the MEP intends to include both the activity levels of the tested agents as well as the activities of the control agents in its surveillance strategy. However, the results of the MEP's evaluation of the actions taken in the EEA indicated that none of the control agents showed the same improvement in the surveillance and control activities. The EEA is expected to be a useful tool to improve the control of IFIs in public health programs in Europe.


## Introduction
The most important components are lysine and histidine residue. In fungi, lysine and histidine are indispensable for cell growth, cell differentiation, cell signaling, and signal transduction. In the filamentous fungi, the lysine residues play important roles in virulence (Fang et al., 2006). Lysine and histidine are also involved in the energy metabolism and signaling pathways of the cell. In fungi, lysine is important for growth, morphogenesis, stress responses, cell morphology, and stress resistance (Krogh and Cunningham, 2006). Lysine is also required for the transport of amino acids and substrates in the fungal cell wall, cell wall integrity (CCL) and for virulence (O'Gorman and Keller, 1997). The absence of histidine or lysine in the cell wall is crucial for growth and morphogenesis, and lysine and histidine are crucial for virulence. In A. fumigatus, the absence of lysine or histidine leads to resistance to antifungal drugs (Chapman et al., 2009). In C. albicans, lysine and histidine are important for cell growth, cell differentiation, cell signaling, and stress resistance (Akhidzadeh et al., 2011). In C. neoformans, the absence of lysine or histidine in the cell wall limits conidiation and virulence (O'Gorman and Keller, 1997).

Although the role of lysine and histidine is not fully understood, they are important for the growth, morphogenesis, and virulence of C. albicans (Garrido and Crous, 2005; Chacón and Cui, 2006). In addition, L-lysine and histidine play important roles in the cell wall and in signaling pathways of the cell (Nelson et al., 2005; Chacón and Cui, 2006). The roles of lysine and histidine in the growth and virulence of C. albicans are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of lysine and histidine in the cell growth, morphogenesis, stress resistance, and virulence of C. albicans.


## Methods
nidulans, . fumigatus, and A. fumigatus. Thus, we designed a C-terminal peptide of L-like protein (LNP) in the study of A. nidulans. In brief, the C-terminal peptide was synthesized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 method, followed by reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ß-D-glucoside (BCID) as a substrate. Subsequently, the purified peptide was incubated with ammonium bicarbonate buffer (BSA) and reacted with hydroxyurea (HS) at 45°C for 15 min. The product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC (ESI^TM Water-Cell, Waters) and eluted with a solution of borate:methanol (2:1) at 100°C for 10 min. The purified peptide was submitted to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) and eluted with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (pH 5.0). The purified peptide was applied to a column of methanol:acetic acid (1:1) for column chromatography, and eluted with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (pH 5.0). The resulting peptide was then applied to a solution of borate:methanol (2:1) for column chromatography, and eluted with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (pH 5.0). The concentration of LNP was determined by spectrophotometry at refractive index detector (NITE, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

Molecular Identification of L-like Protein by RNA-Seq
A. nidulans strain N402 was isolated from a patient with skin disease (6) and was cultured in Middlebrook 7H10 broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 37°C and 220 rpm for 4 days. The mycelia were harvested from the liquid broth and washed twice with sterile water.


## Results
albicans
In the present study, L-like proteins are involved in the regulation of fungal pathogenicity in . albicans. L-like proteins were predicted as L-like proteins in the proteome of the NCBI database using BLASTP, followed by BLASTP, and BLASTP-based query-based BLASTP analysis. The best hits were assigned to the proteins encoded by the L-like protein sequences (Supplementary Figure S1) and other database entries (Supplementary Figure S2). The L-like proteins encoded by the NCBI, BLASTP, and BLASTP-based database entries were identified to the NCBI database using a stringent BLASTP filtering procedure. The BLASTP search results for the NCBI database entry with the highest number of proteins is shown in Table 2. The BLASTP search results for the NCBI database entry with the highest number of proteins are shown in Table 3.

## Discussion
They are very abundant in fungi, especially in the basidiomycetous fungi Ustilago maydis and Aspergillus fumigatus, and are therefore considered to be a novel class of protein that belongs to the most conserved class of proteins in fung. L-like proteins can also be found in filamentous fungi such as C. neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and are associated with the virulence of these fungi [29, 30].

In this study, we showed that L-like proteins were a major regulator of the virulence of M. oryzae. In addition, we demonstrated that L-like proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of M. oryzae by producing antimicrobial peptides, metabolites, and enzymes that are required for their degradation [31].

M. oryzae is a high-throughput screen for L-like proteins in M. oryzae. A total of 22 L-like proteins were identified in the proteome of this fungus. Among them, five proteins were identified as L-like proteins, namely two proteins with homology to the surface of S. cerevisiae L-like proteins, and three proteins with homology to surface of C. albicans L-like proteins. In addition, we found a total of 23 L-like proteins were identified in the proteome of M. oryzae. The proteins were identified as M. oryzae surface-associated proteins, which include membrane-associated proteins, phospholipases, and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as voriconazole and propiconazole [32].

In this study, we demonstrated that L-like proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of M. oryzae by producing antimicrobial peptides, metabolites, and enzymes that are required for their degradation [31].

Recently, L-like proteins have been identified in a variety of bacteria and fungi, including certain Candida species, such as S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and S. pombe [33]. However, L-like proteins have not been previously identified in fungi. In this study, we demonstrated that L-like proteins were involved in the pathogenesis of M.
