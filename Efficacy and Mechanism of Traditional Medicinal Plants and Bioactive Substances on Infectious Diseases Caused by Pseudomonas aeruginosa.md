## Abstract
Human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the primary cause of childhood herpes zoster infections, predominantly in children 2-23 years old. The virus can also cross the placenta and genitalia, possibly by direct cross-reaction with other prions, such as the placenta. Human HSV-1 can also cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is assumed to play a significant role in virus replication. To date, there have been few studies about the BBB pathobiology and the role of human HSV-1 in the antivirulence potential of HSV-1.

We studied the immune responses of BALB/c mice towards HSV-1 in a neonatal mouse model. HSV-1 RNA was detected in the blood of mice circulating in 24 h of infection and was detected in the brain of mice up to 24 h of challenge, with a 10% survival advantage. HSV-1 RNA was detected in the serum of mice up to 24 h of infection, with a 10% survival advantage. In addition, HSV-1 RNA was detected in the bone marrow of BALB/c mice at 24 h and 24 h of challenge, with a 10% survival advantage.

## Methods
 and Pseudomonas brasiliensis, . brasiliensis, P. sanguinatus, and P. lindemuthinium, respectively [4]. In addition, chlorophyll content of the plant material was determined using the modified CMC method [6].

The method of Denton et al. (1996) was used to evaluate the antifungal activity of the plant material against the pathogen P. brasiliensis. In this case, the plant material was inoculated in a Petri dish with sterile soil and then spread with a sterile cotton swab. The inoculated petri dishes were incubated at 25°C, and then the number of P. brasiliensis yeasts was measured. Three replicates were used for each treatment. The test was repeated three times, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the method of Simpson [7] and Ehrlich and Irvine [8], with the exception that the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by plating in duplicate.

3.4. MBCs
The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the plant material were determined by the method of McTaggart and Goy [9] and they were determined by inoculating the plant material in a Petri dish with a bacteriological suspension of M. oryzae (1 × 10^7 CFU mL^-1) at a density of 5 × 10^4 CFU mL^-1. The inoculated petri dishes were incubated at 25°C, and then the number of M. oryzae yeasts was determined. Three replicates were used for each treatment. The test was repeated three times, and the MBCs were determined by the method of McTaggart and Goy [9].

3.5. Microscopic Evaluation
The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the plant material were determined by inoculating the plant material in a Petri dish with a bacteriological suspension of P. brasiliensis (1 × 10^7 CFU mL^-1) at a density of 5 × 10^4 CFU mL^-1. The inoculated petri dishes were incubated at 25°C, and then the number of M. oryzae yeasts was determined. Three replicates were used for each treatment.


## Results
aeruginosa using the MIC, MIC_50 and MIC_90 value. The MIC_50 value of the fluconazole was 2 µg/ml and the MIC_90 value of voriconazole was 0.5 µg/ml. As shown in Table 2, all of the tested compounds were more potent than fluconazole against P. aeruginosa. As shown in Table 3, a synergistic effect was observed against P. aeruginosa. The MIC_90 value of voriconazole was 2 µg/ml and the MIC_50 value of fluconazole was 0.5 µg/ml. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of voriconazole were higher than fluconazole against P. aeruginosa. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of voriconazole were 1 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of fluconazole against P. aeruginosa were found to be 0.5 µg/ml and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of voriconazole were 2 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of voriconazole were 1 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of fluconazole were 0.5 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of voriconazole were 0.5 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively.

3.3. Antimicrobial Activity of P. aeruginosa Against MDR and C. albicans

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of the selected compounds against MDR and C. albicans were found to be 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of the selected compounds against C. albicans were 1 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml, respectively.


## Discussion
Based on the results obtained in the present study, the study concluded that bioactive substances, such as . alternata, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. tenuissima, A. versicolor, and A. cinerea, could be applied as therapeutic drugs in combination with conventional antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole, for the treatment of candidiasis. It should be noted that the type of antifungal agent is determined by the patient’s condition and geographic location, and the available data are insufficient to determine the toxicity and efficacy of compounds against invasive fungi. In addition, the use of the compounds in combination with conventional antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole, is important for the long-term effects of these drugs, and these combinations will be effective against invasive fungi. Although the mechanisms by which A. alternata, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. terreus, and A. versicolor can activate C. albicans in vitro, the application of these compounds was not necessary. However, a potential synergistic effect of these compounds against C. albicans was observed in a murine model. This synergistic effect was also observed in other studies, which reported that the compound may act synergistically with conventional antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole, voriconazole, and micafungin, or it may inhibit C. albicans in vitro.

In addition, A. terreus, A. fumigatus, and A. terreus were inhibited by all of the tested compounds, and A. fumigatus and A. terreus were inhibited by the combination of A. alternata and A. terreus, which showed synergistic effects against C. albicans. However, in contrast to the results obtained with the current study, the results of the present study showed that the combination of A. alternata and A. terreus could be effective in inhibiting C. albicans growth. The study also showed that the combination of A. alternata and A.
