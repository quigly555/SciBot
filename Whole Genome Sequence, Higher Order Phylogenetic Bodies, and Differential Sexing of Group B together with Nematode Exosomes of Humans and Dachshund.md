## Abstract
Cryptococcus species are present in soil, plant debris and vegetation throughout the tropical region of North America. The species richness, diversity and composition of C. gattii in the Western United States are both consistent with and increase compared to the species diversity in soil. C. gattii is currently the second most frequently isolated C. gattii from soil samples in this region. In order to gain more insights into the composition and dynamics of this unique C. gattii species complex, we analyzed soil, plant debris and soil fungal communities. Based on sequence data and similarity analysis, we hypothesize that the presence of C. gattii in the sampled samples is related to its natural habitats rather than to isolation by human activity. We analyzed soil, plant debris and plant fungal communities in order to find out whether the soil fungal community was affected by the presence of this species. The overall results showed that soil fungal community composition was affected by the presence of C. gattii but had a small effect on the fungal community. Interestingly, the presence of soil fungi in the same samples affected the composition of the C. gattii soil microbial communities. Our results suggest that human activities or agricultural practices may be responsible for the changes in the fungal community composition in the sampled habitats.

## Methods
gi-ps.org/GOA/index.html) were used to find the best-performing gene models. The alignment files were imported into the server version of PhyloBayes (http://phylobayes.org/phylobayes/index.html) and subjected to a Bayesian analysis with a mixed model search with a search time parameter of 0.2.

All aligned sequences were checked for accuracy, and their phylogenetic placement was done using a Bayesian analysis with a mixed model search with a search time parameter of 0.2. In the Bayesian analysis, the best model for each gene was selected based on the most compatible model of evolution with a GTR + I + G model. A single best model was selected based on the most compatible model.

## Results
Nematode exosomes are released from the endosome of the host cells by the metabolism of endosome biogenesis, which is facilitated by the release of exosomes (17. Nematode exosomes are released from exosomes by the metabolism of endosome biogenesis, which is facilitated by the release of exosomes (17). We compared the relative expression of the group B gene, Nematode exosomes, and Nematode exosomes among different groups of human, Dachshund, and humans. Group B gene expression was higher in human groups than in Dachshund and humans (Table 2). A similar pattern of expression was observed in Dachshunds, animals, and plants, but no difference in the expression levels of group A gene. Furthermore, the expression of the group A gene was higher in human groups than in Dachshunds and animals (Table 2). The expression levels of group B gene were similar among all groups, but no significant difference was observed between groups B and B2, B3, and B4 (Table 2).

The effect of plant, animal, and plant-derived exosomes on the expression of group B gene was examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig 2). There was no significant difference in the expression levels of group B gene between plant-derived and plant-derived exosomes. However, the expression of group B gene was lower in plant-derived exosomes compared with animal exosomes.

In the analysis of the relative expression of group B gene, the expression levels of the group B gene were similar among all groups. However, the relative expression of group B gene was lower in animals than in plants. The expression of group B gene was higher in plant-derived exosomes compared with animal exosomes. The relative expression of group B gene was lower in exosomes than in plant exosomes, but no significant difference was observed between groups B2 and B3 (Table 2). The relative expression of group B gene was higher in animals than in plants.


## Discussion

Since the human genome encodes a large number of genes, the nuclear genome is expected to have a more compact and compact DNA/RNA/DNA backbone compared to the other two major human genomes, which has been observed to be a higher content of genes and proteins [25. A high genome size has been observed in the human genome [26], [27], as well as in the Nematodes. The increase in genome size for the Nematode genome has been observed in the two other major human genomes. In the Nematodes, the whole genome is composed of 17 genes, which are mostly involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, triglycerides, glucose, etc. [28]. In the Nematodes, the Nematode genome has a more compact genome structure, with two gene clusters (cluster II) and five genes (cluster III) together with 14 genes (cluster IV) in cluster III, while the rest of the genome consists of only one gene cluster (cluster IV) and one gene cluster (cluster VI) together with three genes (cluster VII) and three genes (cluster IX) in cluster VI. The Nematodes have four genes in cluster III and four genes in cluster IV, whereas the rest of the genomes consists of five genes in cluster III and three genes in cluster IV. This genome structure has been observed to be a higher content of genes and proteins compared to the other two major human genomes.
