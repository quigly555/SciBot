## Abstract
The present study investigated the effects of recombination between the mating type locus (MAT) and the mating type genes (MAT) on the recombination architecture and secondary metabolite production of asexual yeasts, using four yeast strains. All the strains showed reduction in the recombination activity when compared with the MAT genes of the respective mating type strains, which is reflected by the presence of tryptophan in the parents and a-phelan in the progeny. However, all the strains showed increased production of tryptophan when compared with the MAT genes of the respective progeny. The results suggest that the MAT genes play an important role in secondary metabolism of these tryptophan-rich isolates.


## Introduction
The in vitro method for the synthesis of three types of sulfur compounds (tetrafluoro, thiogafungin, and cytochaloylcholines) was used to produce compounds of low sulfur (.e., 4.4 g/L), high sulfur (i.e., 2.6 g/L), and low sulfur (i.e., 1.4 g/L) as substrates for synthesizing the functionalized compounds (Gutierrez et al., 2015; Álvarez et al., 2017; Akhman et al., 2017). The natural sulfur compounds of the Caco-2 and Caco-3 derivatives are used as co-stituent in organic synthesis, and are generally regarded as valuable substrates for the synthesis of functionalized compounds (Gutierrez et al., 2015; Akhman et al., 2017). However, the chemical structures and biological functions of the Caco-2 and Caco-3 sulfur compounds are not well understood, although there is a growing interest in elucidating their biological activities and their biological behavior in various crop plants (Björne and Keller, 2017).

It is known that sulfur compounds, particularly sulfide compounds, have various biological activities, including bactericidal and fungicidal effects, which are dependent on the presence of the specific sulfur compounds (Gutierrez et al., 2015; Akhman et al., 2017). For example, the role of a series of naturally occurring sulfide compounds in bioremediation of soil and their possible application in the biopolyplastics industry are discussed in a recent review (Gutierrez et al., 2015). A study using naturally occurring sulfide compounds in the biopolymerization of C. albicans suggested that the C. albicans sulfide compound CacRAMOJGU was the major candidate for the biopolymerization of soil Caco-3 and sulfide compound CacRAMOJGU. This study demonstrated that CacRAMOJGU can be used as a biopolymerizer and was successfully applied to the biopolymerization of C. albicans Candida spp. and Pseudomonas spp. (Gutierrez et al., 2015). However, the mechanisms and biological activities of CacRAMOJGU remain unclear.


## Methods
The physicochemical characteristics of Acetyl-CoA-Dependent Methionine sulfoxide (CMS) were measured in .5% sulfuric acid using a liquid scintillation counter (Scintilien, Kiel, Germany). This method was validated in soil samples and the presence of cysteine hydrochloride was demonstrated by using a colorimetric assay (7). The results of this test were expressed as µmol g^-1 g^-1 (turbidity, humidity, CO_2, NH_2).

4.3. Synthesis of Acetyl-CoA-Dependent Methionine Sulfoxide (3)
A mixture of Acetyl-CoA-Dependent Methionine sulfoxide (3) (0.1 mg, 0.1 mmol g^-1) and sulfuric acid (0.2 mL, 0.15 mL, 0.05 mL) was heated to obtain the desired solutions (1.0-3.0 mg/mL). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 1.0 mL of sulfuric acid and the resulting solutions were poured to yield the desired amount. The reaction mixture was then kept at room temperature (about 25°C) for the further purification of Acetyl-CoA-Dependent Methionine sulfoxide.

## Results
sclerotiorum seedlings with different exposure to 20% and 40% of acetate for growth and the production of fatty acids were compare. The results are shown in Table 4.

The results indicated that the growth and production of fatty acids and proteolysis occurred in the growth conditions tested. In the first 6 h, a significantly higher proportion of fatty acids was produced in the growing conditions compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate. However, the amount of total fatty acids was lower in the exposed growth condition. The amount of total fatty acids was found to be higher in the growing condition compared to the exposure to 40% of acetate. The total fatty acids were also found to be higher in the growth condition compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate. The amount of total fatty acids was found to be higher in the exposure to 40% of acetate compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate. The amounts of total fatty acids were also higher in the exposure to 40% of acetate compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate. However, the amount of total fatty acids was higher in the exposure to 40% of acetate compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate.

The results indicated that the growth conditions tested were different for the growth and production of lipids and proteolysis. The amounts of total fatty acids and total fatty acids were found to be higher in the growth conditions compared to the exposure to 40% of acetate. However, the amount of total fatty acids and proteolysis were higher in the exposure to 40% of acetate compared to the exposure to 20% of acetate.

## Discussion
The values of the antioxidant enzyme activity were generally higher than those of the other three carbon sources (Table 2. In general, the highest antioxidant enzyme activity was observed in the presence of NO_3^·- (NO_3), which is a substrate of the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of myristoyl-CoA and carotenoids [16]. The NO_3^·- and carotenoid-mediated pathways are linked to the production of pro-oxidants and bioactive compounds [16]. The NO_3^·- is a substrate of the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of myristoyl-CoA and carotenoids [16]. The presence of NO_3^·- was also detected in the soil of the EA. However, the enzyme activity decreased after the addition of this carbon source to the soil.

The results showed that the concentrations of the enzymes in the EA and the soil of the EA varied with the soil type. This may be due to the organic content of the soil, as soil of PDR and EA of P. carinii have the highest amounts of the enzyme activities [23]. The addition of high amounts of arable carbon into the soil of the EA caused the increase in the total enzyme activity of P. carinii. This may be due to the presence of organic acids in the soil of the EA. However, the enzyme activities of P. carinii have decreased after the addition of arable carbon to the soil of the EA, which was probably due to the high amount of arable carbon in the soil of the EA. The addition of high amounts of organic acids to the soil of P. carinii may be due to the presence of organic acids in the soil of the EA. The addition of organic acids to the soil of P. carinii may be due to the presence of organic acids in the soil of the EA. The addition of organic acids to the soil of P. carinii may be due to the presence of organic acids in the soil of the EA. The addition of organic acids to the soil of P. carinii may be due to the presence of organic acids in the soil of the EA.
