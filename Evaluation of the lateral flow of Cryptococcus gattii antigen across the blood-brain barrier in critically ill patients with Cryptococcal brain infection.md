## Abstract

80 healthy adults were enrolled, and 56 (1.8%) were HIV-infected (29.7% of the total patients). Cryptococcal meningitis was the most common clinical manifestation, followed by bacterial meningitis (12%), cryptococcal meningitis (5%), and shock (4.3%). The median time interval of onset for Cryptococcus meningitis was 1.8 (IQR 1.4-2.7) years. Cryptococcal meningitis was more frequently associated with HIV-infected patients than without HIV. Invasive meningitis was associated with higher mortality, and patients with Cryptococcus meningitis had higher protein and lower glucose concentrations than patients without meningitis.

We found a consistent association between HIV status and the time to first cryptococcal meningitis presentation, and these patients had similar overall prognosis to non-HIV Cryptococcus meningitis. In this setting, the most common presentations were bacterial meningitis and shock. The most common presentation of Cryptococcus meningitis was also associated with higher glucose concentrations, and the majority of patients with cryptococcal meningitis had cryptococcal meningitis.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infection in HIV-infected patients, and a significant complication in patients treated with current antifungal drugs. More data are needed to better define the role of Cryptococcus meningitis in the context of treatment with antifungal drugs.

This study is reported as the first to evaluate the outcome of HIV-1 RNA therapy in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. We found that all HIV-infected patients had cryptococcal meningitis. Among HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 44% had shock and 29% had invasive fungal infection. The most common clinical presentations were fever (74%), headache (75%) and neurological symptoms (20%). In shock, 36% of patients had Cryptococcus and 13% had Cryptococcus-like lesions. Invasive fungal infections were most common in HIV-infected patients with Cryptococcus, occurring in 12% of patients and occurring in only 4% of patients with shock.


## Introduction
Fungi are ubiquitous organisms found in various environments in both intact and suspended forms in nature. They are ubiquitous in the environment and play important roles in both biological processes and biotechnological processes, including biological control, ecological processes, and bioremediation [1].

Fungi are ubiquitous organisms found in soil, water, and air, and can survive both in extreme environments, and in extreme conditions, such as hypersaline lakes, volcanic eruptions, hypersaline waters, and solar space. Many species are capable of producing edible products, such as saprotrophic edible mushrooms [2]. In recent years, mushrooms have been shown to exhibit various pharmacological activities, such as antidiabetic [3,4], anti-inflammatory [5], anti-cancer [6], anti-inflammatory [7], anti-inflammatory [8], and anticancer activities [9].

The most common fungal species isolated from aquatic environments are Penicillium, Trichoderma, Alternaria, and Cladosporium [10]. Alternaria and Cladosporium have been reported as contaminators in recreational water, and have been implicated in the spread of pathogenic and environmental human and animal infections.

The main agent responsible for human and animal diseases, including Penicillium, is a basidiomycetous fungus belonging to the family of Diatrype-Polyporoidaceae. It infects mainly immunocompromised patients, but also those with other underlying diseases, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and other chronic diseases [11].

Penicillium infections can be caused by diverse fungi, which are usually harmless and do not cause disease symptoms. However, they can cause disease in otherwise healthy patients, such as those with predisposing conditions such as renal or adrenal diseases, etc. Penicillium infections are extremely rare. However, penicilliosis can present with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the skin and nails to a disseminated infection, which can be as wide as 6-11 cases per million inhabitants [12].


## Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Al-Azhar University, and all animals used in this study were handled according to the guidelines set by the “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” of the United States National Research Council (Approval No. 11/2010) [22].

Strains and Growth Conditions
S. cerevisiae strain SC5314 was used in all experiments [23]. Yeast cells were grown at 30°C, unless otherwise noted.

Fungal Strains
The S. cerevisiae strain SC5314 was used in all experiments with S.


## Results
We used a modified panel of antibodies against GPI-ß and IgM to select three serum antibodies for testing across the blood-brain barrier in critically ill patients with Cryptococcal brain infectio. The antigen was obtained from blood cultures of healthy individuals using antibodies against GPI-ß and IgM against GPI-ß, respectively. As described in the Materials and methods section, we examined the ability of the serum antibodies to bind to the blood-brain barrier in the context of Cryptococcus gattii infection (Table 1). A lower sensitivity was observed for the sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis. The strongest antibody binding was observed in the sera of those with a history of cryptococcosis and a history of neutropenia, as well as the sera of those with a history of neutropenia. The sera of those with a history of cryptococcosis were also less sensitive to the sera from patients with a history of neutropenia. However, the sera of those with a history of cryptococcosis were less sensitive to the sera of those with a history of neutropenia. These results indicated that sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis were more likely to bind to the blood-brain barrier in the context of cryptococcosis.

Antibody binding of the sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis to the blood-brain barrier
The sera of patients with a history of cryptococcosis were highly seropositive, as demonstrated by low antibody titers. The sera of patients with a history of cryptococcosis were also highly seropositive. The sera of patients with a history of cryptococcosis were also seropositive. As demonstrated by low antibody titers, sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis were more likely to bind to the blood-brain barrier in the context of cryptococcosis.

Our findings also showed that the sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis were more likely to bind to the blood-brain barrier in the context of cryptococcosis. This result indicated that the sera from patients with a history of cryptococcosis were more likely to bind to the blood-brain barrier in the context of cryptococcosis.


## Discussion
In addition, we analyzed data collected in the literature to determine whether the patients who had a high cryptococcal antigen load had a higher risk of disseminated diseas. We found that the risk of disseminated disease was associated with the duration of time from the initial infection, the time to onset of symptoms, and the total time from the initial infection to the onset of symptoms.

Our findings provide evidence that the time to onset of symptoms is associated with the risk of cryptococcosis, but not with the time from initial infection to onset of symptoms. The patient with disseminated disease had a high risk of disseminated disease. However, the patient with cryptococcosis had a low risk of disseminated disease.

CNS disease is characterized by increased intracranial pressure and increases intracranial pressure. The increase in intracranial pressure may increase the blood pressure in the brain, which may lead to increased intracranial pressure and increased intracranial pressure. The patient with disseminated disease had a low risk of disseminated disease. However, the patient with cryptococcosis had a high risk of disseminated disease. This finding is similar to a prior study that reported that the risk of Cryptococcus gattii infection was associated with the duration of time from initial infection to onset of symptoms, but not with the total time from initial infection to onset of symptoms.

The initial infection in our patient was a brain-alveolar puncture, which is often associated with the development of cryptococcal meningitis. The patient had no signs of meningitis and no apparent neurological symptoms. We also did not find any increased intracranial pressure or elevated intracranial pressure in the CSF. In our patient, the initial infection was a brain-alveolar puncture, and the patients’ serum was normal. The initial infection in our patient had no signs of meningitis and no apparent neurological symptoms. This finding is similar to a previous study that found that the risk of cryptococcosis was associated with the duration of time from initial infection to onset of symptoms.

The patient with meningitis had a low risk of meningitis, which was associated with the duration of time from initial infection to onset of symptoms. However, the patient with meningitis had a high risk of meningitis.

This study has some limitations.
