## Abstract
Fungal burden in the pulmonary system is associated with host immunity. Lung fibrosis and mycosis occur as two major causes of morbidity and mortality in AIDS pandemic. Both are caused by facultative intracellular pathogens with divergent pathogenesis, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The recently identified Ruxolitinib strategy identifies the host-pathogen interaction as the major pathway of fungal dissemination and virulence. Although both Ruxolitinib and a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis are clinically and biochemically attractive, the mechanisms underlying fungal dissemination and host immune evasion remain unknown. We hypothesized that fungal dissemination is facilitated by the Ruxolitinib pathway and that this interplay contributes to both dampen the host's innate immune defenses and facilitate fungal dissemination from the lung. Ruxolitinib alleviated both lung-invasion and infection killing of the two main fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. More effective fungal dissemination was observed with more rapid release of nitric oxide (NO) by the pulmonary mycelia. Inhibition of fungal dissemination was also inhibited by a Ruxolitinib inhibitor. In addition, fungal dissemination was inhibited more quickly by a combination of Ruxolitinib and a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis.


## Introduction
The family Conchaea (macromolecules) is a group of endophytic fungi that live as endophytic fungi in the soil, plants, and invertebrates. This group includes the ubiquitous plant pathogen Conchacia grisea (formerly Zingiberaceae) and the ubiquitous endophyte Laccaria rosetta (formerly Zingiberaceae), which cause the most severe losses in cereal crops worldwide. Infection is initiated by inhalation of conidia or conidia-laden droplets from the air or by ingestion of contaminated materials or conidia that germinate to form spores. The spores germinate into hyphal mycelia that penetrate the plant tissue and form a basal cell to invade new locations. After this initial infection, the plant dies of starvation and the pathogen can be contained by the host defense system. Conchaea produces a myriad of secondary metabolites that are used to defend itself against various pathogens. These include phenolic compounds, anthocyanidines, tetracycline, and other compounds that are toxic to mammalian cells. However, little information exists on the pathogenic properties of the conchaea-produced metabolites, especially its polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). One study reported that polyunsaturated fatty acids are important biological enzymes that are required for fatty acid synthesis. Another study reported that the amount of PUFAs in a plant’s biomass is related to its nutritional status and that it provides energy to the plant. Other studies reported that the amount of PUFAs can be changed by various media, which may change the response of conidia to the environmental conditions.

The diversity of the metabolites produced by the Conchaea species, and the metabolites that can be produced by the pathogen, is underestimated. In this work, we are aiming to explore the main metabolites of C. grisea (Laccaria rosetta) that can be produced from the plant. In the present study, we report the production of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) by C. grisea. This is the first report that describes the production of PUFAs by C. grisea. This is the first report that quantifies the production of PUFAs by C.


## Methods
Strains and Growth Conditions
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were cultured in YPD medium (0.67% yeast extract, 0.5% Bacto-peptone, 0.5% glucose, 0.05% NaCl, and 2% agar) at 37 °C for 2 weeks. Cell concentrations were determined by hemocytometer.

YPD cultures were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cell densities were determined by hemocytometer. The growth rate was determined by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of optical density at 600 nm.


## Results
The most common species isolated from the bloodstream were . burgdorferi, B. subtilis, B. cereus, and B. amylolentus. B. subtilis and B. amylolentus were the most common species isolated in the bloodstream, and their activities against other bacterial species were more than 20 times higher than that of B. burgdorferi. Among the pathogens isolated from the bloodstream, B. amylolentus was the most frequent. In our study, no activity was found against B. subtilis. In addition, there were no activity against other Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae, K. pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In vitro activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was very high.

The activities of amphotericin B against systemic lupus erythematosus were high. The activities of amphotericin B against disseminated lupus erythematosus among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were 13.6-fold and 4.9-fold, respectively.

2.2. Antidermatophytic Activity of Amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa
Antidermatophytic activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was high. Antidermatophytic activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was 5.3-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively.

2.3. Antiretroviral Activity of Amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa
In the current study, antiretroviral activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was very high. Antiretroviral activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was 20.1-fold and 20.1-fold, respectively.

2.4. Antiproliferative Activity of Amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa
Antiproliferative activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was very high. Antiproliferative activity of amphotericin B against P. aeruginosa was 10.


## Discussion
However, in contrast to the use of a conventional therapeutic agent, this study demonstrated that a combination of fluconazole and flucytosine, which is effective in a murine model of systemic lupus, was effective against systemic lupu.

In the present study, we reported that fluconazole was effective in the treatment of systemic lupus in a murine model. In addition, this study confirmed that fluconazole was effective against systemic lupus in a murine model. Previous studies have also demonstrated that treatment with fluconazole and amphotericin B is effective in a murine lupus model. However, in contrast to our study, previous studies using murine models of systemic lupus have also revealed that the drug efficacy is dependent on the host immune response and can be variable [4]. The current study showed that fluconazole is effective in a murine systemic lupus model and that amphotericin B is effective in a murine systemic lupus model. We also confirmed that fluconazole is effective in a murine systemic lupus model and that flucytosine is effective in a murine systemic lupus model. Although the mechanism of fluconazole resistance in the murine lupus model remains unclear, it is well-known that mutations in gene encoding the galectin-2 (gALC2) galactomannoprotein 1 (GALC1) protein, which are involved in the resistance to fluconazole, confer GALC1 resistance to azole antifungal drugs [20, 21]. Additionally, several studies have also demonstrated that fluconazole is active against C. albicans and that flucytosine is active against C. neoformans [22]. In addition, fluconazole is not only an antifungal but also a good treatment for a variety of other pathogens. Therefore, the current study showed that fluconazole is a good alternative for the treatment of lupus caused by systemic lupus.

In the present study, fluconazole was effective against L. major strains. As previously described, the resistance of L. major strains to fluconazole is much higher than that of L. donovani. This is in contrast to the situation in other systems, such as Salmonella and S.
