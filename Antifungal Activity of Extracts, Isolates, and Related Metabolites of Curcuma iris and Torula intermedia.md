## Abstract
Encephalitis due to Aspergillus is a rare, fatal disease that is estimated to be less than five cases per million live or die worldwide each year. The main etiology of its lethality is a primary immunodeficiency, which is likely due to an inflammatory response initiated after the onset of immunodeficiency syndrome (IOD). The main etiology of its resistance is an autoimmune defect manifested as hypomorphic swelling in the brain, which is common in immunocompromised patients, leading to an overaccurulation of the immune system, which can result in fatal complications, including immunosuppression, aspergillosis, and hematologic malignancies. Due to the wide range of immunodeficiency mechanisms that have been studied, the manifestations and the causes of fatal symptomatic infections are still not fully understood. In this article, we used culture-based and in vitro methods to reveal the spectrum of hypomorphic swelling in the brain, including the involvement of the brain microvasculature. Using a literature search strategy, we discovered only five cases of hypomorphic swelling in the brain in the last 12 months: three cases in infants and one case in their elderly, and two cases in their younger adolescents. Hypomorphic masses were frequently observed in the brain of healthy infants and in their older adolescents, while the affected areas were predominantly seen in the upper, lower, and upper lobes andons, while the affected areas were more abundant in the lower and upper lobes andons. In addition, hypomorphic masses were frequently seen in the brain of children, including two cases of healthy infants, while the affected areas were predominantly seen in the lower and lower lobes andons, while the affected areas were more abundant in the upper and lower lobes andons.


## Introduction
The genus Hymenaea, first described in 1843 (Hirayama et al. 2012), is a heterogeneous group of eukaryotic organisms that belongs to the order Hymenoptera, order Choanephala, family Choanephala and family Choanephalae (Singer and Lyon 2006, Swisher et al. 2014). Hymenaea is phylogenetically closely related to Choanephala (Singer and Lyon 2006) and Choanephalae (Singer and Lyon 2006). However, Hymenaea is a sister order to Choanephala (Kuroki et al. 2011), and therefore appears to be a sister to Choanephala (Swisher et al. 2014). Hymenaea has been isolated from the leaves of a variety of plants, including various species of Acacia, Ficus, Pyrus, Salix, Salix, Sclerotinia, Soli, Piper, and Sabinogon (Kuroki et al. 2011), and also from the leaves of some species of Agave, Eucalyptus, and Pinus (Singer and Lyon 2006).


## Methods
The total volume of the E:5, E:4, E:5, and E:7 extract was determined with a Thoma-X-band filter device (MBI MicroSpin, Germany. In order to check the color of the crude extract, the film thickness was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (MBI microplate UV-2, Xiamen, China). The total E:5, E:4, and E:5 extract was prepared as described in the method of Kullback [27] and the combined E:5, E:4, and E:5 extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure.

E. coli (ATCC25922) was used for the isolation of the extracts from Curcuma iris. Briefly, E. coli was grown on PDA (1% peptone, 1% dextrose, and 1% KI) medium at 37°C for 3 days. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in sterile PBS. The cell suspension was adjusted to the required concentrations using a Neubauer chamber, and the cell suspension was further diluted with PBS to reach a final concentration of 100% cell viability. The cells were then disrupted by vortexing with a glass bead, and the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 12000× g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 5% PBS. The cells were further centrifuged at 12000× g for 10 min to pellet the cell debris, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS, and the cell number was determined by counting the number of CFU on the agar plate.

The E. coli strains were maintained in liquid medium at -80°C. The E. coli strain E. coli-E. coli-E. coli-E. coli-E.


## Results

For the root extract and stem stem extract preparations, the fresh and synthetic stem extracts exhibited the highest activities against the tested fungi, and the synthetic stem extract significantly inhibited the growth of the tested fungi (Table 2.

For the stem extract and stem extract preparation, the three extract preparations exhibited similar activities, and the three extracts significantly inhibited the growth of the tested fungi, whereas the two extracts significantly inhibited the growth of the tested fungi (Table 2).

3.5. In Vitro Activity of Extracts
The inhibition of the fungal growth in aqueous solutions is a good indicator of the activity of extracts against the tested fungi.

3.6. In Vitro Activity of Extracts
The results of the concentrations of extracts tested are illustrated in Figure 2. The concentrations of extracts were determined using a different chemical method and are listed in Table 3. The extracts exhibited the highest activity against the tested fungi. The concentration of the extracts was 0.05-0.7 g/L, which was within the limits of detection. The extracts exhibited the least activity against the tested fungi, and the highest activity against the tested fungi was 0.2 g/L.
