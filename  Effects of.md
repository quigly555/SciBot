## Abstract
Over the last decade, the application of molecular techniques for the identification of specific families of microbial proteins has been gaining importance due to its advantages and the availability of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic methods. In this review, we focus on the molecular applications of proteins that have been widely used for the identification of pathogenic or commensal organisms such as fungi, bacteria, and helminths. The use of different approaches, different experimental design, and different analytical procedures to study pathogenicity, commensalism, and infection has allowed us to overcome the limitations of molecular diagnostic methods and the limitations of molecular methods for the identification of pathogenic or commensal organisms such as fungal resistance. We also discuss and present the advantages and limitations of molecular methods in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, commensal organisms, and infectious diseases with special emphasis on the molecular diagnostic applications of protein diagnostics.


## Introduction
.


## Methods
venezuela were inoculated on Sabouraud agar (SDA) plates (10 g yeast extract, 10 g peptone, and 1 g glucose per liter) and incubated at 28 °C for 5 day. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3000×g for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. Fungal biofilm growth was analyzed by using a FACS Diva flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The results were analyzed using FlowJo v10.0 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).

Preparation of Fungal Biofilm Isolates
A mixture of 500 µl of a 2 × 10^6 CFU/ml suspension of P. venezuela was incubated with 20 µl of 0.5 mg/ml of trypan blue dye in 0.1 M HCl for 3 h at 37 °C. After this period, the cells were washed with PBS and the cell numbers were counted.

Preparation of Fungal Biofilm Isolates
The suspension of 10^7 CFU/ml of P. venezuela was incubated with 20 µl of 0.2 mg/ml of trypan blue dye in 0.1 M HCl for 3 h at 37 °C. After this period, the cells were washed with PBS and the cell numbers were counted.

Preparation of Fungal Biofilm Isolates
Cells were suspended in 50 µl of 0.01% trypan blue in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 10^5 cells/ml. These suspensions were incubated with the addition of 10 µl of 0.5 mg/ml of chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated for 5 min with a suspension of 10^5 CFU/ml of C. albicans strain ATCC 90028 (MAT a clinical isolate, isolated from a patient with dermatophytoses from January 2011 to July 2015) in 1 mL of PBS at 37 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and the suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min.


## Results
coli
In addition to the potential contribution of the N-glycan recognition domain, the N-glycan binding domain of N-glycan Fungicide could also be the best studied region of glycan formation in . coli. The N-glycan binding domain of N-glycan Fungicide was shown to be highly conserved in eukaryotes [2], [17], [18]. We were interested in determining the evolution of the N-glycan binding domain of N-glycan Fungicide.

To test the possibility that N-glycan Fungicide affects N-glycan production, the glycan concentration and the concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined. The glycan concentration and concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains. The glycan concentration and concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains. The glycan concentration and concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains. The glycan concentration and concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains.

The incorporation of N-glycan into the N-glycan form was evaluated by measuring the concentration of N-glycan in the culture supernatant (Figure 1). The concentration of N-glycan in the culture supernatant was determined for all strains and the tested strains. The concentration of N-glycan in the culture supernatant was determined for all strains and the tested strains. The concentration of N-glycan in the culture supernatant was determined for all strains and the tested strains.

In order to determine if the N-glycan production was affected by N-glycan production, the concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium was determined by using the following concentrations: 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0.1% of the total protein. The concentrations of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains. The concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium was determined for all strains and the tested strains.

The glycan concentration and concentration of N-glycan in the growth medium were determined for all strains and the tested strains.


## Discussion
benthamiana on a microbial surface
On the surface of a microbial system, the production of a variety of compounds by microorganisms, including chitin, cellulose, and starch, is produced (Koc et a., 2011). Chitin, in particular, is one of the major compounds in N. benthamiana, but not in other microorganisms, and may also be produced by other microorganisms (Wong et al., 2011).

In this study, we examined the bioactive compounds produced by N. benthamiana N-glycosylation, the second step in the N-glycosylation process in N. benthamiana. The results of the interaction assays showed that some of the compound, N-glucose, was highly active in interaction with both C. albicans and C. neoformans. The presence of several glycosides in the C. albicans cell wall in the presence of the glycosylation of N-glycosylated compounds, in this case, N-mannose, may be related to the generation of N-glycosylated compounds.
