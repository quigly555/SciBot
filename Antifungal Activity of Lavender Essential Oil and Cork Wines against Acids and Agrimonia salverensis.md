## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is mainly caused by the inhalation of Aeromonas species, which can also infect HIV-infected patients. The early stage of infection is characterized by the production of a pleural fluid, which contains a mixture of C-C Asian pine, which is the predominant species, and A. baumannii, which is dominant in the C. gattii biogeography section. The pulmonary cryptococcosis is most frequently caused by the inhalation of Aeromonas species, which can also infect HIV-infected patients. This study investigated the prevalence of clinical, epidemiological and drug-drug interactions between A. baumannii and A. melanista.

A total of 384 A. melanista isolates were isolated from various clinical specimens. From the specimens, 97% were identified as A. baumannii, and it was found that A. melanista was the dominant species among the isolates with 99% of encounters with A. baumannii. The presence of drug-drug interactions was found to be higher among the isolates with 99%, and this trend continued for the remaining isolates.


## Introduction

Vincenzo and Posas (saponins) are two groups of flavonoid. Lavender is used in traditional medicine for treating cough, fever, colds, dysentery, constipation, and diarrhoea. Lavender is also used in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer, skin diseases, skin diseases, inflammation, rheumatism, and menstrual disorders [12]. In traditional medicine, it is also used as a tonic, anti-inflammatory, and antithyroquinone for the treatment of rheumatism, diabetes, dyspepsia, and gonorrhea. In the past, Lavender has been used as a folk medicine for pain and inflammation, as a remedy for headache, dyspepsia, and dysphagia, and as a laxative for osteomyelitis [13]. However, the use of Lavender is associated with allergic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in children [14]. Previous studies have found that the presence of Lavender in traditional medicine has an additive effect on the blood circulation [15]. Therefore, it is important to examine the antimicrobial activity of Lavender essential oils against Acids and Agrimonia salverensis.

Acids and Agrimonia salverensis
Acids are composed of lipids and fatty acids and can be caused by either bacteria or fungi. Acids can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or parasites. Infection by bacteria typically results in infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, followed by Mycobacterium equinum. The most common and serious infection caused by fungi is pyogenic pyelonephritis. The most common opportunistic infection is Candida albicans. However, other common infections, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and other fungi, such as Mucor spp., have been reported [16,17,18]. In general, patients with weakened immune systems such as HIV/AIDS patients, patients on immunosuppressive therapy, and patients on prolonged steroid therapy are at risk of developing Acid infections. There are various clinical presentations such as localized, chronic, or disseminated infections. Depending on the etiology, infection can be classified into three types: asymptomatic infection, chronic infection, and invasive infection. Immunosuppressive therapy is used for the control of Acid infections.


## Methods

The concentrations of the essential oil and Cork Wines were determined according to the method of Fujita et a. [63]. The essential oil of Lavender was dissolved in aqueous solution (0.1% v/v) of petroleum ether (10 g/L), and was then diluted with distilled water (1.2 mL) to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 g/L. The stock solution of Lavender essential oil was prepared by dissolving 2.5 g of the essential oil in 1.2 mL of distilled water, and then diluting the diluted solutions with distilled water. The stock solution was then added to the fermentation broth and the fermentation broth was poured into a sterile bong and poured. The broth was poured and poured into a sterile bottle and shaken gently to obtain pure essential oil. The broth was then poured into a tube and poured into a tube. The essential oil of the mixture was then extracted by adding a drop of ethanol (20 mL, v/v) to the solvent. The oil was then removed from the tube by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a tube. The oil was then removed from the tube by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently. The oil was then extracted by adding an equal volume of anhydrous sodium hydroxide and the mixture was poured into a sterile bong and shaken gently.


## Results
The lavender essential oils were evaluated against Acid and Agrimonia salverensis by the method of the same protocol used for the present stud. As shown in Table 1, the essential oil of lavender contained a well-defined mass spectrum of nanno-ß-d-glucoside, anthraquinone, vinification agent, and flavonoids. The effects of lavender essential oil on Acid and Agrimonia salverensis were tested by the MIC, MIC_90, and MIC_50 values for the tested strains, respectively. The results showed that the lavender essential oils exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against both species. The IC_50 values of lavender essential oils against Agrimonia salverensis were 0.28 µg/mL and 0.23 µg/mL, respectively, and MIC_90 values of lavender essential oils against Acid and Agrimonia salverensis were 0.19 µg/mL and 0.25 µg/mL, respectively. The data indicated that lavender oil and lavender plant extracts exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against both species.

The antimicrobial activity of lavender essential oils against Agrimonia salverensis was evaluated by the CLSI/MDA assay. As shown in Table 2, the antimicrobial activity of lavender essential oils was greater than that of vinification agent. As shown in Table 2, lavender essential oil showed strong antifungal activity against both species, with IC_50 values of 0.62 µg/mL and 0.14 µg/mL, respectively.

The antimicrobial activity of lavender essential oils against Acid and Agrimonia salverensis was evaluated by the MIC_90, MIC_90, and MIC_50 values for the tested strains, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the MIC_90 values of lavender essential oils were 0.17 µg/mL and 0.14 µg/mL, respectively, and the MIC_50 values of lavender essential oils were 0.10 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL, respectively.


## Discussion
The results of the present study showed that the potential of the cell wall chitin and cellulose degrading enzymes for the production of fatty acids, lignin, xanthones, and the synthesis of fatty acids is dependent on the type of cell wall chitin and cellulose degrading enzymes. The production of lignin, xanthones, and the production of fatty acids by the cells grown in PAB medium are dependent on cell wall chitinases and ß-glucans, whereas cellulose degrading enzymes are the major cellulolytic enzymes of the cell wall. Cellulose degrading enzymes are also required for cell wall chitin synthesis and the synthesis of fatty acids.
