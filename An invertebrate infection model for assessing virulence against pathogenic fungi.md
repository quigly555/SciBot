Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient receiving corticosteroid therapy. This patient had been treated for multiple invasive fungal infections with high suspicion, and he had a good outcome.

A 57-year-old African American male with a past medical history of non-fungal ulcers, choroidal thickening of the vocal folds, and polyposis-induced choroidal prosthesis was treated with liposomal amphotericin and corticosteroid, with no complications reported.


## Introduction
The genus Rhizoctonia was established by Hammill (1934) to accommodate phytopathogenic and non-phytopathogenic species that inhabited a wide range of habitats within the plant kingdom. Species of this genus were regarded as serious threats to plant and animal life and required quarantine measures against their occurrence in their respective ecosystems (Cornelissen et al. 2006). In the past, Rhizoctonia was associated with fruit rot and was a potential threat to strawberry (Lamprecht & Bartlett 1980, Cornelissen & Schmidt 1975, Rossman et al. 1995, Bartlett & Bartlett 2000), pear (Lillieux & Lebel 1996), apple (Lebel & Neumann 1994), and citrus (Nishiyama & Koike 2009). However, in recent years, the fungus has attracted considerable attention as a cause of postharvest decay of fruits and vegetables. Currently, postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Rhizoctonia oxysporum have been extensively studied (Mullins et al. 2007, Sun & M.M.T. Hayes 2011).

The major pathogen of fruit and vegetable decay is Rhizoctonia solani, which causes the decay of many fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals, with a few diseases reported from other plant species. The Rhizoctonia species are mainly found on apples (Alvarez & Cioccoli 2000), oranges (Alvarez et al. 2000), and pears (Ciccazzo et al. 2003), with a few exceptions, such as R. solani var. gigaspora (Kerrigan & Ewbank 1975), R. oxysporum (Wu et al. 2006), and R. solani var. guilliermondii (Nagafuku et al. 2007).


## Methods
Briefly, sterile toothpicks were placed into sterile 6-wells microtiter plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA. Each well was inoculated with 5 × 10^6 cells in 0.5 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a volume of 50 µL. The wells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. The number of viable C. albicans and C. glabrata were determined by plating serial dilutions of CFUs from the wells. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h, and the number of colony forming units per gram of tissue was determined. The colony forming units per gram of tissue were defined as the number of CFUs per gram of tissue.

The virulence of the C. albicans strain was assessed using the Cryptococcus neoformans strain ATCC 208821 (ATCC 90028) [27] and C. glabrata strain ATCC 12228 (ATCC 90030) [28]. Cryptococcal cells were grown overnight at 37°C, diluted to an OD_600 of 0.1 in sterile water, and then diluted to an OD_600 of 1.0 in RPMI-1640 medium and grown for 3 h at 37°C. The mycelia were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 0.5% (wt/vol) Tween 20 for 1 h at 37°C. After the mycelia were washed, the mycelia were cut into 5 µm thin segments, and homogenized in sterile water with a pipette. The cell suspensions were then diluted to an OD_600 of 0.2 with RPMI-1640 medium, and plated onto YPD agar for CFU enumeration. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h. The number of CFUs per gram of tissue was determined as described above.

Phagocytosis assays
Cryptococcal cells (1 × 10^6/mL) were seeded in 6-wells microtiter plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C. The cells were then lysed with 0.05% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37°C.


## Results
To test whether the pathogenic fungal infection model in vitro is suitable for the assessment of virulence in the murine model of cryptococcosis, we generated murine models of cryptococcosis using the mice deficient in a non-secreted, non-CD4^+ T lymphocyte-mediated innate immune syste. The murine model was performed to assess the feasibility of the mouse model of infection (Figure 2).

The murine model was tested to determine whether the host immune response is sufficient to observe the disease in the murine model of cryptococcosis. In this model, we observed minimal disease in the murine model (Figure 2A). In contrast, the host immune response is required to observe the disease in the murine model of cryptococcosis (Figure 2B). The host immune response is required to observe the disease in the murine model of cryptococcosis.

Infection by Pneumocystis jirovecii produces T lymphocytes with an effect on the host immune system
We have previously shown that infection by P. jirovecii produces T lymphocytes that produce IL-1ß and IL-6 [19,20]. We next asked whether infection by Pneumocystis jirovecii produces T lymphocytes that produce IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-1ß.

We examined whether Pneumocystis jirovecii produces T lymphocytes that produce IFN-<U+03B3> or IL-1ß. T lymphocytes were isolated from BALF and brain and then cultured in YEPD for 4 h to obtain T-cell monoclonal antibody (TCA)-DG, T-cell dendritic cell-specific primers (TDC-MHC, TDC-PIC) or immunofluorescent macrophage conjugation (ICM-Ig) (Figure 3A). T cells were then plated on a plate containing either Pneumocystis jirovecii (Figure 3A), an M. tuberculosis infection (Figure 3B) or a non-infectious M. tuberculosis infection (Figure 3C) and infected by Pneumocystis jirovecii (Figure 3D).


## Discussion
In . albicans, the CnPDR2 protein is required for virulence, but not for infection [57]. In C. neoformans, the CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B subunits also serve to regulate CnPDR2 activity, which is essential for the production of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 [58,59].

We further demonstrated that the CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B proteins could also inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, including IL-6 and TNF-a. In contrast, CnPDR2-B protein did not have a significant effect on IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a expression in the lung, suggesting that the CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B proteins are not essential for protection against pulmonary inflammation. In contrast, CnPDR2-B protein significantly reduced IL-10 and IL-13 expression in the lung, as well as the production of IL-12 and IL-13 by the human epithelial cells. We also determined that CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B protein was able to inhibit IL-10 and IL-13 expression in the lung. CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B protein was able to inhibit IL-10 and IL-13 expression in the lung and the production of IL-12 and IL-13 by the human epithelial cells.

IL-6 and IL-13 have been previously associated with the lung epithelium, where they inhibit the production of IL-13 and inhibit the production of IL-6 [60,61]. In the current study, we used the lung epithelium as a model of C. neoformans infection, and we observed that CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B proteins could be induced by the epithelial cells. CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B proteins are also able to induce IL-13 and IL-6 expression in the lung, suggesting that CnPDR2-A and CnPDR2-B proteins are required for the production of IL-13 and IL-6 in the lung.
