## Abstract
The members of the arachidonic acid (AA) transmembrane protein family (Tale1, TEF1, and TEF2) and the AA-melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor (LSH1) have been proposed to play a role in regulation of the response to a wide variety of stimuli in most organisms. However, to date, there is very little information about the functions of these proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) of organisms such as fungi and bacteria. Here we investigated the roles of these proteins in the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) of two model organisms, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. We found that the BMDC cell surface expression of the Tale1 and TTF2 genes was significantly up-regulated in response to ketoconazole and amphotericin B compared to that of the BMDC cell surface expressing the other two yeast genes, R265 and D198. The TTF2 gene and the Tale1 and TTF2ß gene variants were significantly differentially up-regulated in response to ketoconazole and amphotericin B compared to that of the BMDC cell surface expression.


## Introduction
The genus Aspergillus is comprised of more than 100 species, and many of them cause pulmonary infection. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a common manifestation, and patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are often asymptomatic.[ 1] However, it is fatal if left untreated. ^2] The frequency of IA in the ICU has increased more than 50% in the past 15 years. ^2] The best predictor of mortality is the duration of stay in ICU and of subsequent deaths.


## Methods

The study involved the analysis of 1,500 patients with histoplasmosis in a range of age group. A total of 100 patients were included. The cell density was observed using a spectrophotometer (Axiovert, Cambridge, UK). After transfection, histoplasmosis was quantified as the number of transfected cells per ml of the culture medium. The cells in the culture medium were then used to count the number of cells in the growth chamber.

The efficacy of the transfection protocol of the heat shock treatment of Streptomyces marcescens F-18 was performed at the Department of Biotechnical Faculty, University of São Paulo.

The data obtained from this study were considered the standard clinical reference in the study of research. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of São Paulo (CEUA-SP).

Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of São Paulo (CEUA-SP). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Patients
In the study, patients with histoplasmosis in any of the conditions, including histoplasmosis, were included in this study. The patients were divided into five groups: 1) patients without histoplasmosis, 2) patients with histoplasmosis, 3) patients without histoplasmosis and 4) patients with histoplasmosis. All the patients were divided into five groups; (1) patients without histoplasmosis, (2) patients with histoplasmosis, (3) patients without histoplasmosis and (4) patients with histoplasmosis.

The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of São Paulo (CEUA-SP) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards and the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Clinical data
The patients with histoplasmosis in the present study were classified into two groups: histoplasmosis with Histoplasma meningitis and Histoplasma meningitis with Histoplasma meningitis.


## Results
This is consistent with the importance of oral candidiasis to the hos.

Candida glabrata Leishmaniasis is caused by an oral candidiasis, and the mechanisms of this disease are unknown. Candida glabrata can cause oral and deep-erectile candidiasis, and the majority of candidiasis in humans occurs through ingestion of candidal cells. The oral route of treatment of candidiasis is associated with oral candidiasis, and it is a difficult path to manage. The mechanisms of this disease are unknown, but candidal growth and dissemination are the major cause of candidiasis in humans [9,27,28,29]. Candida glabrata is a commensal of the mouse model of candidiasis, and it is the most common cause of candidemia in humans [30]. Candida glabrata is associated with oral candidiasis, and the oral route of treatment is associated with oral candidiasis. Candida glabrata is associated with deep-erectile candidiasis, and oral candidiasis is a major cause of candidemia in humans [31]. Candida glabrata is associated with systemic candidiasis, and it is a commensal of the mouse model of candidiasis [32]. The oral route of treatment of candidiasis is associated with oral candidiasis, and oral candidiasis is a serious and fatal infection in humans [33]. In addition, there are several reports that the oral route of treatment of Candida glabrata is associated with oral candidiasis [34,35].

Viral Absence of Candida glabrata Is Associated With Intracellular Vesicles
The results from the analysis of the extracellular vesicles (VEC) in the oral cavity, which was obtained by measuring the ratio of the extracellular vesicles to that of the extracellular vesicles, in the gavage of candida, are presented in Table 2. In addition, we identified a trend towards more retention of intracellular vesicles in the oral cavity of candida when the candida were compared with that in the gavage of candida.


## Discussion
albicans (EC34337 and EC34337-1) were involved in heat shock response. E. coli heat shock proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in several stress response mechanisms such as oxidative stress, cell wall remodeling, heat shock and cell wall stress [29], [30]. To investigate whether these three heat shock proteins play any role in the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus, we first studied the heat shock protein expression of EC3501 and EC35300-1 in vitro and compared them to those of other heat shock proteins. Surprisingly, EC3501 expression was significantly up-regulated in the heat shock protein expression compared to EC35300-1. These data suggest that EC3501 might play a role in regulating the heat shock response in A. fumigatus. EC3501 is a typical member of the family of heat-shock proteins and is reported to be involved in cell stress response, activation of the transcription factor NF-<U+03BA>B and other stress responses [30], [31]. In addition to heat shock proteins, the heat shock protein expression of EC3501 was significantly increased in the cell wall of A. fumigatus (Fig 2A). The EC3501 expression was also up-regulated in the cell wall of A. fumigatus compared to other fungal species (Fig 2A). The cell wall of A. fumigatus has been shown to be highly unstable and highly influenced by various environmental conditions [32]. Thus, the up-regulation of EC3501 in A. fumigatus compared to other fungal species could be due to its inability to respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli.

The down-regulation of EC3501 in A. fumigatus was also observed in response to the presence of cell wall stress (Fig 2B). The up-regulation of EC3501 in A. fumigatus correlated with the induction of cell wall stress-related genes (Fig 2B). However, the induction of cell wall stress-related genes (EC34337, EC34333, EC34335, EC34338, EC34339, EC34350) in A. fumigatus was not significantly different from that in other fungi (Fig 2B).
