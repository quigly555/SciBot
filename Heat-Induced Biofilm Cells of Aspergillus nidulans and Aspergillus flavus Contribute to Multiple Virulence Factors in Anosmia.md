## Abstract
We report the case of a 30-year-old man with AIDS, hepatitis C, and liver cirrhosis who presented with respiratory failure, aseptic respiratory failure, and multiorgan failure. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, HIV-associated encephalitis, and Kaposi sarcoma due to a Klebsiella pneumoniae autoantibody. He had a favorable outcome after multiple myeloma, HIV-associated encephalitis, and liver cirrhosis. Given the unusual presentation and possible underlying opportunistic infection, this case provides evidence of possible post-transplant treatment for at-risk individuals with immunodeficiency, and of course, comprehensive evaluation for post-transplant treatment should be considered.


## Introduction
Infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The incidence of infections with HIV has increased significantly in the last years, and there is a high potential for HIV to become an important cause of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) [1-3]. The clinical manifestations of a variety of conditions such as myelosuppression, myelosuppression-associated immunodeficiency syndrome (MSA), autoimmunity, and autoimmune diseases are among the major risk factors for developing NHL [4-7]. Some of these conditions can be present as early manifestations of HIV-associated NTM, such as HIV-associated paronychia, CD4+ T cell lymphopenia, and lymphocytic lymphadenopathy, which can progress to NHL. In addition, HIV-associated multifocal leukoerythroblasta (LOH) can be a lethal opportunistic infection [8]. LOH can be fatal if left untreated, and HIV-associated NHL is a potentially fatal disease, especially in countries with limited access to antiretroviral therapy [9-11].

In the past two decades, there has been an increased attention on the clinical manifestations of HIV-associated NHL. However, the early diagnosis and treatment of a variety of opportunistic infections remains challenging. In this study, we present a case of HIV-associated NHL with the clinical presentation that was clinically indistinguishable from LOH. The patient presented with headache, nausea, vomiting, and severe dehydration. He was admitted to the emergency department. The study was performed according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines (US) criteria for patients with severe hemoptysis and severe leukaemia. We also evaluated the possibility of neutrophils in the serum and CSF, macrophages and neutrophils in the CSF, and cytokine production in the plasma in order to determine the clinical and laboratory features. The diagnosis and management of a variety of serious infections was performed.

## Results
The primary infection models of IPA are not widely recognized in the field, however, the IPA virulence factors are associated with the in vivo models [4. In order to better characterize the virulence factors in the primary IPA models, we examined the phenotype of the primary IPA model by testing the in vivo virulence of the three Aspergillus flavus strains. As shown in Figure 7, the virulence of the three Aspergillus flavus strains was significantly reduced compared to that of the parental strain in the primary IPA model (p < 0.001). The virulence of the Aspergillus flavus strains was not associated with a significant increase in the number of CFUs in the lungs of the model. The primary IPA model also failed to produce any additional CFUs compared to the parental strain (Figure 7). These data indicate that A. flavus is an essential pathogen for virulence in an in vivo model.

Virulence factors associated with IPA virulence in A. flavus

As a first approach to evaluate the pathogenicity of A. flavus, we used the model of IPA to examine the virulence of the three Aspergillus flavus strains. The virulence factors associated with IPA infection in the primary IPA model were as follows: age, neutrophil depletion, neutrophil depletion, and exposure to high temperature (22째C) (Figure 8A). The virulence factors associated with IPA infection in the secondary IPA model were as follows: age, neutrophil depletion, neutrophil depletion, and exposure to high temperature (22째C). The virulence factors associated with IPA infection in the in vivo model were as follows: age, neutrophil depletion, neutrophil depletion, and exposure to high temperature (22째C). The virulence factors associated with IPA infection in the primary IPA model were as follows: age, neutrophil depletion, neutrophil depletion, and exposure to high temperature (22째C).

## Discussion
[42] and Barazi et a. [43] showed that C. neoformans cells were infected with two C. gattii strains each and were rapidly engulfed by a biofilm-like structure formed by the two C. gattii strains. The biofilm-like structure was composed of a spherical cell, with a smooth surface and a smooth cell wall composed of a polysaccharide-like substance and fibrous matrix. A robust biofilm-like structure was observed for all strains tested and the cell wall was not altered. The biofilm-like structure was also observed when the C. gattii strains were treated with antifungal agents. It was possible that the biofilm-like structure was not formed after treatment with antifungal agents. The cell wall was not altered and the cell wall did not become distorted, indicating that the cell wall was not altered.

Biofilm formation and biofilm formation were similar in C. gattii and C. neoformans. The cell wall of C. gattii and C. neoformans cells was a thicker layer than the cell walls of C. neoformans and C. gattii. The cell wall of C. gattii and C. neoformans were almost completely covered by a layer of a dark-brown pigment. In contrast, C. gattii and C. neoformans cells were surrounded by a layer of a dark-brown pigment. The pigment was dark brown to dark brown in C. neoformans and bright green in C. gattii. In addition, the cell wall of C. gattii cells was composed of a dark-brown pigment and dark brown to dark brown pigments. The cell wall of C. gattii was covered by a layer of a dark-brown pigment. The pigment was dark brown to dark brown in C. neoformans. The pigment in C. neoformans was more dense and had an outer layer of a dark-brown pigment. The pigment was dark brown in C. gattii and was more dense and had an outer layer of a dark-brown pigment. The cell wall of C. gattii and C. neoformans was composed of a dark-brown pigment and a brown-orange pigment. The pigment was darker in C. gattii and was more dense and had an outer layer of a brown-orange pigment. The pigment in C.
