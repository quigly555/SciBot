## Abstract
Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection of the latex of infected animals, which is caused by Coccidioides brasiliensis and Coccidioides lutzii. The emergence of resistant strains of these fungi has increased the need for new diagnostic tests. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo bioinformatic analysis of 120 potential novel drug targets for Coccidioides. For drug identification, we performed the bioinformatic analysis on the fungus of the yeast cells in the culture supernatant of the C. brasiliensis genes for CYP51 and CYP125 while the bioinformatic analysis on the 120 potential new drug targets was performed on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes for CYP51 and CYP125. Among the 60 potential new drug targets, we identified the two novel CYP51 target genes, which are essential for Coccidioides infection.


## Introduction
In these cells, the recovery of some components of the innate immune system may occur either due to the immune-immunity or the innate immune respons. In this case, the recovery of epithelial cells from injured tissue may be associated with an increased amount of Th1- and Th2-driven Treg cells. Other conditions, such as chronic inflammation, may also lead to Th1-biased cells. These cells may react with Th1-driven Treg cells to B cells, which then exert a proinflammatory effect. While the number of B cells in the bone marrow may be low in the majority of tissues, there are very high numbers of Th2 cells in the macrophages. While these cells are abundant in the macrophage, they may not be present in the bone marrow. The macrophage may differentiate into B cells by crossing the blood-brain barrier, which then leads to Th2-biased cells. The bone marrow is the primary site of Th1-polarized Th2 cells, which then induces Th1-polarized Th2 cells. Other studies have indicated that bone marrow macrophages may differentiate into Th1-polarized cells. However, the definition of this differentiation is not always simple, as some macrophages may differentiate into Th2 cells. Indeed, some macrophages can differentiate into Th1 cells and other cells with different phenotypes. For example, type 1-polarized macrophages are Th1 cells and form dense granules with low numbers of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12. Type 2-polarized macrophages may form dense granules with high numbers of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12. However, type 1-polarized macrophages do not differentiate into Th1 cells, as the other cells produce IL-12. IL-12 and IL-23 are the main cytokines produced by macrophages, and these are responsible for the production of IL-12 and IL-23. IL-12 is a by-product of IL-23 and the production of IL-23 is generally associated with Th1 cells production of IL-12 and TGF-ß. IL-23 is produced mainly by Th2 cells and can be produced by Th1 cells. IL-23 can be produced by both Th1 and Th2 cells.


## Methods
% (w/v) mycelial powder and 1% (w/v) aga. The tubes were inoculated with the same number of bacteria and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. After the incubation, the mycelia were harvested by filtration using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The filtrate was carefully removed and the mycelia were re-suspended in distilled water. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was collected and the mycelia concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^5/mL. The concentration of the supernatant was 0.2% (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich). The mycelia concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^3/mL.

The in vitro antagonistic activity of the antibiotics was determined by incubation of the tested bacteria in a solution of 0.5% (w/v) mycelial powder and 0.5% (w/v) agar with the tested antibiotic, which was prepared by dissolving the tested antibiotic in sterile water, to the mycelium. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was collected and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^3/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate.

3.4. Isolation and Activity of Cell-Free Bacteria
The collected supernatant from the plate was stored at 4°C and the microbial biomass was estimated by spectrophotometry. The bacterial activity was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (CFU) per mL of supernatant. The experimental procedure was carried out in triplicate.

The determination of the cellular activities was performed by measuring the cell-free bacterial biomass. The experimental procedure was carried out in triplicate.

3.5. HPLC Analysis of Bacterial Growth by HPLC
The isolated microbial biomass was dissolved in methanol and then filtered and evaporated. The crude extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (30-m length, 4.8 mm × 4.


## Results
 × 10^3 CFU/mL of infected Bacteria and .0 × 10^3 CFU/mL of uninfected Lymphocytes. As shown in Figure 2A, the surface Bacterial suspension was dispersed through the Lymphocytes (Figure 2B). To characterize the location of Bacterial Bacterium in the Lymphocytes, the bacterial suspension was also washed and encapsulated with 100 µg/mL of specific anti-bacterium antibody and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Bacterium was also found in the Lymphocytes, with a thick and compact surface and absence of pseudohyphae (Figure 2C). The secretion of Bacterium by Lymphocytes was not detectable in the absence of anti-bacterium antibody. In the presence of anti-bacterium antibody, the surface of Bacterium was covered with hyphal-like structures and surrounding the Lymphocytes. The absence of pseudohyphae was also observed in the absence of anti-bacterium antibody. The epithelial cell wall of the Lymphocytes was covered with pseudohyphae. These observations indicated that the bacterial suspension of Bacteria formed a deep-cell envelope, which had a thick surface, and a compact surface.

Antibacterial Activity of the Bacterial Bacterial Bacterium Isolated from Clinical Samples
The antimicrobial activity of the bacterial suspension of Bacteria isolated from clinical samples was evaluated using various concentrations of each antibiotic and the MIC of each antibiotic was determined. In the presence of the different concentrations of each antibiotic, the bacterial suspension was tested for antibacterial activity against eight bacterial strains and the MIC was determined by measuring the MIC to obtain the bacterial suspension. The bacterial suspension was tested in the presence of 0.5% FBS (Figure 3A). The MIC value of the bacterial suspension was determined to be 0.25 µg/ml for Bactofuran and 0.5 µg/ml for Bactofuran plus FBS. The MIC value of the bacterial suspension was determined to be 0.5 µg/ml for Bactofuran and 0.5 µg/ml for Bactofuran plus FBS.


## Discussion
In addition, chronic infection in the PCP patient with immunocompromised state such as HIV and many other immunocompromised patients is common [5, 6. In our case, DCBD was also observed in the right hand lobe and posterior part of the right lung in addition to the left lung lobe. Both of these injuries may have been caused by the TB (TB-TB-TB-Tuberculosis complex) infection in our patient.

The diagnosis of PCP in the setting of immunocompromised states, such as HIV and TB, is challenging and sometimes time consuming. However, it has been proven to be a rapid diagnosis and timely treatment is vital in the setting of PCP [1]. However, in HIV-infected patients with PCP, the diagnosis is challenging as CD4 counts typically are low and the disease is poorly controlled [1]. The absence of any CD4 counts is a good prognostic indicator for PCP. The lack of a CD4 count was also noted in our case as well. The overall CD4 counts are normal for PCP [1]. CD4 counts were low for most of the cases in our case, but our patient had CD4 counts of 200-350 cells/µL. In HIV-infected patients with PCP, CD4 counts are often elevated, especially for CD4 counts >350 cells/µL [1]. In our patient, CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL were normal for the patient and the CD4 count was about 150 cells/µL. Although the patient had a low CD4 count, his CD4 count was still low, which suggests that CD4 counts were normal for this patient.

CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL have been reported in HIV patients with PCP [1, 2]. The CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL were low in our case as well. However, our patient had CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL. CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL were elevated in our case and higher in HIV patients with PCP [1]. This indicates that CD4 counts of 150-200 cells/µL could have been normal in our patient.
