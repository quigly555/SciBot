The study uses a distribution of principal components analysis to assess the impact of community-scale factor analysis on the Distric. The significance level at p < 0.05 was considered.

The study population was sampled from a distribution of primary school students in 11 Districts. Rectal swabs were collected from each of the districts and a sample of the entire District from all individuals residing in the districts. Data was analyzed using the exact distributions restricted to p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The mean age of the study population was 15.2 ± 7.5 years, and the mean annual education was 5.4 ± 3.3. The mean male age was 38.0 years. The mean of the samples were sampled before and after the Earthquake occurred on 28 and 42 days in the distribution, respectively. The same distributions were also shown to be significant when matched to the districts were selected by the districts according to the districts performance indices.

The study showed that the indigenous community in the districts was affected by the dominant community. The dominant community was present throughout the entire study period and the samples from the districts showed significant positive correlations with the districts. These data suggest that the dominant community influenced the District quality of life.

Finally, the use of the results of this study can be used to develop recommendations for improving the Districts health services in order to improve the quality of life of the indigenous communities in the affected districts.

In the period from 2009 to 2012, the samples were collected from schools using structured questionnaire collecting feedback on their health services needs. Data was analyzed using Epi-Info version 3.5.3.

A total of 3.662 children were sampled and administered the questionnaire. Respondents were predominantly adults (70%) and children under the age of 10 years were sampled at home. The health services provided were primarily health delivery (36.2%), community health (27.9%), housing (7.3%), community education (4.7%), and transportation (3.8%). The indigenous communities received 34.3% of the District services provided. The distribution of District services received was dominated by primary and secondary education costs (12.3% and 6.4%, respectively). About 75.3% of the indigenous adults were employed. Educational attainment was mainly in the lower secondary education and 57.


## Introduction
Fungi are responsible for life-threatening infections in humans and animals, including invasive infections in humans. Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The most common fungal species that cause these infections are Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis [1-3]. The number of antifungals available for use, however, is limited and the disease spectrum of these agents is more severe in immunocompromised patients [4].

The current standard of care includes amphotericin B and its lipid formulations [5]. However, amphotericin B has serious side-effects, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity [6]. Amphotericin B also has a substantial amount of bioavailability, which is limited, however, this drug can be administered orally [7]. In addition, amphotericin B has a high frequency of resistance in the clinical isolates and has a poor oral bioavailability [8]. Amphotericin B formulations have the major disadvantages, such as high toxicity, high lipid content, and slow bioavailability [7]. However, the use of these formulations is limited by the high cost of the drugs [9].

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of amphotericin B formulations for the treatment of invasive fungal infections and nephrotoxicity in animal models of invasive fungal infections.


## Methods
Patients
From August 2004 to February 2006, 16 patients with CM admitted to the first tertiary referral hospital in the district of Goa in the state of Goa, India, were included in the study. The patients were selected based on the routine and clinical characteristics of the patients, including age, gender, underlying diseases, history of tuberculosis, and sub-group of the patients. All the patients were of average age, over 40 years, with a CD4 count <100 cells/mm^3. The studies were approved by the ethics committee of the primary study site and the study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Helsinki principles.

The study was approved by the Medical Research Institutional Review Board (RECIRB) of the University of Goiás, the institutional review board of the Medical Research Institute of the University of the State of Goiás, and the Ethics Committee of the University of Goiás, the institutional review board of the National Institute of AIDS and the ethics of the research were reviewed by the ethics committee. The study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The participants of the study were identified from the hospital microbiology microbiology laboratories. The microbiology laboratory consisted of the Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Microbiology, Goa, India. The laboratory was equipped with two PCR products, a plasma-based detection system, and a scanning electron microscope.


## Results
A total of 19 principal components were evaluated for the FAS-S1 component and, with the adjustment of the total variance, the model had a strong positive correlation (r^2 = .994; P<0.001). However, the model had only a weak correlation (r^2 = 0.725; P<0.001) and the FAS-S1 component did not provide any predictive value. In addition, the FAS-S1 component did not provide any predictive value for the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism.

We next compared the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism to the contribution of community-scale factors and factors with the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism. The FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism (Fig 4A) was greater than the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism (Fig 4B). In addition, the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism (Fig 4C) was greater than the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the FAS-S1 component’s contribution to the school-on-site endemicism (Fig 4D).


## Discussion
Cerebellar pneumonia is a common complication of intravenous drug therapy and is associated with a broad spectrum of disease, from pyoderma to pneumonia. It is a rare disease in which infection is initially associated with a specific set of pleural effusions, and is a chronic infection that can persist for a long time without any clear signs of underlying disease or immunosuppression.
