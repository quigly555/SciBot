## Abstract
The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii is a significant global threat, causing life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus is a well-known pathogen for causing cryptococcosis, and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity has been greatly enhanced due to the expansion of diverse genetic markers. Using an in-depth genetic analysis of C. gattii, we have identified different transcriptional profiles that are differentially induced during conidia production in comparison to non-conidia clones. By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach and comprehensive phenotypic analysis, we have identified differentially expressed genes, such as ATPase, cytochrome P450, and NAD+ oxidase, during conidia production. Interestingly, we found that many of these genes were also expressed during sexual development. By contrast, several of them are not yet expressed, suggesting that they might be regulated by an individual or even a complex of individual genes. The differential expression of genes involved in ergosterol synthesis during conidia production may therefore impact the developmental process of conidia, as well as the virulence of C. gattii in animal hosts.


## Introduction
In recent years, the incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically in hospitalized patients (Casadevall and Perfect, 2005; Romano et al., 2013). Although the incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased significantly in the past few years, their frequency has remained relatively low. This is mainly because of their immunocompromised status, including prolonged intensive care unit admission and transplantation, prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents, prolonged use of nebulized chemotherapy, use of corticosteroids, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Romano et al., 2013).

Different fungal species can cause infection in different hosts. Fungi can cause infections of the skin, nails, mucosa, urinary tract, and skin. The distribution of fungi in the urinary tract is a common site of fungal infection. The most common genera are Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Candida (Ramamoorthy and Perfect, 2006; Vyas and Perfect, 2006; Romano et al., 2013). In addition, Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen, as the yeast can disseminate from the lungs to the central nervous system and cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis. Other Cryptococcus species, such as C. gattii, C. neoformans, and C. deuterogattii, can cause life-threatening fungal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients (Kanafani et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Romano et al., 2013).

Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of invasive fungal infections in critically ill patients has increased significantly over the past few decades. In the last few years, there has been a substantial increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections in intensive care units (Chung et al., 2012). In fact, the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care units has increased over 500% (Pfaller et al., 2006).

The most common fungi isolated from the urinary tract in India are Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei.


## Methods

In a study published in 2013, highly virulent Candida sp. were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers [24]. In this study, we were able to isolate 4-8 × 10^4 CFUs from a mouse spleen at 48 h after inoculation with an anticoagulant. The frequency of infection was estimated to be 10%. The number of Candida spp. was confirmed by the presence of Candida spp. in the blood and spleen by the number of CFUs in the spleen of a single colony of the strain, as reported previously [25].

In another study, we found that Candida spp. can interact with endothelial cells. In this study, we were able to isolate 1 × 10^4 CFUs from a mouse spleen at 48 h after inoculation with an anticoagulant. The number of CFUs in the spleen of a single colony of the strain, as reported previously, was less than 10%. The number of Candida spp. was confirmed by the presence of Candida spp. in the blood and spleen of a single colony of the strain, as reported previously [25].

In this study, we identified the presence of endothelial cells in the spleen of a single colony of the strain, as reported previously [26]. We used 1 × 10^5 Candida spp. per ml in RPMI 1640 broth (Gibco) for each of the experiments. The number of Candida spp. per ml was determined by counting the number of Candida spp. that formed a separation zone around the cells. The percentage of endothelial cells that were carrying a cell-specific (concentration) endothelial cell population was calculated by multiplying the number of cells carrying a specific population by the number of cells carrying a non-specific population.

## Results
. Characterization of Fungal Colonization Patterns
Based on the results from Fungal Microscopy, we determined the virulence of three selected strains of S. farnesii (CYC7, H99, and LAB1) for the Gram-positive bacterium of the skin disease (Table 1). The fungal growth and colonization of the first 10 days of the study period was compared to that of the two control groups.

The fungal burden in the skin was significantly decreased after the administration of PDV-1-3 (p<0.


## Discussion
However, the patients we treated in our series had no history of previous immune activation or invasive infection. This suggests that the common mechanisms that we have identified for the maintenance of the immune response in this group of patients, rather than a restoration of the immunity against bacterial infection, may be more complicated in patients with asthma and asthma-associated conditions, as demonstrated by the poor prognosis of this group of patients.

In our study, it was found that the airway inflammation was associated with chronicity of the symptoms, with the onset of cough, chest pain and dysphagia and the onset of dyspnea, which was a sign of the severity of asthma [32]. The clinical signs of asthma were particularly variable in the patients, with cough, dyspnea, chest pain and dyspnea all associated with high levels of breathlessness and an increase in the frequency of high-pitched and low-frequency exhaled exhaled and high-frequency exhaled sound, which may be a sign of chronic bronchitis [33].

The mechanisms by which the immune response is activated by the presence of bacteria in the airway and in the respiratory tract are unclear and involve several different routes. There are several mechanisms, including: (1) nitric oxide production by airway epithelial cells [34]; (2) alteration of intracellular proteins by microbicidal activity and cellular metabolism [35]; and (3) an increase in extracellular matrix factor C [36]. In the patients with asthma, we found that the inflammatory response was associated with a delay in the onset of cough, dyspnea and chest pain and a decrease in the frequency of high-pitched and low-frequency exhaled exhaled exhaled and high-frequency exhaled. These symptoms were nonspecific in the patients and had no significant correlation with the severity of the disease or the severity of the disease itself.

The mechanisms by which the immune response is activated by the presence of bacteria in the airway and in the respiratory tract are unclear and involve several different routes. There are several routes that the immune response might be activated in patients with asthma, including an increase in extracellular matrix factor C [37], alteration of intravascular proteins by microbicidal activity and cell metabolism [38] and alteration of intracellular proteins by microbicidal activity and cell metabolism [39].
