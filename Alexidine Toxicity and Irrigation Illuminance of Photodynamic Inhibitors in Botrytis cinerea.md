## Abstract
Plant defense-related molecules including N-acylhomoserine lactone, phosphoinositides (PI), pantonolases, and glutathione peroxidases can be recognized and used as antimicrobial agent. However, other aromatic-based aromatic alkaloids could be used in the same process. The main aromatic alkaloid in C. laurentii is 3-oxo-4-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, which has been reported to be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress response. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHBM) and 1,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHBM) on pathogenicity of A. flavus in the insect pathogenicity-related fungal pathogenicity-deterrent pest insects. Aspergillus nidulans, Fraxinus tubes and A. flavus were injected intraperitoneally with 2.3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHBM) and 1,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHBM) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, followed by 0.5 mg/kg DHBM and 0.25 mg/kg DHBM for 10 min each. The insect was then exposed to pathogen doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg/kg. The insects were then inoculated with a lethal dose of A. flavus using a bait trap constructed to subvert DHBM and 1,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DHBM). The pathogen killed 50% of the infected A. flavus. The larvae were able to survive for 15 days and exhibited a survival margin of 75% at day 7, androphied animals were also killed 50% of day 7. At day 8, the insect showed a subacute mortality of 31%, androphilic animals were detected in the galleries of the infected insect hemocoel. At day 9, A. flavus killing was higher than that of the hemocoel, androphilic animals were detected in the galleries of the infected A. flavus. At day 10, the mortality was 33% and the insect was able to kill 31% of the insect population. In conclusion, A.


## Introduction
Trichoderma is a genus of fungi that belong to the genus Trichoderma, and are found in the soil as endophytes, symbionts, or pathogens of plants (Bien and Espenshade, 2011). They are commonly found in soil (Bien and Espenshade, 2011; Cogoni and Teixido, 2012), and a few species are saprophytes or parasites (Pereira et al., 2015). Although Trichoderma species have been known to cause infections in humans, they have rarely been isolated from the skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, and skin and nail (Rangel et al., 2004; Aguileta et al., 2007). Skin diseases such as dermatitis, atopic eczema, ocular inflammation, or pruritis have been reported in Trichoderma spp. (Rangel et al.


## Methods

## Results
cinere. B. cinerea were infected with B. cinerea ATCC 2001 and measured daily. The results showed that 4-L-phenylethanol significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea, while 4-L-phenylethanol significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea. The control strain (ATCC 2001) was grown in the presence of 0.1% phenylethanol and the strain of B. cinerea was used as a control.

3.3. Biological Activity
The results showed that 4-L-phenylethanol significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea, while 4-L-phenylethanol significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea. The control strain (ATCC 2001) was grown in the presence of 0.1% phenylethanol and the strain of B. cinerea was used as a control.

3.4. Anticryptococcal Activity
Anticryptococcal activity of compounds 1-7 was evaluated using a standard approach and the results are presented in Table 4.

The results showed that 1-L-phenylethanol and 4-L-phenylethanol were more effective against C. albicans than the control strain. The control strain (ATCC 2001) was grown in the presence of 0.1% phenylethanol and the strain of B. cinerea was used as a control. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of 4-L-phenylethanol was more potent against C. albicans than the control strain.

3.5. Anticryptococcal Activity
The results showed that 1-L-phenylethanol and 4-L-phenylethanol significantly inhibited the growth of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C. neoformans in a dose-dependent manner. The control strain (ATCC 2001) was grown in the presence of 0.1% phenylethanol and the strain of B. cinerea was used as a control.

## Discussion
neoformans, a fungus that is important for the development of candidiasis (40. Although this fungus has been used as an in vivo model for fungal infection in vivo, little is known about the fungusâ€™s biological role in vivo. To date, only three reports have been published about the fungal pathogen C. neoformans (41-43). Our present results provide further evidence that the photodynamic inhibitor nystatin A can induce the production of this fungal pathogen. In vitro, this inhibitor was able to induce the production of a variety of photodynamic inhibitors such as NDM, which is a phytocarcinogenic agent, and NDM-induced inhibition of photorespiratory transport, including the inhibition of respiratory chain and the photorespiration pathway, both of which are important for fungal pathogenicity (24).

Our previous research revealed that the photodynamic inhibitor, nystatin A, can induce the production of the photosensory photosynthesis gene, the pigment MDR, which is required for the production of the secondary metabolites, such as melanin (44). Furthermore, our present results showed that the photodynamic inhibitor, nystatin A, can induce the production of the enzyme, the photolyase, the enzyme-like protein, the enzyme-like RNA polymerase (LRP), the melanin synthase (LRP-1), the cell wall polysaccharide synthase (LWP-1), and the melanin-like protein (LWP-2) in the cells, which are critical for the normal growth and development of C. neoformans (35, 45). Thus, we further showed that photodynamic inhibitors such as nystatin A can induce the production of the enzyme, the LRP, and the melanin-like protein (LWP-2). In addition, our results showed that the photodynamic inhibitor, nystatin A can induce the production of the melanin-like protein (LWP-3). This is in line with other studies that reported that photodynamic inhibitors induce the production of the melanin-like protein (LWP-4) in the C. neoformans yeasts (46).
