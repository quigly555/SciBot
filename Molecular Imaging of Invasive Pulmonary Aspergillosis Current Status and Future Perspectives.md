## Abstract
Infections of the cow dung beetle (Vulvovaginales) are frequent vectors of many neglected animal diseases. Vyvovaginalenia is the third most frequent cause of infection in cow dung beetles worldwide. Vyvovaginales have been recognized as a very effective vaccine candidate against various human-pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, there is still uncertainty regarding its mode of action. The aim of this study was to identify the mode of action of the Vyvovaginales against BSI. In order to do that, the study group consisted of members of the Animalia and Fungalales, of which 12 were selected for this study. The VGIIa and VGIIb strains were collected from beetles that were in the process of being evaluated as potential BSI vectors. Then, the active site of Vyvovaginales was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that the VGIIa was significantly more effective than the BSI vector. The VGIIb strain had more virulence when evaluated in terms of both clinical and animal manifestations. However, the VGIIa displayed a better protection against bovine mastitis. The mechanism of action was similar to that of the VyvaA strain. However, the VGIIa also had a worse virulence when evaluated in terms of both clinical and animal manifestations. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the Vyvovagininales is a promising vaccine candidate against several animal-pathogenic bacteria and viruses. However, further investigations are needed.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Among these, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common IFI and represents an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with immunosuppressive diseases. The most common clinical presentations in patients with IA include fever, cough, and dyspnea. In some settings, IA is the most common fungal systemic disorder with a mortality rate of 30% and 70% in general population, respectively (Perry et al., 2014). The morbidity and mortality associated with IA is mainly due to the immunocompromised status, the immune status of the patient, the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Gill and Brown, 2017; Perry et al., 2017). The common underlying immunodeficiencies are myeloid-mediated immune disease (MDA) (Hall et al., 2015), sarcoidosis (Cotter and Dring, 2015), and systemic mycoses (Ferrari et al., 2003; Perry et al., 2017). Other immunocompromised patients are also at risk of IA. It is estimated that approximately 10% of patients with various forms of immunosuppression are infected with fungi (Wu et al., 2017).


## Methods

.2. Case Definition
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Medical School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Protocol # 2009-ID/39/EC) (Protocol # 2009-002-01.0). All of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosed by the National Institute of Occupational Medicine or IOS/IOS-Brazil (Protocol # 08-016-01) were enrolled consecutively into the study. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital.

2.2. Case Definition
The diagnostic criteria used in the present study were: (1) probable diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, (2) probable diagnosis of IOS/IOS-Brazil, and (3) probable diagnosis of IOS/IOS-Brazil.

2.2. Case Definition
The procedure of the present study involved the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis in the presence of pulmonary aspergillomatous abscess. The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillomatous abscess was based on histopathology, radiologic criteria, and clinical investigations. The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillomatous abscess was based on the clinical characteristics and diagnostic criteria of pulmonary aspergillosis.

2.2. Case Definition
The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspergilloma was based on the histological findings and the clinical investigations.

2.2. Case Definition
The results of pulmonary aspergilloma were based on the clinical features of pulmonary aspergilloma and the clinical procedures.

2.2. Case Definition
The research group of Dr. H. S. Serrano was able to determine the pathogen prevalence in the patients with pulmonary aspergilloma. The incidence of pulmonary aspergilloma was reported in one patient with pulmonary aspergillomatous abscess. The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergilloma was based on the criteria of the previous study [11].

2.2. Case Definition
The epidemiological data of pulmonary aspergilloma were used in the present study. The data of pulmonary aspergilloma and the data of IOS-Brazil were used in the present study.

## Results
Most papers reported on the development and clinical manifestation of pulmonary aspergillosis (Fig 1. However, most of the reports were based on reports of fungal infections. The first reports focused on the development and clinical manifestation of pulmonary aspergillosis (27, 28, 29). We have reviewed the literature and found that there are insufficient studies to assess the development and clinical manifestation of pulmonary aspergillosis in the current study.

Using the complete literature, we identified six publications that reported a clinical diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but did not report on the incidence of the disease. These included the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with a history of pulmonary aspergillosis, the development of cerebral toxoplasmosis, and the development of clinical manifestations (Fig 2). The incidence of pulmonary aspergillosis was estimated to be 2% (30). The incidence of pulmonary aspergillosis was estimated to be 1.9% (31) (Fig 2).


## Discussion
. Chemistry
The essential and active compounds of the essential oil of D. hansenii were synthesized by reaction of the aromatic amines with water (CH_2) and CH_3 (CH_2NH_2) as solvent (methylsulfonyl chloride) and glycerol (cinnamaldehyde). The essential oil of D. hansenii was obtained by reaction of CH_2 with methylsulfonyl chloride (CH_2) and CH_3 (CH_2OH) as solvent. The essential oil of D.
