## Abstract
Recent reports have highlighted the potential utility of live vaccines against fungal diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of immunity to fungal pathogens remain unclear. In the present study, we first explored the effect of adjuvant live vaccines on the expression of resistance markers such as the polysaccharide capsule, HLA-DR1, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase B and the transcription factor Sj. Resistance was induced in three mouse strains and four human cancers by adjuvant live vaccines, either alone or in combination with adjuvant live vaccines. In addition, live vaccines induced strong and pronounced immune regulation against the four fungal strains. Immunization with live vaccines, alone or in combination with adjuvant live vaccines, induced expression of two resistance markers, HLA-DR1, a homology to the M1 capsule, BCR-A1, and a laminarin-like protein. Using mouse lung epithelial cells, we demonstrated that live vaccine induced strong upregulation of the capsular polysaccharide in the lung, as well as differential expression of the capsular polysaccharide capsule in the lungs of mice lacking HLA-DR1, BCR-A1 or Sj. These results suggest that live vaccine may induce in vivo resistance to fungal pathogens. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that adjuvant live vaccines induced in vivo resistance in the lungs of mice lacking HLA-DR1, BCR-A1 or Sj, or that adjuvant live vaccines induced weak and strong responses in the lungs of mice lacking HLA-DR1, BCR-A1 or Sj, or that adjuvant live vaccines induced a strong response in the lungs of mice lacking HLA-DR1, BCR-A1 or Sj. The discovery of these distinct cellular responses represents a key step forward in understanding fungal pathogenesis and could aid in the development of novel vaccines for fungal diseases.


## Introduction
Fungal infections in humans are usually not well understood. In Brazil, the incidence of invasive fungal infections has been estimated to be over 50% [1]. Most invasive fungal infections are caused by Candida species (C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis) and Cryptococcus neoformans (C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis). The most common non-albicans species are Candida and Candida parapsilosis. However, other species such as C.


## Methods
These yeasts were identified by macroscopic observations on the isolated colonie. A total of 40 yeast strains were included in the study. A total of 70 Candida albicans, 45 Candida albicans, and 30 Candida albicans strains were used in the study. Yeasts from this study were cultured in CMC medium (CMC = 1% w/v peptone, 2% w/v yeast extract, 1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v glycerol, 0.01% w/v uracil) with or without different inhibitors (cyprodinol, carvacrol, or caspofungin, or nystatin, as required). For the cell wall stress tests, yeast strains were cultured in 96-well plates at 30 °C for 48 h. The media was then removed and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The cells were counted on a hemocytometer and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland (0.5 x 10^4 CFU/mL) in 1% w/v glycerol. The media was then placed in a moist chamber at 30 °C for 24 h. The cells were then collected and washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove non-phagocytosed yeasts. The supernatant was then transferred into a 1.5% w/v glycerol solution (the same amount as the culture broth) and kept at 30 °C for subsequent cell counts. The yeast cells were then stored at 4 °C for further analysis. The concentration of yeast cells in the supernatants was measured by the method described by Prasunamy et al. (2014) with some modifications. The yeast cells were diluted to 1.0 x 10^5/mL in 1% w/v glycerol, and the yeast cells were then added to the supernatant of the yeast cells. The culture broth was then centrifuged at 2000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh 1.5% v/v cell-free culture and maintained at 30 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh 1.


## Results
cerevisiae and Candida albicans are first loaded with acetyl-CoA, and then subsequently loaded with galactose, maltose, glycerol, and sucrose, which are neutral precursors of proteins with a major role in the cell wall biosynthesi. Thus, the synthetic vesicles have been shown to be responsible for the production of many plant-derived compounds, as well as the mobilization of many microorganisms, including fungi [1].

After the vesicles were loaded with the crude extracts of S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans, the leaves were harvested, and the total amount of the extract was extracted into long-spored pieces. The extracts were then processed with acetone and sulfonamide to remove the acetyl-CoA and galactose that had been mobilized into the vesicles. The final extract was then placed in acetone and sulfonamide, and the resulting extract was analyzed by mass spectrometry to detect acetyl-CoA and galactose by the spectrophotometric method. The mass spectrometry results showed that the extract contained the amount of acetyl-CoA and galactose in the extract, and the concentration of the extracts was close to the detection limit. The extract showed similar amounts of galactose, maltose, glycerol, and sucrose in the extract as the extract of S. cerevisiae (Table 1). The extract of S. cerevisiae was also identified as the extract of S. pombe and was used in the literature as the standard for isolation of a mold extract.

The major extracts of S. cerevisiae (Table 1) contained about 75% of the natural products that were identified in this study. The major extracts of S. pombe were further identified as the extract of Candida albicans, the extract of S. cerevisiae was the extract of Candida dubliniensis, and the extract of Candida parapsilosis, which was the extract of Candida glabrata. These extracts showed similar amounts of the extract in the extract of S. pombe, and the extraction of S. cerevisiae contained the extract of S. pombe, which was the extract of S. dubliniensis.


## Discussion
albicans are shown in Figure 4 and Figure . The extracellular vesicles are made up of a mixture of cell wall and extracellular vesicles, which are divided into extracellular and intracellular vesicles (Figure 5). The extracellular vesicles are released by the plasma membrane and transported by a hemolymph to the extracellular vesicles. The intracellular vesicles are made up of a single extracellular vesicle (Figure 5A and Figure 5B) and some intracellular vesicles (Figure 5C).
