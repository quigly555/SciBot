## Abstract
Morphological plasticity and the function of nucleotide sugars are central to processes such as chromosome organization and repair and which have been under consideration for several years. To support these processes, cells are constantly exposed to diverse environmental stresses, including cell wall perturbing agents, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell wall perturbing agents. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fibrinogen and nucleotide sugar regulation have also been under consideration. A number of studies have been performed to explore molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. The importance of cell wall composition in cellular organization and maintenance has also been highlighted. This review aims to shed light on the role of cell wall polysaccharide nucleotide sugars as molecular predictors of mitochondrial morphology and the important role that these nucleotide sugars play in cell organization and maintenance. Finally, we discuss the possible role of cell wall polysaccharides in mitochondrial morphology, suggesting that modifications in cell wall composition are required for maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and for cell organization and repair. Finally, we review the importance of cell wall polysaccharide sugars in maintenance of mitochondrial morphology.


## Introduction
Fungi are abundant in the soil, and thus, they form mutualistic associations with their soil microbiota, and thus, they colonize its environment with their hosts (Martinez, 2010; Mendes et al., 2013). Fungi are associated with a variety of ecological niches and conditions, such as high- and low-nutrient, and nutrient-poor soils. This is important for the survival and propagation of fungi in these habitats, and consequently, they play an important role in ecosystem functioning. Fungi have a remarkably diverse potential sources of bioenergy, which is utilized in the production of biofuels and other commodity products, such as building materials, fuels, chemicals and chemicals used in agriculture and other industries (Pappas et al., 2012). Fungi are also associated with many other microbial genera and species, including yeasts, mold, and parasites, that are ubiquitous in the environment (Clemente et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014). Yeast species are characterized by a characteristic high growth rate, low surface area, and a lack of substrate attachment (Sagratini et al., 2005). Although yeast species are abundant in the soil and are relatively low in the air, they are associated with significant quantities of organic matter, and thus, they contribute to the maintenance of the ecosystem functioning (Bassetti et al., 2009).

Yeasts are amongst the most abundant plant-associated microorganisms, and their global growth rate is estimated to be around 10^-18 M, and their growth is dependent on a variety of factors, including nutrient availability, temperature, and the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus (Sagratini et al., 2005). Yeast growth is typically induced under low-nutrient conditions, and due to their slow growth, the substrate is often insufficient (Ricciardo et al., 2010). However, they are able to proliferate and cause disease, as observed in soil contaminated by agricultural residues and polluted by wastewater (Singh et al., 2010).


## Methods
This hospital serves a catchment area of about 2,000 inhabitants, and has been the gold standard referral hospital for the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis in the State of Madhya Prades. To this end, 1-week-old male mice (Charles River, UK) were used in this study. They were provided with standard doses of 0.5 mg/kg (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) per mouse, as described in the Pharmacopoeia, and were kept in the dark at 4 °C to prevent them from light-induced infections. Mice were housed in the animal facility of the Medical Research Institute of Madhya Pradesh (MRM) in a small room. The animals were allowed access to a food and water free of animal cages, and provided with sterilized food and water free of charge. The mice were handled according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Government of India (reference number: 2010A-M-0011-S).

In this study, we have included 11 mice from the MRM, 1 from a healthy control, and 1 from a mouse with acute sepsis due to myocardial infarction. All animals were cared for in strict accordance with the principles of the ethical treatment of animals.

Mice and animals
The animal was used in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Government of India (reference number: 2010A-M-0011-S). The mice were housed in the animal facility of the Medical Research Institute of Madhya Pradesh (MRM) under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and humidity change, as described in the Pharmacopoeia. Mice were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 14 dpi.

Mice
The mouse was randomly divided into two groups of four animals (four mice for each group) and then the animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 14 dpi.

Histopathology
Histopathology was performed by the use of the method described by Dube and colleagues [22] with slight modifications.


## Results
We therefore analyzed the immunogenicity of PMA and PMB using the stress-induced secretion of histidine. PMA was used as a negative control. After 2 h of exposure, PMA was able to induce the inflammatory response that is usually associated with neutrophil recruitment. PMB was used as a positive control. The cellular responses to PMA and PMB were analyzed in three separate experiments. We examined the inflammatory response by measuring the release of soluble neutrophils. We used a rat MP-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects neutrophil release in the serum of neutrophils [7]. We observed that the amount of soluble neutrophils in the serum of rat MP-2 treated with PMA, PMB and PMA + PMA were significantly higher than that of the controls (p < 0.01, Student’s t test, Fig 4A). PMA was able to induce the inflammatory response that is usually associated with neutrophil recruitment (Fig 4B). PMB was used as a negative control. The release of soluble neutrophils was detected by ELISA. PMA was able to induce the inflammatory response that is normally associated with neutrophil recruitment (Fig 4C).

We next asked whether PMA could induce a change in the cellular response to inflammatory mediators, including neutrophils, in response to PMA. PMA was used as a positive control. We examined the cytokine release of the cytokine-producing MHC class II cytokine IL-1ß, which is known to be induced by neutrophils [8]. We observed that PMA induced the production of IL-1ß in response to PMA, PMB and PMA. PMA was able to induce the inflammatory response that is normally associated with neutrophil recruitment. PMB was used as a positive control. PMA was able to induce the inflammatory response that is normally associated with neutrophil recruitment (Fig 4D).

In summary, PMA significantly induced the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro. The secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by PMA were also able to induce a change in the cellular response to PMA.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine production by PMA-induced neutrophils was measured by using the cytokine production assay.
