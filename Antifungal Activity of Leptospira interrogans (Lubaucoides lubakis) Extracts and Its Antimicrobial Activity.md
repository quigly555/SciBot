## Abstract
The need for novel antimicrobial agents has historically been attributed to the pathogens or microorganisms present in the environment. Natural products, particularly polyphenols, are known to have therapeutic benefits against infectious diseases. This article reviews the natural products with antibacterial activity and antimicrobial activity from the sources and phytochemistry of which polyphenols are composed. The phytochemical analysis of the natural products revealed that the polyphenols possess a number of pharmacological activities, such as antiplasmin (Zanthoxylum salamaria), antiplasmin (Zanthoxylum latifolia) and quorum-sensing (Meyerabia spp. and Rhodotorula spp.). This review furtheritizes the natural products to show their as yet undetermined biological activities. The literature reveals that natural products present in this review possess antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and cytotoxic activities.


## Introduction
The bacteria that cause human disease are commonly identified as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not often identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. However, there are increasing numbers of infections caused by other bacterial pathogens, e.g., pneumococci, or by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which have been identified in the United States, Canada, and Europe [1, 2]. Commonly identified organisms are Gram-positive cocci (aureus, S. aureus, Pneumonium, and Acinetobacter species) and Gram-negative cocci (Bacillus anthracis, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) that are found worldwide in both immunocompromised and healthy humans. For these reasons, it is of high interest to the microbiology community. The incidence of bacterial disease in these populations is much higher than in developed countries, in part because of the high cost of diagnostic procedures, such as culture and microscopy and the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, in part because of the risk of resistance to common antibiotics, such as penicillin and cephalosporin [3].

In addition to Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus presents a great challenge to the medical community as it can persist in various body fluids, is resistant to antibiotics, and is capable of undergoing life-threatening invasive infections. S. aureus has been associated with several types of human infections including pneumonia, otitis externa, wound, and septicemia [4]. In recent years, S.


## Methods

The tested strains were stored in sterile, low-iron freezer (LIM, LGZ, Egypt) at -80°C and transported to the laboratory within 24 . Then, the tested strains were identified by agar (1.0 g/L) colorimetric assay of antimicrobial peptide as previously described [34].

The tested strains were also maintained in LYM broth (LB) (0.67% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 0.1% dextrose) at 28°C for 24 h. Then, the tested strains were diluted with the LYM broth (4.0 × 10^6) and cultured at 37°C for 24 h. The culture broth (1.0 × 10^6) was then used as the agar medium. The MIC of the tested strains were determined in a second dilution of the broth (1.0 × 10^5) using the method described in our previous study [35].

Antifungal Activity of L. angustifolius
The tested strains were cultured in LB broth (1.0 × 10^6) at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the tested strains were diluted with the LB broth (4.0 × 10^6) and cultured at 37°C for 24 h. The suspension was then added to each of the test plates (3.0 × 10^5) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The medium was then removed, and the fungal colonies were then washed with sterile distilled water and re-suspended in 0.5% (v/v) glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, 0.5 mL of this suspension were added to the test plates. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The MICs were determined as the lowest concentration that inhibited growth of the test strain compared with the control.

## Results
neoformans and . coli, as well as against S. aureus and B. cereus, respectively. In addition, their antimicrobial activity was also highly efficient against M. tuberculosis, M. aureus and B. cereus. The extracts were also able to reduce the growth of P. aeruginosa, M. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa, while M. aureus was the most sensitive, with a MIC value of 2.5 µg/ml.

The antifungal activity of lubaucoides lubakis extract and its anti-yeast extract against M. tuberculosis, M. aureus, and P. aeruginosa is shown in Table 4. The extract was also able to reduce the growth of S. aureus, M. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa, while the anti-yeast extract was effective against S. aureus, M. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. The extracts were also able to reduce the growth of P. aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa, with a MIC value of 2.5 µg/ml.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of Leptospira interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) Extracts and Its Antimicrobial Activity
The antifungal activity of the extracts and its antifungal activity against M. tuberculosis, M. aureus, and P. aeruginosa is shown in Table 5. The extracts were able to reduce the growth of P. aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa, with a MIC value of 4 µg/ml. The anti-yeast extract was also able to reduce the growth of M. aureus, M. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. aeruginosa, with a MIC value of 2.


## Discussion
subtilis
The MIC and MBC of Leptospira interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) extract against the Gram-positive and -negative . subtilis (Fig 2) were determined (Table 1). It has been reported that this extract showed MIC values of 125 µg/ml for two Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis (Streptomyces sp.), and 125 µg/ml for three B. subtilis (Streptomyces sp.) and 145 µg/ml for four B. subtilis (Streptomyces sp.) [30]. In the present study, the MIC values of these extracts against both Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis were found to be 3.0 µg/ml, 1.5 µg/ml and 4.0 µg/ml, respectively.

The antifungal activity of the extracts of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) against the Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis was evaluated using a standard (MIC=5 µg/ml) and a minimum (MBC=2.0 µg/ml) concentration (Fig 2). The MIC values of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) extracts were determined and found to be 8.5 µg/ml.

The MIC values of the extracts of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) against the Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis were determined (Table 2). The MIC values of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) extracts were determined and found to be 10.5 µg/ml.

The MIC values of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) extract against the Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis were determined (Table 3). The MIC values of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) extracts were determined and found to be 5.0 µg/ml.

The antifungal activity of the extracts of L. interrogans (Lubaucoides lubakis) against the Gram-positive and -negative B. subtilis was evaluated using a standard (MIC=5 µg/ml) and a minimum (MBC=1.
