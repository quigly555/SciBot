## Abstract
Hemocyanin is a natural polyphenol pigment produced by the decomposer decay of wood. Its use in paper industry and in the food industry is mainly due to its health benefits and the relatively low toxicity to animals. Moreover, the pigment has been considered as a possible alternative for biorefinery and as a promising candidate for bioremediation of chemical messengers such as heavy metals and organic acids. In the present review, the use of different chemical agents for the synthesis of hemocyaninin has been discussed and the toxicity profiles of the produced products discussed. Finally, the possible application of hemocyanin in biorefinery and food industries have been described. This review paper mainly focuses on the chemical agents used in hemocyanin synthesis. The literature further describes the toxicity profile of hemocyanins.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an ubiquitous fungal pathogen that is capable of colonizing a wide variety of mammalian tissues. This yeast is often found in the nasopharynx and in the bloodstream. It can cause infections ranging from superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic infections. Candida is the fourth most common fungal pathogen and the second most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections after Candida albicans. It is estimated that about one-fifth of patients with blood and brain abscesses have no clinical benefit.[ 1] Candida is also rarely associated with serious infections. However, in patients with bloodstream infections, there is a tendency to refractory to candidiasis, and the number of deaths due to candidiasis was estimated to be over 1.5 million in 2011.[ 23]

Given the increasing incidence of fungal infections in the world and the increasing number of patients with severe neurological symptoms and immunosuppression, candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality.[ 45] Candida species cause a wide variety of infections ranging from superficial skin infections to invasive and life-threatening systemic candidiasis.[ 6789101112]

Here, we report a case of disseminated candidiasis due to C. albicans in a Japanese patient.


## Methods
For each treatment, two serial 2-fold dilutions were made, and 10 µL of each dilution was placed on the agar surface of each wel. The plates were incubated at 30°C and the radial growth was measured after 3 days. The plates were then incubated at 30°C and the growth rate was expressed as % growth.

4.5. Antifungal Activities of Arginine Oxidase (AxII)
For the antifungal assay, 1 µL of 1-phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) was added to 100 µL of RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS, with a final volume of 100 µL. Serial 10-fold dilutions were made, and 100 µL of each dilution was added to the agar surface of each well. The plates were incubated at 30°C and the radial growth was measured after 3 days. The plates were then incubated at 30°C and the radial growth was expressed as % growth.

4.6. Antifungal Activities of Arginine Oxidase (AxII)
To determine the antifungal activity of the purified antifungal compounds, the 1-phenanthroline compound (0.2 mg/mL) was added to 10 µL of RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS, and with a final volume of 100 µL. Serial 10-fold dilutions were made, and 100 µL of each dilution was added to the agar surface of each well. The plates were incubated at 30°C and the radial growth was measured after 3 days. The plates were then incubated at 30°C and the radial growth was expressed as % growth.

4.7. Antifungal Activities of Arginine Oxidase (AxII)
Antifungal activity of 1-phenanthroline (1-P) was assessed according to the previously described method [33]. A 100 µL aliquot of 1-phenanthroline (1-P) was added to the 1-P (0.2 mg/mL) solution and a final volume of 100 µL was added to the agar surface of each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C and the radial growth was measured after 3 days.

## Discussion
In addition, the compound(s) found in this extract are in agreement with the data of the present study, and could be associated with the function of this extract as a bioactive agent against Cryptococcu. The active compounds found in this extract could be attributed to various substrates, such as the presence of phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Some of the active compounds found in this extract could also be associated with the biosynthesis of other hydroxyl radicals. This could be the case of the active compounds found in the extract of Zizhaugh River Bight, in which a flavonoid, chlorogenic acid, was the major compound. The presence of phenols could be associated with the activity of the extracts of this bight.

The extracts of the black h. reported by Kamathu et al. (2015) were found to have a wide spectrum of biological activities against a wide variety of pathogens, and were also found to have a potent activity against the pathogenic fungi C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. In the present study, the extracts of this bight were found to have a broad spectrum of biological activities against C. neoformans, including antifungal activity, antibacterial activity, antileishmanial activity, and antioxidant activity. The activity of the extracts of this bight could be associated with the substrate used to extract the active compounds. This could be the case of the flavonoids, and the terpenoids found in this extract.
