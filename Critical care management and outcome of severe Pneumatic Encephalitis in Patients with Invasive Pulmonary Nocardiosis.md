# Critical care management and outcome of severe Pneumatic Encephalitis in Patients with Invasive Pulmonary Nocardiosis
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
We included six Pneumatic Encephalitis patients from a literature search in our database to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of PNEU and to compare this with the culture and cryptococcal antigen assay.

We included six Pneumatic Encephalitis patients with no underlying diseases. The patients were admitted at the Hospital for General Medical Excellence (HGA) Milne for microbiology and immunology treatment of a serious Pneumatic Encephalitis. Three patients died during their stay. The most common underlying disease was pulmonary tuberculosis, and the second most common underlying condition was cryptococcosis. A total of nine Pneumatic Encephalitis cases were severe and were mostly malignant. We included three cases of cryptococcosis, two cases of pneumococcal meningitis, and two cases of nephritis. A total of 116 patients with PNEU (71 invasive pneumococcal infections, 17 invasive nodal infections and two leukopenia) and two others with no underlying diseases were included.

Pneumatic Encephalitis is common in the general population. Pneumatic infection is the most common cause of Pneumatic Encephalitis, and the majority of the patients with pneumococcal meningitis do not have a known immune-deficiency. Diagnosis is hampered by culture and multiple investigations require several hours. Pneumatic infections are treated with combination therapy, and mortality is almost halved. The main limitation of this study is to identify patients with PNEU and other infections, and this approach was compared to CCRB, a novel multiplex PCR method.

Six hundred and forty patients with PNEU and invasive pneumococcal infections were enrolled in this study, and 16 cases were excluded. Cases from the presence of PNEU were included in this study. In addition, 20 cases and 20 controls were excluded. Pneumatic pneumonia was diagnosed in 114 cases (83.5%), with 82.1% cases occurred in the “neutropenic” setting of Sicily. Eight cases (10.9%) were pneumococcal isolates, two cases (1.9%) were non-neutropenic isolates and two cases (2.9%) were Pneumatic Elongation Disease cases.

Non-neutropenic and invasive pneumococcal infections are common among patients with PNEU and other infections in Sicily.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom is vast and consists of at least 200 taxa, which are known as saprophytes. The saprophytes are opportunistic fungi that can cause various diseases in the human host, including invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in immunocompromised individuals [1]. IFIs can be classified into non-specific, disseminated, opportunistic, and disseminated forms [2].

Primary cutaneous fungal infections are rare, with only a few cases in immunocompetent individuals [3]. In these cases, the lesions are superficial, and the fungus usually persists for days or weeks before it is reported for the first time in the body fluids or the media. The pathogenicity of fungal pathogens is determined by several factors, including their ability to switch from the superficial to the more invasive phase, the ability to form hyphae, and the ability to adhere to and invade human tissues.


## Methods

All clinical data was collected for 7 days from start of the study in 2013 to date and presented to the study cohort in November 2013, prior to all patients that had been enrolled for the study at this tim. The purpose of the study was to gather information on all patients with the risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (OA) and to gather clinical characteristics.

Data management
All patients were informed of their diagnosis and those with evidence of underlying clinical or radiological disease were managed. The patient care was done by the medical team, which consisted of a resident of the medical clinic, the infectious diseases specialist, and the radiology specialist.

Data collection
Patients were examined clinically and their body weights, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and chest radiography data were recorded. In case of missing or unclear data, the data were collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) and stored in a relational database (BIND).

Data management
Statistical analyses were done using SPSS v.20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile range (IQR). When necessary, categorical variables were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The outcome of Pneumatic Encephalitis in Patient with a Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was also compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher exact test. The first quartile of the distribution was used to determine the association between survival time (Lung At The Time Of Treatment) and mortality (Lung Time At The End Of The Study). The non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to determine the association between Lung At The End Of The Study and Lung Disease Status. To identify the most common clinical conditions, a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with Lung Disease At The End Of The Study. The main outcome was selected if the observed group was <U+03C7>2 = 1.

The main outcome of Lung Disease At The End Of The Study was also identified in the logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors associated with Lung Disease At The End Of The Study. The main outcome of Lung Disease At The End Of The Study was also selected in the logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors associated with Lung Disease At The End Of The Study.


## Results
We have successfully generated a yeast strain that is able to colonize a minimal medium without the use of menadione [15]. We hypothesized that the expression of the hap2 gene in the M. tuberculosis strain could be involved in the infection of the skin.


## Discussion
The research community has largely been focused on fungi (and especially dimorphism) because of their widely used biochemical and physiological data. However, many other species have recently been discovered, and many new taxa are emerging. In the present study, we show that A. pullulans is a new genus with novel and abundant biological characteristics. A. pullulans has a large number of morphological characteristics, and we found a high number of cryptic species. In addition, we discovered many new species that have not previously been reported. In addition, we found new taxa that have not yet been described.

A. pullulans is characterized by the ability to produce pectinases. The morphological characteristics of A. pullulans are similar to other members of the genus, such as the halotolerant species A. pullulans, but the production of pectinases has been described previously. In addition, A. pullulans produces a variety of secondary metabolites, such as enosaccharides, which are known to be produced by some species. These compounds are also able to produce secondary metabolites.
