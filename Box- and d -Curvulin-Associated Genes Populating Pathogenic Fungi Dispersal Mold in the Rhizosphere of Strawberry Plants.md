## Abstract
Histoplasmosis is an emerging ascomycotic infection with high mortality and morbidity every year worldwide. The fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, is found in the environment and as decomposers of decaying fruits and vegetables. H. capsulatum is heterothallic and produces a dim to ascomatal stage of the disease. Disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory system is the major feature in the life style of the fungus during the development of the disease. However, the role played by hematopoietic mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of histoplasmosis is not clear. Here, we show that the dimorphic fungus Mro-rich soil isolate M13 is able to survive and replicate in vegetative mycelium. We found that this is the first study demonstrating that M13 can be used as a suitable host for the study of H. capsulatum.


## Introduction

## Methods
In the first step, we examined the species-specific fungi composition in the strawberry plant tissues with respect to the root-associated fung. In this step, the root-associated fungi were selected based on previous studies in strawberry plants of the genus Rhizosphere. Thus, the root-associated fungi were selected based on the diversity of fungi present in the strawberry plant tissues.

The pathogenic fungi were identified by direct microscopy and the total fungi were observed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. The fungal community was analyzed with an Olympus BX-51 microscope, equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ-4 software. The imaging mode was as follows: laser-induced light scattering (LIMS), 2D energy analysis (ETA), and 2D fluorescence.

In addition to the fungal taxa, the bacterial, fungal-like, and fungal-like fungi were also used as reference species in this study. In addition, we used a species-specific identification of the taxa. We analyzed the fungi that have been selected for the phytochemical analysis by Phytochemistry-EIA (PECL) (Table 1) and the taxonomic classification of the species (Table 1).

The analysis of the root-associated fungi was performed in three different conditions: (i) root-associated fungi with pH values of 3, 4, and 6, respectively, and (ii) root-associated fungi with a pH value of 4.0, 5, or 6.0, respectively. In order to perform the comparison of the pH values of different fungal taxa, the fungus that showed the lowest pH value (0.5-6.0) was selected for the Phytochemical analysis, and the fungus that showed the highest pH value (5-6.0) was selected for the morphological analysis.

In the phytochemical analysis, three samples of a common root-associated fungus, that has been identified as the root-associated fungi, were tested for the identification of the fungal community by the 3, 4, and 5 classes of different methods.

For the phytochemical analysis, the fungal communities were evaluated in different fungal morphological features.


## Results
Thus, we chose to focus on the Fungi of strawberry plants because they were the most virulent of the three strains described below (Table 1.

The Fungi of strawberry plants were grouped into three main clades, with a high level of sequence similarity to the Fungi of F. culmorum (98% sequence similarity), F. oxysporum (98% sequence similarity), and F. vesiculosum (98% sequence similarity). F. culmorum was reported to have been isolated from a large strawberry collection in Italy [32], whereas F. oxysporum was found in the NCBI database [34]. The Fungi of strawberry plants were classified into two clades (Figure 1A). The first clade included the two Fungi of F. culmorum and F. vesiculosum, which were described as “fungi of strawberry plants” in the 2001 database. The second clade included the two Fungi of F. oxysporum and F. vesiculosum, which were described as “fungi of strawberry plants” in the 2005 database. The third clade included the three Fungi of F. culmorum and F. vesiculosum, which were described as “fungi of strawberry plants” in the 2005 database. The four most virulent Fungi of strawberry plants were the three Fungi of F. oxysporum, F. vesiculosum, and F. culmorum (Figure 1A). The three most virulent Fungi of strawberry plants were the three Fungi of F. culmorum (Figure 1B).


## Discussion
In our study, we identified these genes in both the rhizosphere and rhizosphere of the strawberries and compared them to those in other plant specie. These genes are generally conserved across the whole genome of a pathogen, but not always associated with the pathogenicity of the pathogen. For example, deletion of DCL1 and DCL2 resulted in reduced pathogenicity of the strawberry plants (Fig 2). Moreover, deletion of DCL3 and DCL4 resulted in increased pathogenicity of the strawberry plants (Fig 2). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two genes are not involved in the pathogenicity of strawberry plants.

In contrast to other plants, the pathogenicity of strawberry plants is regulated by environmental factors (e.g., genetic factors), and is therefore conserved across the whole genome of the pathogen (Fig 3). The pathogenicity of strawberry plants is likely a result of a combination of the various environmental factors and genetic factors. Plant species have a strong ability to adapt to diverse environmental conditions, which in turn result in an increased ability to survive and reproduce in stressful environments. For example, strawberry plants have a high degree of genetic plasticity, which allows them to respond to various environmental changes [16]. However, the ability to grow in stressful environments is also important for adaptation to stressful conditions [13], [17]. In strawberry plants, the genes involved in the response to environmental stress are enriched in genes involved in stress response (e.g., MAPK) and cell cycle (e.g., CRT1) [13]. Cell cycle is also important for the production of virulence factors, including hormones, cellular stress resistance and adaptation to adverse conditions [13].

The genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation were generally found to be highly upregulated in strawberry plants. However, gene duplication and loss of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation was observed in the rhizosphere of the strawberry plants. The rhizosphere of the strawberry plants also contained a high amount of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.
