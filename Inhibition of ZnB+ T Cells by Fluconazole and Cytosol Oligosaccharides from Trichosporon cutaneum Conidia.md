## Abstract
Fungal burden and the outcome of candidiasis in humans are very variable and can be predicted with a model organism. However, the detailed knowledge of host-pathogen interactions is limited. Here we established a new transcriptional model of candidiasis in Candida glabrata by employing a murine model. We demonstrated that a defect in the expression of the key virulence factors - CgPdr1, Psa1, and Grp1 - is not due to a direct effect of fungal growth on the host but, rather, to a previously unknown effect of fungal growth on the pathogenicity of C. glabrata. The defect in the induction of the virulence factors was significantly associated with the mortality of infected mice. Interestingly, the loss of virulence factor-mediated tolerance in C. glabrata was associated with a significant reduction in the virulence of infected mice. In addition, the ability to survive antifungal treatment was found to be associated with reduced the virulence of the infected mice. Collectively, our results suggest that the virulence of C. glabrata is reduced by the loss of the virulence factors, and that the defects in the virulence factor expression and host-pathogen interaction are dependent upon the failure of the host to tolerate fungal growth in the absence of a fungal host. These results suggest that in C. glabrata, the ability to survive antifungal treatment and virulence is the primary driver of the host response to infection.

Candida glabrata is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans. This fungus produces hyphal growth in vitro and in vivo to evade innate immunity. CgPdr1, the key virulence factor of Candida glabrata, is silenced in the absence of a human host. Here, we have investigated the contribution of CgPdr1 and Grp1, two previously identified virulence factors of C. glabrata, in virulence of C. glabrata.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is an uncommon form of meningoencephalitis that presents with headache, fever, altered mental status, and seizures. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is most commonly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, an environmental saprophyte that can cause meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. ^1 The most common clinical presentation is cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent individuals,^2 but the incidence of cryptococcal infections in immunocompromised patients is increasing. ^3

Cryptococcus neoformans can cause serious fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, such as cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, in which the mortality rate was reported to be over 40% in patients with AIDS. ^4^,^5 The importance of this condition is illustrated by the occurrence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in a patient with sarcoidosis. ^6 The opportunistic infection was mainly associated with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, with the mortality rate being reported to be between 20 and 60% in patients with sarcoidosis. ^7

A large retrospective cohort study reported that 80% of patients with HIV-associated cryptococcosis admitted to the ICU. ^8 The incidence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was reported to be 2.7% in patients with AIDS, 2.


## Methods
% L-tryptophan medium (TMP) for 7 day. The cells were then labeled with the ZnB-T cell line (ZnB+T, Invitrogen) and cultured for 3 days in the presence of fluconazole (0.5 µg/ml). After 3 days, the media was replaced with fresh media and the ZnB+ T cells were counted.

To determine the efficacy of fluconazole and the fraction of the ZnB+ T cells recovered after treatment with ZnB+T, the culture media was collected and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and used for the assays. For the assays, 5 × 10^5 cells/ml were treated with fluconazole and treated with 0.5 µg/ml ZnB+T. The supernatant was collected and used for the assays. The antifungal activity was determined by the 2-((2-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenyl)-2,4-diphenyl)-1,4-difluoro-1,4-bis-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-difluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyrolaminopropyl-4-amine (MT-IPA) assay. The cultures were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with 5% CO_2. The MTT assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of the ZnB+ T cells on the growth of the bacteria. The MTT assay was performed by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1% v/v MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) to each culture, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. The MTT activity was determined using the colorimetric spectrophotometry method according to the method of Masumoto et al. (1991).

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated in triplicate. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, USA) and the data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the mean (SD).


## Results
We therefore wanted to investigate whether treatment with fluconazole and cytosol oligosaccharides produced T cell activatio. To do so, we used fluconazole and cytosol oligosaccharides in combination with macrophages or macrophages for 10 min and compared the induction of T cell responses to fluconazole and cytosol oligosaccharides.

The response to fluconazole was comparable to that observed in the early phase of the fungal infection. In contrast, the response was significantly different in the late phase of fungal infection (Fig 4). Fluconazole treatment resulted in significant reductions in the numbers of the mature T cells in infected macrophages and macrophages. However, in the presence of fluconazole, only three T cell responses were observed (Fig 4). These results suggest that the macrophage-mediated immune response is a protective mechanism against fluconazole.

T Cell Activation in the Presence of Fluconazole and Cytosol Oligosaccharides in the Presence of Macrophages is Transduced to the Subsets of T Cells in the Presence of Fluconazole
Given the significant differences in the response to fluconazole and cytosol oligosaccharides between the early and late phases of fungal infection, we next investigated the effect of fluconazole and cytosol oligosaccharides on the activation of T cells.

We found that fluconazole treatment significantly reduced the number of mature T cells in the late phase of fungal infection (Fig 5). However, fluconazole treatment induced significant reductions in the number of mature T cells in the late phase of fungal infection (Fig 5). These results suggest that fluconazole-mediated inflammatory response is a protective mechanism against fluconazole.


## Discussion
capsulatum by fluconazole and cytarabine suggest that the T cell response to . albicans is highly conserved in C. albicans. To examine whether the response to fluconazole and cytarabine is conserved in C. albicans, we compared the response of H. capsulatum cells to fluconazole and cytarabine. Although the fluconazole and cytarabine concentrations used in this study were higher than those used in previous studies, the strains used in this study were different from those used in previous studies in C. albicans.

H. capsulatum cells treated with fluconazole and cytarabine displayed reduced growth on agar plates, whereas cells treated with fluconazole and cytarabine showed increased growth on media supplemented with other azoles (Fig 3A). We also observed that fluconazole and cytarabine treatment significantly reduced the growth of C. albicans on agar plates (Fig 3A). This result suggests that the antifungal effect of fluconazole and cytarabine is not limited to fluconazole and cytarabine but is also found in other antifungal drugs. In C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and C. gattii, the H. capsulatum cells treated with fluconazole and cytarabine were significantly less sensitive to fluconazole and less sensitive to azole antifungals (Fig 3A). These results are consistent with studies that have demonstrated that the fungus C. albicans responds to azoles via the transcription factor Cdr1 [39]. These results suggest that the inhibition of T cell-mediated antifungal immunity is not limited to fluconazole or cytarabine but is also found in other antifungal drugs.

Cytarabine and Fluconazole Are Important for the Antifungal Activity of Fluconazole and Cytarabine
The antifungal activity of fluconazole and cytarabine was found to be significant for the inhibition of fungal growth and virulence of C. albicans.
