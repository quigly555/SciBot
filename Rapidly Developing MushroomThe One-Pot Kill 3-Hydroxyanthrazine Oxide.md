## Abstract
Gastrointestinal coccidioidomycosis is a serious complication in patients of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The high mortality and morbidity associated with coccidioidomycosis is a result of opportunistic infections that do not share the immune response of the host with which they were recruited. Antibodies (Abs) against common antigens of HIV/AIDS (HIV 1, HIV 2, and 4) have been recently associated with susceptibility to coccidioidomycosis. The present study evaluated the occurrence of coccidioidomycosis and immune reconstitution phenomena in 30 patients with gastrointestinal coccidioidomycosis (CG) at one time during follow-up. The prevalence of coccidioidomycosis was higher in patients with HIV-1 infection (17%) than in patients with HIV-4 infection (32%) and other non-HIV coccidioidomycosis (38%). Patients with non-HIV coccidioidomycosis were more likely to have detectable low free red blood cell (RBC) counts (mean = 4.9, range = 0.0-4.6) compared with patients with HIV-4 infection (mean = 6.9, range = 0.9-8.4). Patients with immune reconstitution had lower plasma concentrations of RBC (mean = 0.06, range = 0.0-0.46) when compared with patients with HIV-4 infection.


## Introduction
A variety of fungi, including some of the ascomycetes, have been reported to produce extracellular enzymes, such as proteases [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Ascomycetes are fungi that can produce a number of enzymes: hydroxyuric acid, ferric acid, steryl acid, pepsin, and amylases [7]. A number of extracellular enzymes are present in the yeast form of fungi and are collectively called extracellular proteases [8]. In the yeast form of fungi, extracellular proteases have been shown to be involved in the degradation of cell membranes, intracellular nucleic acids, and proteins [9]. The number of proteases that are secreted by a given microorganism is relatively small, being less than 100 secretases in an individual [10]. The main secreted proteases in the yeast form of fungi are TCA cycle proteins [11] and glycosyltransferases (GTs) [12].


## Methods
Agar was previously used to treat pycnidia and sporangia in vitro (16. Fungal spores were extracted from the agar plates by gently washing the agar plate twice with distilled water. The mycelia were collected by filtering through sterile Miracloth (Calbiochem) and immediately frozen in liquid N_2.

Preparation of extracts and protein fractions
The fractionation of proteins was performed using a C18-SAPR-HisSelect (Bio-Rad) column (Phenomenex, Hercules, CA) with a 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was equilibrated with 5 M NaCl (pH 7.0) and then the column was washed three times with 0.1 M NaCl. The column was dried, weighed, and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator (Nalgene, Sweden). The crude fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (25) and Western blotting (30).

Protein purification
Protein purification was carried out using the UltraClean^TM Protein Purification Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified proteins were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) (TNT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden), 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST-T), 0.02% Tween 20 (TNT-T), and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against phospho-PICR I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Sweden), and the secondary antibodies against phospho-PICR II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Sweden) and phospho-PICR III (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Sweden).


## Results
The primary aim of this study was to determine if ST from the new . trichocarpa ptd was able to kill P. trichocarpa mycelia. The STs were incubated with the fungus at the concentration of 10 µM. The SOD activity and MIC values of the P. trichocarpa ptd ST were determined. The results showed that the STs from P. trichocarpa ptd were able to reduce the killing activity of P. trichocarpa mycelia by 62.7-fold (P<0.0001) and 85.9-fold (P<0.0001) compared with the control group, respectively (Fig 1). The MIC values of the P. trichocarpa ptd ST were 100 µM for P. trichocarpa mycelia, 50 µM for P. trichocarpa mycelia and 80 µM for P. trichocarpa mycelia, compared with the control group (P<0.0001), confirming the efficacy of P. trichocarpa ptd ST.

P. trichocarpa ptd Infection Shows No Effect on the Growth of P. trichocarpa Mycelia
To determine if the P. trichocarpa ptd was able to cause disease in P. trichocarpa mycelia, the two-pot infection by P. trichocarpa ptd was used as a model. The P. trichocarpa ptd was able to eliminate the fungus in P. trichocarpa mycelia and caused no disease in P. trichocarpa mycelia. The two-pot infection of P. trichocarpa ptd with P. trichocarpa ptd resulted in the inhibition of growth of P. trichocarpa mycelia (Fig 2).

P. trichocarpa ptd Infection Results in a Grown Membrane Potential
In order to investigate the effect of the P. trichocarpa ptd on the growth of P. trichocarpa mycelia, the P. trichocarpa ptd was incubated with the fungi for 3 h and observed by light microscopy.


## Discussion
[5] and is currently in the development phas. The heterocyclic state of the divalent cations in the ryanthrazine is a key factor in the enzyme’s biological activity [26]. The results of this work show that the structure of the phenolic compound can be modulated by an increased concentration of the divalent cations, which can be exploited for the optimization of ryanthrazine production by the mushroom mushroom.

2.2. In Vitro Effect of the Compound on the Growth of Mushroom Hyphal
The hyphal growth of the mushroom is a process that involves the production of an enzyme by the fungus, which is then subjected to a variety of conditions, including temperature, salinity, light, UV, and oxidative stress. The results of this work show that the compound of D. irregularis can induce the hyphal growth of the mushroom. The inhibition of the enzyme could be due to the presence of the phenolic compound, as well as the other chemical compounds that can be identified. The inhibition of the enzyme by the phenolic compound may also be due to the presence of other compounds that can be identified. The inhibition could also be due to the phenolic compound, which can be identified.

The results of this study showed that the compound of D. irregularis can induce the expression of the enzymes genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. The expression of these genes are controlled by the MAPK pathway, which is activated by these compounds, and regulated by MAPK signaling pathways, which is activated by these compounds [27]. In this study, the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds was also induced.
