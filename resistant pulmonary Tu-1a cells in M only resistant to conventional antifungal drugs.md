## Abstract
The immunological impact of pathogenic fungi on the innate immune system has received much attention in recent years as a potential source of novel therapeutic agents against human pathogens. However, the identities of some fungal pathogens could contribute to the immunopathology of immune diseases, as well as the mechanisms of pathogen-mediated immunomodulation. Here, we analyzed the role of the P-type lectin (CL) in innate and adaptive immunity and showed that it affects innate immunity in a synergistic and yet compartmentalized manner. In contrast to previously reported human and yeast CLR antibodies, P-type lectins from fungi and bacteria were found to bind P-Glycsules differently and to exert an inhibitory role in fungal binding to mannose sugar and glucuronoxylomannan. In vitro, P-type lectins from the fungi and bacteria bound to fungal mannose, whereas bacterial mannose was the only available carbohydrate. In contrast, P-type lectins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to fungal glucuronoxylomannan, whereas bacterial mannose did not.


## Introduction
In contrast, the ^13C class of antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, itraconazole and posaconazole do not kill M only resistant strains but only susceptible ones [7,9,10. The ^13C class of antifungals, such as flucytosine, amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and other triazoles, has been used for decades to treat fungal infections [11,12]. However, ^13C class drugs have serious side-effects in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, especially those with drug resistance. The high rates of fungal infections in HIV-positive patients and the need of new antiretroviral therapies (ART) have contributed to the growing number of patients with tuberculosis and immunocompromised conditions like those with HIV or severe burn patients [13]. The severe side-effects of these drugs including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity are typical. The use of ^13C classes of antifungals is associated with several serious adverse effects including nephrotoxicity, renal toxicity and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the development of novel, safe and efficient antifungals remains a challenge in the field of fungal medicine.

Natural products have been widely used for medicinal purposes. Traditionally, plants have been used for a variety of ailments, including insomnia, fever, cough, diarrhea, malaria, asthma, muscle spasm, diarrhea, malaria, diarrhea, muscle spasm, headache, muscle spasm and diabetes. Numerous studies have been carried out on the effects of natural products on the fungal structures. In this regard, studies were carried out with the plant Opuntia in the form of extracts, which were found to be effective in the treatment of many common diseases, including dermatophytosis, sporotrichosis, mycetoma, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, as well as alemtuzumab, in some cases showing the reduction of the fungal structures, such as those producing the antifungal activity.


## Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal use and care.

Strains and growth conditions
The A. fumigatus strain Af293 (Table 1) was used to generate a BL21(DE3)pLysS mutant. Primers for generation of the A. fumigatus pLysS mutants were designed from the genome of the strain and are listed in Table 2. The pyrG^- mutant was generated by transforming the pyrG gene into the <U+0394>pyrG^- mutant by biolistic transformation with the pyrG(-) selectable marker (16). The pyrG(-) selectable marker (17) was transformed into A. fumigatus strain Af293. The wild-type strain was transformed with the pyrG(-) selectable marker (18) to generate the <U+0394>pyrG^- <U+0394>pyrG(-) mutant (19).


## Results
tuberculosis secretes Mg^2+ in susceptible pulmonary Tu-1a cells, we measured the Mg^2+ content of . tuberculosis clinical isolates. The intracellular Mg^2+ contents were similar in the two TBIs. However, M. tuberculosis isolates were more susceptible to fluconazole than the control group (Fig 4A). Therefore, M. tuberculosis isolates were not sensitive to fluconazole.

Mg^2+ uptake by M. tuberculosis isolates
Our data suggest that M. tuberculosis isolates secreted Mg^2+ in response to fluconazole and other antifungal drugs. To further test the effect of Mg^2+ on M. tuberculosis Mg^2+ uptake, the MIC values of Mg^2+ in M. tuberculosis isolates were determined. The MIC values of Mg^2+ in M. tuberculosis isolates were significantly lower than in the controls (P<0.05; Fig 5A). We further tested Mg^2+ uptake by Tu-1a isolates, in which the MIC values of Mg^2+ were increased by more than two-fold in both TBIs. The MIC values of Mg^2+ were increased by more than two-fold in both TBIs (P<0.05; Fig 5B). Therefore, Mg^2+ uptake by M. tuberculosis isolates was significantly increased by more than two-fold in both TBIs.

Mg^2+ uptake by M. tuberculosis isolates in response to fluconazole
We next tested the effects of Mg^2+ uptake by Tu-1a and Mg^2+ uptake by M. tuberculosis isolates in response to fluconazole. Mg^2+ uptake by M. tuberculosis isolates in response to fluconazole was significantly lower than in the controls (P<0.05; Fig 6A), and the MIC values of Mg^2+ were increased by more than two-fold in both TBIs (P<0.05; Fig 6B).

## Discussion
The protective effect of conventional antifungals on M is that they can be used for preventing the spread of TB and other pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis [10. This study showed that the induction of a protective response to conventional antifungals in M is a rare event, and it was not observed in the case of TB. This is because TB is a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. [11] The pathogenicity of TB is a consequence of the diffusion of the drug through the blood stream. It is an epidemic disease in which the number of TB cases is estimated at one million, which is the number of cases in the developed world every year [12]. The infection is also a result of the excessive use of antibiotics by the patient population [13]. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the TB cases are caused by the emergence of TB, which has been reported in the developed world [14], but also in developing countries [15] or in the developing countries [16].

The nature of the resistance of TB to conventional drugs, and the role of the anti-TB drugs in the development of resistance in TB, has been described [17], and the present study showed that the induction of a protective response to conventional drugs in M is a rare event. This is because TB is a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. [18], [19] It is also a very rare event, but it is possible that this rare event may occur more commonly, and in some cases, this could be a path of TB.

The results of this study show that the induction of a protective response to conventional drugs in M is a rare event, and the induction of a protective response to conventional drugs in M has not been observed. This is because the pathogenicity of TB is a consequence of the diffusion of the drug through the blood stream. It is a very rare event, but it is possible that this rare event may occur more commonly, and in some cases, this could be a path of TB.

The results of this study also show that the induction of a protective response to conventional drugs in M is a rare event, and the induction of a protective response to conventional drugs in M has not been observed. This is because TB is a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients.
