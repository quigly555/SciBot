## Abstract
Interleukin 1 receptor-1 (IL-1RL1) is a rare and important antigen. It is the target of mucosal and bacterial infections, and the mechanism of action of IL-1RL1 remains elusive. In this study, we found that treatment with IL-1RL1 significantly suppressed the expression of IL-1RL1 and interleukin (IL)-12p70 in Pichia pastoris, and reduced IL-12p70 levels and IL-13 in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In addition, IL-1RL1 was induced during inflammation, and the induction of IL-12p70 was reduced upon treatment with IL-1RL1. Furthermore, IL-1RL1 was essential for the development of an autoimmune form of rheumatoid arthritis, which was suppressed in patients treated with IL-1RL1. Furthermore, IL-1RL1 was required for the development of an early-life bereavement, and the maintenance of homeostasis. In summary, our study demonstrated that treatment with IL-1RL1 significantly suppressed the expression of IL-1RL1 and IL-12p70 genes, and suppressed the expression of IL-1RL1 and IL-12p70 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and monocyte-derived human monocytes.


## Introduction
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic infection caused by the genus of Pneumocystis and is classified into four main groups, namely, Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-neutrophilic enteropathies, pneumococcal pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hibbett et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2010). While the basic clinical course of PJP remains unknown, it is known that the initial clinical course of PJP is associated with increased susceptibility to several opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and other common infectious diseases (Sobel, 2004; Safavi et al., 2017). As a consequence of this, there is an increasing need for novel treatment strategies to prevent and treat PJP.

Among the promising compounds with anti-PJP activity are sulfonamides (Zhang et al., 2017). These compounds have been recently approved for the treatment of opportunistic infections. They act by inhibiting the activity of PJP and other pneumococcal and non-pneumocystis jirovecii strains (Kunth-Ribeiro et al., 2016).

Sulfonamide derivatives have been used for many decades as anti-inflammatory drugs. They are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that sulfonamide-based drugs have numerous biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-tumor and anti-proliferative activity (Gupta et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). For instance, sulfonamides have been demonstrated to have an anti-inflammatory and antimycotic effect in vitro against a wide range of pathogens including, but not limited to, bacterial infections, lung cancer, glioblastoma, and experimental carcinoma (Zhao et al., 2014; Pappas et al., 2014).


## Methods
brasiliensis, which were supported by the development of a model of the pathogenic microorganism, . avenacellina (Wickerhamii anthracnose, [28], unpublished data). A detailed analysis of the model is given in Table 2.

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the principles set forth by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German law on the protection of animals. The protocol for the preparation of food and the care and use of the animals were approved by the responsible Federal State authority of the German Republic (Bünde Lebenigke GmbH).

Cell culture
RAW264.7 macrophages (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (200 U/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO_2. In some experiments, DCs were differentiated into macrophages by exposure to the supernatant of medium, which was transferred to the culture media instead of to the macrophages.

In vitro phagocytosis assays
RAW264.7 macrophages were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 5 × 10^5 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO_2. Non-adherent macrophages were removed by washing with DMEM. Fc receptors were blocked by the addition of a 1% non-ionic acid solution (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Macrophages were infected with 1 × 10^6 PFAM-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% CO_2. In some experiments, macrophages were treated with or without 1 mM L-glutamine and 1 µg/ml of propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, St.


## Results
avium infection, the early and late stages of . avium infection were analyzed using the trichothecene and propiconazole treatment. The MICs of the trichothecene and propiconazole were 2.5 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively, and the MICs of the propiconazole were 1.5 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. Both compounds were significantly different in the treatment of M. avium (p<0.05). In the treatment of M. avium, the MICs of the trichothecene and propiconazole were 2.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively, and the MICs of the propiconazole were 2.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. In the early stages of M. avium infection, the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.05) by the trichothecene and propiconazole (p<0.05) but the MpP_2 was inhibited significantly (p<0.


## Discussion
Acridine blue staining was visualized by fluorochrome staining on the pharynx and intra-pharyngeal flui. Acridine blue staining was visualized by fluorescence microscopy on the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice. The results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice, and the pharynx fluid was then found to be secreted from the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid. We therefore hypothesize that Acridine blue staining from the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid could be the result of a T cell activation mediated by Dectin-1.

Acridine blue staining was also visualized by fluorescence microscopy in the intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice. In the intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice, the pharynx fluid was filled with acridine blue staining. The pharynx fluid was then injected with acridine blue staining from the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice. The results of immunofluorescence analysis of the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice, and the pharynx fluid was then found to be secreted from the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid. The results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice. The results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice.

We conclude that in addition to the T cell activation and cytokine production, the T cell response is activated in the presence of acridine blue staining from the pharynx. Furthermore, acridine blue staining from the pharynx and intra-pharynx fluid of infected mice could be the result of a T cell activation mediated by Dectin-1, resulting in Dectin-1 expression.
