## Abstract
The Hyper-immunoglobulin M syndromes (HIGM) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders with diverse clinical manifestations that, although rare, present a very high genetic burden. This review discusses the prevalence, clinical features, risk factors, and treatment options for these patients.


## Introduction
Candida species are generally considered as benign commensals on the skin and mucosal surfaces of healthy individuals but can cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals (Pfaller et al., 2010). Candida glabrata accounts for the majority of these infections, while Candida albicans is responsible for a small proportion of systemic infections. Although both are responsible for most superficial infections, candidiasis can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there are two classes of antifungal drugs, antifungal and iturin, available to treat candidiasis. This class is based on the polyene amphotericin B (AMB), and the imidazole difluoro-tetral (ID) and triazole moiety is the cornerstone of antifungal therapy. In contrast, echinocandins, the second most used class, are still used in the clinic for severe fungal infections (Smith and Read, 2016).

The antifungal activity of the antifungal agents is mostly due to the ability of the cell to resist environmental stress, such as the oxidative damage of the cell membrane and the hydrophobic damage of the cell wall (Davoli et al., 2015). As an example, C. albicans has been found to be able to survive in diverse environments, such as the gut, skin, and mucosal surfaces (Davoli et al., 2015). Microbial species can also grow as yeast cells and are referred to as true hyphae, which are embedded structures in the host cell wall that allow them access to nutrients and water (Davoli et al., 2015).

In addition to their ability to resist environmental stress, Candida albicans also has an extensive arsenal of virulence attributes, such as biofilm formation, resistance to oxidative stress, and biofilm formation. Candida biofilms can be considered as a source of infection because they are present in all tissues and are able to form together with other fungal cells. The species can colonize a variety of tissues in the body and cause diseases, such as systemic or gastrointestinal infections, as well as superficial infections such as oral candidiasis and candidemia (Goutam et al., 2017). Candida biofilms are characterized by their instability, which can change rapidly and dramatically depending on the condition and the immune status of the host.


## Methods
Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed by India ink staining, and Cryptococcus meningitis was diagnosed by culture of serum from cryptococcal antigen positive cultures in the Cryptococcus neoformans culture collection (Cryptococcus neoformans Tumors, ATCC®) using standard Cryptococcus antigen tes.


## Results
Yeast virulence
The killing of A. fumigatus yeast cells was determined after 48 h of incubation at 25°C in the presence of 20 µg/ml of FK506. The growth of A. fumigatus was inhibited by up to 30 µg/ml of FK506, and a significant reduction of virulence was observed when yeast cells were incubated with 25 µg/ml of FK506, compared to the control (P<0.0001). In contrast, all inoculated cells were viable at 20 µg/ml FK506, and the mortality rate was 21% (P<0.0001). The LD_50 value of A. fumigatus was increased by 2.5-fold, and a significant increase was observed when A. fumigatus was incubated with 20 µg/ml FK506 (P<0.0001).

Antifungal activity
The antifungal activity of FK506 and the five other azole antifungal agents is shown in Table 1. The FK506 MICs ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 µg/ml. The MIC_50 and MIC_90 were 8.62 µg/ml, 0.25 µg/ml, 0.5 µg/ml, 0.


## Discussion

In contrast to the lower prevalence of both disease and immunodeficiency in our study, tuberculosis was the most common cause of lung disease, followed by pneumonia, tuberculosis, and Cryptococcu. There are no available data on the occurrence of TB, but the data were limited to respiratory tract infections. This study suggests that the incidence of TB is increasing in Nigeria.

In our study, tuberculosis was the most common cause of pulmonary disease, followed by pneumonia, tuberculosis, and Cryptococcus. The incidence of tuberculosis in our study is comparable to a study conducted in Kuwait, where the incidence of tuberculosis is 9.5% [2]. This finding is consistent with the results of a study conducted in Nigeria, where the incidence of tuberculosis was 11.7% [6]. However, in that study, there was a higher incidence of tuberculosis in patients with severe immunodeficiency, but this was not reflected in the incidence of tuberculosis in our study. We observed that the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.8% in our study. This is consistent with the findings of a study conducted in Uganda, where the incidence of tuberculosis was 20.8% [13]. The incidence of tuberculosis is in the region of 15.0% in our study.

Meningitis was the most common disease among those with AIDS and in this study, the incidence of disease was 21.3% in patients with AIDS. This is comparable to a study conducted in Nigeria, where the incidence of meningoencephalitis was 6.8% [7]. This finding is similar to the findings of a study conducted in the United States, where the incidence of meningoencephalitis was 25.9% [8].

There was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary disease among patients with HIV infection. The incidence of pulmonary disease was 19.2% in our study. This is similar to a study conducted in South Africa, where the incidence of pulmonary disease was 15.6% in HIV-infected adults with AIDS [14]. There were also no significant differences in the incidence of pulmonary disease between patients with HIV infection and those with AIDS. However, this difference was not observed in our study.

There was no significant difference in the incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia in our study. However, pneumocystis pneumonia was the most common disease in patients with HIV infection, with a incidence of 19.1% in our study.
