## Abstract
The resistance of Candida albicans to antifungals including flucytosine, azoles, and echinocandins is a well-recognized clinical feature of this human pathogen. However, the clinical data of the clinical isolates of C. albicans from the settings of oral and vaginal candidiasis are still available, there are still very limited molecular tools for the rapid identification of the C. albicans isolates and in particular, the diversity of the oral candidiasis population was very small.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the oral candidiasis oral isolates from oral and vaginal candidiasis patients and their susceptibility profiles, based on a systematic review of the literature, in order to evaluate the in vivo antifungal efficacy and safety.


## Introduction
Plant growth promoting bacteria (PBLOs) play an important role in promoting human health and protecting the human body from pathogenic diseases. PBLOs are classified as serious pathogenic bacteria by the World Health Organization (WHO) and include gram-negative, non-typhoidal Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteria, and viruses (Enterococci and Mycobacterium) (1). They are considered as opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and can cause serious infections in immunocompromised patients. They also affect the immune system of people with compromised immunity, including people with AIDS, patients with cancer, and transplant recipients (2, 3).

The infection with E. coli is caused by a multidrug resistant (MDR) E. coli strain, which can be isolated from the environment, but not humans (4, 5). The most common route of infection is the respiratory tract. The MDR strain, which has reached epidemic levels, is responsible for almost 200,000 infections annually worldwide (6). MDR strains can survive for long periods in the environment, and subsequently they can spread to the brain, causing meningoencephalitis.


## Methods
The group of patients included in this study was the definition of CD4^+ T cell positive patient. The patients were classified into three groups based on the criteria of their particular diagnoses: (1) the CD4^+ T cell positive patient (CD4+ T cell positive), (2) the CD4^+ T cell negative patient (CD4^+ T cell negative), and (3) the CD4^+ T cell negative patient (CD4^+ T cell positive).

The assessment of the status of the clinical and radiographic parameters was based on the evaluation of the general parameters of the patient. The parameters were: duration of first stroke, the presence of oral and/or oedema, blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, and electrolyte status. The criteria of the classification of the patients were the following: (1) the presence of presence of a hystolic blood pressure of less than 10 mm H_2O; (2) the presence of a hypotonic blood pressure of less than 15 mm H_2O; (3) the presence of a hypotonic heart rate of less than 20 mm H_2O; (4) the presence of a cerebrovascular pressure of less than 20 mm H_2O; and (5) the presence of a leukocyte count greater than 100 cells/Âµl. The patients were divided into two groups based on the following criteria: (1) presence of hypothermia (hypothermia was defined as no hypothermia), (2) hypothermia plus hypothermia, and (3) hypothermia plus hypothermia.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The multiple comparison between groups was performed by Student's t-test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the differences between the groups.

## Discussion
elegans (27, 33-35), and we considered that the OVH1L2 could be used as a reference for other systems where this protein is involved in fungal pathogenicit. In addition, we used the OVH1L2 protein as a drug target to investigate drug-drug interactions and explore the effect of various antifungal drugs on fungal cell wall. OVH1L2 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of FKS1, a known virulence factor in C. albicans (25), as well as to inhibit FKS2, a known virulence factor in C. neoformans (27). The OVH1L2-FKS2 interaction was also studied in C. elegans, in which a drug-drug interaction was demonstrated to be mediated by the OVH1L2 protein (Fig 6). This interaction could be mediated by FKS1, a known virulence factor in C. albicans (27), or FKS2, a known virulence factor in C. neoformans (27). Interestingly, the <U+0394>OVH1L2 mutant failed to grow in the presence of FKS1, suggesting that FKS1 is also an important virulence factor. Although the <U+0394>OVH1L2 mutant did not grow, the OVH1L2 protein was retained in the cell wall, as well as in the plasma membrane, as the <U+0394>OVH1L2 mutant had no detectable increase in cell wall protein. As the <U+0394>OVH1L2 mutant has a greater resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B, and as a result, is resistant to fluconazole, we were not able to perform further studies in C. elegans. In contrast, we found that the <U+0394>OVH1L2 mutant retained the ability to form biofilm structures in response to antifungal treatment, and we determined that this gene is upregulated during the osmotic stress response, indicating that this gene plays a role in osmotic stress resistance and biofilm formation.
