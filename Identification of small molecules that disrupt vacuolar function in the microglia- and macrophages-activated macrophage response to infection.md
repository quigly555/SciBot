## Abstract
The microsomal architecture is the initial step in the evolution of mobile genetic elements. It is generally considered that mobile genetic elements can evolve rapidly, independently of one another and that this can happen in some metazoa and other eukaryotes. In the metazoa, mobile genetic elements are found in a number of genome sizes ranging from ~1 Mb to ~5 Mb. The number of mobile genetic elements found in the genomes of all metazoan species is small compared to the number of known mobile genetic elements. However, among metazoan and eukaryotic genomes, ~7% of the mobile genetic elements are not mobile and this figure has grown more so in the latter sister species, the Plagiomycota, which has an even larger number of genomes. The majority of the mobile genetic elements are found in the protist Trichosporon oleaginosus, which has an even larger number of genomes.


## Introduction
The genus Trametes was established by Vaucluse et al. (2012) to accommodate nine species (Liu et al., 2015), which have been found on various substrates, including bark, spruce, hardwood, and tilia, and recorded as marine or terrestrial invertebrates (Naris, 1981; Li and Talbot, 1987; Korkama and Talbot, 1997; Qiao et al., 2015). The genus Trametes was also recently reported to be associated with four marine invertebrates, namely Malassezia javanica, Trametella lagerianum, Trametella vernicola, and T. lagerianum (Vaucluse et al., 2012). Malassezia javanica is a marine species of the genus Trametes (Franceschini et al., 1974) that is found on bark and spruce of the Argus thallus (Lagerbach et al., 1991; Simoy et al., 1978), the most common substrate used by angler whales in the south of China (Zeng et al., 2016). The marine invertebrate Trametella lagerianum is reported to be associated with the bark of the bark worm, T. lagerianum.

The genus Trametes was originally classified as a marine herbivore and a member of the Trametella genus (Vaucluse et al., 2012). The first species of Trametes was found on a young cocoon of pine in southern France (Vaucluse et al.


## Methods
First, we used a previously described method [38], [39. We used a previously published method [40], [41], [42], [43], [44] to identify microglial protein complexes. Second, we used a previously published method [42], [45] to identify vacuolar proteins in the macrophages-activated macrophage response to infection. Third, we used the previously described methods [38], [39] to identify vacuolar proteins in the macrophages-activated macrophage response to infection. Fourth, we used the previously described methods to identify vacuolar proteins in the macrophages-activated macrophage response to infection. Finally, we used the previously described methods to identify vacuolar proteins in the macrophages-activated macrophage response to infection.

In order to obtain a complete list of compounds identified as vacuolar proteins, we searched the Swiss-Prot database for all compounds, including those from the commercial collection and the highest concentration of each, and those with the highest number of substitutions in the compounds. The list was divided into five groups: (i) chemical compound, (ii) vacuolar protein, (iii) chemical compound, (iv) vacuolar protein, (v) vacuolar protein, (vi) vacuolar protein, and (vii) vacuolar protein. The compound (i) was identified by the highest possible molecular weight values and (ii) vacuolar protein was identified by the lowest molecular weight value of the vacuolar protein. For the prokaryotic compounds, we used the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) method. The molecular weight of vacuolar protein was calculated as the ratio between the m/z of vacuolar protein to the m/z of vacuolar protein of the chemical compound. The concentration of each compound was calculated as the ratio of its concentration to the concentration of the vacuolar protein.

2.6. Interaction Methods
To compare the activity of vacuolar proteins against various types of microglia, we used a previously published method [46]. For this purpose, we used a previously published method to identify vacuolar proteins. In this method, we used a previously published method [48], to analyze the prokaryotic and the plant microglia.


## Results
To identify molecules that disrupt vacuolar function in the microglia-activated macrophage response, we used microglia-activated macrophage microenvironment (MM) to investigate the presence of small molecules that disrupt the vacuolar function of microgli. We isolated and isolated small molecules with anti-VGI activity using an LC-MS/MS method, and confirmed that the isolated molecules were VGI specific. The detection of a few molecules, including those that disrupt vacuolar function and could interfere with the detection of larger molecules such as small molecules with anti-VGI activity, was also confirmed by the LC-MS/MS method (Table 1). These molecules were detected in a wide variety of microglia-activated macrophage microenvironment (MM) that we purified from fresh microglia in order to validate the results of our screen (Table 1).

The following experiments were performed to evaluate whether the specific compounds identified in our screen could interfere with the detection of small molecules with anti-VGI activity in the microglia-activated macrophage response. We first tested the presence of compounds that disrupt vacuolar function and interfered with the detection of large molecules, including those that disrupt vacuolar function (Table 1). We tested the presence of inhibitors of vacuolar function, such as thiabendazim, tetrabenazole, fenpropim, voriconazole, and amikacin (Table 1). As shown in Fig 5A, the presence of inhibitors of vacuolar function can interfere with the detection of large molecules, including inhibitors of the vacuolar function, that disrupt vacuolar function. The presence of inhibitors of vacuolar function can interfere with the detection of small molecules with anti-VGI activity. These inhibitors, such as amikacin, tetrabenazim, or fenpropim, disrupt the function of vacuolar function. We then tested the presence of inhibitors of vacuolar function, such as thiabendazim, tetrabenazim, and amikacin, that disrupt vacuolar function, and these inhibitors, such as amikacin, tetrabenazim, and amikacin, disrupt the function of vacuolar function.


## Discussion
The study of fungal pathogens is vital for the understanding of pathogen-host interactions. In the present study, we analyzed the fungus-host interactions using a mixture of fungal isolates from different clinical and veterinary sources. This approach has led to the identification of potential pathogens in which it is possible to establish the presence of fungal pathogens in the patient. The results obtained in this study showed that the presence of fungal pathogens was strongly associated with the host’s disease, even when isolates were obtained from healthy individuals. This finding is similar to those reported in other studies, where the presence of fungal pathogens was strongly associated with the host’s disease. The results also show that the presence of fungal pathogens in clinical samples was significantly associated with the patient’s disease, even when the patient’s clinical microbiology laboratory was located in a rural area.

In this study, we found that the presence of fungi in the CSF was associated with the presence of fungal pathogens. The presence of fungi in the CSF was significantly associated with the patient’s disease. The results revealed that the presence of fungi was associated with the patient’s disease, even when the patient’s clinical microbiology laboratory was located in a rural area. This finding is similar to the results reported by Sullan and colleagues in the study of pulmonary fungus in humans, who found that the presence of fungi in the CSF was significantly associated with the patient’s disease [14]. The results revealed that the presence of fungi in the CSF was significantly associated with the patient’s disease.
