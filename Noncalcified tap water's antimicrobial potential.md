## Abstract
The most important enzyme in the superoxide dismutase pathway (SOD) is the mainstay of intracellular SOD activity. SOD is found in all major organelles of eukaryotes, is found in all major cell subsets, and is highly expressed in cells that are genetically homogeneous. However, the expression status of this enzyme in various organelles has been reported. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the status of SOD in most major organelles, including the genes, protein structures and mechanism of action of the enzyme. We provide an overview of the use of SOD as a drug target, as drug target, or as a mechanism of selective inhibition in cancer, and we highlight the importance of the gene content of SOD in different tissues. We highlight the evolution of resistance to SOD, the importance of SOD in various diseases, and the importance of the mechanism of action of the enzyme in different tissues.


## Introduction
2015; Shkoukyan et a. 2014; Panchayat et al. 2017) and it was shown to be effective against C. albicans (Barrett et al. 2012; Takagi et al. 2011; Nagahama et al. 2015). It has also been reported to be effective against a wide range of bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter species, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis (Barrett et al. 2012; Izumi et al. 2014; Nagahama et al. 2015; Totonoguchi et al. 2014; Shirakawa et al. 2014; Swisher et al. 2016; Legras et al. 2017). In addition, it has been shown to be effective against the most common pathogenic fungi, namely, C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Candida tropicalis (Miyamoto et al. 2010; Poyama et al. 2015; Toyofuku et al. 2015). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that tap water contains a variety of molecules that can serve as bioactive agents against pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Hata et al. 2010; Baddley et al. 2015; Harunand et al. 2016). However, the mechanisms behind antimicrobial activity of tap water have not been fully elucidated yet.

An important feature of tap water is that microbes can multiply in water. Thus, it is very important to understand the mechanisms behind microbial growth in water. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of growth in water, although some reports indicate that growth can occur in various environments including indoor, outdoor, and even gutters (Agrios et al. 2003; Dafouz et al. 2006; Macpherson et al. 2007; Gao et al. 2013; Scheniro et al. 2014; Rifaat et al. 2016). While the importance of microbial growth in drinking water has been recognized for a long time, the underlying mechanisms driving microbial growth remain poorly understood (Frisch et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2010; Macpherson et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2013; Scheniro et al. 2014). Therefore, the present study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of microbial growth in tap water.


## Methods
The number of bacteria in the medium was randomly selected and a total of 12,000,000 bacteria were teste. The antimicrobial activity was calculated as a ratio of the number of bacteria in the medium to the number of bacteria in the control. A negative control, with control of M. furfur, was also included. The MICs were defined as the lowest concentration of M. furfur that prevented bacterial growth in the medium.

Phenotypic and virulence assays
The methods of molecular biology and chemical analysis of yeast strains and compounds were reported in previous reports [30, 31]. For the molecular characterization of M. furfur yeasts, strains were cultured on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar at 30°C, and after 72 h of incubation, were scraped and washed three times with distilled water. The yeast cells were counted, and the number of viable cells was calculated using the standard curve method. The strain M. furfur was maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) slants at 30°C. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled water, and resuspended in sterile distilled water. The cells were diluted 1:10 in sterile distilled water. For the virulence assay, mice were challenged with 10^6 yeast cells of M. furfur per mouse. The doses of treatments were determined by the sum of the number of mice killed in each time point and the number of mice in the group with the lowest numbers of viable cells.

In order to evaluate the antagonistic effect of the compounds, the M. furfur yeasts were cultivated in the presence or absence of M. furfur for the indicated time points (30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min), at 37°C. In order to evaluate the killing efficiency of the compounds, the yeast cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the specified treatments at 37°C for 24 h and the colony counts were counted after 24 h.

The fungal strains were cultivated in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) slants at 30°C. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. For the bacterial strains, the yeast cells were used for inoculations, and the experiments were conducted in the absence of M. furfur. The experiments were carried out with yeast cells and cells alone.


## Results

Biomass (mainly the biomass) and lipid (mainly the lipid content) are major components in the fungal biomass and lipid productio. In this study, we examined the productivity of crude essential oils (methanol, glycerol, propanol, propanol plus trifluoroacetic acid) from various marine-derived sources. The crude essential oils from different sources were analysed by GC-MS in their high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra. The HRMS spectra of crude essential oils from different sources were recorded and compared to the HRMS spectra of the crude essential oils of the main plant material obtained from other natural sources (Table 1). The results showed that the amounts of these oils increased with the increase in the biomass concentration. Although the amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 1 g/L, it decreased to 0.2 g/L in the oil from the marine feedstock from a Biocalexico DBB, with a concentration of 0.1 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1). The amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 0.5 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1). The amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 1 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1). The amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 0.5 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1). The amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 0.2 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1). The amount of crude essential oils in the dry extract of L. marneffei was highest at 0.2 g/L, which was similar to the amount found in the biodiesel from L. marneffei (Table 1).


## Discussion

To date, there has been no studies to date comparing the antimicrobial activities of the four main waterborne pathogens, namely . albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. The results of this study show that the four most frequent waterborne pathogens have comparable or even higher in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities. This is in line with other studies showing that the antimicrobial activity of the waterborne pathogens (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. albicans) is strongly related to the bacterial population, as shown by the significant decrease in the MIC values of the three waterborne pathogens, C. albicans, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis. These results are in line with a previous study showing that the antimicrobial activity of C. albicans was similar to that of C. parapsilosis [22]. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of C. albicans was not related to the bacterial population, which is in line with previous studies showing that C. albicans is a bacterial dominant species [25].

Similarly to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis is the most common waterborne pathogen. However, the antimicrobial activity of C. parapsilosis was significantly lower than that of C. albicans, which is in line with previous studies showing that C. albicans is a relatively less commensal microorganism, which is in line with the results of previous studies showing that the antimicrobial activity of C. parapsilosis was highly related to the bacterial population [26]. This is in line with the results of previous studies showing that the antimicrobial activity of C. parapsilosis was more related to the bacterial population [27] than to the fungi [28].

The results of the present study showed that the antimicrobial activity of the waterborne pathogens (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. albicans, C. albicans) was significantly lower than that of the fungi (C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. albicans). This difference in the antimicrobial activity of the waterborne pathogens was also found in a previous study [23].
