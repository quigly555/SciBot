## Abstract
In this study, we explored the stability of yeast cells in the presence of copper (CC) and silver (Cu) in the presence of methanol (Mn). In particular, the antifungal activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae against C. albicans was inhibited by both CC and Cu. In a second study, we evaluated the antifungal activity of S. cerevisiae against M. tuberculosis (Mt.) in presence of both copper (Co) and Cu (Cu+) followed by MTB in methanol. Copper-mediated antimicrobial activity was strongly inhibited by Mt. in the methanol-CC interactions. M. tuberculosis co-culture did not increase the bacterial growth or cell density, suggesting that Mt. was the target of copper-mediated antimicrobial activity. In conclusion, we found that the Cu-Co-Mn co-culture did not increase the antibacterial activity of Mt. Instead, Mt. could serve as a target for antifungal activity. The Cu-Co-Mn co-culture did not increase the antibacterial activity of Mt. As a result, Cu-Co-Mn co-culture was not needed for MTB growth in culture. This study demonstrates that Cu-Co-Mn co-culture can be used as a new target for antifungal therapy. Further studies are discussed in this issue.


## Introduction

In general, synthetic fungicides are considered as a promising therapeutic option in agricultural setting. However, in agriculture, synthetic fungicides have a high toxicity and high fungicide-resistant (FB) level (2). Thus, the development of alternative fungicides is imperative (3). In recent years, several promising natural compounds (4-6), which are also active against several pathogenic fungi and bacteria, have been investigated for their antifungal activity (7). However, the antifungal activity of these compounds is still unclear (8).

Sulphonamides are ubiquitous compounds which have been mainly isolated from plant tissues and isolated from plant roots. They are a natural terpenoid derivatives isolated from the bacterium Sulphonapillarius caeruleus and from the plant Syzygium communis (9). Sorghum bhutanensis, a plant pathogenic bacterium, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various ailments (10). However, the therapeutic properties of this compound have been relatively limited. However, phytochemicals such as propyl-but-34-en-3-one, propyl-but-34-en-3-one, and 3-methyl-4,6-diol derivatives have been reported to be effective against various bacteria, fungi, and yeasts (11,12).

In the present study, three types of organic compounds, styrylamides and styrylamide derivatives, were tested for antifungal activity using different combination of triazoles and strobilurins, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of the tetrazole compound tetrazole perchlorate (TATP) was evaluated against various fungal and bacterial strains. The cytotoxic activity of the pentazolone compound pentazolone was investigated. The terpenoid terpenolanum pentazolone was the most active compound and it showed the most effective antifungal activity (f). The plant glycoside hydroxamic acid was reported to be a terpenoid and showed a good fungicidal activity (f). The pentazolone compound octazolone showed a good fungicidal activity (f).


## Methods
fumigatus [17], were also employed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the two exosomal peptides on the fungal strain. The microdilution method described by the CLSI M27-A3 method [18] was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds against A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. niger. MICs were determined as the lowest concentration that produced no growth, while MICs were determined as the lowest concentration that produced no visible growth, while MICs were determined as the lowest concentration that inhibited fungal growth (MIC_50). In addition, for both species, antifungal activity was calculated from the microdilution results (MIC_50) of the compounds as described previously [19]. For each well, 10 µL of a 2-fold dilution series of the crude extract (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well, which was then incubated for 24 h at 35°C. After incubation, the MICs of the compounds were determined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited fungal growth. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined as the lowest concentration that killed 10% of the tested fungal strains. The MFC of the compounds was defined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited fungal growth. The P value was calculated as follows: where C was the concentration of the crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of the tested fungal strains; Y was the concentration of the crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of the tested fungal strains; Q was the concentration of the crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of the tested fungal strains; and X was the concentration of the crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of the tested fungal strains. All of the assays were repeated three times.

## Results
The 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives were also more effective against Aspergillus fumigatus than the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives, although their MICs were lower than those of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivative.

2.2. Evaluation of Antifungal Activity of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing Derivatives against Aspergillus fumigatus
As shown in Table 1, the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives inhibited the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus at the concentrations tested. MICs of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives were comparable to those of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives, but the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives were more effective against Aspergillus fumigatus (Table 1).

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing Derivatives against Aspergillus fumigatus
The MICs of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives against Aspergillus fumigatus were compared to those of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives. MICs of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives were comparable to those of the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives, but the 2-H-D-Glucuronic Acid-Containing derivatives were more effective against Aspergillus fumigatus (Table 1).

## Discussion

Taken together, the results suggest that a long-chain divalent hydroxyl group attached to the hydroxyl group of the a-substituted galactose-5-monooxygenes (A-H-D-Glu(1-4)=A-D-Glu(1-4) group) in the long chain of the fungal ß-(1,3)-glucuronides would inhibit the biosynthesis of A-(1,3)-glucuronide.

In contrast, a long-chain a-substituted mannose-5-monooxygenes (A-H-D-Glu(1-4)=A-D-Glu(1-4) group) attached to the a-substituted galactose-5-monooxygenes (A-H-D-Glu(1-4)=A-D-Glu(1-4) group) in the long chain of the fungal ß-(1,3)-glucuronides (Supplementary Fig S7).

The 2-H-D-Glucuronide Derivatives
The 2-H-D-Glucuronide Derivatives (2-H-D-Glucuronide Derivatives) (Table S8) were isolated and purified from T. virens from H. capsulatum and T. harzianum (Supplementary Fig S9).
