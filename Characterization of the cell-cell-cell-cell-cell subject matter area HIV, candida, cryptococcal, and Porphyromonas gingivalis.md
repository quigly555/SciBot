## Abstract
A new species of Phyllosticta is described based on the morphological characters and a number of molecular characters that have been used for identification in literature to support their congeneric status. Morphological characters include pseudostictic basidiospores and basidiocephaly, basidial masses, and aseptate basidiospores. Phylogenetic analyses based on a combined sequence dataset of the nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rDNA region database, as well as data from other reported PhyloGynology species, are provided to support the identification of Phyllosticta as a new species.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus has been reported in 85% of cases and the highest mortality rate reported is 15-25%. Most cases are caused by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells, although other Cryptococcus species may also be involved [1].

The infection starts with the inhalation of aerosolized yeast cells of the environmental yeast variety Cryptococcus gattii. The most common species found in the environment are C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans. Individuals with these two species are opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised hosts. The environmental yeast variety is generally found in soil, especially in pigeon droppings, decaying wood, vegetables and fruits.


## Methods

Ethical statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of São Paulo, with approval number CCTC-13-01-B, and by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Medicina, Department of Medical Sciences, University of São Paulo, with approval number CCTC-13-01-. The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation, approved by the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (protocol number 2014/11/2014). The animals were humanely euthanized with CO_2 and their lungs and brains were collected. The lungs, brains, and kidneys were homogenized with 0.5 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10 µl of each was serially diluted in PBS and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The fungal burden was then determined. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the animal model and was performed in the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), University of São Paulo, Federal University of São Paulo (protocol number 17.12.2016), under the protocol number B.190. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of São Paulo, Federal University of São Paulo, under the protocol number B.170.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing
The antifungal activities of the tested agents were determined on the basis of their ability to inhibit Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis in vitro. The assays were conducted according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [20].

In vitro susceptibility testing
The susceptibility of the tested drugs to Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis was evaluated by the MIC assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [20].

In vitro susceptibility testing
The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [20].


## Results
We performed a first-order multiple cell-cell cell (CFCC) analysis (Figure 2. This analysis was based on the CFCC values for the subjects and focused on the cell-cell-cell-cell-cell cell cell (CFCC) area for both HIV-infected and non-infected subjects. For both the subject and the CFCC results, we found similar results (Figure 2A). The cell-cell-cell-cell cell (CFCC) area for the non-infected subjects was significantly (P<0.001) higher than the HIV-infected subjects, but there were no significant differences in the CFCC values for the HIV-infected subjects (P<0.001). We also found a significant difference in the CFCC values for the cryptococcal subjects (P<0.001). However, we did not observe a difference in the CFCC values for the candida subjects (P<0.001).

Based on the CFCC results, we then performed a second-order multiple cell cell (CFCC) analysis to determine whether the increased cell-cell-cell-cell cell-cell cell area represents the cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell cell (CFCC) area. We found that the cell-cell-cell-cell-cell cell-cell cell-cell cell (CFCC) area was significantly higher (P<0.001) for both the HIV-infected and non-infected subjects (Figure 2B). However, there were no significant differences in the CFCC values for both the candida and cryptococcal subjects (P<0.001). The differences in the CFCC values for the candida and cryptococcal subjects were not statistically significant.

The cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell cell (CFCC) area for the HIV-infected and non-infected subjects was significantly (P<0.001) higher than the CFCC value for the HIV-infected subjects, but there were no significant differences in the CFCC values for the HIV-infected subjects (P<0.001). These results are consistent with the CFCC results for the cryptococcal subjects.


## Discussion
neoformans cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell structure was first characterized by the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the cell surface of the fungu.
