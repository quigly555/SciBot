## Abstract
The high prevalence and abundance of bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics, the expansion of resistance to antimicrobial resistance, and the expanding spectrum of resistance to antimicrobial resistance highlight the need for the development of new and efficient approaches to combat food spoilage and infections. Among the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), peptides bearing amino acid sequences identical to those conserved in the bacterial cell walls, and with amino acid repeats from other fungi, fungi, bacteria, and parasites, we present evidence that these peptides can act as alternate and alternative sensors of environmental and host stress. We also report a novel mechanism that suggests promising applications for the use of AMPs as natural and sustainable defense agents against spoilage and infection by a panel of over 35 bacteria, fungi, and parasites.

Food spoilage and infections are important problems for food security, particularly for spoilage and infection by multidrug-resistant organisms.


## Introduction
The most extensive and important collection of African fungi is the collection of the genus Rhizobium [6. Rhizobium species can be found in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of Africa and Asia, with only few exceptions [7]. Rhizobium species are also found in subtropical and temperate regions of Africa and Asia [7,8,9].

Rhizobium spp. have been used as herbicides in several countries and are commonly found on fresh and salt water collected in these regions [8,10]. The majority of these species are phytopathogenic and are considered opportunistic pathogens. However, several species are associated with serious human health problems. The most serious disease is black spot, caused by Rhizobium, on the skin and mucous membranes of humans, and can kill the animals quickly [11]. The disease is transmitted by the inhalation of spores or mycelia from the environment. Infected animals may become sick from the inhalation of spores, leading to the development of skin lesions [12].

Rhizobium spp. are known to produce toxins of varying degrees of toxic potency, such as trehalose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and o-d-d-gluconate, which are toxic to mammalian cells. The mycelia of Rhizobium spp. produce enormous amounts of trehalose with a half-life of approximately 300 days [13]. Trehalose produced by the trehalose production by Rhizobium spp. can be recognized by their trehalose-binding proteins (tTreHp) and can be used as a marker for the expression of virulence-related genes in fungi [14].

Trimoxazole is a fluorinated triazole with a half-life of about 300 days and is one of the most widely used triazoles, with over 50 accepted applications in the clinical practice in the United States, Europe and Australia [15,16]. Triazole derivatives, such as clotrimoxazole and pyrimidinedione, are also commonly used as triazole derivatives.


## Methods
From each of the seven sites, seven individuals from each community were selecte. The locations were chosen to represent their geographical origins and the diversity of the original studies, in order to avoid biases associated with the study of the 'diverse communities'. All the samples were collected in the field, in the field of one single plant material from each community (Cousine, albany, Congo, Sudan, St. Louis, Minnesota, USA).

DNA Extraction and PCR Amplification of ITS1, ITS2, and ITS4
Genomic DNA was extracted from three individual samples of Ruandaiaolia from a single tree (Cousine and Stearns, unpublished data). PCR amplification was performed with the M-MLV Plant DNA Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers ITS1 (5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTTGCGG-3’) and ITS4 (5’-CTGCGTTCTTCATTTAGAGAGAATGC-3’) were used to amplify the LSU and ITS regions of the rDNA regions of the clone of each species, respectively. The PCR products were purified using the M-MLV Plant DNA Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was sequenced on an ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.1 (PerkinElmer, Norwood, CA, USA) and analysed with the Bioedit software version 7.0.5.1 (Hall, 1999). The sequences of the primers are listed in Table 1. The sequences of the ITS and LSU primers were checked for correct identity with the GenBank database and verified by the NCBI database. The PCR products were purified by using the M-MLV Plant DNA Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Fungal DNA was extracted using the Fungal DNA Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). The PCR products were purified and sequenced on an ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.1 (PerkinElmer, Norwood, CA, USA). The DNA was sequenced on an ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.


## Results
Both Proteobacteria and Fungal Community members were underrepresented in the soil microbial diversity (Figure 2. Both soil microbial diversity and soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal diversity and soil fungal community members in the Proteobacteria community. Both soil fungal diversity and soil fungal community members were underrepresented in the soil fungal community. However, for the Proteobacteria and Fungal Community members, soil fungal community members were underrepresented in the soil fungal community. In addition, Fungal Community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community.

Fungal Community Members in the Proteobacterial Community
A total of 3,214 (1.7%) soil fungi were identified in the soil fungal community in both seasons, whereas there were 1,686 (0.1%) fungi identified in the Proteobacterial Community. Amongst the Fungal Community members, there were 497 (0.5%) species identified in both seasons. As shown in Table 2, Fungal Community members had a more diverse soil microbial community than the Proteobacteria and Fungal Community members. Fungal Community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. There were 9,973 species identified in the soil fungal community in both seasons, whereas there were 16,324 species identified in the Proteobacterial Community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community.

Fungal Community Members in the Proteobacterial Community
Fungal Community members were more likely to have a bacterial community member in both seasons. Fungal Community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. The soil fungal community members were underrepresented in soil fungal community. Fungal Community Members were underrepresented in soil fungal community.


## Discussion
The significant decrease in the incidence of fungal diseases from 2006 to 2014 was attributable to the increase in the use of antifungal agents. These agents caused severe diseases such as the dissemination of Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal-resistant fungi causing fungal diseases in Vietnam. This is a relatively new observation based on previous studies.

While it is well known that a decrease in fungal burden and a marked increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections are associated with an increase in the use of antifungal agents, the molecular basis of fungal infections is still unknown. The few reports in the past decade of antifungal-resistant fungi causing invasive fungal diseases in Vietnam have been attributed to the use of antifungal agents, rather than to a lack of specific antifungal agent resistance [25, 26]. We observed that there was no difference in the incidence of fungal infections between 2006 and 2013, which could be attributed to the use of antifungal agents. However, the incidence of invasive fungal infections in 2013 was more than that in 2006, which could be due to the increased use of antifungal agents in the present study. Our data also suggested that the incidence of invasive fungal infections was increased in 2013. This is consistent with previous studies from Vietnam. The present study was conducted in a large population with a low frequency of immunocompromised patients.
