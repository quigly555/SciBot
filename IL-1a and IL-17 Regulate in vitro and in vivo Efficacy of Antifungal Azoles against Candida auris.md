## Introduction
The emergence of antibiotic resistance in various microbial pathogens is a global problem that requires a thorough understanding of the evolution of the resistance mechanisms. However, the development of resistance in microbial pathogens is often understudied. In fact, the increasing use of non-culture sterilized (i.e., ionizing) fluids such as ethanol, glycerol, ethyl alcohol, and/or sodium chloride has fueled the demand for safer alternative microbial sterilized fluids such as glycerol or ethyl alcohol. In the last two decades, this concept has attracted increasing attention [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Glycerol has been used in commercial applications, such as wastewater treatment, and it is commonly used to sterilize water and oil [8,9]. The main component used in glycerol-based bioconversion is acetic acid, and the value of this molecule is well-known [8,10,11]. The antioxidant properties of glycerol are well-known in the literature, and some studies have shown that glycerol has a good activity against a wide range of bacterial strains including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [12,13,14,15,16,17,18].


## Methods
albicans, . dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, and C. tropicalis) were analyzed in vitro. Data were analyzed using the software package Cytoscape^TM v7.6.2 (http://www.cytoscape.org/).

In vitro Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the E. coli strain WP-2401, a clinical isolate isolated from a newborn infant, was determined by the antimicrobial activity of the E. coli strain WP-2401 on the mycelial growth of C. albicans (Sigma-Aldrich). WP-2401 was grown at 37°C in 200 ml of the complete media in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm for 24 h. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with sterile distilled water. The suspension was adjusted to 10^7 CFU/ml using sterile distilled water and 10% of the cell concentration was used for drug preparation. The mycelial powder (2 g) was added to 200 ml of Eppendorf E-200S (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C. The mycelia were then harvested by filtration and washed with sterile distilled water. Then, the mycelia were harvested by filtration and washed with sterile distilled water. The suspension was adjusted to 10^6 CFU/ml using the method described by Nirenberg et al. [11]. After that, the mycelia were washed with sterile distilled water and the concentrations of the drugs were measured by HPLC (Dionex LC 1200, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) using an UltiMate 3000 LC system (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The data were analyzed using the software package Cytoscape^TM v7.6.2 (http://www.cytoscape.org/).

In vitro Antifungal Activity
The in vitro antifungal activity of the E. coli strain WP-2401, a clinical isolate isolated from a newborn infant, was determined by the anti-fungal activity of the E.


## Results
Heterogeneity of bacterial communities in the HNPC
To study the diversity of bacterial communities in the HNPC, the bacterial communities of the surface and endothelium samples were first examined. As shown in Figure 1, the surface and the endothelium samples were in a similar group.


## Discussion
This work builds on the concept of the model for filamentation in H. capsulatum, in which filamentation is initiated by a single type of host defense response. Our results demonstrate that H. capsulatum can effectively suppress the host defense response and complete the cycle at a rate that is comparable to other fungi. While the importance of host defense to filamentation in H. capsulatum has been demonstrated previously, this is the first description of H. capsulatum as a pathogen. The current study extends our understanding of the role of the host defense response in fungal pathogenesis, revealing that H. capsulatum has the potential to be used for further development as a novel pathogen.

We identified H.
