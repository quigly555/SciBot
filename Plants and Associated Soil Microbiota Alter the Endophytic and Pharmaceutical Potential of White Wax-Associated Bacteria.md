## Abstract
Opportunistic fungal infections (OFIs) are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality.


## Introduction
Currently, the most common method to control fungal infections is through chemical fungicides, such as strobilurins and tannins [13,14. Bacterial pathogens also use the host’s immune response to establish an infection [15]. Because of their antifungal resistance, a number of compounds have been developed as antifungal agents [16,17]. In addition, the development of new antifungal agents, such as polyenes, which bind to the fungal cell wall, could be used as an efficient treatment for fungal infections. Thus, there is a growing interest in the development of new antifungal agents that can be used in the treatment of fungal infections. In this sense, the recent developments in the field of drug development have resulted in the search of new compounds that may act in synergy and may act synergistically with existing antifungals. For instance, cholinesterase inhibitors such as cephalosporin, echinocandins, and azoles may act as antifungals against mycobacterial infections [18,19].

Cephalosporins are structurally related to ß-cyclodextrin (CD) and cholinergic antifungals. CD is the main antifungal protein, which consists of a linear ß-1,3-glucan, an enzyme that produces a calcium channel, and a calmodulin (Cnb) that binds to proteins and blocks their synthesis. Cnb is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that binds to ß-cyclodextrins and monofunctionally binds ß-cyclodextrins with the best binding properties [20]. Cnb is a cyclodextrins-binding protein that binds mainly to the immunoglobulin class I (IgG-I) [21,22]. On the other hand, IgG-I is a cyclodextrins-binding protein that binds mainly to class II antifungals and is found in all classes of antifungals [23]. Cnb binds mainly to class I antifungals and is a member of the class III antifungals.


## Methods
Plant material was carefully removed and washed with distilled water to remove traces of organic solven. To remove the solvent from the soil surface, water was added to the soil. The soil was washed with distilled water to remove soil organic matter. The soil organic matter (SOP) was extracted from the organic matter with a hexane:methanol (95:5) method and the solvent was removed using a chloroform:methanol (95:5) method. The total organic matter (TOC) was extracted from the TOC with hexane:methanol (95:5) method and the solvent was removed using a chloroform:methanol (95:5) method. The soil P. luteus (CBS 278.49) was used as a reference of the endophytic and medicinal plant of P. luteus. The fungal biomass was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). The soil P. luteus (CBS 278.49) was also used as a reference of the endophytic and medicinal plant of P. luteus.

2.2. Test Method
The antimicrobial activity of each of the extract and the solvent extracts of P. luteus were tested against the bacterial strains P. aeruginosa (ATCC 76213) and E. coli (ATCC 25922). The antifungal activity of the solvent extract of P. luteus was also tested against E. coli (ATCC 25922). The antimicrobial activity of the solvent extract of P. luteus was also tested against A. fumigatus (ATCC 208821) and S. cerevisiae (ATCC 90112). The antimicrobial activity of the solvent extract of P. luteus was also tested against C. albicans (ATCC 90028). The antimicrobial activity of the solvent extract of P. luteus was also tested against S. cerevisiae (ATCC 90028) and A. fumigatus (ATCC 90028).

2.3. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the solvent extract of P. luteus against C.


## Results
To validate that the soil bacterial community in Georgia is structurally and ecologically similar to the soil microbial community in California, we extracted bacterial community from the soil samples and used G-value-based clustering to determine the bacterial populations in the soi. A total of 37 isolates were isolated from the soil samples and assigned to the 34 bacterial genera listed in the GenBank (Table 1). In total, the frequency of 16 genera in the bacterial communities in the soil samples was similar to the bacterial community in Georgia. In addition, 16 genera were common in all samples and were common only in the California soil (Table 1).

Based on these results, we hypothesized that the soil bacterial community in California is a unique community in which only a few of the soil bacteria can survive the stress of the industrial dust environment. The lack of diversity in the soil bacterial community in California may also reflect a unique diversity in the soil microbial community. However, our analyses suggest that the soil bacterial community in California is not a typical microbial community in which the abundance of a broad host range is expected. Therefore, we suggest that the soil bacterial community in California may be a new ecological concept or an emerging source of environmental information for pharmaceutical applications.

The Enterobacteriaceae Family Is Required for Antifungal Activity
The Enterobacteriaceae family is the major phylum of the soil microbial community in California [28]. The Enterobacteriaceae family is characterized by having nine essential genes, which are involved in the cell cycle, the cell wall, the vacuole, and the membrane, and the virulence mechanisms [29, 30]. These essential genes include the cAMP-PKA pathway, the O-PKA pathway, the ergosterol pathway, the pyruvate metabolism pathway, the pyruvate assimilation pathway, and the sodium and nitrite metabolism pathway. The Enterobacteriaceae family also includes a number of virulence factors, including the virulence factors for Candida species, the key virulence factors for various pathogenic microorganisms, and the adhesins, which are secreted to prevent infection, resistance to antifungals, and to antibiotic resistance.


## Discussion
The finding that the endophytic Bacteroidetes was more abundant in the endophytic white wax is in line with that of the natural killer Bacteroides fragilis, which was found more abundant in the wax of the white wax [16. However, we did not find a clear association between the abundance of Bacteroidetes and the endophytic lifestyle of B. fragilis. The presence of this bacterium, B. fragilis, in the wax of the natural wax of the Japanese oak was a result of the production of a toxin by the bacterium [17]. It was found in the wax of the bark and leaf of many trees in Japan, where the production of this toxin was first reported [18]. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in the endophytic black wax of the native species of bark and leaf of the Japanese oak is not surprising. The different characteristics of the endophytic lifestyle of B. fragilis may be related to the morphological and chemical characteristics of the endophytic black wax, the amount of plant material, and the nature of the bioactive compounds and fungicides used.

The effects of the plant species on the endophytic bioactive compounds may be associated with the endophytic lifestyle of the fungus. The bioactive compounds from the bark and leaf of the Japanese oak are multifactorial, and a direct effect of the bark and leaf species could be due to the bioactive compound production by the fungus and to the difference in the quality of the plant material. Therefore, the influence of the bark and leaf species on the endophytic bioactive compounds could be linked to the difference in the quality of the plant material and the nature of the bioactive compounds.

The results of our study also showed that the bioactive compounds produced by the fungus and the bioactive compounds produced by the B. fragilis were associated with the bioactive compounds in the bark and leaf of the tree species, which are consistent with those reported in the literature [19]. However, we also found that the bioactive compounds produced by the fungus were associated with the bioactive compounds in the bark and leaf of the Japanese oak, which indicates that the bioactive compounds produced by the fungus could be responsible for the bioactive compounds in the bark and leaf of the tree species.
