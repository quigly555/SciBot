## Abstract
The species distribution of black yeasts is characterised by a spectrum of genetic diversity between strains, many of which are from distinct taxa, each of which has its own genetic profile. This diversity, together with the different strains and genomes of other fungi, is an asset for biodiversity assessments because it allows us to estimate the relative sizes of different fungal populations, rather than the sizes of taxa that would have been targeted to develop a taxonomic approach.

The species distribution of black yeasts is characterised by a spectrum of genetic diversity between strains, many of which are from distinct taxa, each of which has its own genetic profile. This diversity, together with its sizes of different fungal populations, makes this genome-wide barcode of fungi a useful resource for biodiversity assessments. We estimated that the average size of the black yeasts genome is 1.2 Mb, and that the average number of predicted genes per strain is 1.3. We found that most black yeasts genes are shared between several taxa and that there is a large proportion of the shared genes between yeasts from different kingdoms and geographic regions. We showed that the average number of yeast genomes per strain is 1.7 Mb, and that these are significantly different genomes. The average number of genes per yeast species is 1.3 Mb and that these are significantly different genomes. The average number of genes per yeast species in two different kingdoms is 1.6 Mb and that these are significantly different genomes. We showed that the average number of genes per yeast species in three different kingdoms is 1.7 Mb and that these are significantly different genomes. We determined the overall genome sizes of five black yeasts by performing the MCMCABACP gene cluster analysis and using a genome size of 1.4 Mb, and using a genome size of 1.


## Introduction
With the development of the eukaryotic cell as an organelle that maintains a constant state of energy, the cellular energy demands are continuously increased. It is estimated that, in the case of cancerous cells, the daily energy demands of cancer patients are nearly 12,000 kcal/kg (Vittorio et al., 2009). In addition, cell metabolism and recycling is a key part of the cell maintenance (Park et al., 2009; Carrasco-Santos et al., 2015). These physiological requirements lead to the activation of a large number of proteins, including autophagy-related proteins (ATPases), in response to different environmental conditions. At present, the major ATPases involved in autophagy are the mammalian mitochondrial ATPase (MATA) subunit Mga1, the eukaryotic ATPase-encoding gene MobA1, and the mitochondrial iron permease Mga2 (Santos et al., 2014). ATPases, which are not specific for specific substrates, are activated by the addition of ATP to the cytoplasmic organelles and can therefore be activated by extracellular signals in various steps (Vittorio et al., 2009).

ATPases can be classified into different subgroups, according to their mechanism of action. In the mitochondria, ATPases form complexes with extracellular cargoes and are activated by different signals including extracellular ATP, ROS, and Pi (Anujam et al., 2013; Anujam et al., 2016). The intracellular cargoes can act as the stress signals or as effectors by mediating cellular responses that promote mitochondria growth and survival. Mitochondria can also be activated by signals from the outside, such as xenobiotic stimuli, metabolic disturbance, and pathogens (Vittorio et al., 2009). The external signals include xenobiotics, such as hypoxia, oxidants, and heat shock (Hustad et al., 2010).


## Methods
For each assay, 200 µL of a 5 × 10^4 conidia/mL suspension of the wild-type (WT) and the respective control (CZ) were inoculated into 50 mL of YPD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) and incubated at room temperature for 4 . A final concentration of 1% Bacto-yeast extract was added. The cultures were then incubated at 30°C for 30 min.

## Results
First, the transcription factor response element, the adaptor protein SreA, has been shown to have direct and conserved roles in oxidative stress response and fungal pathogenicity [16. However, the transcription factor response element was also identified as being a candidate gene in the search for genes whose expression is dependent on oxidative stress in the host [17]. These findings suggest that the transcription factor response element might be involved in the regulation of fungal pathogenicity. Indeed, the transcription factor response element was identified in a number of previously described genes involved in oxidative stress response [18-21] and in the regulation of fungal pathogenicity [15]. The transcription factor response element is also found in several genes involved in the regulation of other processes such as the regulation of immune cell, stress response, and virulence [22,23]. A number of genes encoding enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, including the ABC transporter HapX and the ABC transporter ABC-2, have been identified as being transcription factors. A number of genes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, including the ABC transporter ABC-3, also have been identified as being transcription factors. Furthermore, genes involved in detoxification of heat shock protein, heat shock protein, and heat shock protein were also identified as being transcription factors.

A total of 17 genes were identified as being transcription factors by the Fungal Gene Ontology (Fungo) software (Table 2). The Fungo software uses a protein-protein interactions (PFA) matrix to identify PFA networks that are involved in fungal virulence, which can lead to the identification of PFA networks in fungi. These networks are used to identify and predict network topology and network integrity. It has been shown that a number of PFA networks have been found in fungi [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The analysis of the Fungal Gene Ontology (FunGO) enrichment analysis revealed that the most enriched genes were involved in the biosynthesis of carbon sources, such as glycerol, glycerol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glycerophosphatidylinositol isomerase. The most enriched genes were involved in the transport of glycerol and glycerophosphatidylinositol, which were also identified in the FunGO analysis.


## Discussion
As a consequence, gene expression of fungal virulence genes (. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans) was induced by two-factor RNAi, and genes involved in oxidative stress response and fungal pathogenicity (C. glabrata) were also induced by two-factor RNAi. In contrast, the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus were induced by two-factor RNAi, and gene expression of the genes involved in oxidative stress response was induced by two-factor RNAi (Table S1).

Interestingly, a similar pattern of transcriptional response was observed for genes involved in stress response and pathogenicity (Table S1). For instance, in S. cerevisiae, genes involved in stress response, response to oxidative stress, and fungal pathogenicity (Table S1) are upregulated when the fungus grows in the medium containing pentose phosphate (PTPH). In C. neoformans, upregulation of genes involved in stress response was observed in response to PTPH, in response to stress conditions, and in response to cell wall-degrading agents, in response to oxidative stress, and in response to cell wall-degrading agents (Table S1).

The three-factor RNAi treatments also induced transcriptional responses in C. neoformans and C. gattii, which are plant-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi, respectively. In C. neoformans, genes involved in stress response and pathogenicity were upregulated, and the gene expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response was induced in response to PTPH, in response to cell wall-degrading agents, and in response to cell wall-degrading agents (Table S1).

A similar pattern was observed for the genes involved in stress response, pathogenicity, and fungal virulence. In C. neoformans, upregulation of genes involved in stress response, pathogenicity, and fungal virulence was observed, and the genes involved in stress response and pathogenicity were upregulated (Table S1).

The genes involved in stress response were also induced in C. gattii, which is a plant pathogen, and the genes involved in stress response and pathogenicity were upregulated (Table S1).
