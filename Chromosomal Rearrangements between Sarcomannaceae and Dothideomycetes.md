## Abstract
Background: A variety of sialic acid (SI) inhibitors have been recently introduced into clinical practice, but the toxicity of various sialo acids in the clinical setting has been their contribution in toxicity and the scientific literature on SIIs remains sparse.

Methods: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with clinically insignificant infections were included in this study. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the etiology of SIIs and safety of the included patients. Associations were established between SIIs and prescribed sialic acid (SI).


## Introduction
The lineage separating the three Dothideomycetes has been thoroughly studied in the literatur. There is a great deal of interest in the lineage that includes the Cudra, C. lusitaniae, and Dothideomycetes. However, there is little information available in the literature about the Dothideomycetes.

2. The genus Sarcomannaea (also known as Cudra and C. lusitaniae) was proposed by Bachewich et al. (2012) based on the features of the ascoma, the phialides, and phialides without the pyriform or centromeres. The phialides are typical of the Dothideomycetes and are characterized by the presence of a stilbene-convex, the presence of multiple conidia and ascospores, and the presence of a stromata in the peridium (Bachewich et al., 2012, 2013, 2014).

3. The genus Dothideomycetes is characterized by the presence of two phialides, one cytoplasmic and one aculeate. The phialides are thought to be specific to the Cudra and Dothideomycetes (Chen et al., 2011, 2013), with some exceptions including C. glabrata and C. lusitaniae. The aculeate are found in the stromatic complex and are found in the stroma and ascospores of Cudra and Dothideomycetes (Santos et al., 2008, 2009, Cázares et al., 2010).

4. Sarcomannaea is the most important phytopathogenic fungus on rice (Santos et al., 2008, 2009, Cázares et al., 2010, 2012). It can infect a wide variety of hosts including cabbage, cauliflower, sweet potato, and tomato (Díez and Cabral, 2000, Quijada et al., 2006, Ramírez et al., 2006, Ramírez-Garcia et al., 2015). Sarcomannaea is also a primary pathogen of latex grapes (Martínez-Santos et al., 2008, Quijada et al., 2009), the most important crop in Mexico (Martínez-Santos et al.


## Methods
Genome sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The sequencing data was deposited in NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number SRP06658. The accession numbers for the fungal genomes are listed in Table 1.

Phylogenetic analysis
The taxonomic groups of the selected fungi were selected based on previous studies (Cantón et al. 2015), using a bootstrap method with 1000 replicates (bootstrap value = 50% for the concatenated datasets). The phylogenetic trees were visualized in Figtree v1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).


## Results
The highest-order AM and OCA/DA sequences showed high similarity to each other, and the OCA/DA sequences were concordant with those of the AM and OCA/DA sequences, respectivel. In the AM sequences, the Dothideomycetes was clearly separated from the AM sequences (Figure 2). The OCA/DA sequences were the most similar to the AM sequences, with Dothideomycetes and AM sequences being in different positions and not well-conserved. The OCA/DA sequences were not well-conserved, but were well-supported in both trees, suggesting that these sequences were in common. The AM and OCA/DA sequences were similar in the RAxML tree, but the AM and OCA/DA sequences were not well-conserved. The Dothideomycetes tree showed high similarity to the AM and OCA/DA sequences, with the AM and OCA/DA sequences being in different positions and not well-conserved.

The ARPT trees revealed the presence of a single clade with a high support value (Figure 3). The ARPT trees revealed that the AM and OCA/DA sequences of Dothideomycetes were clustered together with the AM and OCA/DA sequences. The AM and OCA/DA sequences were well-supported in the RAxML tree, but the AM and OCA/DA sequences were not well-conserved in the RAxML tree. The AM and OCA/DA sequences of Dothideomycetes were in well-conserved positions and not well-supported in the RAxML tree.

The Dothideomycetes, AM and OCA/DA sequences were well-supported in both trees, but the AM and OCA/DA sequences were not well-conserved in the RAxML tree. The Dothideomycetes sequences of AM and OCA/DA sequences were in well-conserved positions and not well-supported in the RAxML tree. The OCA/DA sequences of AM and OCA/DA sequences were in well-conserved positions and not well-supported in the RAxML tree.

The Bayesian trees of the RAxML tree revealed a monophyletic group (Figure 4).


## Discussion
2016a, 2018), has been isolated from different species of the genu. The genus Pseudoboxifolia contains two distinct species, Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1 and Pseudoboxifolia sp. 2, which belong to the genus Pseudoboxifolia, respectively. Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1 and Pseudoboxifolia sp. 2, which belong to the genus Pseudoboxifolia, respectively, have been reported from the stem and are morphologically similar to Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1 and Pseudoboxifolia sp. 2, respectively. In addition, the genus Pseudoboxifolia contains three genera, namely Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1, Pseudoboxifolia sp. 2, and Pseudoboxifolia sp. 3, which belong to the genus Pseudoboxifolia. The new genus Pseudoboxifolia is characterized by the presence of two distinct species-R. millefolium and R. vermiformis, which are highly similar to R. millefolium, respectively. Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1, R. vermiformis, and R. vermiformis have also been reported from the stem and are morphologically similar to R. millefolium and R. vermiformis. Pseudoboxifolia sp. 2, R. vermiformis, and R. vermiformis have been reported from the stem and are morphologically similar to R. millefolium and R. vermiformis. The new genus Pseudoboxifolia is characterized by the presence of four species-R. millefolium, R. millefolium, R. vermiformis, and R. vermiformis, which are closely related to R. millefolium. Pseudoboxifolia sp. 1, R. millefolium, R. vermiformis, and R. vermiformis, respectively, has been reported from the stem and are morphologically similar to R. millefolium and R. vermiformis. The genus Pseudoboxifolia includes species in several genera, including R. millefolium, R.
