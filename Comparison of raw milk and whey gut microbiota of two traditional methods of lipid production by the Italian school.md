## Abstract
The dimorphic transition from the yeast to the filamentous form of growth is fundamental to the biology of metazoa, and is linked to several aspects of physiology and/or developmental biology. Morphological switching is a common and widespread phenomenon in the fungi and metazoa that has been widely studied over the last three decades. Current understanding of the molecular processes underpinning the development of metazoa and their connection to metabolic and developmental switches is based on studies of the basidiomycete Ascomycota, while many other taxa have been studied, primarily in the dimorphic phase, such as the protist Podospora anomala. To date, very little is known about the developmental and metabolic processes underpinning the development of metazoa and their connection to metabolic and metabolic switch. In this study we present an overview of the published metabolomic data from different metazoan species and present results from studies of the metazoan, Trichosporon porosum, and the yeast-like fungi Kabatiella vedroni and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. We provide an overview of the metabolic and metabolic pathways in both fungi and yeasts, and show that metabolic changes that occur during development can directly affect the structure and function of the host plant. These metabolic changes can be driven either by metabolic enzymes or by metabolic mechanisms that have evolved to overcome the limitations of the cell wall of the host.


## Introduction
Fungi are the leading cause of disease in humans. In fact, over the past two decades, the number of fungal infections caused by fungi has dramatically increased and the number of new fungal infections is increasing. Over 1.7 billion people worldwide are affected by fungal diseases and approximately 1.5 million new fungal infections are reported each year.

The most common fungal pathogens are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. C. albicans causes superficial mucosal and/or community mycoses in over 200,000 people each year, and the most common manifestation is an oral infection caused by C. glabrata (1). In the case of infection by C. glabrata, the same mechanisms as in C. albicans are involved. In the case of C. albicans, the action of the “suspect” strategy is to isolate and culture the organism from the oral cavity. This strategy is relatively simple, and the results are good. However, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the culture method for identifying C. albicans are very low, and it is very difficult to detect and isolate those fungi that are not coniothyriine.


## Methods

The methods used in the present study included culturing feed-stock of different milk and whey forms, and incubating the feedstock at 37 °C in 20% (v/v) glycero. The animals were monitored for body weight and humanely killed when they reached the end of their experimental period.

The process of culturing of feedstock was performed according to the methods described by the traditional method of fermentation. The test for the virulence of each strain was performed in an animal-free lab, using 16-weeks-old male BALB/c mice. The experiments were performed in three independent groups, with four mice each.

2.3. General Procedure for the Analysis of the Wound Culture
The wound culture method was used to determine the wound-associated microbes in the gut microbiota of the mice. Briefly, 10-week-old female BALB/c mice were used for each treatment. The wound-associated microbes were isolated from the gut of the mice by inoculating 10 µl of freshly obtained mycelium (1 × 10^6 CFU mL^-1) on the surface of the wound of the mice by a sterile swab. The animals were then transferred to sterile plastic containers for 3 days in order to collect the microbial pellet. The samples were then kept at -20 °C for 72 h, and the microbial pellet was used for further analysis.

2.4. Statistical Analysis
The data obtained for the bacterial and fungal analysis in the gut microbiota were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test (GraphPad Prism version 5.00. For the statistical analyses, the statistical method was used in SPSS (version 17.0).

2.5. Selection Criteria for Microbial Characterization
The selection criteria for the microbial characterization in the gut microbiota was used for the microbiome profiling in the mice. In brief, the microbial species were analyzed based on their morphological characteristics. The microbes were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Three different bacterial species were selected for the experiment: Enterobacterium spp. (Rhodotorula spp.), Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.

## Results
The results are shown in Table . Although the fermentation of raw milk was relatively efficient, the bacterial load in the dairy product was significantly lower compared to the dry milk. The raw milk had an average 16.5 log CFU ml^-1 of lactobacilli and 16.7 log CFU ml^-1 of total lactobacilli. The raw milk had an average 0.34 log CFU ml^-1 of lactobacilli and 0.08 log CFU ml^-1 of total lactobacilli. The raw milk also had an average 21.3 log CFU ml^-1 of total lactobacilli. The Raw Milk Is Not Fatty Acids (SNI) Exhibits Good Osmophagia-Protein Composition
Raw milk was rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C16:1) and linoleic acid (C16:2) (Table 3). The raw milk was rich in palmitic acid (C16:1) and linoleic acid (C16:2) and was rich in PUFA (C18:1) (Table 3). The quantities of saturated fatty acids (SFA) were higher in the raw milk than in the dry milk (Table 3).


## Discussion

The results of the bacterial community compositions of raw milk and whey contain several taxonomic and taxonomic difference. The difference in the bacterial community compositions between raw milk and whey may be related to the different types of whey. However, the differences in the composition of the bacteria within the gut microbiota have not been investigated yet.

The results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the gut microbiota of the two traditional methods of lipid production by the Italian schoolchildren are in accordance with those reported in other studies. They also showed that the different types of whey (raw and whey) did not correlate well with the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota of the schoolchildren [37, 38]. The analysis of the primary bacterial communities in the raw milk and whey samples indicated that the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota was highly dynamic, reaching a maximum for the raw milk samples and decreasing for the whey samples. The correlation between the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota and the bacterial species richness was also observed in other studies. For example, it was suggested that the composition of the gut microbiota of the schoolchildren was highly stable during the early stages of their growth, but then the composition of the gut microbiota changed significantly [39].

The results of the bacterial community composition of the two traditional methods of lipid production, in raw milk and whey, are in accordance with those of previous studies. It is noteworthy that the effect of raw milk and whey on the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota is not very strong. The results of the primary bacterial community compositions of the two traditional methods of lipid production are in accordance with those of the previous studies. The results of the bacterial community compositions of the raw milk and whey gut microbiota are in accordance with those of the previous studies. It is clear that the differences in the bacterial community composition of the gut microbiota are not due to a common microbiota. However, some differences in the bacterial community composition of the gut microbiota may also be related to the different types of whey and the types of fatty acids. The results of the quantitative analysis of the gut microbiota of the two traditional methods of lipid production by the Italian schoolchildren are in accordance with those reported in other studies. They also showed that the differences in the bacterial community compositions of the gut microbiota of the schoolchildren were mainly related to the different types of whey.

The results of the bacterial community compositions of the raw milk and whey gut microbiota are in accordance with those of the previous studies.
