## Abstract
Nectar yeasts are an important resource for microbial communities, particularly for fungal species, which benefit from host plant penetration and symbiotic associations with plants and other organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of host plants on the composition of nectar yeasts of strawberry (Vitis vinifera L.), strawberry (Pestalotiopsis crassa UJ3V9M and Vitellia moniliforme L. 1), and mango (Juglans spp. no. 269, No. 2018) yeasts, both isolated from different host plants, including strawberry and mango. The analysis of the data to predict host-pathogen interaction showed that pathogenic yeasts were more abundant in the mycobiome. In addition, the host-pathogen association with host plants was more pronounced in both strawberry and mango than in strawberry. Both pathogens were also found to have a minor effect on the bacterial and mycorrhizal immunity, with the former mainly observed at mucosal surfaces and the latter mainly observed in the gut. Yeast-host interaction was also observed in both mycobiomes, with the former largely observed in fruits. In conclusion, the host-pathogen association in nectar of strawberry and mango will promote the growth and virulence of both pathogenic and commensal nectar yeasts.


## Introduction
Candida species are opportunistic pathogens of mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals and cause superficial infections of mucosal origin that may lead to life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [1]. Among the most common Candida species, Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most common cause of invasive candidiasis and the most common fungal species associated with nosocomial infections in the United States [2, 3]. The rapid evolution of drug resistance, the increasing use of invasive diagnostic assays, and the emergence of antifungal drug resistance make candidiasis an ever-increasing problem in clinical practice [4, 5]. In order to improve the effectiveness of antifungal therapy, drug discovery and development (DCD) have increased intensive investment in the search for new antifungal agents [6, 7]. These agents have been shown to have various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK) properties [8-11].


## Methods
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (S. Louis, MO, USA).

2.5. Effect of Chemicals and Antimicrobial Agents on the Cell Wall Membrane and the Cell-Wall Protein of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
Methanol and aqueous solutions were used to dissolve the cell wall in the assay medium, which was supplemented with 0.1% (wt/vol) of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% (vol/vol) of methanol (Sigma-Aldrich).

The cell wall was stained with the fluorescently labeled vancomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and hyaluronic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and was observed under a Zeiss ZEN blue epifluorescence microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Germany).

2.6. Effect of Chemicals and Antimicrobial Agents on the Cell Wall Membrane and the Cell-Wall Protein of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
The cell wall was stained with aqueous solutions of 10% (wt/vol) and 20% (vol/vol) chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) and was observed under a Zeiss ZEN blue epifluorescence microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Germany).

2.7. Effect of Chemicals and Antimicrobial Agents on the Cell Wall Membrane and the Cell-Wall Protein of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
To remove the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell wall, the buffer and the supernatant of the assay medium were separately removed and the membrane was washed with PBS. The membranes were then placed in a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 10 min and then incubated for 30 min at 4Â°C with the buffer at the same pH. The membranes were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 10 min with the buffer at the same pH.


## Results
Using this assay, we found that the PDI method significantly reduced the effectiveness of the pepper seedling-induced disease on pepper seedlings (p<.05) (Table 2).

The PDI method of being able to generate a cell-based penetration assay of mucus formation was very promising. To overcome the problems associated with the PDI method, we developed a novel method for enhancing the penetration assay. We first used the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings. We found that the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings was highly promising. The ability of the PDI method to induce the disease on pepper seedlings was enhanced by the use of PDI-PCR (p<0.05) and by the use of PDI-PCR (p<0.05) to stimulate the disease.

We then used the PDI method of inducing the disease. We found that the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings significantly enhanced the efficacy of the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings. We found that the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings was able to significantly increase the efficacy of the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings.

To further evaluate the efficacy of the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings, we used a different assay. We found that the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings significantly increased the efficacy of the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings.

The results shown in Table 3 demonstrate that the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings was superior to the PDI method of being able to stimulate the disease on pepper seedlings.

3.5. Biased Analysis of Compounds
The key compounds in the PDI method of being able to induce the disease on pepper seedlings were determined and identified (Table 4). Compounds 3a-5a were identified as T-7, T-5, T-9, and T-12.


## Discussion
In addition, we were able to study the effect of a highly toxic metal, Zn^2+ [18], on the fungal cell wall, which was observed by direct cell-based penetration using both cell-based and cell-based stimulatio. The fungal cell wall was highly hydrophobic at the pH 6.0 range, and several cell wall and secreted proteins were identified (Table S6).

The cell wall was also a significant target of metal toxicity as a result of the strong impact of Zn^2+ on the fungal cell wall. According to the data presented in the present work, the cell wall of C. reinhardtii was significantly reduced by the high dose of Zn^2+ in the presence of Cu^2+. This reduced fungal cell wall was also evidenced by the increase in the cell wall proteins in the presence of Cu^2+. These results suggest that Zn^2+ is more toxic than Cu^2+. The fact that Zn^2+ is not toxic to C. reinhardtii is in line with the findings of previous reports. For example, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, C. reinhardtii mutants lacking Cu^2+ are more sensitive to cell wall stressors, such as Cu^2+ [19]. Similarly, in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, a Zn^2+-resistant mutant was also more resistant to cell wall stressors [20]. The exact mechanism by which Zn^2+ reduces the fungal cell wall is not yet known. In the present work, we found that the addition of Zn^2+ to C. reinhardtii cell walls significantly enhanced the penetration of C. reinhardtii by the yeast strain. Interestingly, the addition of Zn^2+ to C. reinhardtii also had a significant effect on the fungal cell wall. The C. reinhardtii mutant is highly susceptible to cell wall stressors, such as Cu^2+ [21]. The results of the present study further suggest that Zn^2+ is a potent cell wall stressor that can be used as a novel therapeutic agent.

Based on previous results and the results of the present study, we hypothesized that C. reinhardtii can grow in a microenvironments that are not conducive to conidial growth.
