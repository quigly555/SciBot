## Abstract
The development of antifungal drug development and discovery is usually carried out by multiple laboratories each year. The early studies were undertaken in our laboratory, which was supported by grants from the US NIH and the Marie Curie Research Institute, to assess the toxicity and safety of the antifungal caspofungin and amphotericin B. We first observed a concern for the emergence of resistance to amphotericin B. This article highlights the most recent development of antifungal drug safety.


## Introduction
neoformans)
Infecting the host is the main consequence of the association of the fungal cell with its environmen. This is achieved by the competition for nutrients and space between the cell and the environment. The cell has to find, acquire nutrients and produce energy to survive and adapt to the harsh environments. The increased activity of the immune system is compensated for by increased cytotoxicity and immunosuppression (4).

The fungal cell has a complex and tightly interconnected network of receptors, which are recognized by multiple types of cell receptors, each of which can activate different signaling pathways. The sensing of different types of stimuli by the cell receptors is primarily through the receptors for sugars present on the surface of the fungal cells. These receptors include receptors for the target proteins, lipids, and other factors that activate the immune system (5, 6). The diversity of ligands to the cell signaling pathway is related to the morphological and physiological characteristics of the cells. The ability to sense different ligands is responsible for the differentiation of different cells types and their response to the ligands. Cell signaling is divided into two types of receptors: extracellular receptors and intracellular receptors (7). Extracellular receptors are specialized receptors that can sense different ligands at the cell surface and by their associated molecules, can be divided into three types: receptors for different glycans and proteins, receptors for proteins and lipids and also receptors for molecules with immunoreactivity (8).

The recognition of different ligands by the cell is influenced by the combination of signals that are sensed from other cell types. The recognition of cell surface molecules by the cell receptors is controlled by the TGN pathway. The TGN pathway is composed of seven members: TGN1, TGN2, TGN3, TGN4, and TGN5. Some members of the TGN pathway are involved in the production of immunosupressible molecules, which may affect the host defense mechanisms (9, 10). In addition, the TGN pathway can be inhibited by antifungals, which affect the cell signaling pathways that are involved in the responses of the fungus to the different stresses (11). In addition to the classical signaling pathways, several other signaling pathways also participate in the responses to various stresses. The basic signaling pathways are activated by signals produced by the cell and their receptors (12).


## Methods
The Fbp1 region of Cryptococcus neoformans was amplified by PCR using the primers Fbp1_A1 and Fbp1_A2 [33] and then cloned into pMD19-T vector (Tiangen, Beijing, China. This vector contains a CYP51A promoter and a C terminator, and was used to transform Cryptococcus neoformans strain YPD 1.4 (Gams et al., 2003). The resulting yeast strain was transformed with the pMD19-T vector and was selected on SC-URA plates (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The purified Fbp1-expressing yeast strain was transformed with the pMD19-T vector and was selected on SC-URA plates (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The recombinant plasmid was sequenced and the Fbp1-expressing strain was selected on SC-URA plates containing G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The recombinant plasmid was used to transform Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21.

Generation of Fbp1-expressing C. gattii strain JEC21
The C. gattii strain JEC21 (JEC21a) was transformed with pGAD-Fbp1-T vector and was selected on SC-URA plates containing G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The recombinant plasmid was sequenced and the C. gattii strain JEC21a was selected on SC-URA plates containing G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The recombinant plasmid was used to transform C. gattii strain JEC21a. The Fbp1-expressing C. gattii strain JEC21a was transformed with pGAD-Fbp1-T vector and was selected on SC-URA plates containing G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The recombinant plasmid was used to transform C. gattii strain JEC21a.

## Results
neoformans in viv. The C. neoformans F-box proteins were homogenously expressed in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice, and were used as positive and negative controls. Cryptococcus neoformans was identified as a positive control when the wild-type strain was cultured in the absence of F-box protein Fbp1. In contrast, the F-box proteins were absent from the C57BL/6 mice when the wild-type strain was cultured in the absence of F-box protein Fbp1.

The F-box proteins have a F-box domain (Fig 2A), and have a conserved F-box domain (Fig 2B) (35). In addition, we found that the F-box domain in Fbp1 was more conserved than that in Fbp2, and that the F-box domain in Fbp1 was more similar to that in Fbp2 than to that in Fbp1 (Fig 2C). To further validate the F-box domain in Fbp1, we also constructed an F-box protein Fbp1(FBP1) mutant that was complemented with the wild-type Fbp1 allele by an affinity purification method (36). We first confirmed that the Fbp1(FBP1) mutant was transformed into C57BL/6 mice via the use of the purified Fbp1 allele. A strong, wild-type Fbp1 allele was found in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice, but the Fbp1(FBP1) mutant did not (Fig 2D). The wild-type Fbp1 allele was only found in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice, and the Fbp1(FBP1) mutant showed no obvious phenotype. The Fbp1(FBP1) mutant had a wild-type Fbp1 allele, but the Fbp1(FBP1) mutant was not able to grow on minimal media (Fig 2D). The Fbp1(FBP1) mutant was more virulent than the wild-type Fbp1 allele, indicating that the Fbp1(FBP1) mutant was virulent. These results indicate that the F-box proteins are important for the virulence of C.


## Discussion
This protein is a dimeric complex with an F-box domain and is present in the cell wall and the plasma membrane of the pathogenic yeast, . neoformans. The F-box domain of Fbp1 is not present in other filamentous fungi [57] and it is not present in the F-box of Cryptococcus neoformans. The F-box domain of the Cryptococcus neoformans Fbp1 is present in both yeast and human F-box proteins. The F-box domain of Fbp1 is conserved in all fungi studied and this suggests that the F-box domain of Cryptococcus neoformans may have a similar function in F-box protein function. The F-box domain of the Cryptococcus neoformans Fbp1 is present in the yeast genome, but it is not present in the human genome. The F-box domain of Fbp1 is conserved in both human and yeast [58]. The F-box domain of Cryptococcus neoformans is present in both the cell wall and ER. However, the F-box domain of Cryptococcus neoformans is absent in human and yeast. This suggests that the F-box domain of Cryptococcus neoformans is unique in fungi and that the F-box domain may be a conserved gene in fungi. This idea was also supported by the identification of F-box domains in other fungal species. The F-box domain of HapX (HapX) in Cryptococcus neoformans is absent in human and yeast [59]. The F-box domain of HapX in Cryptococcus neoformans was found in the ER and is conserved in both human and yeast. The F-box domain of HapX in Cryptococcus neoformans is conserved in both human and yeast [60]. The F-box domain of HapX in Cryptococcus neoformans was found to be conserved in both human and yeast. This suggests that the F-box domain may be a conserved gene in fungi. This also suggests that the F-box domain may be a conserved gene in fungi.
