## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. This study evaluated the antifungal efficacy of a curative agent, namely cyclosporin A (CoA), against IFI in a mouse model of Aspergillus fumigatus. A total of 40 days of curative therapy with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole was achieved. The antifungal activity of CoA was demonstrated to be in a dose range of 250 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL.


## Introduction
The genus Hydnopogon is a genus of wood-inhabiting species, which includes more than 30 taxa found in various habitats including soil, water, and plants [1-3]. They are also found in alpine soils, freshwater streams, and marine waters [4-7].


## Methods
We defined invasive cryptococcosis as a Cryptococcus meningitis case in a person with a positive CSF India ink stain and a positive India ink tes. We found that an empiric approach of amphotericin B and fluconazole was effective in excluding invasive cryptococcosis from the analysis.

We also estimated the proportion of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in our cohort based on the CSF culture of the suspected cryptococcal meningitis cases. We calculated the proportion of CSF culture cases with invasive cryptococcosis in our cohort based on the number of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort. We calculated the proportion of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort based on the number of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort. We calculated the proportion of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in our cohort based on the number of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort.

The proportion of CSF culture cases with invasive cryptococcosis in our cohort was based on the number of cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort. We used the proportion of CSF culture cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort for estimating the incidence of invasive cryptococcosis. We used the proportion of CSF culture cases with invasive cryptococcosis in the cohort for estimating the incidence of invasive cryptococcosis.

Statistical Analysis
All of the data from the study were summarized to the most recent year, as well as to the date of the study, and entered into a Microsoft Office spreadsheet. We compared the incidence of invasive cryptococcosis with the time interval between the date of the first episode of cryptococcosis in the cohort and the date of the second episode. We compared the incidence of invasive cryptococcosis with the time interval between the date of the first episode of cryptococcosis in the cohort and the date of the second episode.

## Results
neoforman. Fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans was able to grow in the presence of fluconazole. Fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans was also able to grow in the presence of fluconazole at the concentration of 125 µg/ml (Figure 4A).

Effect of Fluconazole on the Activity of METH and METH-Based Antifungal Agents
After the antifungal agent fluconazole was used in the control of METH, it was found that METH was more effective than METH for the suppression of S. aureus infection. The MIC values of the antifungal agents fluconazole and miconazole were 0.002 and 0.003 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC values of the antifungal agents were 0.004 µg/ml and 0.003 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC values of the antifungal agents for the control of S. aureus infection were 0.002 µg/ml and 0.003 µg/ml, respectively.

## Discussion
Interestingly, the IgG3-Fc array showed a similar pattern of uptake of Agaric acid in the mice model (Figure 6C. However, IgG3-Fc has a more potent immunoregulatory effect than IgG2a [28], and IgG3-Fc has an increased susceptibility to infection with Cryptococcus neoformans [30, 31]. The serum IgG3-Fc has a less potent immunoregulatory effect than IgG2a [28, 30], and the IgG3-Fc has an increased susceptibility to infection with Cryptococcus neoformans [30, 31]. The IgG3-Fc antibody responses to the Th1/Th17 axis have been reported in the immunocompetent mice model of invasive cryptococcosis [32]. These antibodies are also able to increase the number of CD8^+ T cells in the brain and bone marrow [33]. The use of the Agaric acid-based therapy in the immunocompromised mice results in an increased incidence of immunocompromised patients [34].

The results of the immunosuppressive studies indicated that the Agaric acid-based therapy has no effect on T cell immunity and the Th17 cells (Figure 7). In contrast, the Th1/Th17 axis was increased in the immunosuppressed mice and Th1/Th17 cells (Figure 7) was increased in the immunocompromised mice, and Th17 cells were significantly increased in the immunocompromised mice. These data indicate that Agaric acid is more effective in the immunocompetent mice compared to the immunocompetent mice.

In conclusion, the immunomodulatory effects of Agaric acid on T cell immunity were previously reported. However, the immunomodulatory effect of Agaric acid was not observed in the immunocompetent mice. These data suggest that Agaric acid is less effective in the immunocompetent mice compared to the immunocompetent mice. The immunomodulatory effects of Agaric acid on T cell immunity were previously reported. However, the immunomodulatory effects of Agaric acid were not observed in the immunocompetent mice.
