## Abstract
Liposomes are the most abundant renewable feedstocks and may play an important role in the sustainability of the winemaking process. The biopolymer of interest, L-lysine, is a substrate for cell production for many important industrial organisms. However, most of the studies on the biopolymers have been devoted to studying the metabolism and physical properties of L-lysine. In this study, we found that the L-lysine metabolite diethylalanosterol (HGA) is the substrate for the synthesis of the red and green fluorescing fluorescing fungi Sporothrix schenckii and Rhizoctonia solani, which constitute an important group of fungal species used in the production of industrial red and white fluorescingumes. Furthermore, we showed that HGA is metabolically active with a high content of the substrate H-cymeno-alanosterol (1.54-2.13-fold increase). We also verified that the enzymatic activity of HGA was increased in the fungus when grown on glucose at room temperature or in the presence of ethanol at 50 ppm. In addition, the increased red and white fluorescence of melanin in the presence of HGA was demonstrated. Our results provide a platform for the characterization of the metabolic activity of a substrate-grown organism when it is exposed to the conditions that are commonly encountered in industrial organisms such as low temperature, low pH, and low sulfur (5-6). Taken together, these studies show that the increased red and white fluorescence of melanin in the presence of HGA is due to an increase in the metabolic activity of the substrate.


## Introduction

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), and they recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), signal transduction molecules, and microorganisms to regulate infection (9, 10. While some DCs may be involved in antifungal immunity (11), other DCs are considered to be important for innate immune recognition and may play a role in antifungal immunity. A number of DCs have been reported to be activated by Paracoccidioides spp. (12, 13), including DC-SIGN (14), DC-DAMP (15), DC-MAPK (16), DC-RING (17), DC-SHIN1 (18), DC-SHIN1A (19), and DC-SHIN1B (20). Additionally, DCs have been reported to be activated by ß-glucan (21, 22) and mannose (23, 24), as well as mannose (25, 26). In vitro antifungal activity of Trichoderma species and Trichoderma reesei is reported to be comparable to those of A. fumigatus (27). In addition, Trichoderma species have been reported to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and C. glabrata (28). It has been reported that Trichoderma species can inhibit the growth of Aspergillus species (29).

While some antifungals that target the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway have been studied, the exact mechanism behind antifungal-target interactions remains largely unknown. It has been reported that Trichoderma species can trigger apoptosis in vitro (30, 31). In addition, the production of oxidative stress in fungi has been reported (32).

T. reesei is a basidiomycetous yeast that has been used as a model to study the fungal pathogen, Candida albicans (33, 34). In vitro antifungal activity was reported to be equal to that of the conventional antifungals (35-37). The antifungal activity of Trichoderma species has been reported to be comparable to those of A. fumigatus (39, 40).


## Methods
The test was performed on a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, Cambridge, UK) using RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and a standard mixture of 2% glucose (w/v), .165 M MOPS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 20% glucose (w/v). A standard mixture of 1% Tween 20 (w/v) was used for yeast, as the antifungal activity of 2-phenylethanol is not affected by this medium. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The MIC values of the compounds were determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting growth by 50% (CFU/mL).

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, no. 123, dated 27 January 1997, L14/1993) and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (CEUA).

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Candida parapsilosis ATCC2001 by using a Plant RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A standard mixture of 2% (w/v) glucose (w/v) and 0.1% (v/v) methanol (w/v) was used for yeast and methanol, respectively. RNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Germany). The RNA samples were treated with RNAiso Plus RNA kit (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd., China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RNA isolation, the RNA was treated with DNaseI (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd., China) and then treated with DNaseI and then treated with RNaseH (Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd., China).


## Results
Morphology
In addition to the morphological differences in the molds observed in our study, the morphological differences in the fungal community are in agreement with the morphological and geographic locations of our site. For example, M. pulcherrima was found to be a non-fungal fungus inhabiting a tree bark. This was confirmed by our examination of the relative abundance of fungi isolated from the same tree bark that we sampled. Our analysis shows that M. pulcherrima was found to be the most abundant fungus on the tree bark of a small tree with a thick bark structure, and therefore the average annual production per gram of biomass (g/g) is approximately 17.4 (Table 2).

The average annual biomass produced by M. pulcherrima is higher than the average biomass produced by C. neoformans (Table 1).


## Discussion
glabrata infectio. The levels of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were evaluated in serum and 3D growth of C. albicans and C. tropicalis in vitro. The results showed that the highest activity of 2-phenylethanol was observed against C. albicans and C. tropicalis in vitro, but not in vivo. However, C. albicans was more susceptible to 2-phenylethanol in vitro compared to C. tropicalis. The most potent activity was observed against C. albicans and C. tropicalis in vitro. However, C. albicans and C. tropicalis were more susceptible to 2-phenylethanol in vivo compared to C. albicans and C. tropicalis in vitro.

2-Hydroxy-3,4-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (2H-Mg-2H-Trp) was found to be the most potent activity of 2-phenylethanol against C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. albicans in vitro. The activity was comparable to that of 2-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (1H-Mg-2H-Trp) in the concentration range of 5-10 µg/mL. However, C. albicans was more susceptible to 2-phenylethanol than that of 2-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (1H-Mg-2H-Trp). C. albicans and C. tropicalis were more susceptible to 2-phenylethanol than that of 2-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (1H-Mg-2H-Trp). C. albicans was more resistant to 2-phenylethanol than that of 2-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (1H-Mg-2H-Trp). However, C. tropicalis and C. albicans were more susceptible to 2-phenylethanol than that of 2-caffeoyl-5-monooxygenase (1H-Mg-2H-Trp).
