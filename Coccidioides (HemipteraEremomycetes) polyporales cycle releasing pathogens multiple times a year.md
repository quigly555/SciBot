# Coccidioides (Hemiptera:Eremomycetes) polyporales cycle: releasing pathogens multiple times a year
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Background: Cryptococcus gattii is responsible for a worldwide pandemic, with an estimated 181,000 deaths per year. Current antifungal therapies are suboptimal, and resistance to any major classes of antifungal drugs is an emerging issue. The development of new antifungals is currently in its infancy.


## Introduction
 2006.

The ability of the melanized fungus to cause disease in nature is a major factor determining the course of infections (Hoch et al., 2015; Goswami and Skaar, 2016). Melanized fungi have been described as obligate parasites and as a result of its metabolic capabilities, melanized fungi can infect a wide range of animals including invertebrates (e.g., the brown mollusk Dactylis elegans), birds (e.g., D. kroganis), mammals (e.g., the mussel Musselia moluccana), fish (e.g., Musselia circinelloides) and even birds (e.g., Musselia circinelloides) (Cavalier-Smith et al., 2006; Ebert, 2007; Ertz et al., 2015; Mukherjee et al., 2016).

Melanized fungi have also been implicated in human diseases including: keratitis (Luparia melitensis), cutaneous infections (Vibrio cholerae), and allergic skin and nail infections (Deng et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014). These fungal diseases are characterized by systemic symptoms, with sometimes fever, headache, confusion, malaise, fever, rash, and arthralgia (Zhang et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014). In addition, melanized fungi can be pathogenic for both humans and animals (Khan, 2010; Wachovics and Sobrado, 2010). Melanized fungi are known to cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients, especially those with impaired immune systems. Among them, melanized fungi are reported to cause nearly 400,000 life-threatening infections annually (Zhang et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014).

Several groups have reported that the melanin in the cell wall is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of disease (Chakraborty et al., 2017). In addition, the composition of melanin in the cell wall is a critical determinant of its pathogenesis, including the presence of macromolecules that allow melanin to escape from the cell wall, such as chitin, which is produced as a pigment (Kamakura et al., 2010).


## Methods
.


## Results
The resulting infectious process is defined as a pathogen-free cycle that is accompanied by the development of an immune system and/or by the release of pathogens within host cells (Sordariomycetes.

Coccidioides polyporales cycle
There are five C. polyporales species described in the literature [16,17] (Fig 2). The C. polyporales and C.


## Discussion
A comprehensive overview of the phylogenetic relationships of fungal pathogens is beyond the scope of this stud. However, it is noteworthy that fungal pathogenicity has been emphasized in the case of the pathogen of humans [49]. In this case, the pathogen of humans could not be identified because of the absence of the human gene CCAAT-1 expression. A previous study found that CCAAT-1 expression was not associated with disease in human subjects [50]. However, CCAAT-1 expression in T. atroviride was increased by 6-fold after treatment with T. atroviride [51]. The decrease in CCAAT-1 expression after treatment with T. atroviride in the present study suggests that fungal pathogens may use T. atroviride as a source of a toxin. This study provides evidence that T. atroviride could be a source of virulence factors such as CCAAT-1. Further studies are also needed to determine the extent of the expression of CCAAT-1 in T. atroviride.

To investigate the potential role of CCAAT-1 expression in T. atroviride, the T. atroviride genome was sequenced using the Tmov1 promoter [52]. Tmov1 encodes a putative homolog of the fungal homolog of the CCAAT-1 gene in T. atroviride, T. atroviride-1, T. atroviride-2 and T. atroviride-3. The genes encoding putative Tmov1 gene were identified in all the T. atroviride strains tested. The majority of Tmov1 genes are putative pathogenicity genes. The expression levels of putative pathogenicity genes were higher in the T. atroviride strains. However, the expression level of the putative pathogenicity genes was reduced in the T. atroviride strain. The T. atroviride strain was unable to develop or produce a fungus. These results suggest that the T. atroviride strain may use T. atroviride as a source of virulence factors.

In addition to the potential use of T. atroviride as a source of a toxin, we found that the T. atroviride strain could also be used as a vaccine for human diseases. T.
