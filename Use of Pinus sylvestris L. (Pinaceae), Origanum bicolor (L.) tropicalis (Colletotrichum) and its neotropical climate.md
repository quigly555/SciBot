## Abstract
Mucormycosis is an emerging angio-invasive infection, most commonly associated with angioedema and respiratory failure. Asymptomatic pulmonary mucormycosis with histopathology is rare in children. We report a case of mucormycosis with histopathology in a 3-year-old child with severe asthma and atopic dermatitis.


## Introduction

The plant is a perennial tree with a wide distribution and is often found in forest soils throughout the tropics [5. Several species have been recorded from Pinus sylvestris, but only two species are known from this species habitat: the first one is from the Sudan forest, and the second one is from the Guiana forest [6]. The first two Pinus sylvestris species were described by Melo [7]. The first one was re-described by Bambal [8]. The second one was described by Bambal and synonymized by Bambal [9]. In the literature, Pinus sylvestris is listed as an endangered species, which severely affects the natural ecosystem and the health of Pinus sylvestris forests and horticultural plants [10]. The first two Pinus sylvestris species were found from Portugal [8]. The Portuguese Pinus sylvestris is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) [11]. In the IUCN call for an end to the practice of listing Pinus sylvestris [12].

In the past two decades, Pinus sylvestris has been extensively studied in various countries around the world. In Brazil, the first documented species of the genus was discovered in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest in 1956. During this period Pinus sylvestris was reported from six Brazilian states: Bahia, Goiás, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and São Paulo state. Pinus bicolor, Pinus eucalyptus, and Pinus littoralis were reported from the State of Goiás in 1961, 1963, and 1964. The first records of the genus were found in Goiás, Goiás, Minas Gerais, and Goiás, Minas Gerais in the State of Minas Gerais in 1968 [13]. In the State of Minas Gerais, Pinus bicolor was reported from the State of Bahia in 1974 [14].


## Methods
., a transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a photomultiplier-type viseq C6x5. The temperatures were maintained between 25-30°C. The isolation of plant materials was performed at the research station, where samples were stored at 4°C. Samples were thawed on ice and immediately frozen. For the collection of the SDA, a tube of 1 ml of PBS containing 1% (wt/vol) potassium permanganate was used to release the spore from the culture. The samples were kept in a laminar air flow cabinet (SPFLB) at 4°C. A 1 ml aliquot of the suspension was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -20°C.

Seeds of Pinus sylvestris L. (Pinaceae) were used as a source of starch, and their production was monitored by measuring the sugar content of the sample. For sugar determination, the extract was subjected to a semipreparative sucrose gradient for 15 min. The glucose content of the extract was determined using a method of Bradford [50]. The sucrose content was expressed as the percentage of the total sucrose released from the sucrose added. For the analyses of sucrose content, a semipreparative sucrose gradient was conducted for 10 min and then the sugar content was calculated according to the formula: (%) Sucrose content (%) = [total sucrose (min)] × 100, where [min] is the min of the sucrose added and [min] is the min of the sugar.

Seeds of Pinus sylvestris L. (Pinaceae) were used as a source of oil, and their production was monitored by measuring the oil content. For sugar determination, the extract was subjected to a semipreparative sucrose gradient for 30 min. The oil content was expressed as the percentage of the total sucrose released from the sucrose added. For the analyses of sugar content, a semipreparative sucrose gradient was conducted for 10 min and then the sugar content was calculated according to the formula: (%) Sucrose content (%) = [total sucrose (min)] × 100, where [min] is the min of the sucrose added and [min] is the min of the sugar.

. lat. and S. nigrum).

Habitat: On bark of a dead culm of Pinus sylvestris L. (Pinaceae), Origanum bicolor (L.) tropicalis (Colletotrichum) and its neotropical climate (August) as well as the salt-related species S. s. lat. and S. nigrum.

Distribution: Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australasia, and Europe.

Additional specimens examined: Japan, Shimane, on a dead culm of Pinus sylvestris L., May 1998, T. Kobayashi, No. 1044 (HAL). Korea, on a dead culm of Pinus sylvestris L., July 1998, H.D. Shin, No. 1207 (HKAS); Japan, Shimane, on a dead culm of Pinus sylvestris L., July 1998, H.D. Shin, No. 1208 (HAL).

Notes: Based on the phylogenetic analyses, C. cajan is closely related to C. fusca (CBS 502.73) (Fig 1), C. kenanensis (CBS 700.93) (Fig 2), C. hubeiensis (CBS 570.90) (Fig 3) and C. irregularis (CBS 462.68) (Fig 4) and is also found to be related to C. kenanensis (CBS 570.90) (Fig 1) by molecular analysis (data not shown) (Fig 3).

Four species of Cercospora are described in the genus Cercospora (Saccardo 1884), viz., Cercospora cajan (Saccardo 1884), Cercospora cajan (Saccardo 1884) and Cercospora cajan (Saccardo 1884). Cercospora cajan (Saccardo 1884) was described by C. Kuntze and C. Kuntze as the type species of Cercospora, and was treated as a synonym of Cercospora s. str. (Crous & Braun 1998). The generic name Cercospora cajan (Saccardo 1884) is also validly applied to Cercospora s. str.


## Discussion
Pinus sylvestris is also known for its olive nectar aroma, and it is also a popular medicinal plant in tropical countries like Australia and New Zealand [33, 34. In this study, I. sylvestris was found to be most similar to I. spicifera in quality, macroconidial morphology, and chemical analysis. The plant produces a wide variety of different substances including phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids [35]. In addition, I. sylvestris also has been reported to be a good source of the sugars and nitrogenous carbon compounds [36].

The genus Pinus is characterized by its thallus with a long-limbed stipe, a bryant-like habit, and a dry-smooth stipe [37]. The plant is known to produce a wide variety of plants, including saprophytic strains [38]. The fungus has also been found to produce flavonoids [39].

The genus Pinus is composed of edible ascomycetous fungi, which are used for various purposes. For example, Pinus sylvestris has been reported to produce dihydromethanolic acid (DHMA) as an anti-oxidant and antioxidant [40].

The genus Chaetomium has been reported to produce phytochelate-type compounds that are important in the treatment of infections caused by fungal species [41]. It is a well-known plant pathogen that can be isolated from soil and plants of several families [42].

The genus Chaetomium was originally introduced by Chen [43]. It is known to produce phytochelate-type compounds, including a compound of a-pinene [44]. Chaetomium sp. is a species found in the genus Chaetomium and was reported to produce phytochelate-type compounds such as methanol [45].

The genus Chaetomium produces various metabolites. Chaetomium sp. has been reported to produce glycosides, a-pinenes, flavonoids, and dihydromethanolic acid [46].

The genus Chaetomium contains various species, some of which have been reported to produce phytochelate-type compounds. For example, Chaetomium sp.
