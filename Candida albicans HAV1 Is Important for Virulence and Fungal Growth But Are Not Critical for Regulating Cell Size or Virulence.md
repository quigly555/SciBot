## Abstract
C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are a group of type II (glucan receptors) that have been pivotal in immune responses to a broad range of pathogens. However, CLRs also play a role in immune responses against fungi and viruses, as well as against plant and fungal pathogens. The goal of this study is to examine the functional and molecular characteristics of the components of the human C-type lectin receptor (CLR), which we hypothesize is the most abundant and functional class.

We characterized the C-type lectin receptor-derived fragments (CTLR-Fc), with high selectivity and low specificity, by screening a library of mutants for mutations in the gene responsible for catalyzing the C-type lectin binding loop.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by a family of encapsulated yeasts (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii) in the mammalian host. This infection mainly affects immunocompromised individuals with hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and patients with autoimmune disease [1]. The species C. neoformans and C. gattii are globally distributed, causing an estimated 220,000 deaths annually, mainly in HIV/AIDS patients and in cancer patients [2].


## Methods

.5. Mutation and Inhibition of Inhibition of Inhibition of Inhibition of Growth
To test for a possible involvement of the different mutants of HAV1 in the antagonistic effect of the enzymes, the mutants of HAV1 were used in this study. They were chosen based on previous studies [27] that showed that the fludioxonil (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and fludioxonil-sulphuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were effective at the inhibition of the growth of S. cerevisiae as determined by the HPLC method [28], and the fludioxonil (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and fludioxonil-sulphuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were effective at the inhibition of the growth of M. avium. All mutants were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 30°C for 4 days and then the cell suspension was diluted with PBS and added to the mixture of M. avium, M. parasitica and M. parasitica cells to reach the desired density. This was done by adding the growth control to the mixture and adding the same amount of PBS, after which the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was then resuspended in PBS.

4.6. Antifungal Activity of HAV1 and HV-2
The antifungal activity of HAV1 and HV-2 was determined by the MMGM method [29]. The cells were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at 30°C for 48 h. The M. avium, M. parasitica and M. parasitica cells were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) medium at an optical density at 595 nm (OD600nm) and then transferred to a 96-well plate. The wells were incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm) for 24 h. Then, the M. parasitica and M.


## Results
RNA-seq of the yeast cells in the presence of Heterobacterium strains was performed to identify genes involved in the regulation of cell size, growth and virulenc. Using the YPS protocol, we observed that the YPS gene YPS_W5 was upregulated in the presence of Heterobacterium strains (Figure 6A). This gene was previously described as being involved in fungal virulence [27]. In addition, we found that the sphingolipid pepyridoglycolate synthase gene spx1 was upregulated in the presence of Heterobacterium strains (Figure 6B).

To further explore the role of genes encoding protein-protein interactions, we performed PCR for the binding of Heterobacterium strains to the DNA of C. neoformans and C. albicans. As shown in Figure 6C, the two C. neoformans strains bound to the P. pachyrhizi DNA sequence of the genome with a high degree of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the Heterobacterium strain. The binding of Heterobacterium strain DNA to the P. pachyrhizi DNA sequence was more specific for C. neoformans than for C. albicans, and this binding was more specific in both cases (Figure 6D). The P. pachyrhizi DNA binding activity in both strains was higher than that of C. neoformans (Figure 6E). These data suggest that Heterobacterium strains may bind to the P. pachyrhizi DNA sequence of the genome in the same way as C. neoformans or C. albicans.

We also investigated the effect of Heterobacterium strains on the growth of C. neoformans and C. albicans. We performed the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of Heterobacterium strains for 4 h at pH 7.5. After that, the growth of the two strains was compared at different pH values. We observed that the growth of C. neoformans and C. albicans was inhibited in the presence of Heterobacterium strains in the presence of Heterobacterium strains (Figure 7A). In contrast, the growth of C.


## Discussion
. Schmidt et al., 2019). However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying these processes remains elusive. The present study is the first to propose a novel mechanistic basis for the roles of HAV1 in pathogenesis and virulence. The mouse-like host-pathogen interaction has been demonstrated in a murine model of invasive candidiasis (Nakayama et al., 2007) and also in the mammalian host-pathogen model of invasive candidiasis (J. S. Schmidt et al., 2018). Our findings on HAV1-dependent cell size in human fungal cells will provide the first step in a novel, high-throughput, multidisciplinary approach to understanding the innate immune system and fungal pathogenesis.

We observed that HAV1 plays a critical role in regulating cell size and virulence in mice. The loss of HAV1 resulted in a reduced ability to colonize and cause disease in mice. This difference was also observed in the <U+0394>hav1- and <U+0394>hav1-<U+0394>human HAV mutants, which were also affected in the <U+0394>hav1-<U+0394>human HAV mutants, which are normally the same size as mice. We found that HAV1 is required for cell size and virulence of human Candida albicans. To test the role of HAV1 in virulence, we transferred the hav1<U+0394>human strain to a wild-type mouse strain and studied the effect of HAV1 on host cells and biofilm formation of human Candida albicans. In response to HAV1 treatment, cells were composed of hypha-deficient, but not hyphal-deficient cells, which was evident as the hav1<U+0394>human cells were able to form biofilms on the biofilm surface of infected mice. However, cells were also found to be more sensitive to HAV1 treatment than cells that were pre-treated with H. capsulatum. This led us to propose that HAV1 functions in the host-pathogen interaction to inhibit Candida albicans hyphal growth.
