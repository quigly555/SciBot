## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging fungal pathogen responsible for 1,230 fatal cryptococcosis cases in immunocompromised patients worldwide. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes in HIV-infected and immunocompetent patients with cryptococcosis.

This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to September 2018. Patients were =18 years of age hospitalized with =6 months to investigate the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. Clinical features included headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, and positive blood cultures. Secondary outcomes included invasive aspergillosis and mycobacterial infection.

Among the 476 patients, HIV infection was the cause of 2 cases, (1.4%, 95%CI: 1.3-1.5) of cryptococcosis, of which only 1 (0.6%) was aspergilloid. The median time to initiation of the antifungal regimen was 18 months (range: 1.1-1.9). Twelve HIV-infected and 11 HIV-uninfected cases developed cryptococcosis. All but one case (2.6%) of cryptococcosis were aspergilloid. Overall mortality was 15%, and three died within 12 months of diagnosis. The most common presentations were generalized lymphadenopathy, pleocytosis, and pleocytosis. Patients were treated with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole, and had a significantly lower survival (4.9% vs. 62.4%, P < 0.001).

Cryptococcus gattii infection was associated with worse prognosis than cryptococcosis among patients with advanced HIV, suggesting that advanced disease in the setting of HIV infection is necessary for cryptococcosis treatment.


## Introduction
Selection for infections in livestock is largely a consequence of the success of livestock breeding and/or the selection of suitable animals for infection [1,2]. Livestock breeding is a key factor in the economic success of the dairy industry. In contrast to other animal husbandries, the global dairy market for milk is estimated to be worth $4 billion [3]. Milk is a key source of animal protein, lactose and glucose, and has a variety of applications in the industrial production of dairy products, such as detergent, detergent and detergent-oil [4]. Milk is consumed at a rate of 10^10 kg^-1 per year [5] and is consumed in a cost-per-kg basis [4]. Milk is consumed in a cost-per-kg basis in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, China and Mexico [5]. In this study, the global market for dairy products is estimated to be $3.3 billion.

Livestock breeding is often implemented under the premise that the desired animal is a free-living and is genetically predisposed. Free-living animals are defined as animals that are not susceptible to infection by humans and are, thus, free-living animals. Free-living animals are selected for growth by virtue of the ability to produce reproductive structures (egg-shaped colonies, which can be seen in the laboratory environment) and are known to be more fit than free-living animals [6]. Free-living animals are selected for their growth by virtue of their large, oval, round, gelatinous colonies. The circular colony is more likely to be round than the round colony, and it is easier to detect if there is a long tail.


## Methods
Results of the linkage analysis showed that the SIVI-CMV is essential for pathogenesis, and the CRP-CMV is essential for pathogenesi.

There are two main methods for the evaluation of the performance of the linkage analysis. The first is the method of the competing analysis, where a combination of all the relevant parameters of the LAG model is used, the first parameter being the absolute value of the difference in the linear correlation between the two parameters, and the second parameter being the absolute value of the linear correlation between the parameters. This combination has been applied in several different laboratory laboratories and clinical laboratories and proved useful for diagnosis of Candida.

The LAG model is based on the equation L = a-b, where a is the effective number of all the parameters and b is the number of the parameters that were individually correlated in the model (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, j, k, l, n, and o) and the effective number of parameters is determined from the equation: (1 - l)Ã—10^(-1/a) where, l is the number of the parameters in the model, and a is the effective number of all the parameters. The HMW method is also used to assess the performance of the linkage analysis. The method was used in this study to determine the optimal pathway for the pathogenesis and the pathogenicity analysis.

The model uses the following parameters: the number of the parameters that were correlated in the model, and the number of the parameters that were individually correlated in the model. The HMW is a method of the competing analysis to evaluate the performance of the linkage analysis.

The HMW analysis was performed using the program LAGAINTM [26]. A combination of the parameters in the model, including the number of the parameters, and the number of the parameters in the model, were selected for the linkage analysis. The HMW analysis was performed with the program ANTIQS [27] and the results were analyzed by the program BWA [28] using the combination of the parameters in the model.

Finally, the method of the competing analysis was used to assess the performance of the linkage analysis.


## Results

.4. Ca2+ Homeostasis in a Substrate-Like Environment
The majority of known Candida species harbor a single Ca2+ channel gene (CAZy database), while Ca1+ is a common regulatory Ca2+ channel in other fungi. The Ca2+ channel is catalytic for the production of the main CAZy family enzymes, including chitin synthase (CS), chitin deacetylase (DAC), and actin. In yeast, the chitin synthase and deacetylase enzymes are responsible for the degradation of chitin and chitin deacetylase are responsible for the synthesis of chitin deacetylase [41,42]. Recently, a strain of C. neoformans (H99) with a genome-wide deletion of the chitin synthase gene (CAZy database) showed that it also had a defect in chitin deacetylase [43]. However, the gene deletion in the <U+0394>pksP mutant strain was not as severe as in the <U+0394>pks1 strain (data not shown), indicating that it might have been caused by the activity of PksP or Pks2, two genes with different regulatory functions. The presence of a single Pks2 gene in C. neoformans suggested that it is a Ca2+ channel that is important for fungal growth and development in a substrate-like environment.

3.5. Ca2+ homeostasis
The presence of a single Ca2+ channel gene is a confirmation of the role of Ca2+ in Ca2+ homeostasis. As the Ca2+ channel is a common regulatory Ca2+ channel, and is important for fungal growth and development, we tested the effect of deletion of the Ca2+ gene in a P. falciparum and P. major isolates. As shown in Fig 3, P. falciparum and P. major exhibited similar growth and development phenotypes as the <U+0394>pksP mutant. Furthermore, all three of the P.


## Discussion
We have demonstrated that GlcCer-mediated fungal cell wall and adhesion to human serum has a strong role in pathogenicity and infection of mice (Fig 6). This cell wall-associated CCR3-dependent expression of GlcCer is important for CCR3-dependent cell wall integrity and virulence in C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae [21-23]. Our data showed that GlcCer is required for invasive growth and invasion of the murine systemic mycosis model, which was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig S2) (Fig 7). GlcCer-dependent CCR3 was found to be required for the ability to form biofilm on serum agar. Biofilm formation on serum agar was previously shown to be CCR3 dependent [20]. In addition, studies have shown that GlcCer is required for the formation of biofilm on serum agar as well as in vitro in vitro infection of A. fumigatus [24, 25]. The ability of GlcCer to form biofilm on serum agar has also been demonstrated in vitro [20]. In C. albicans, GlcCer was found to be required for biofilm formation [25]. Here, we found that GlcCer was required for biofilm formation and virulence in a murine systemic mycosis model. Biofilm formation is a unique trait of C. albicans, which has been demonstrated to be a virulence factor for the yeast. The ability to form biofilm is an innate property of C. albicans. Studies have shown that C.
