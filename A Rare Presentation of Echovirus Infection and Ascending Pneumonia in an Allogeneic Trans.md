## Abstract
Candida albicans is a human and animal opportunistic pathogen that causes disseminated infections, often in the form of pulmonary infections. The innate immune receptors involved in the initiation and resolution of antifungal drug tolerance are not well defined. The aim of this study was to identify the inflammatory and immune-mediated pathways that control C. albicans conidiation and resolution.

Conjugation of a surface antigen receptor (CNA/r) to ÃŸ3 glucan was expressed in the fungal cells and its binding was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of CNA/r in the congenic cell line lines Cy1B/sCD38a was examined by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence staining was used to analyze the expression of CNA/r in the cultures of C. albicans congenic and non-congenic cells.

The expression of CNA/r was higher in the congenic cell lines compared to the non-congenic cell lines. The number of CNA/r was significantly lower in the congenic cell lines and congenic cell lines had a significantly lower expression of CNA/r than the expression of CNA/r in the non-congenic cells. The expression of CNA/r was significantly higher in the non-congenic cell lines compared to the congenic cell lines. In conclusion, C. albicans induced congenic cell differentiation and congenic cell differentiation was significantly inhibited in the presence of CNA/r in the fungal cells.

Conjugated antigen receptor (CNA/r) is expressed in the fungal cells and its ligand is expressed in the congenic cell.


## Introduction
In contrast, an allogeneic transplantation is usually managed with a more liberal use of immunosuppressive agents such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunomodulatory agents [12. In the first decade of life, the most commonly reported case in the transplant population is cryptococcal meningitis, which can lead to mortality in up to 50% of patients [13]. In the second decade of life, cryptococcal meningitis remains rare and remains the most common and serious complication in the transplant population [14].

Cryptococcosis has a worldwide distribution and affects mainly immunosuppressed patients, although cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent individuals may also present in patients with other medical conditions such as sarcoidosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and asthma [15]. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of cryptococcal meningitis vary from country to country. For example, the prevalence of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Africa is estimated at 6.7% in Uganda [16] and 5.9% in Lesotho [17] and in Tanzania [18]. In contrast, tuberculosis (TB) meningitis has been reported in tropical Africa, especially in Malawi [19] and Uganda [20]. In Tanzania, cryptococcal meningitis is also reported in a patient with pulmonary TB (NTBM) infection [21]. In Malawi, cryptococcal meningitis occurs in HIV-negative patients with pulmonary TB (NTBM) infection and presents as a meningoencephalitis without immunodeficiency. In the patients with HIV/NTBM infection, the majority of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis occurs in Malawi. The majority of patients with HIV/NTBM meningitis in Malawi die before the age of 70 [22].

Cryptococcosis is considered a human fungal disease mainly affecting immunocompromised individuals, especially those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [23]. The most common clinical presentation is cryptococcal meningitis, which can develop from mild to severe forms, depending on the route of infection. The most common of these forms is a pulmonary form [24].


## Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Nairobi, and all animal experiments were conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Reagents
MICs were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A2 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008) and MICs were determined according to the CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2008). Fluconazole (FLC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as an antifungal control.


## Results
The survival curve of the group with EBV infection (T = .04; p < 0.001) was significantly higher than that in the group with normal (T = 0.08; p < 0.001) P values. The increase in death rate was not significant in the group with EBV infection. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Table 2.

Survival curves of the three groups were shown in Fig 2. The death rate of the group with EBV infection was lower than that in the group with normal (T = 0.02; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 3. The group with EBV infection was significantly less than the group with normal (T = 0.04; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 4.

For the group with EBV infection, the death rate was lower than that in the group with normal (T = 0.03; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 5. The group with EBV infection was significantly less than the group with normal (T = 0.02; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 6. The group with EBV infection was significantly more than the group with normal (T = 0.03; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 7.

The survival curve of the three groups is shown in Fig 8. The group with EBV infection was significantly more than the group with normal (T = 0.02; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 9. The group with EBV infection was significantly less than the group with normal (T = 0.02; p < 0.001) P values. The results of the analysis of survival curve of the three groups are shown in Fig 10.


## Discussion
% to .5%) and the incidence of S. pneumoniae infection was 6.6% (95% CI, 3.9% to 8.2%) [27]. In the study, most patients (71%) had pulmonary disease and were on immunosuppressive therapy. The authors did not detect a risk for infection with E. faecalis. The infection occurred after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Although the overall incidence of Echovirus infection was moderate, the incidence of Ascending pneumonia was significant, in which the incidence of E. faecalis was 16%. It is noteworthy that the incidence of Ascending pneumonia in the study was 17%. This may be due to the risk factors of Ascending pneumonia, including exposure to common soil, pesticides, and transplantation. Ascending pneumonia may be the result of immunosuppressive therapy, tumor chemotherapy, or other diseases [28].

While most cases of Ascending pneumonia in the current study were not caused by E. faecalis, there were cases of E. faecalis infection in both transplanted and allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients infected with E. faecalis infection had a higher rate of Ascending pneumonia compared to transplanted recipients (14.7% vs. 2.6%). Ascending pneumonia in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients infected with E. faecalis infection was not as severe as in the current study. However, we found that the overall rate of Ascending pneumonia was higher in transplanted stem cell transplant recipients compared to allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.

Sulphur and Bacteroidetes are the major pathogens in human respiratory tract infections. Because of their high prevalence in humans, it is also considered that echinococci are important pathogens of respiratory tract infection [29]. The most common bacterial pathogens in humans are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this study, E. faecalis was the most common pathogen, followed by Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus.
