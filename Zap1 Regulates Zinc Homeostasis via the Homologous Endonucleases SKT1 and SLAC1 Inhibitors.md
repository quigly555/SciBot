## Abstract
Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides posadasii and C. gattii.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients.1,2 Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening condition. In an estimated 100,000 patients die from IA annually, with mortality rates exceeding 50% in immunocompromised patients.3

Despite the development of antifungal agents, the development of antifungal resistance is increasing.1,2,3-5 Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous filamentous fungal pathogen, with an estimated 10-25% of all clinical cases occurring in the environment.6,7 Several studies have reported on the susceptibility of A. fumigatus isolates to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins.8,9,10 In these studies, the A. fumigatus isolates were selected for susceptibility testing because of their increased susceptibility to amphotericin B and the increased susceptibility to echinocandins.10 As a result, the number of patients treated with echinocandins has decreased.11-14 Although some studies reported on the clinical epidemiology of azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates,15-17 others have reported that A. fumigatus azole resistance is rare.18 In this study, we sought to describe the clinical epidemiology of echinocandin-resistant A. fumigatus isolates from the Netherlands Mycology Research Institute (NIII), a center for antifungal susceptibility research.


## Methods
The SKT1 ORF was replaced by the SKT1 ORF containing the ORF of PpNP. The SKT1 ORF was subsequently cloned into pPIC-7 vector and amplified by PCR. The PCR product was transformed into P. pastoris GS115 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Holland, University of Kansas) and screened by restriction endonuclease using the oligonucleotides SKT1 ORF and SKT1 ORF (Roche) and gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The SKT1 ORF was then cloned into pPIC-7 vector to generate pPIC-SKT1. The SKT1 ORF was used to transform P. pastoris GS115 and selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar.

Assays to determine the effect of P. pastoris GS115 on the growth of P. pastoris
The effect of P. pastoris GS115 on P. pastoris GS115 was determined by the concentration of P. pastoris GS115 (1 mg/ml) in 200 ml of water. Yeast cells (10^6/ml) were inoculated in 5 ml of LB broth and grown overnight at 37°C in a shaker incubator. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000× g for 10 min and washed three times with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). P. pastoris GS115 (1 mg/ml) was added to 10 ml of this suspension. Growth of P. pastoris GS115 on P. pastoris GS115 was measured by measuring the optical density at 490 nm with a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

## Results
In the ZAP1/SKT1 complex, homologous sequences for each of the three SKT1 and three SKT2 genes were present (Fig 5B and C. However, no homologous sequences were found in the ZAP1/SKT2 complex in the other regions, which were not present in any of the samples (Fig 5C). We confirmed that the ZAP1/SKT1 complex is required for Zn_2Cys_6 homeostasis by a recent study (26). The ZAP1/SKT1 complex was also found in the ZAP1/SKT2 complex in all samples (Fig 5D). We also found that the ZAP1/SKT1 complex was also essential for Zn_2Cys_10 homeostasis by a recent study (28). In addition, the homologous sequences for all three SKT1 and three SKT2 genes were found in all the samples (Fig 5E). This indicates that the ZAP1/SKT1 complex regulates Zn_2Cys_10 homeostasis via the homologous endonuclease genes SKT1 and SKT2.

The ZAP1/SKT1 complex is required for zinc homeostasis in the presence of zinc
We next sought to test whether the ZAP1/SKT1 complex is required for Zn_2Cys_6 zinc homeostasis. To test this, we constructed a new ZAP1/SKT1 complex with the homologous SKT1 gene as the control (Fig 5E). The ZAP1/SKT1 complex was established by our previous study in which the three SKT1 genes were mutated to create the ZAP1/SKT1 complex (27). The ZAP1/SKT1 complex was verified by RT-PCR with zinc specific antibodies (Fig 5F). The ZAP1/SKT1 complex was found to be required for Zn_2Cys_6 zinc homeostasis by a previous study (27).


## Discussion
cerevisiae and . pombe are the homologs of Rv6 of the mammalian S. cerevisiae homolog, Zap1, and the two genes that are of interest in S. pombe are the Zap1 and Slac1 homologs.
