## Abstract
The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus can cause invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immune compromised hosts. To survive in these environments, A. fumigatus has evolved an adaptive immune response that plays a role in many aspects of its life cycle. This immune response has been subject to many clinical challenges, including the elevated risk of fungal infection and the production of toxic metabolites. One of these metabolites, ß-D-glucan, a major biomarker of A. fumigatus virulence, has been associated with both invasive and non- invasive mycoses. However, the contribution of ß-D-glucan in A. fumigatus pathogenicity is not well-established. Our objective was to evaluate the role of ß-D-glucan as a potential biomarker for A. fumigatus virulence.

We performed blood, tissue, or whole tissue samples from healthy donors (n = 37) with A. fumigatus IA and three A.


## Introduction
The genus Candida is well known for its numerous opportunistic infections including superficial mucosal infections. However, this group is especially vulnerable to infection by opportunistic fungi including species of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Malassezia, which are associated with high mortality rates.


## Methods
Mouse anti-ß-actin (clone AB-13-4A, GenScript) was used at 1 µg/ml and mouse IgG1-FITC (clone ATCC, GenScript) was used at 1 µg/m. Mice were euthanized by CO_2 and body weight was maintained at 20% of the animal’s total body weight. Lungs were removed aseptically, homogenized and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma). For quantitative analysis, lungs were sectioned (1 µm^2) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma) to determine the presence of histidine, leucine, and arginine in lung tissue. The number of histidine and leucine in lung tissue was determined using the Cell Quest Mouse Counting System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the measurements were performed using an iMark™ VersaDoc xR Lab-Stat XR+ System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Statistical Analysis
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines for housing of laboratory animals. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maine (Protocol #RP-56-08). All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with the United States Animal Welfare Act and the Animal Welfare Act, and were approved by the Washington State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #A-826-01).

The animal survival assay was performed as described previously (26, 28). Briefly, groups of 20 BALB/c mice were used in this study. Animals were housed at the University of Maine Medical Center Animal Facility with a 16-h light-dark cycle and an 8-h dark-time. Animals were kept in a temperature-controlled room at room temperature (25-28 °C) and given food and water ad libitum. Mice were allowed access to water ad libitum and water ad libitum until the day of experiment. Mice were weighed, ear-dried and immediately immersed in distilled water for 15 min, and then immediately immersed in distilled water for 10 min.

The mice were monitored daily for signs of disease and death for 6 d.

## Discussion
Alfredins are the most abundant proteins in fungi, comprising more than 70% of the total protein content of the fungi (Wang et al. 2013). In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the AAF-family protein sequences in fungi. The AAF family proteins have been shown to be evolutionarily conserved in fungi, and they are the most important proteins for fungal growth, development, and pathogenicity. AAFs are organized as two subfamilies, which are more closely related to each other than to the a- and ß-AF proteins (Bokulich et al. 2006; Barraclough et al. 2007; Bartolome et al. 2009). AAFs are important for a variety of processes such as regulation of cytokine production (Bokulich et al. 2006; Barraclough et al. 2007), cell signaling (Bokulich et al. 2006), lipid metabolism (Bokulich et al. 2006; Barraclough et al. 2007), and protein translation and translation initiation (Bokulich et al. 2006). In addition, AAFs are involved in cell signaling, cell cycle regulation, and cellular immune response (Movad and Barraclough 2009). In the present study, we compared the AAFs of the six strains of S. cerevisiae, and the AAFs of the strains of Fusarium oxysporum. We found that the AAFs were involved in pathogenicity, cell differentiation, stress response, virulence, and cell proliferation, as well as cell cycle regulation, cell wall integrity, and oxidative stress response (Figures 1, 2). Interestingly, the AAFs of the three strains of S.
