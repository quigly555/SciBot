## Abstract
The incidence of fungal infections has increased substantially over past decades due to changes in the human host environment and changes in the immune status of the human immune system. The most common pathogens are yeasts and filamentous fungi. Fungi with a cell wall and/or a surface morphology are predominant pathogens in humans. However, there are other less common pathogens that have evolved a variety of cell structures and/or surface structures to evade the host. These include viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and parasites. The adaptability of yeasts and filamentous fungi has allowed for the evolution of a wide variety of immune diagnostics. However, there has been a dearth of research on the topic of adaptive immunity in fungi and other small eukaryotes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the current understanding of the role of eukaryotic adaptive immunity in human hosts and disease.


## Introduction
Phospholipids are structural structures that are present in eukaryotic organisms and are involved in many physiological processes such as cell growth, cell differentiation, cell division, cell apoptosis and apoptosis [1,2]. In higher eukaryotes, phospholipids have been mainly studied because of their structural and functional similarities with cytosine and membrane proteins [3,4]. In addition, phospholipids are essential for the transport of ions and other compounds, such as lipid rafts and ATP, across membranes [5]. In fungi, the functional characteristics of phospholipids are largely related to their electrostatic nature, which is important for lipid transport across the fungal cell wall [6]. In C. albicans, the most common phospholipid is GlcA, which is involved in the synthesis of ß-(1<U+2192>4)-linked glycoconjugates and, thus, in fungal morphogenesis [7]. In S. cerevisiae, the structural characteristics of the fungal lipid bilayer are similar to those of the mammalian lipid bilayer, with the inclusion of a lipid-binding protein GlcC, which is involved in cell signaling [8]. In the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the presence of a phospholipid-glucosidase also has been found in its membrane [9].


## Methods
In this study, the pathogen was chosen as a reference strain of . suis because it is the only S. suis type that is sensitive to antifungal therapy [10], [11].

Antifungal therapy was performed as previously described [4]. The starting point of the antifungal therapy was 1 mL of sterile PBS. The next day, the haemolymph was collected and the concentration of the drug in the hemolymph was measured. The results were expressed as µg/mL and were considered as a control. The haemolymph was then diluted 1:100 and stored at -70°C.

The methodology used for antifungal therapy was previously described [11]. Briefly, when the antifungal therapy was performed, the antifungal therapy was performed in a sterile tube and a suspension of 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL in sterile saline was added into the tube. This was repeated three times. The turbidity of the solution was measured at 570 nm using a disposable scale (Nanjing Jiancheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). The antifungal therapy was performed in a volume of 100 µL with 100 µL of sterile saline. The volume was adjusted to 0.5 mL with sterile saline to prevent excessive bacterial growth. The cells were then serially diluted by 1:100 in sterile saline to achieve a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The antifungal therapy was performed for a total of 2-3 days.

4.2. Bacterial Isolates
Bacterial strains were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Zouche of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Guizhou, China. All the strains were isolated from the blood and liver tissues of the patients who received antifungal treatment.

The clinical isolates of bacteria were collected in the laboratory of Dr. Zhang of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Guizhou, China. All the strains were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Sangon Biotech, Ltd., China) at 37°C for 48 h and subcultured twice. The pathogenic strains were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Xiao, after obtaining the culture collection.


## Results
The results showed no significant difference in the bloodstream infection between the bloodstream infection in the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist and the bloodstream infection in the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist (p = .53). The data were compared between the bloodstream infection and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection.

Comparison of the Bloodstream Infection
The bloodstream infection of the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist was compared to the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection. The bloodstream infection of the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist was compared to the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection. The bloodstream infection of the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist was compared to the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection. The bloodstream infection of the umbilical cord of the gastroenterologist was compared to the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection, and the bloodstream infection of the two methods of bloodstream infection.

## Discussion
% to 1.0% in all populations. The prevalence of Osteolitiasis was 0.05% in O. cruzi and 0.13% in O. albidus. In the same study, the prevalence of blood stream infectious diseases in O. cruzi was 0.08% and 0.12% in O. albidus. In the present study, the prevalence of Osteolitiasis in O. albidus was 0.04% and 0.04% in O. cruzi, respectively.

A previous study showed that the frequency of blood stream infections in Osteolitiasis patients was similar to those in other blood diseases [15]. In the present study, the frequencies of blood stream infectious diseases were significantly higher in Osteolitiasis patients compared to other blood diseases. However, Osteolitiasis patients had lower CD4 cell counts and malignant lesions compared to other blood diseases. Although the frequencies of blood stream infectious diseases were not significantly different between Osteolitiasis and other blood diseases, the occurrence of blood stream infections in Osteolitiasis patients was similar to that in other blood diseases. The frequency of blood stream infectious diseases in Osteolitiasis patients was also higher than that in other blood diseases.

In this study, the frequency of Osteolitiasis patients with Osteolitiasis was significantly higher than those with other blood diseases. Blood stream infectious diseases were significantly higher in patients with Osteolitiasis compared to those with other blood diseases. Blood stream infectious diseases were significantly higher in patients with Osteolitiasis compared to those with other blood diseases. The frequency of Osteolitiasis patients with Osteolitiasis was higher than those with other blood diseases. However, the occurrence of blood stream infections in Osteolitiasis patients was significantly lower than that in other blood diseases.

During the management of Osteolitiasis, patients with Osteolitiasis can become symptomatic and develop serious bleeding problems. Blood stream infectious diseases are commonly associated with severe bleeding problems in the majority of patients. In the present study, blood stream infectious diseases were significantly higher in patients with Osteolitiasis compared to those with other blood diseases. Blood stream infectious diseases were significantly higher in patients with Osteolitiasis compared to those with other blood diseases.
