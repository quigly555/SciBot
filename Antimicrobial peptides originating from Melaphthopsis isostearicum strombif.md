## Abstract
Invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening fungal infection of humans caused by Candida albicans and is often caused by the inhalation of environmental fungi. It is often difficult to distinguish these fungal infections from candidiasis in the general population. Candida glabrata is the most common cause of candidiasis in the immunocompromised population. Although the etiology of candidiasis is not yet fully understood, the aim of this study is to elucidate the immune response induced in the peripheral blood of mice that is predisposed to develop resistant phenotypes in C. glabrata.

We used mice immunized with C. glabrata for experimental proof of immune response to a virulent environmental background. The survival of C. glabrata isolates was investigated. The experimental proof of immune response was evaluated in the peripheral blood of mice immunized with wild type or MHC class II. The susceptibility of mice to infection was evaluated in the Galleria mellonella model by the checkerboard method.


## Introduction
elongat. Melaphthopsis trifolium is a plant from the family Apudaceae. This species of Apudaceae is widely distributed in the tropics, subtropics and temperate regions of the world. The plant is native to the United States and throughout the Mediterranean area, and is cultivated in Africa and Asia. In South Africa, the plant is highly valued and is grown in many parts of the country, especially in the coastal areas. In the late 19^th century, the Great Lakes were the major source of the contaminated water from the Great Salt Lake. Since then, the disease has spread throughout the country, causing severe crop losses, mainly in the dairy industry. The disease is recognized as a global threat to human and animal health and is believed to be responsible for more than 1,200 million cases of small pox infections in humans and animals in Africa and Asia [1].

Melaphthopsis is a non-toxic, non-toxic and biodegradable perennial herbaceous plant that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of South America, especially in Brazil and Argentina [2,3,4]. It is native to South America and has been used as a traditional medicine in the Americas as the remedy for a variety of ailments such as, skin disorders, toothache, fever, diarrhoea, asthma, irritations, headache, constipation, vomiting, irritations, and skin diseases [5]. Currently, there are approximately 250 species of this genus, of which approximately 50 species have been isolated from tropical and subtropical regions of South America [6]. It is common in South America and throughout its distribution, it is highly valued for its antimicrobial activity, gastrointestinal effects, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and wound healing properties [7,8,9].

The genus Melaphthopsis was proposed by Costa et al. [10] based on its characteristic dimorphic conidiophores that can grow either on either the aerial or on the submerged hyphae. It was later re-described as a tropical herbaceous plant, found in the tropics, subtropics and temperate regions of the world [11]. Several molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed the presence of Melaphthopsis in a wide range of other Phytophthora species [12,13,14].


## Methods

A detailed description of the antifungal compounds was given in additional sections of the monographs (Table 1) and the results of the present study were interpreted according to the following criteria: antifungal activity; a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of .5 µg/ml of the compound; and, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC).

Antifungal activity
Antifungal activity of the extracts was determined according to the standard procedures by Ehrmann and Muench [50]. Briefly, the two fractions (0.5 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates at 37°C. After incubation for 3 days, the optical density (OD) of the plates was measured at 600 nm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that completely inhibited growth of the tested strains, compared with that of the drug-free control. The MICs of the extracts were evaluated according to the principles of reference methods [50]. The antifungal activity of the extracts was evaluated by two-fold serial dilutions of the compound. The dilution method described by Ehrmann and Muench was applied in this study.

MFC
The antifungal activity of the extracts was evaluated by two-fold serial dilutions of the compound. The dilution method described by Ehrmann and Muench was applied in this study. The MFC of the extracts was determined according to the following principles: MFC = (MIC-MIC) - (MIC-MIC) x 100, where MFC is the MIC of the extract and MIC is the MIC of the drug, and MIC is the MFC of the compound.

The antifungal activity of the extracts was evaluated by two-fold serial dilutions of the compound. The dilution method described by Ehrmann and Muench was applied in this study.

## Results
(M-001419), a co-crystallized hydrophobic peptide originating from Melaphthopsis . (M-001420), and a polysaccharide derived from Melaphthopsis S. (M-001421) L. (M-001422). The content of the peptides identified in our study ranged from 8.1% (L2) to 20.6% (L3) and the average number of peptides was 4.7 (Table 1). The sequences of the peptides were submitted to GenBank as a file (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/annotation_results.html). The most common peptides obtained were KOH (45.3%), OH (40.4%), and amylase (19.4%). The most abundant KOH peptides were hydrophobic KOH, amylase, and hydrophobic KOH, amylase, KOH and amylase, and hydrophobic and non-hydrophilic KOH, amylase, and amylase.


## Discussion
In this study, we describe the discovery of a novel pathogenicity factor in C. neoformans. To date, the mechanisms involved in this process have been poorly understood and limited to studies in C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. gattii, respectively. Two genes, C. neoformans-specific HapX and C. gattii-specific HapX1, are involved in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans, respectively. However, it is still unclear whether C. neoformans-specific HapX plays a role in virulence. Previous studies in C. neoformans have revealed that HapX is required for growth in liquid and in the presence of carbon sources [35]. In our study, we showed that C. neoformans-specific HapX was required for growth in liquid, but not in the presence of carbon sources. The fact that C. neoformans-specific HapX is involved in virulence could be related to its ability to survive in the host. Previous studies have demonstrated that C. neoformans-specific HapX is involved in virulence of C. neoformans [36].
