## Abstract
We report the case of a 63-year-old man who developed acute meningitis secondary to Mycobacterium bovis, M. abscessus, and Burkholderia pseudomallei after a one-month intermittent course of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The administration of a high dose of flucytosine (5 µg/kg/d for ten weeks) and deoxycholateazol (1 µg/kg/d for one week) resulted in a similar improvement, while the administration of dexamethasone (1 µg/kg/d for three weeks) and valoflavone (50 mg/kg/d for three weeks) resulted in a similar improvement. The administration of fluconazole (5 µg/kg/d for three weeks) and valoflavone (50 mg/kg/d) resulted in a similar improvement. The administration of glucan was discontinued for the following week. His symptoms, including headache, blurred speech, and photophobia, were unchanged. On day 6, the administration of fluconazole (5 µg/kg/d for ten weeks) and dexamethasone (1 µg/kg/d for three weeks) was completely and completely without symptom or adverse effect, and there was no change in his photophobia, photorexia, or astigmatism. The administration of deoxycholateazol (5 µg/kg/d for three weeks) and the administration of this drug within 30 days were without any adverse effects. Immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to fungal infections and may be at increased risk of fungal colonization and invasive disease as a consequence of the enhanced fungal burden in the hospital environment.


## Introduction
The genus Botrytis, which includes several economically important and taxonomically important plant and animal pathogens, is characterized by the production of toxic secondary metabolites, mainly of phytopathogenic and pathogenic character, with a striking resemblance of the wood decay pathogen Meloidogyne brasiliensis to Phytophthora so far poorly characterized (van der Aa & Van Dijck, 2013). The Meloidogyne spp. are known for their harmful wood decay, which is not only economic problem but also environmental hazard, with a consequent serious health threat (Meloidogyne brasiliensis) (Droby et al., 2007). Meloidogyne spp. are also known to be a potential threat to food crops, which are threatened by the accumulation of mycotoxins (Aguirre et al., 2000; Villalobos et al., 2000; da Silva Ferreira et al., 2001; da Silva Ferreira et al., 2001; Pinto et al., 2000). Some of the mycotoxins in Botrytis are polyketides, such as ß-lactams, diazothiazole derivatives, and phytoconstituents, which can be toxic to their respective animal and plant hosts (da Silva Ferreira et al., 2001; Cázares dos Santos et al., 2013).

The phytochemistry of wood decay is mainly based on the analysis of pyrophosphatidylinositol (PI) as a class, which has long been considered a defense mechanism to protect the plant against the damage caused by wood decay (Bond et al., 1998). PI plays a central role in fungal cell wall integrity, cell wall degradation, and pathogen invasion (Wang et al.


## Methods
A .5-kb PCR product was obtained from the DNA from each sample using the primers pair P1-P4 (F: 5'-CTCCGTTGAAACGCCGACCTGAC-3', R: 5'-CTGGTCCGTAGTCCGATGACACT-3') and P5-P7 (F: 5'-CCGTAGTCACCCATCATCTCCCCG-3', R: 5'-CTAGCAAGACCTGACTCAGC-3') (Meyer et al., 2010), and the results were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

To identify the subunit of the D4-d3 rRNA gene (dD4-DNA), an approximately 1.1-kb PCR product was obtained from the DNA of each sample using the primers D4-D2 (F: 5'-CCTCCGTCAACCCTTCCGTC-3') and D4-D4 (R: 5'-GAGGTACCTTCCAATCCCCACCT-3') (Sambrook et al., 2011). A 1.1-kb PCR product was obtained from the DNA of each sample using the primers D4-D5 (F: 5'-CCTGTTGCCACCCGCTCTC-3') and D4-D6 (R: 5'-CACCCTCCGCATCCCCAG-3') (Sambrook et al., 2011). A 1.5-kb PCR product was obtained from the DNA of each sample using the primers D4-D8 (F: 5'-CCGTACCTCCACCCACCT-3') and D4-D9 (R: 5'-AGCAGCTGACTCGACCCAG-3') (Stielow et al., 2013). A 1.


## Results
To study the function of the model . brasiliensis LPDs, the entire decarboxylase domain was predicted to be present in all investigated lysates. As expected, P. brasiliensis LPDs were stable in the presence of 1 mM CaCl_2, which resulted in a high level of aromatic acid (Fig 2B). However, the addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 caused a decrease in the extracellular pH of the lysates (Fig 2C). This result is in contrast to that reported for the wild-type LPDs, which showed no pH change (Fig 1C). The lysates of P. brasiliensis LPDs with the addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 exhibited a significant increase in pH values (Fig 2D). This result suggests that CaCl_2 influences pH regulation of LPDs, as previously reported [21].

In order to investigate whether P. brasiliensis LPDs could be an alternative to the classical LPDs in the pH-dependent system, we tested the effect of the addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 on the pH of lysates of P. brasiliensis LPDs. As shown in Fig 2E, the addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 caused a significant decrease in the extracellular pH of the lysates of P. brasiliensis LPDs, and a similar effect was also observed for the wild-type LPDs. The addition of 1 mM CaCl_2, however, did not cause a significant change in pH values (Fig 2F).

P. brasiliensis LPDs influence the pH of LPSs
We next wanted to investigate whether P. brasiliensis LPDs affected the pH of LPSs by influencing the activity of lysates. pH-responsive lysates were incubated with 1 mM CaCl_2 or the addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 for 24 h, and pH was determined by comparing the pH values between the LPSs and the wild-type LPDs. As shown in Fig 3A, addition of 1 mM CaCl_2 affected the pH values significantly, with a pH value of 8.2. However, addition of 1 mM CaCl_2, which caused a pH value of 8.


## Discussion
Indeed, a multidrug resistance mechanism in . pombe has been described [28]. However, the mechanism that inhibits the efflux pump from the plasma membrane has not been reported yet, and the mechanism for the mechanism that inhibits the efflux pump from the plasma membrane has not been established yet.

The rate of C. albicans-induced efflux in the intracellular environment was increased by more than 50% in response to calcium addition. In addition, the rate of C. albicans-induced C. neoformans-induced C. albicans-induced C. neoformans-induced cells was increased by more than 30% in response to C. neoformans infection. The rate of C. neoformans-induced C. albicans-induced C. neoformans-induced cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C. albicans infection. The rate of C. albicans-induced C. neoformans-induced C. albicans-induced cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C. neoformans infection.

The activity of the efflux pump in C. albicans is thought to be regulated by the presence of sodium channel transporters, sodium-potassium channel transporters, and the efflux pump to the plasma membrane [29]. In C. albicans, the efflux pump plays an important role in the regulation of its plasma membrane functions [30]. The efflux pump is a sodium-potassium channel transporter that is present in the plasma membrane of C. albicans cells and can be induced by intracellular Ca^2+ [31]. In the present study, the rate of C. albicans-induced C. albicans-induced C. albicans cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C. albicans infection. The rate of C. albicans-induced C. albicans-induced cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C. albicans infection. The rate of C. neoformans-induced C. neoformans-induced C. neoformans cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C. neoformans infection. The rate of C. neoformans-induced C. neoformans-induced C. neoformans cells was increased by more than 50% in response to C.
