## Abstract
The B6-like protein kinase (BKA) family is essential for growth and differentiation of many organisms. In fungi, BKA is a major regulator of the response to virulence factor(s) such as the fungus Candida albicans, and kinase B (Kbk) is a major regulator of hyphal growth and melanization of sensitive and melanized seeds in humans. In the pathogenic yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, the BKA of the central nervous system is required for the maintenance of the capsule and mating, as well as for the growth and virulence of the yeast toward implanted medicals. We report that the BKA of the spleen is essential for the survival of C. neoformans in the mammalian host C. albicans. The capsule is induced during the sexual development of C. neoformans, and the cAMP levels are high for this stimulus. A murine model of the murine inhalation infection caused by C. neoformans infection is shown to have a unique BKA, and this finding may explain the specific responses of the fungal cells to the antifungal drug itraconazole. This model is also compatible with the specific role of BKA in the virulence of C. neoformans. Taken together, our findings reveal that the fungal cell integrity B-protein kinase B is essential for the survival and growth of C. neoformans to the antifungal drug itraconazole.


## Introduction
The infection usually occurs in immunocompromised hosts such as patients with severe bacterial or fungal infections [6. Cr. neoformans is a facultative intracellular fungus that lives on the skin and in the lung, in the alveoli of the lung, and in the soil. It can be inhaled by the human host and, if not localized, it can disseminate to the central nervous system and cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis.

Cr. neoformans is a facultative intracellular fungus that exists in the form of yeast or hyphal cells. It can survive inside the host cell or in the environment and can escape from the host cell. The fungus can also survive in a variety of non-virulent forms such as the form of a dormant form, the dimorphic form, or the pathogenic yeast form. There are approximately 15,000 identified species of yeast and dimorphic fungi, with a wide array of environmental conditions for growth and reproduction [7]. It has been hypothesized that the dimorphic form is more virulent than the pathogenic yeast form, and Cr. neoformans is a major cause of human infections. In addition, there is growing evidence that the dimorphic form is also responsible for infections in immunocompromised hosts [8].

Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection that is caused by the encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. C. neoformans causes life-threatening pneumonia and can disseminate to the central nervous system to cause meningoencephalitis [9]. There are two varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans: var. grubii and var. neoformans. The serotypes VNI, VNII, and VNB are responsible for most human cryptococcal infections. The other serotypes are VNBI, VNBIe, and VNHP. C. neoformans infections are more common in immunocompromised hosts. C. neoformans infection is thought to be acquired through inhalation, and the pathogen can survive and replicate within the host cell. This fungus is able to cause disease in an animal host such as pigs or mice.

It has been reported that cryptococcosis is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised hosts.


## Methods
Isolation of Cryptococcus
The isolate was isolated from a patient with a syndrome involving cough and bronchial leakage, and was maintained in the laboratory at the Department of Clinical Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Pretoria. The isolate was also maintained at 4 Â°C.

Preparation of Cryptococcus
In order to isolate Cryptococcus, we used the DMSO method [37] in our current study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Pretoria.

Isolation of Cryptococcus
The protocol was carried out according to the procedures previously described by Sathu, et al. [39].

## Discussion
However, the immunosuppressive effects of Cryptococcus in animals have been reported to be reduced in animal models [4,8,9. The current study provides the first experimental evidence of reduced CD4 T cell counts in C. neoformans in a human patient with cryptococcal meningitis. The cryptococcal infection in these animals was characterized by a decreased ability of CD4 T cells to persist in the blood, as well as a decreased ability of CD4 T cells to proliferate in the presence of antifungal agents, which is consistent with previous studies [8,9]. The absence of detectable increases in CD4 T cell counts in these animals, which suggests that C. neoformans does not have the ability to proliferate in these animals, is also consistent with a decreased ability of these cells to proliferate in these animals. Thus, these animals have been shown to have reduced CD4 T cell counts, consistent with the absence of cell proliferation, as well as a decreased ability of CD4 T cells to proliferate in the presence of antifungal agents, which is consistent with a decreased ability of these cells to proliferate in these animals. We hypothesize that a decrease in CD4 T cell numbers in the host may be responsible for the decreased ability of these cells to proliferate in the presence of antifungal agents. This possibility is further supported by the fact that the ability of these cells to proliferate in the presence of antifungal agents has been shown to be reduced in animal models [4].

Our study demonstrates that C. neoformans is able to proliferate in the lungs and brain in a murine model of cryptococcosis. This finding is in line with previous studies that have shown that the ability of C. neoformans to proliferate in the lungs and brain is decreased in animals infected with C. gattii [4,8]. The reduction of C. gattii infection in the lungs is in line with previous studies that have found that the ability of C. neoformans to proliferate in the lungs and brain is decreased in animals infected with C. gattii [4,8]. The lungs and brain of these animals were also shown to be a more likely site of infection [4]. This finding is in line with previous studies that have shown that C.
