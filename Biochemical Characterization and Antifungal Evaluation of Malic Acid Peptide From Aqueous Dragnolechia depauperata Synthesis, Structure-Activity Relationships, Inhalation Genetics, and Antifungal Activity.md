## Abstract
II, N. 1, January 1996.

The detailed synthesis of the first class of ß-fructose dihydrofolate monooxygenases, that does not use l-fructose as a substrate, was demonstrated by efficient in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of l-fructose in crude extracts. Among the enzymes, the oleanolic acid esterase and the ß-glucosidase (pg2050), with the corresponding linear antibiotic 1,2,4-dihydroxydrofuran-2-one were identified as potent antimicrobial peptides, which also showed a high-level antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of the phytochemically synthesized ß-glucosidase enzyme and the antimicrobial activity of the ß-glucosidase enzymes (pg2051 and p.6035) were evaluated by MIC and MFC values.

The broad spectrum antifungal activity of the phytochemically synthesized ß-glucosidase enzyme and the ß-glucosidase enzyme was characterized by the quantification of eleven differentially hydrated phenyl groups in the ß-glucosidase enzyme extracts. The quantification of the methyl groups in the ß-glucosidase enzyme extracts showed that these enzymes are of similar working order except for p.6035, which has a methyl group of N-pentadecyl-3-one in the p.6035 and p.6035 p.6035 extracts. The MIC values of the ß-glucosidase enzyme and the ß-glucosidase enzyme extracts were determined for the purpose of assessing the activity of these enzymes. The MIC values for the phytochemically synthesized ß-glucosidase enzyme and the ß-glucosidase enzyme extracts were determined for the purpose of assessing the activities of these enzymes.

The results of the study showed that the phytochemically synthesized ß-glucosidase enzyme extracts had good activity against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. The extract with the best activity was further tested for its effect on the activity of the extract with the lowest MIC value.

## Introduction
The genus Dictyosporium was established by E.M. Shilton (1895) to accommodate eudicots, and for which only four species have been recognized: D. iranianum (formerly D. cepacia), D. vinum, D. stenoceras, and D. nomius (Ellis 1971, Prentice et al. 1978). Today, D. iranianum and D. vinum are the most commonly isolated species in this genus, and are among the most common diploid species (Ellis 1971, Prentice et al. 1978). Dictyosporium depauperata is the most common diploid species of Dictyosporium, asexual morph of which more than 80% of them are species of other genera (Sutton 1980, Parr et al. 1994). Diploid fungi, which are highly polyphyletic, are not restricted to ascomycetes (Gill and Talbot 2011). However, diploid fungi have also been reported in other groups, including Dothideomycetes, Histoplacomycetes, and Agaricomycetes (Sutton 1980, Sivanesan 1987).

The genus Dictyosporium was initially described by S.M. Shivas (1892) based on D. iranianum, and later S.M. Shivas (1894) re-examined the morphological characteristics of the newly discovered species and accepted D. iranianum, D. vinum, D. nomius, and D. cepacia as the type species of Dictyosporium. Subsequently, numerous studies on Dictyosporium have been conducted (Ngamskulrungroj et al. 2002, Atsumi et al. 2008, Suen et al. 2012).


## Methods
Sample Collection and Isolation of Fungal Isolates
The sample collection of a 3-year-old and four-year-old C. laurentii isolate (n = 19) and of a C. albicans isolate (n = 12) from a child ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU-FREU) was considered in this study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Federal University of Uberlândia (CEUA/UFU-FREU).

Sample Collection and Isolation of Fungal Isolates
All fungal isolates were collected from patients who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital between January 2010 and December 2013. The samples were randomly collected from the sites of the patients’ wounds and from the clinical beds in order to avoid contamination of the host. Each sample was stored in sterile 1L bottles and stored in sterile containers in the freezer at 4 °C.

The study was approved by the Ethical and Scientific Review Committees of the Federal University of Uberlândia (CEUA/UFU-FREU). The samples were transported to the Federal University of Uberlândia Hospital and the University of São Paulo (UFU-SPSP) for DNA extraction and/or storage in sterile 1L bottles.


## Results
Aqueous-dextrose was first dissolved in 1% SDS at room temperatur. The quinazolinone was dissolved in 10% SDS at room temperature for 5 h. The quinazolinone was dissolved in 2% SDS at room temperature for 60 h. The elution process was performed on a YPD plate with 2.5% SDS for 10 min. The elution concentration of quinazolinone was determined by the following formula: The elution concentration of quinazolinone was 32.5 mg/mL.

The crystal structure of the quinazolinone derivative was first confirmed by ^1H NMR spectroscopic method (Fig 1). The ^13C NMR spectrum of the quinazolinone derivative revealed the presence of two characteristic resonances, four doublets, two triplets, three pentons, two quaternary carbons, and one decibers. The doublets were assigned to the proton (5.7 ppm, 9.1 ppm, and 6.1 ppm) and the electron (31.4 ppm, 23.3 ppm, and 8.6 ppm) resonances, respectively. The decibers were assigned to the proton (7.7 ppm, 7.6 ppm, and 6.1 ppm) and the electron (27.5 ppm, 22.4 ppm, and 4.6 ppm) resonances, respectively. The quinazolinone peak (12.2 ppm, 14.3 ppm, and 7.2 ppm) was assigned to the proton (2.8 ppm, 1.5 ppm, and 1.9 ppm) and the electron (15.3 ppm, 12.2 ppm, and 9.1 ppm) peak was assigned to the decibers (3.4 ppm, 5.7 ppm, and 7.8 ppm). The quinazolinone peak (8.1 ppm, 2.9 ppm, and 6.1 ppm) was assigned to the proton (15.3 ppm, 11.2 ppm, and 5.


## Discussion
The ^13C-NMR spectrum of the crude malic acid (1) was determined as a spectrum of the peptide of the genus Alafimonaspora, and the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the crude malic acid (2) was as a spectrum of the sugar from . caproni, and the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the crude malic acid (3) was as a spectrum of the sugar from A. pullulans. The ^13C-NMR spectrum of the crude malic acid (4) was as a spectrum of the crude sugar from A. pullulans, and the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the crude malic acid (5) was as a spectrum of the crude sugar from A. pullulans.

The theoretical production of crude malic acid by A. pullulans was determined using the SPRANCOAT method. The maximum yield of crude malic acid was achieved when the concentrations of the synthesized sugar were increased to 1.2 and 5.0 g L^-1 and the synthesized sugar was subjected to the TLC method. The crude malic acid yield was calculated using the SPRANCOAT method. The maximum yield was obtained when the concentration of the synthesized sugar was increased to 1.0 g L^-1 and the synthesized sugar was subjected to the TLC method. The theoretical yield of crude malic acid was calculated using the SPRANCOAT method.

The reactions in the synthesized malic acid were carried out by the formation of amide-loaded amide-thiols (AMTS) from the amino acid residues of the malic acid and the amino acid residues of the branched chain. The synthesized sugar was subjected to the TLC method and the reactions were carried out by the formation of ammonium sulfate (AMTS) from the amino acid residues of the malic acid. The synthesized sugar was subjected to the TLC method and the reactions were carried out by the formation of ammonium nitrate (AMN) from the amino acid residues of the malic acid. The synthesized sugar was subjected to the TLC method and the reactions were carried out by the formation of ammonium sulfate (AMN-S) from the amino acid residues of the malic acid.
