## Abstract
The expression of the Yap1 ortholog in Streptococcus suis and the expression of the bmVTL, which encodes a transmembrane protein, aceA, in the promoter of the Yap1 gene were investigated in this study. We found that the Yap1 expression profile was similar between the S. suis and strain with the bmVTL, and the expression levels were higher in the S. suis hygromycin culture medium. In addition, Yap1 expression was induced when the S. suis was grown in a medium supplemented with the methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or in a treatment with MeJA alone. When the Yap1 expression was investigated in the presence of co-housing-initiated methyl octahycamylglycerol (CMH) in the promoter, we found that the expression of the Yap1 protein was significantly up-regulated in the presence of CMH in the promoter. In addition, the co-initiated CMH in the promoter of the Yap1 protein was found to increase the Yap1 expression levels. The expression levels of the Yap1 ortholog in non-neutropenic, plant-beneficial, and insect- beneficial strains were also increased in response to MeJA treatment.


## Introduction
Nocardia are a group of filamentous fungi which belong to the family of euploid filamentous fungi, which are classified as Nocardia (1). Nocardia can be classified into 2 main groups, which are described as members of the subphylum Oenothermium, and non-subphylum, that are not part of the subphylum Oenotherm. The first classification was proposed by Hawksworth in 1963 and proposed by Vizzini and Von Teijnsland in 1962 (2). It is accepted that most species of Nocardia, which are classified as non-subphylactic, non-phylogenetic, non-mammalian, and ectothermic fungi, belong to the order Phyllosticta (3).

The genus Nocardia was first proposed by Hawksworth (4) in 1894 as a member of the subphylum Oenotherm. Later, Hawksworth (5) and von Höhnel (6) accepted species from Oenotherm, O.barbadens, O.chalybaudia, O.decapitus, O.digosoria, O.chalarus, O.chalybauda, and O.dimersus (3). The genus Nocardia was first proposed by Vizzini and von Höhnel (6) in 1957. Later, von Höhnel (7) proposed the genus Oenotherm (subphylum Oenotherm), which was later divided into five sections, namely Oenothermaeori, Oenothermaeori, Oenothermaeosporium, Oenothermaeospora, and Oenothermaeospora. The first five sections, namely Acanthamoeba, Alveolus, Albugo, A.paraguay, A.montagnei, A.marmelos, A.mackayii, A.nidulans, A.mcclurei, A.


## Methods
Cells and culture conditions
A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. B. dermatitidis strains used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), and 1% streptomycin-GST (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA). The P. brasiliensis A1163 reference strain was used in all experiments. The wild-type strain (A. fumigatus AF293) and the deletion mutant (A. fumigatus D1/A. fumigatus D1) were used as controls for gene deletion experiments.

Yeast strains and plasmids
All strains were generated by amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using PCR and Sanger sequencing.


## Results
In addition, the content of VOCs was observed to be significantly higher in the candidacidal FITC Mycolog Checklist, with .46% and 6.32% VOCs, respectively. VOCs from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FITC Mycolog Checklist were identified as a significantly higher concentration of VOCs (P < 0.05) in the five-day-old candidacidal culture of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, compared to the Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus FITC Mycolog Checklist (Fig 3).

In the Candida albicans Mycolog Checklist, VOCs from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FITC Mycolog Checklist were identified as a significant higher concentration of VOCs (P < 0.05) in the four-day-old candidacidal culture of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, compared to the Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus FITC Mycolog Checklist (Fig 3).

Candida albicans Mycolog Checklist, VOCs from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FITC Mycolog Checklist, were identified as a significantly higher concentration of VOCs (P < 0.05) in the candidacidal culture of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, compared to the Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus FITC Mycolog Checklist (Fig 3).

In the Candida albicans Mycolog Checklist, VOCs from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FITC Mycolog Checklist, were identified as a significantly higher concentration of VOCs (P < 0.05) in the candidacidal culture of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, compared to the Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus FITC Mycolog Checklist (Fig 3).

In the Candida albicans Mycolog Checklist, VOCs from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FITC Mycolog Checklist, were identified as a significantly higher concentration of VOCs (P < 0.


## Discussion
In addition, VOCs from . cenocepacia strain VNI also contain microbial VOCs from Pseudomonas syringae strain B77, which was the most common VOC from Uganda [30]. In addition, VOCs from Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 750 were also found in P. brasiliensis strain H99 and also from the lung of a patient with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [31].

Microbial VOCs and VOCs derived from human fungal pathogens have been detected in several clinical samples [32]. In addition, VOCs of several Aspergillus species were detected in the human fungal pathogens Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus [33]. Several Aspergillus species have been detected in the environment, including several species of Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus gattii [34]. Similarly, the VOCs of fungi were detected in the intestine of a patient with an intestinal tract infection [35]. Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in the intestinal tract of a patient with an intestinal tract infection [36]. Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in the intestines of a patient with intestinal tract infection [37]. The VOCs of A. fumigatus were detected in the intestine of a patient with an intestinal tract infection [38].

In addition to the reported fungal pathogens, the main VOCs derived from yeast, filamentous fungi and viruses were also detected in the human fungal pathogens C. neoformans and C. gattii. These VOCs are mainly derived from the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be involved in human fungal infection and fungal infection of the mucosal surface of the skin [39]. Cryptococcus neoformans was reported to be involved in the infection of the urinary tract of patients with cystic fibrosis [40].

VOCs of yeast, filamentous fungi and viruses were also detected in the oral mucosa of a patient with a bacterial infection [41]. The VOCs of fungi were also detected in the saliva of a patient with acute bacterial colitis [42].
