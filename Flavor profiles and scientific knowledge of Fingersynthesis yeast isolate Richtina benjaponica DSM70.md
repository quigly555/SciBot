## Abstract
We report a case of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in a child with severe immunosuppression. Immunosuppressors are known to have therapeutic and prophylactic effects in patients with fungal infections. However, the impact of immunosuppressors on patient outcomes is still poorly understood.

A 12-year-old boy developed severe aspergillosis with pulmonary involvement in the left upper lobe. Due to the growing size of the lesion, the patient was referred to the tertiary referral hospital in Shanghai, China for antimycotic treatment. After that, the patient had multiple organ failures and was diagnosed as having pulmonary cryptococcosis. Although the initial diagnosis was asymptomatic, the second was diagnosed with cryptococcosis with granulomatous lesions growing on the left side of the body, and then the third diagnosis was based on the skin lesion size and microscopic results.


## Introduction
The genus Fusarium (Zionaceae) includes a large number of saprobic, ascomycetous, and nematode-trapping fungi. Many of these fungi are ascomycetous, which are able to cause serious diseases on plants, animals, and other eukaryotic organisms, including some in the nematode-trapping fungi. Some of them are ascomycetous and can cause serious health problems. In particular, the human-associated species Fusarium equiseti and F. oxysporum can cause serious infections in the human host, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), such as renal transplant patients [1,2]. These fungi are often isolated from intensive care units, and have been found in deep and infiltrating sites, often in the lungs and skin of patients [3,4]. The clinical importance of these fungi has been recognized as a complication of intensive care unit placement, especially in the elderly patients and those receiving intravascular [5]. In addition, a few species have been identified from various eukaryotic species and tissues, including some non-nematode-trapping fungi, such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sporothrix schenkii [6,7].

The genus Fusarium includes several species of genera such as Fusarium, Sclerotinia, Penicillium, Trichoderma, and Trichoderma that cause economically important diseases on various plant species [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. In addition to these genera, the number of ascomycetous and nematode-trapping fungi has been recognized as a problem in the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum [15]. Species of the Fusarium genus are mainly found in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Arctic and Antarctic regions [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. However, the distribution of F.


## Methods
sympodialis genom. The M. sympodialis genome was deposited at the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/M. sympodialis/). The M. sympodialis genome sequence has been deposited at the NCBI GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/M. sympodialis/GenBank).

M. sympodialis genome assembly and annotation
Genome assemblies were downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) and assembled with the M. sympodialis genome software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/M. sympodialis/GenBank/) on an assembly server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/assembler.html). The M. sympodialis genome assembly is available at the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/M. sympodialis/GenBank/) with the accession numbers of sequences generated in this study (Table 1). The genome annotation and annotation has been conducted with the genome annotation tool of the M. sympodialis genome (https://molevol.org/wiki/Annotation_tool_of_M. sympodialis/Molevol_Guide/Annotation_tool_of_M. sympodialis_Guide).

Phylogenetic analysis of M. sympodialis-GFP-binding protein
The M. sympodialis-GFP-binding protein sequence was retrieved from the M. sympodialis-GFP reference genome. The protein sequences of M. sympodialis-GFP-binding proteins from the M. sympodialis-GFP reference genome were retrieved from the M. sympodialis-GFP annotation service (http://molevol.org/wiki/Molevol_Guide_of_M. sympodialis/Molevol_Guide_of_M. sympodialis_Guide). The predicted proteins from M. sympodialis-GFP-binding protein sequences were obtained from the M. sympodialis-GFP annotation service (http://molevol.


## Results
1 strain, which is not characterized by Finger-type L-sphingolipid activity, were selected as non-host plant-pathogenic strain. We observed that the moderate Finger-type activity of CBS738.41 strain (100.0%) and CBS738.41 strain (99.0%) could be attributed to a reduced ability of the CBS738.41 strain to grow in the presence of xylose and xylitol as a sole carbon source, and the CBS738.41 strain could also grow in the presence of xylose and xylitol, but they could not grow in the presence of xylitol or xylitol. This phenotype could be due to the lack of xylose, xylitol and xylitol assimilatory enzymes, which were required for production of the preferred carbon sources. The non-host plant-pathogenic strains CBS738.41 and CBS738.41 were obtained from the same geographical area, and the non-host plant-pathogenic strain CBS738.41 was obtained from a commercial, sterile feeding farm.

As shown in Figure 3, CBS738.41 strain was not found to be pathogenic to humans or animals (Figure 4). The pathogenicity of CBS738.41 strain to humans, animals and plants was demonstrated by the ability to survive in the presence of xylose and xylitol, and the presence of xylose and xylitol as sole carbon sources, and by the ability of CBS738.41 strain to survive in the presence of xylose and xylitol, but the lack of xylose and xylitol in the CBS738.41 strain could be attributed to its inability to grow in the presence of xylose and xylitol, which were toxic to the human cells.

In order to evaluate the potential plant-pathogenic activity of CBS738.41 strain, the ability of CBS738.41 strain to survive in the presence of xylose and xylitol was evaluated. CBS738.41 strain was able to survive in the presence of xylose and xylitol, and the lack of xylose and xylitol in the CBS738.41 strain could be attributed to its inability to grow in the presence of xylose and xylitol.


## Discussion
The . benjaponica strain DSM7066 was isolated from marine bryophytes (C. schenckii, C. tropicalis) and algae (C. famata) (Table 3). Richtina strain DSM7066 exhibited a good fermenting profile for BCAAs, from two gels: a medium containing about 18 g/L glutaraldehyde and a mixture of both (Table 3). The inhibitory effect of BCAAs was higher in the medium containing the glutaraldehyde (50 mg/L) than the mixture of both (Figure 1A).

2.4. Fruits and Other Flavonoids
P. ferrea was isolated from fruit and floral flowers (Table 3). It was characterized by its high inhibitory activity against the yeasts Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, with MIC values of 0.5 µg/mL, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, with MIC values of 0.125 µg/mL [15]. P. ferrea has been isolated from three different types of fruits: mango (Munro), pear (Pomelo), and apple (Pomelo). The antimicrobial activity of this species is due to the inhibition of the enzyme, Pseudomonas syringae, by P. ferrea [16]. The activity of P. ferrea against Staphylococcus aureus was only weakly active against rice cultivar (MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL), but was very effective against barley cultivar (MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL) [17].

2.5. Fruits and Other Flavonoids
The phytochemicals, such as flavonols, phenols, and terpenoids are mainly responsible for the high content of Fruits in our study. Some of the flavonoids (mainly flavanols, flavones, and flavones) are abundant in fruits and can be toxic to mammalian cells and the environment [18]. The flavonols are naturally occurring in fruits, and can be produced by some plant species such as Quercus, C. victoriae, and R. commune [19]. Some of these flavonols were isolated from different fruits, including peach, pear, grape, pear juice, and mango [20].
