## Abstract
The antimicrobial activity of Lavandula angustifolium leaves extracts against various microorganisms were evaluated by broth micro-dilution checkerboard and time-kill curve analysis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's method for the detection of non-target organisms. The minimal effective concentration (MEC) was determined to be 10 times less than the control. The time-kill curve was determined to be non-specific and non-specific, with a near limit of detection of 10 times. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined as 16.5 mg/mL. The MIC50 and MEC50 values were 0.08 and 0.24 mg/mL, respectively. The time-kill curves were determined for Lavandula angustifolium, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. The minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were 0.25 mg/mL and 1.25 mg/mL, respectively. The time-kill curves were determined for Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were 0.25 mg/mL and 0.08 mg/mL, respectively. The MFC values were determined for all the tested isolates. The results suggested that the use of L. angustifolium leaves extracts as antiviral agents against C. neoformans infection in clinical practice.


## Introduction
Histoplasmosis is a disease that is commonly caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The infection is acquired from the environment through inhalation of spores or conidia. The spores germinate into yeast cells that invade the lung tissue, invade the lymph nodes, and then invade the central nervous system (CNS) in a multisystemic infection. There is no vaccine, and immunization is currently available to prevent or treat this disease. Treatment of histoplasmosis is difficult because there are no diagnostic tools to detect Histoplasma. The best estimate is that there are approximately 500,000 cases of histoplasmosis each year worldwide, but a recent study estimated that there are approximately 400,000 to 1,200,000 cases of histoplasmosis in the United States alone (1).

We herein report a case of a patient with idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia (CD4)+ lymphopenia, chronic low platelet count, and lower total and granuloma volume as a result of histoplasmosis.


## Methods
Briefly, the sample was subjected to .5 mL of liquid CDA medium in the presence of fungi and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant (25 mL) was added to an incubation chamber. After the incubation period, the samples were washed with distilled water and vortexed. The cells were transferred into the CDA media (PAA) media and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was suspended in 1 mL of CDA medium to a final concentration of 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL. The suspension was then subjected to enzymatic lysis with acid-washed 0.5 mL of the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% NP40, 0.25 M EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was suspended in 1 mL of CDA medium to a final concentration of 1 × 10^7 CFU/mL. The suspension was subjected to enzymatic lysis with acid-washed 0.5 mL of the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 0.25 M EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was suspended in 1 mL of CDA medium to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The suspension was subjected to enzymatic lysis with acid-washed 0.5 mL of the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 0.

## Discussion
The Fusarium species complex consists of closely related Fusarium species, and is known to be a very successful commercial production system in the United States and Europe [25]. Based on the research findings of the literature, the presence of Fusarium species is the most common infection in humans, with an incidence of approximately 50% [27]. A review of the literature reveals that the presence of Fusarium species in the United States, Europe, and Australia is associated with its well-known symptoms such as fever, chills, neck stiffness, and neck stiffness requiring intravenous immunoglobulins [28]. In addition, the presence of Fusarium species in the United States is associated with its various physical and psychological effects, including the change in consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and vomiting [29].

The Fusarium species complex was developed to facilitate the production of more effective and environmentally friendly bioproducers. The development of the Fusarium species complex has been successful in generating economical and bioethically beneficial products with diverse production methods such as synthetic bioproducers, ethanol producers, biodegraders, bioethanol producers, and bioethanol-tolerant strains. In this study, three strains of Fusarium species were selected as bioproducers for the production of bioethanol-tolerant and ethanol-tolerant Fusarium strains. The production of bioethanol-tolerant strains was performed in an ethanol-inoculated medium supplemented with an ethanol extract containing ethanol. These strains were then cultured in liquid medium for 24 h and produced bioethanol-tolerant strains, and the bioethanol-tolerant strains were tested for their ability to produce ethanol. These results indicated that the production of bioethanol-tolerant strains could be successfully performed in the laboratory.
