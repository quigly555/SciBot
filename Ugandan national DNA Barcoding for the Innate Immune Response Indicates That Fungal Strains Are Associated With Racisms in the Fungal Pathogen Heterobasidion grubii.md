## Abstract
Polymorphism of the dihydroxynaphthalene-type polyketide synthase Dnm1p from Aspergillus niger has been reported for over 20 polyketides produced by more than 90 genera of fungi. In this study, we investigated the effects of genetic and chemical perturbations of polykaryonase gene loss on Dnm1p production. We constructed yeast Dnm1p mutants with altered growth and conidial morphology. Our results showed that genetic and chemical perturbations of Dnm1p production were dependent on the presence of two different suppressor genes, Dmit1 and Pmt1. Our mutants had defects in the production of secondary metabolites, failed to produce conidia, and had reduced mycelial production. However, our mutants showed growth and conidia production similar to wild-type, with only slight phenotypic defects. These results suggest that genetic and chemical controls of polykaryonase gene loss play a major role in the pathogenicity of A. niger.


## Introduction
These findings demonstrate a crucial distinction between fungi and their eukaryotic relative.

Although the biological diversity of fungal species has been extensively studied, there is a clear distinction between them and their human hosts. Human fungal pathogens usually cause either severe infections, such as blastomycosis and mucormycosis, or superficial infections, such as skin infections and mucormycosis, which are usually more severe and more aggressive than those caused by other pathogenic fungi. Invasive fungal infections are also associated with high mortality rates, particularly in patients with neutropenia [4]. In addition, antifungal drug resistance is increasing, and it is difficult to diagnose or control. Therefore, new strategies are needed to prevent and to prevent fungal infections.

The fungi associated with human infections are considered to be highly diverse, with several species that are difficult to identify and identify. Species in the order Mucorales are considered to be endophytes, saprobic, or “non-pathogenic” [5]. They are found in soil, deadwood, plants, and other organic substrates, but are also found in healthy humans and are generally harmless. The order Mucorales is associated with human infections mainly as a result of its close affinity with humans [6], [7]. Mucoral infections are also caused by mucormycetous fungi of the order Mucorales, but are more common in immunocompromised individuals. These include Rhizopus oryzae, Absidia brevis oryzae, and Absidia fujikuroi [8].

The genus Rhizopus is a phylum of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which includes several species of the order Lepidoptera, including Rhizopus and Phlebotomus, among others [9], [10]. In addition, Rhizopus and Phlebotomus are the etiological agents of several human diseases, including rickettsia and otitis media disease, as well as mucormycosis. Rhizopus pusillus is one of the most important causes of bacteremia in infants and young children worldwide and is responsible for more than 40,000 deaths per year [11].

In fact, there are about 1.


## Methods
Pathology analysis was performed using the Diagnostic Blood Microbiology Laboratory (DMB) method, which is based on culture, morphological, and biochemical methods, and includes analysis of blood culture, conidial suspension, and precipitate of fung. The procedures were performed according to the recommendations of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [8], and the results were obtained from the medical records of each study participant.

Fungal Pathology Analysis
Fungal pathogens were identified by standard laboratory methods (microscopy, culture, and morphological assessment), including sputum staining, Gram-positive staining, and India ink staining. In addition, the clinical characteristics of the studied pathogens were compared with the Fungal Pathology Laboratory of the Medical University of Kuching (MUMK, China) at the School of Public Health, College of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kuching University.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS, USA).

Ethics Statement

All protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kuching University (Procedure 13-08-2016). The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Data Collection
All samples were processed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Laboratory Services protocol (2016) and were stored at -20°C. The data was recorded by the Laboratory Animal Services (LAS) and the study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the School of Medicine, College of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kuching University.

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical regulations of the Association for the Purpose of Life and Health of Animals (AOOLF) and the guidelines of the AOOLF.


## Results
Heterobasidion grubii has previously been described as a fungal pathogen [35], and it is possible that Heterobasidion grubii is a direct pathogen of . graminearum. In this study, we observed that some F. graminearum isolates showed the same morphotypes, even though the isolate was not from the same host. This indicates that the fungus was introduced from a common ancestor.

Based on the above results, we predict that F. graminearum is a dominant fungus in the Fungal community in the F. graminearum pathogen. A possible explanation for this could be the presence of a certain type of fungal species, or a mixture of a certain fungi. For example, the pathogen of F. graminearum, F. verticillioides, has been shown to infect the F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum isolates [36]. The F. verticillioides isolate was reported as having a melanized coloration, a characteristic of the genus Fusarium. The F. verticillioides isolate was found to be isolated from the olive tree and has been associated with a fungal pathogen, F. graminearum [11]. In addition, the F. oxysporum isolate was reported as having a melanized coloration, a characteristic of the genus Fusarium. In the F. graminearum pathogen, the F. verticillioides isolate was reported as having a melanized coloration, a characteristic of the genus Fusarium.

In the present study, we observed that Heterobasidion grubii was isolated from F. graminearum isolates from F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum. The fungus was found to have a white colony, and was found to be easily transported by hand, or by foot, or by plane (Fig 1).

In the present study, F. graminearum isolates were identified as being from F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum. In addition, the fungus was found to be isolated from F. verticillioides and F. verticillioides isolates. The fungus was isolated from the F. verticillioides isolate.


## Discussion
In addition, Rac1 was identified as a highly expressed gene in . antarcticus and H. vitreola (MHL), and was upregulated in H. vitreola and H. eximia. However, its expression is not upregulated in H. eximia and H. vitreola [13].

The present study found that H. eximia was induced to produce a large amount of IL-17 when incubated with HSV-1. The H. eximia-inducing factor (HIF) pathway and the H. eximia-inducing factor (HIF) pathway were also activated in the same manner, and the process was also more efficient in H. eximia-treated HSV-1-infected mice.

Our results also showed that H. eximia-infected HSV-1-infected mice showed increased production of IL-17 and increased production of IL-17-IL-15, which are indicators of Th17 cell activity [14], [15]. Thus, H. eximia-infected HSV-1-infected mice were significantly more efficient in controlling H. eximia-induced IL-17 production in H. eximia-infected mice, which is similar to that observed in the study of Lozani et al. [16]. IL-17 production has been correlated with the severity of acute leukemia [17] and is also associated with the development of T cell responses to HSV-1 [18], [19]. HSV-1 induces IL-17 production in H. eximia-infected mice, which is also the result of the increased production of IL-17 in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mice. We also observed that H. eximia-infected H. eximia-stimulated IL-17 production was associated with the severity of chronic granulomatous disease, which is a rare disease in immunosuppressed patients [20].

In our study, H. eximia-infected HSV-1-infected mice were significantly more efficient in controlling the H. eximia-induced IL-17 production in H. eximia-infected H.
