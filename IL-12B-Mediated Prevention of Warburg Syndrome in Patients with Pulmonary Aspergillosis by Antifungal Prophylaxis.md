## Abstract
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an abundant and diverse cell wall polysaccharide which has been implicated in the action of many diseases, including cancer, HIV, malaria, and many more. It is also found in many agricultural, biomedical, and veterinary fields. However, the mechanisms of HA accumulation and function during cancer are still unclear. In this study, we found that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to HA had enhanced sensitivity to the concomitant hyper-proliferative stress of UV-B and oxidative stress. Furthermore, HA accumulated in the nucleus and nucleus not only of cancer cells, but also in other cells and the endothelial lining. This was also observed when the cells were treated with HA. Interestingly, our results showed that hyaluronan and myric pentasparedoxin (MPI) stimulated expression of the P1 and P2B1 genes in tumor cells, while HA accumulated in the nucleus was not detected. Interestingly, hyaluronan and MPI-stimulated the yeast-like colon in human mononuclear cells exposed to UV-B, while MPI-stimulated HA accumulated in the nucleus. Taken together, our results suggested that HA accumulated in the nucleus of cancer cells exerts an enhanced proinflammatory and antioxidant activity during chemotherapy.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients in both developing and developing countries [1]. While the mortality rate is low in developing countries, the overall number of deaths due to fungal infections in HIV-infected patients is higher than in the general population [2]. Globally, there are approximately 500,000 deaths annually due to fungal infections [3], and the overall number of new infections is expected to increase every year [4]. In developing countries, the incidence of fungal infections is on the rise, and these infections are estimated to account for more than one-third of all new cases in 2017 [5].

Though fungal infections are not well-characterized, these infections can cause severe morbidity and mortality. Because of the limited number of antifungal drugs available, treatment of fungal infections is limited in many parts of the world. In the United States, the treatment of fungal infections remains a challenge. Treatment of fungal infections is particularly challenging in Southern California, where the mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 40% in cases of invasive aspergillosis [6].

The first-line regimen for the management of invasive fungal infections is azoles, which are used in combination with amphotericin B. Azoles are the first-line treatment option for invasive fungal infections in the United States. However, due to the emergence of drug-resistant fungi, the number of recommended initial antifungal therapy has been limited in the United States [7]. The number of effective antifungal agents has been reduced in the Pacific Northwest region, where azoles are still the preferred first-line therapy for invasive fungal infections [8, 9].


## Methods

## Results
Treatment of patients with PMT or cryptococcal infection increased the risk of developing pulmonary aspergillosis, as well as increased mortality (Table 3. Treatment of patients with PMT or cryptococcal infection had no effect on the incidence of lung cancer, nor on the incidence of lung cancer by other causes (Table 3). Therefore, treatment with PMT or cryptococcal infection was safe and effective in our study.

An In vivo Study of the Effects of Antifungal Prophylaxis on the Characteristics of Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Pulmonary Patients With Pulmonary Aspergillosis
To study the effects of antifungal prophylaxis on the characteristics of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, we used BALB/c mice as the control group. After 24 hours of drug therapy, BALB/c mice were euthanized and fungal cultures were collected. After 14 days of drug therapy, no significant differences were observed in the fungal burden, fungal burdens in the lungs, and fungal burdens in the spleen (p = 0.96 and p = 0.82, respectively; Fig 1a). In contrast, there was a significant increase in the fungal burden in the spleen and a significant decrease in the fungal burden in the lungs, and both were significantly reduced in the lungs compared with the control group (Fig 1b). These data indicate that treatment with antifungal prophylaxis increases the risk of developing pulmonary aspergillosis.

Infection with Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common cause of infection in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, followed by cryptococcal infection. Treatment with azole prophylaxis (200 mg/day for 2 days) was recommended for patients with cryptococcal infection; however, treatment with nevirapine (500 mg/day) was not effective. After 14 days of drug therapy, cryptococcal infection was diagnosed in 77.9% (73/115) of the patients. Treatment with nevirapine (500 mg/day) was ineffective in 67.5% (73/115) of patients.
