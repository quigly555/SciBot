## Abstract
Naganishia albida is a widely distributed and used pathogen for the production of melioidosis and meningitis. This yeast-like fungus is a commensal organism that is common to most of its habitat, especially in humans. However, it can be found in healthy individuals, where it causes mild symptoms. A literature survey of 18 cases of human Naganishia albida confirmed human infection in Singapore over a 12-year period. In most of the cases, the causative agent was a rare human-transmitted pathogen, echinocandin-resistant N. albida was isolated from clinical specimens and was reported with apparent genital involvement. We report two cases of genital nystagmus in which the causative agent was identified as N. albida. We also report the first case of genital frank vulvising pancytheism in which the causative agent was also identified as N. albida.


## Introduction
The use of novel antifungal compounds has increased dramatically over the past decades due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In fact, azoles are a new class of antifungal agents that have gained widespread attention because of their therapeutic value and good safety profile [1]. Azoles are a class of structurally different molecules, with a wide variety of modes of action, which are useful for drug design [2]. Among them, the triazoles are the most widely used agents in the clinic; these agents are mainly active against planktonic cells, fungi, and bacteria, whereas they are mostly active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [3].

The mechanisms of action of triazoles against fungi are complex and include cell membrane permeability, membrane trap formation, biofilm formation, and the cell wall integrity (CWI) [4]. Furthermore, the triazoles mainly inhibit the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, a process crucial for fungal survival [5].

In addition to ergosterol, the major sterols in fungi, which are essential for viability, are sterol 35 and ergosterol, which are structurally different from other sterols, such as cholesterol, which are biosynthesized by sterol 14a-demethylase [6].

CWI is a cell membrane permeability-related phenomenon that depends on the concentration of C12.


## Methods
Strains and media
The wild-type strain of A. fumigatus (ATCC 32045) was used as the parental strain to study the effects of temperature on gene expression. The gene encoding glycosylation of the ß-tubulin gene was amplified from pJET1.2 with primers fl1 and fl2 [51]. The PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by sequence analysis. The purified PCR product was sequenced. The sequence of the wild-type strain is presented in Figure 1.

To determine the gene copy number of A. fumigatus strains, gene copy numbers were determined from the copy number of the parental strain by calculating the number of copies of the gene in the wild-type strain by the number of copies of the gene in the mutant strain. The A. fumigatus gene copy number was defined as the number of copies of the gene in the wild-type strain, whereas the gene copy number in the mutant strain is the number of copies of the gene in the wild-type strain.

Western blot
For Western blot, cells were treated with the indicated antibodies (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4°C for 10 min. After the addition of 1× Laemmli buffer, the blot was developed with the DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method and the protein concentration determined with the Bradford method.


## Results
% (n = 41) of the patients were positive for pathogen-specific antibodies (Figure 3A), including . bassiana, B. subtilis, B. neoformans, and B. infundibuliforme. These results were significantly different from the negative results of blood culture in the patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies. The results of the test were also similar to the blood culture results in patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies (Figure 3B). These results are similar to the results obtained by direct assays on blood cultures of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood cultures of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies.

The results of the test are also similar to the results obtained by direct tests on blood cultures of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood cultures of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood cultures of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. subtilis-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B. bassiana-specific antibodies and blood culture results in blood culture of patients who received B.


## Discussion
This study has not been conducted before in the Hematologic Treatment of Patients with AID. We found that the time to onset of symptoms of AIDS was significantly longer in patients with a significant risk of developing invasive disease (P = 0.5). This finding is consistent with that of Cai et al. [16] who found that the risk of invasive disease was significantly higher in patients with advanced AIDS. Another study conducted in Thailand demonstrated that the time to onset of symptoms of AIDS was significantly longer in patients with AIDS and that it was significantly longer in patients with advanced AIDS. The time to onset of symptoms of AIDS was significantly longer in patients with AIDS. This finding is consistent with that of Zhao et al. [17] who found that the time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with advanced AIDS.

In our study, we found that the time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with a significant risk of developing invasive disease (P = 0.5). This finding is consistent with that of Cai et al. [16] who found that the risk of invasive disease was significantly higher in patients with advanced AIDS.

Previous studies [2, 18, 19, 20] and this study [21] have reported that patients with AIDS have a higher risk of invasive disease in comparison to those without AIDS. We found that the time to onset of symptoms of AIDS was significantly longer in patients with advanced AIDS and that the time to onset of symptoms of AIDS was significantly longer in patients with AIDS. The time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with AIDS compared to those without AIDS. We found that the time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with AIDS compared to those without AIDS. The time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with AIDS compared to those without AIDS. The time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with AIDS compared to those without AIDS.

The duration of symptoms in the HIV-infected patients with AIDS was significantly longer than that in the HIV-uninfected patients with AIDS. This finding is consistent with those of Cai et al. [16] who found that the time to onset of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with HIV-infected patients with AIDS.
