## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The current study was to assess the burden of IFI in adult patients with invasive fungal infections admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in China.

This was a retrospective observational study. 101 invasive fungal infections were diagnosed in the study cohort at Chuojun Hospital from June 2013 to June 2014. Clinical data, in accordance with the guideline on antifungal drug guidelines, were collected. Bacterial infections were excluded.


## Introduction
Microbial decomposition is not only a life style, but also a major social activity in which many microorganisms are involved in the degradation of organic matter, the formation of secondary metabolites, and the nutrient cycling (5-7.

In addition to the lifestyle types, many microorganisms are also able to produce metabolites with high molecular weight and high stability (8). The term “metabolomics” refers to the multiple biological activities a microorganism can produce and is usually defined as the study of metabolomic changes in response to an external stress (9). Metabolomics can be divided into three main categories: (i) metabolomic analysis of metabolites, (ii) metabolic profiles, and (iii) dietary changes. Metabolic information is compiled by metabolomics and can be either fed or absorbed (10,11). Metabolomics has been used in the past to analyze the response of a microorganism to external and internal stress (12). Metabolic information includes the main components, including amino acids, sugar, lipid, and energy. Metabolomics has been used for the study of metabolism, the study of changes in metabolism, and the study of the response of a microorganism to environmental and physiological changes. Metabolic information is also correlated to diet (13,14).

Many microorganisms produce different types of metabolites. Some of them, such as lipids, fatty acids, and protein, can be found in the extracellular matrix (15). Some of them, such as amino acids, can be found in secretory vesicles (16). Some of them, such as carotenoids, can be detected in the extracellular matrix (17). Some of them, such as isopropylmalonyl sulfate (IPMS) and isopropylmalonyl sulfate (IPMS), are produced by fungi (18). IPMS is a sugar alcohol and is produced by the fermentation of malt extract. IPMS is a multifunctional alcohol and is produced by the fermentation of malt extract. IPMS is a multifunctional alcohol, produced by the fermentation of lactic acid, a unique ester that is present in the culture of the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. IPMS is a multifunctional alcohol, produced by the fermentation of malt alcohol, malt extract, and carbon source (19).


## Methods
. non-surface water, soil, air, or air-based) during the 14 years of the study of moss, apple, tomato, and root. We also measured the effects of the non-surface water surface (1.5 mm) and soil water surface (0.5 mm) in a non-surface water-based environmental factor. This non-surface water-based environmental factor was explained by a soil-based factor [18] and we used this factor to analyze the effects of soil-based environmental factors on the overall ecology of the fungi.

Based on the results of the negative and positive control groups, the fungi were divided into five subgroups (Table 1): C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. nivariensis, C. thaliana, and C. tropicalis. C. albicans and C. glabrata were defined as the soil-based environmental factors with a P value <0.05. The soil-based environmental factors that were the most active in inhibiting the growth of C. albicans and C. lusitaniae were C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, respectively. C. lusitaniae, C. thaliana, and C. tropicalis were considered as the non-surface water-based environmental factors. The non-surface water-based environmental factors that were the most active in inhibiting the growth of C. lusitaniae were C. glabrata and C. lusitaniae, respectively.

Necropsies and Infections
After the fungi were isolated from the soil, the fungi were used for the analysis of their physiological and molecular functions. After the fungi were isolated from the soil, the mycelial plugs were used for the study of their morphological characteristics. For the morphological analyses, the fungus were grown on the surface of a 3% KOH solution and incubated at room temperature in a shaking incubator for 3 days. After the fungal mycelium was harvested, the mycelial plugs were placed in the appropriate solution. The fungus were then placed on the solid medium and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 3 days.


## Results
To investigate the impact of the evolutionary forces on the microbial lifestyle, we compared the microbial lifestyle types of three different evolutionary timescales: the ancient earth's (ET) evolutionary period (69,200 years ago to 10,000,000 years ago), the ancient Earth's (EA) evolutionary period (97,200 to 120,500 years ago), and the modern day evolutionary period (129,500 to 134,500 years ago. The average environmental and physiological changes of all three time periods were calculated by using a time-lapse algorithm (Figure 4).


## Discussion
Here, the rich land is the centre of research in this study, with its diverse flora, natural history, natural phenomena and history of the whole Eart. However, a different type of climate, climatic conditions and lifestyle types were found, which can be found in different regions of the world. The major climate differences were observed in the temperate regions, with the exception of tropical Africa. The main climate differences were found in the arid regions and the temperate regions, which could be explained by the existence of a similar climate system in the past. It was found that the temperate regions were more stable than the other regions, and the climate change caused severe changes in the distribution of the major climate variables. However, the highest climatic variations were found in the temperate regions and the temperate regions. The soils were more stable than the other regions, and the soils contained more resources and had higher and higher amounts of carbon. The soil parameters were found to be much lower than the soil types, and the soil characteristics were similar to the other soils. The soil types of the Mediterranean countries were different than the other soils, and the soil types of the Mediterranean countries were different from the other soils. This was the reason for the low and significant changes in the soil types in the land. The Mediterranean countries have a higher proportion of arable land than the other land regions, which could be explained by the high accumulation of arable land in the Mediterranean countries. In the land regions of the Mediterranean countries, the soils were less stable than the other soils, and the soil characteristics were similar to those of the land regions, which could be explained by the lower accumulation of arable land in the land regions. The Mediterranean countries had higher relative humidity than the other soils, and the soil types were significantly different from the other soils. The soils contained more carbon and had higher amounts of carbon. The agricultural system in the Mediterranean countries was similar to the agricultural system in the land regions of the Mediterranean countries, and the degree of fungal diversity and diversity was similar to the land regions. The Mediterranean countries had higher proportions of carbon and had higher amounts of carbon. The Mediterranean countries had the highest proportions of fungi, especially Aspergillus. The major climatic conditions of the Mediterranean countries were different from the conditions in the land regions of the Mediterranean countries.
