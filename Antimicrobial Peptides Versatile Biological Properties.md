## Abstract
The diversity of the fungi causing respiratory and allergic diseases is thought to increase in healthcare settings as compared to resource limited settings. These infections are caused by a variety of etiologic agents and include several agents of non-neo-anal polyps, including Talaromyces marneffei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Despite the importance of these pathogens, current therapies are either too expensive or are too complex to provide protection.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are common in immunocompromised individuals and may lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is the most common microorganism that causes superficial mucosal and systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals. The most common invasive infections are candidiasis, mucosal infections and mucocutaneous infections. Candida albicans is commonly the most common cause of human disease, accounting for 30-50% of all human fungal infections [1]. In spite of the large amount of data on the epidemiology, antifungal susceptibility, antifungal drug efficacy and therapeutic strategies, it is still difficult to find a clear, quantitative diagnosis.

There are two main species of Candida: Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis. In patients with serious diseases such as neutropenia and AIDS, C. tropicalis is usually the first clinically isolated Candida. However, the frequency and clinical characteristics of infections in the general population are of greater concern due to the low pathogenic potential of this species [2]. The most common Candida species in the clinical setting are Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. The clinical manifestation is usually asymptomatic. The yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans is the most frequent and is responsible for most cases of candidiasis and candidemia in immunocompromised patients. The emergence of C. krusei as the second most common yeast species in the clinical setting is a clinical dilemma. It may be a commensal of the upper gastrointestinal tract or it may be an opportunistic pathogen of the skin and mucosa in healthy individuals. The clinical presentation may be asymptomatic and it usually presents as an asymptomatic lesion, but can develop into a life-threatening candidiasis. In recent years, the number of studies performed on the clinical manifestations of C. krusei has increased in the literature, and C. tropicalis has been the most commonly isolated species. The results of these studies may suggest a case of C.


## Methods
The pH of the test agent was measured at .0 and 10.0, respectively, and the standard deviation of the obtained data was calculated. The use of the BBR test results in the preparation of sterile sterile plant water has been approved by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (approval No. R6165/07) and the “Protocol of the Institute for Food Safety and Health” (Protocol No. 2000/09/14) of the Federal University of Paraná State (approval No. M7.13.05.2013).

4.2. Determination of Antimicrobial Activity of L. majus Extract
The antimicrobial activity of L. majus extracts was determined using a serial dilution method as previously described by Del Perrault et al. [17]. L. majus is a fungus which is usually classified as a family of major species. The isolate was obtained from the soil of the Botánhos National University. The culture was cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants at 28 °C for seven days, and the resulting mycelium was washed twice with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and then inoculated onto PDA plates. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for 24 h. MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) was determined as the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibits microbial growth and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) as the lowest concentration of the test agent that completely inhibits growth of the microorganism. The BBR test result was obtained after incubation of the test agent at a concentration of 2.5% in sterile water. The MIC results were obtained after incubation of the test agent at a concentration of 2.5% in 100% sterile water.

4.3. Determination of Antimicrobial Activity of L. majus Extract
The inhibitory effect of L. majus extracts was determined using a modified method of Pritchard et al. [18]. A loopful of the mycelium was inoculated onto nutrient-rich agar (NA) plates containing L. majus extract (Sigma, USA) in a volume of 100 µl and incubated at 28 °C for 24 h.

## Discussion
bacillaris, a marine bacterium, can produce a broad spectrum of antimicrobial compounds, which are classified in the micro- and macro-ecological categories [26. In the present study, we used the PD assay to quantify the antimicrobial activity of the polyphenols in S. bacillaris against S. aureus.

The obtained results showed that the PD assay has some advantages, namely it can be easily performed, provides a fast and reliable assessment of the antimicrobial activity, and can be performed in a range of sample types. In the present study, we tested the activity of the polyphenols in S. bacillaris against S. aureus. S. aureus was found to be resistant to all the tested extracts tested, whereas S. aureus was susceptible to all the tested extracts and was resistant to the non-toxic extract. The PD assay also showed that the extracts and extracts of S. bacillaris could exert a protective effect against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.

The results showed that S. aureus was resistant to all the extracts tested and was susceptible to the non-toxic extract. The PD assay of S. bacillaris also showed that the extracts and extracts of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were resistant to the non-toxic extract. The non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris was resistant to the non-toxic extract. The resistant extract of S. bacillaris was susceptible to the non-toxic extract of S. pneumoniae, the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris, and the non-toxic extract was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris. The resistant extract of S. bacillaris was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. pneumoniae, the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris, and the non-toxic extract was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris. The non-toxic extract of S. bacillaris was resistant to the non-toxic extract of S. pneumoniae, the non-toxic extract of S.
