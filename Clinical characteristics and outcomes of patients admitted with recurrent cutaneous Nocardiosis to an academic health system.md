## Abstract
The importance of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the ability to produce siderophores from wastewater has been recognized for decades. In wastewater treatment plants, the siderophores produced by S. cerevisiae are responsible for a large proportion of environmental contamination. Siderophores are important for numerous processes in bioremediation, from wastewater treatment and sanitization processes to the control of lactic acid bacteria in drinking water. These beneficial effects of the wastewater-human microbiome are formidable, and wastewater treatment plants must balance the need to protect health from bioremediation with the need to protect health from environmental contamination. Siderophores are one of the most abundant and diverse components of the microbial microbiome found throughout the world, and wastewater treatment plants must balance the need to protect health from bioremediation with the need to protect health from environmental contamination.


## Introduction

The proportion of patients with long-term treatment plans was higher in the patients with recurrent cutaneous Nocardiosis compared to those with previously treated for other diseases was greater in the patients with Nocardia than in those with other disease.

The proportion of patients admitted with isolated acute infection was higher in the patients with Nocardia than in those with other diseases.

The proportion of patients receiving prophylactic fluconazole for recurrent cutaneous Nocardiosis was higher in the patients with Nocardia than in those with other diseases.

The proportion of patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis for Nocardia or other chronic diseases was higher in patients with Nocardia than in those with other diseases.

The proportion of patients receiving long-term treatment plans was higher in those with Nocardia than in those with other diseases.

The proportion of patients with atopic dermatitis receiving at least once a month at least six weeks of therapy had been increased in the proportion with at least one episode of atopic dermatitis or atopic sympoplegia.

Patients admitted to the emergency department with recurrent Nocardiosis were more likely to have atopic dermatitis than patients without recurrent cutaneous Nocardiosis.

The proportion of patients with atopic dermatitis receiving anti-retroviral therapy at least six weeks of therapy was higher in the proportion with at least one episode of atopic dermatitis than in the proportion with at least one episode of atopic sympoplegia.

The proportion of patients receiving empirical anti-retroviral therapy at least six weeks of therapy at least three times a month at least was higher than in the proportion receiving no treatment at least three times a month at least.

The proportion of patients receiving oral anti-retroviral therapy at least three times a month at least for atopic dermatitis was higher in patients with N. cruris than in those with N. urethritis.

## Results
In the second 2 years of follow-up, a total of 85 (29%) patients had clinical signs and symptom. In the third year of follow-up, a total of 75 (19%) patients had clinical signs and symptoms. In all patients, a trend for higher median baseline CD4+ lymphocytes count and a lower mean CD4+ lymphocyte count was observed (Table 1).

The mean baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients admitted with recurrent Nocardiosis compared to patients admitted with the same age (P < 0.05).

During follow-up, the median CD4+ lymphocytes count was significantly lower in patients admitted with recurrent Nocardiosis compared to patients admitted with the same age (P < 0.05).

The median baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients admitted with recurrent cutaneous Nocardiosis compared to patients admitted with the same age (P < 0.05).

Comparison of patients admitted with recurrent Nocardiosis and those admitted with the same age with recurrent Nocardiosis
The average CD4+ lymphocytes count was significantly lower in patients admitted with recurrent Nocardiosis compared to those admitted with the same age (P < 0.05).

## Discussion
In the present study, we firstly demonstrated that AMB treatment induced the expression of A. fumigatus CD40, a key molecular target for the antibacterial and antifungal activity of AMB in different fungal species and our results showed that AMB might have a synergistic effect against AMB-resistant A. fumigatus strains.

A. fumigatus is a common cause of invasive fungal infection and a major cause of invasive pulmonary infection in HIV-positive patients. Besides, other fungal pathogens such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Aspergillus fumigatus, which have recently been associated with AMB treatment, were also reported in this study. In addition, we also reported that AMB might have a synergistic effect against other fungi such as Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida spp. The synergistic effect could be a result of the interaction between AMB and Fus3, which is involved in the reversible activation of the Fus3 kinase complex. We also reported that AMB treatment with Fus3 might induce the expression of CD40 in A. fumigatus cells and induced the expression of CD40 in human CD4+ T cells.

Besides, we found that treatment with AMB or Fus3 or AMB-immunoprecipitated AMB could induce the expression of CD40 in A. fumigatus cells and the CD40 could also be the major marker of the innate immune response in response to A. fumigatus infection.
