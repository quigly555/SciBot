## Abstract
The diagnosis of bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with advanced AIDS is often delayed due to its association with clinical symptoms and/or clinical failure to date. This delay is associated with poor outcomes and is often associated with nonadherence to treatment. We report a case of a patient who presented with suspected skin and internal organs involvement and was later diagnosed with aBSI. A post-mortem examination of the same abdomen found multiple lymphadenopathy in both lungs identified by histopathology. She died from multiorgan involvement in two months of follow-up. Autopsy was performed and revealed a multiple lymphadenopathy in both lungs, which was rapidly treated with voriconazole. She had a favorable outcome with subsequent decompensation. Clinicians should be vigilant for this diagnosis, as it can promote complications in patients with advanced immunological or neoplastic diseases. In the era of early antiretroviral therapy, early diagnosis of BSI and prompt initiation of treatment are critical for the outcome.

•A post-mortem examination found multiple lymphadenopathy in both lungs and multiple skin and internal organs. •The only treatment available at this time was voriconazole. •Her decompensation was favorable.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen and the primary cause of fungal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. In the developed world, it has been estimated that the incidence of cryptococcal disease is less than 10 cases per 100,000 live-impaired individuals per year per country per year.1,2 Although there is no consensus treatment strategy for cryptococcal disease, it is thought that the treatment of cryptococcal disease is more complex than that of other fungal infections.3,4 Therefore, the research on new antifungal agents is an imperative.

Several studies have shown that polyenes, such as flucytosine, amphotericin B, and azoles, are effective in reducing the mortality of cryptococcal disease.5-9 Several studies have shown that amphotericin B (particularly benzimidazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin), the first-line azole, can be safely administered intravenously.10,11 However, the emergence of azole resistance in C.


## Methods
 mg/mL) as a contro.

C. glabrata was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and used in this study to generate the melanin-binding proteins (LBP, LBP-1, LBP-2, LBP-3, LBP-4, LBP-5, LBP-6, LBP-7, LBP-8, and LBP-9) of the S. cerevisiae melanin biosynthesis. The laminin-binding protein (LBP-1) was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using as template a P. brasiliensis mutant of the pyrG gene and as a G418-resistant marker of the S. cerevisiae melanin biosynthesis. The resulting PCR product was purified using TALON (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and subjected to sequencing. The PCR products were analyzed by 2D-PCR and the band-cluster-based protein identification was performed with the DIG High Sensitivity DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Promega, USA). The LBP-1 was purified and used as the positive control in this study. The purified melanin-binding protein was used as the negative control in this study.

2.3. Determination of the melanin concentration in the FK506-resistant-expressing cells of the S. cerevisiae melanin biosynthesis
The cell suspensions (10^6 cells/mL) of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus (2 × 10^5 cells/mL) were mixed and inoculated into YPD agar (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% peptone, 0.3% dextrose, and 2.5% agar) at 30°C. The cells were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The growth of the S. cerevisiae melanin-expressing cells was compared to that of the S. paradoxus melanin-producing cells and the S. cerevisiae melanin-producing cells were compared to the untreated control.

## Results
The percentage of yeast cells in the culture supernatant and their content in the supernatant of the respective culture medium were determined as described in the methods sectio. The results showed that the number of viable fungi in the supernatant was significantly increased with increasing the culture time (Fig 5a). As shown in Fig 5b, the CFU/ml of the respective culture medium decreased from 11.8±0.4 to 1.2±0.1 in the case of 1 day and 1.4±0.1 to 1.2±0.1 in the case of 4 days. On the other hand, the CFU/ml of the respective culture medium was still significantly increased from 17.7±0.5 to 13.2±0.4 in the case of 2 days and 8.1±0.5 to 16.4±0.6 in the case of 4 days. The CFU/ml of the respective culture medium was not significantly different from that of a normal control, suggesting that the increase in CFU/ml in the culture supernatant is not due to the increase in the amount of yeast cells.

The growth rate of fungal cells was determined as the increase in the culture time. The percentage of viable yeast cells in the culture supernatant was determined as described in the methods section. The growth rate of fungal cells was significantly increased from 0.44±0.03 to 0.96±0.04 in the case of 2 days and 1.9±0.2 to 3.3±0.2 in the case of 4 days. On the other hand, the CFU/ml of the respective culture medium was significantly increased from 0.57±0.03 to 1.3±0.2 in the case of 2 days and 3.5±0.2 to 4.2±0.4 in the case of 4 days. The growth rate of the fungal cells in the culture supernatant was significantly decreased from 0.07±0.03 to 0.94±0.04 in the case of 2 days and 3.9±0.2 to 6.8±0.9 in the case of 4 days.


## Discussion
During this process, the fungus was able to induce a robust yeast-to-hyphal transition, resulting in an increased cell density in the hyphal tip, which was also observed in other studies [11. In addition, the fungal cell density in the fungal cell wall was also increased, as evidenced by the increased number of cells in the wall, cell adhesion, and hyphal formation, and the addition of the fungus to the cell wall (Fig 6A). As a result, the yeast-to-hyphal transition was observed in squamous cells, where the hyphal tip was thicker, and the cell walls were thicker, which is consistent with the results of other studies [11, 13].

To further evaluate the immune response to Aspergillus and Candida, we used a microbial-to-mimetic approach to identify and assign a class of specific immune response-related genes. We identified 1233 genes encoding for anti-inflammatory genes, including genes for TLR2, TLR4, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which were upregulated during hyphal formation. In addition, we identified 1,440 genes encoding for antimicrobial genes, including genes for a group of potential antimicrobial proteins (C1, C2, C3, and C4). These results show that the gene expression changes induced by Aspergillus and Candida were greater than those induced by fungal cells, and that the gene expression changes were more severe than those induced by fungi. This may be due to the interplay between fungal cells and Aspergillus and Candida in terms of the host immune response, which in turn may affect the immune response and fungal pathogenicity.

To further evaluate the immune response to Aspergillus and Candida, we used immunocompromised mice to evaluate the cytokine response to Aspergillus and Candida. Immunocompromised mice treated with IFN<U+03B3> showed higher levels of IFN<U+03B3> mRNA, as well as IFN<U+03B3> protein expression, compared with the IFN<U+03B3>-stimulated mice. These results indicate that the immune response to Aspergillus and Candida was stronger than that to fungi, and that IFN<U+03B3> induced the less severe immune responses.
