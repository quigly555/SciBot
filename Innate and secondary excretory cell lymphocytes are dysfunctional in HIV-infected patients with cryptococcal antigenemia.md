## Abstract
Ongoing research has uncovered important contributions of microorganisms in the environment, and is making important contributions to human health by their interaction with us. The effects of environmental factors, changes in soil properties, changes in plant community composition, and changes in the soil microbiota on human health are only beginning to be understood. In this review, we discuss the contribution of fungal and bacterial communities to human health, and propose strategies to control them. We also explore the importance of the soil microbiota in human health and propose a framework for the management of soil-borne diseases.

This review discusses the effects of changes in the soil environment on fungal and bacterial communities, and their interaction with us.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients. It is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, a yeast-like organism which commonly occurs in the environment.


## Methods
The murine macrophage-like cell line J774. A1 (ATCC CCL-185) was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 100 IU penicillin/ml, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 atmosphere. FITC-labeled murine macrophages (ATCC CRL-1623) were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 IU penicillin/ml, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin. J774. A1 macrophages were cultured in a 10% CO_2 atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO_2. J774. A1 macrophages were cultured in a 5% CO_2 atmosphere in a humidified atmosphere.


## Results

Infection with HIV induces a milder response to anti-human IgM
Infection with HIV induces a milder response to anti-human IgM [16. The immune response against human IgM, which is primarily mediated by IL-17, is often very similar to that of the immune response against HIV [17]. The immune response against HIV depends on the responses to both HIV-mediated and human IgM. Therefore, we next investigated whether the HIV-induced immune response might also depend on the human IgM response.

We incubated the HIV-induced immune response with anti-human IgM, and the HIV-induced immune response was scored as a control (data not shown). Anti-human IgM was also used to assess the response of HIV-infected patients with viral infections to HIV-induced IgM, which is a commonly used antibody [17]. The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a negative control. The HIV-induced response was scored as a positive control (data not shown).

We then assessed the HIV-induced immune response to HIV-induced IgM by immunofluorescence using anti-human IgM. The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a positive control (data not shown). The HIV-induced immune response was scored as negative control (data not shown). HIV-infected patients were then tested by RT-PCR for HIV infection-induced responses in vitro, using anti-human IgM, and a negative control antibody (data not shown).

The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a positive control (data not shown). The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a negative control (data not shown). HIV-infected patients were then tested for HIV infection-induced responses by immunofluorescence using anti-human IgM, and a negative control antibody (data not shown).

We next assessed the HIV-induced immune response to HIV-induced IgM by using the anti-human IgM in combination with anti-human IgG. The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a negative control (data not shown). The HIV-induced immune response was scored as a negative control (data not shown).


## Discussion
Our results show that although it is the dominant fungus in most soils and their biota, the plant community is dominated by C. neoformans. Although C.
