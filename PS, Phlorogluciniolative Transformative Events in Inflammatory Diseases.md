## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus, Cryptococcus gattii, is a deadly pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. The ability of C. gattii to acquire virulent strains is critical for the pathogen to invade and colonize infected mammalian hosts. The genome of C. gattii is extremely large, and the genome of a closely related species is extremely variable. Large genome size phenotypes are hallmarks of pathogenicity in the animal kingdom, and the size of Cryptococcus is thus extremely variable among animal species. This study aims to analyse the gene content of a cryptic species of C. gattii and compare it to the genome size of more closely related species.

We searched for genes predicted to encode small- and medium-sized-units in a cryptic species of the fungal Cryptococcus genus. The search was performed using a combination of multi-locus sequence typing and multi-gene analysis, and including the eubacteria, yeasts and nematodes examined.


## Introduction
The genus Pseudomonas includes the microorganisms that cause life-threatening infections in humans. They are divided into seven major groups: (i) Stenotrophomonas, which cause skin infections; (ii) Mycobacterium, which cause pneumonia; (iii) Staphylococcus and Propionine-producing Staphylococcusium species; (iv) Pseudomonas, which cause meningitis; and (v) Staphylococcus and Propionine-producing Staphylococcus. Pseudomonas spp. are generally classified as non-infectious groups, and their pathogenicity is associated with specific cell types and/or genera. The two most common species involved are St. epithiae and St. ononii. St. epithiae is responsible for a majority of infections worldwide, while St. ononii mainly causes disease in humans. While St. epithiae are commonly isolated from clinical specimens, St. ononii are more common and associated with a greater frequency in nosocomial infections. The relationship between these pathogenic microorganisms and humans is not yet clear, although it is likely that they may be involved in the development of infections in humans.


## Methods
For . pombe cells, the cells were washed twice with 0.1% Tween 80, resuspended in RPMI-1640, and added to 4 ml of medium and cultured overnight. For S. cerevisiae, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% dextrose (0.01% mannitol).

Induced Inflammatory Events in H. pombe
PLDs were performed in a 25 °C incubator. For S. cerevisiae, cells were washed with 0.1% Tween 80, resuspended in RPMI-1640, and added to 2 ml of medium and cultured overnight.

## Results
The numbers of IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells, and of monocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD were lower than that of those with pulmonary disease, respectively (Table 2. In addition, the number of IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells in the lungs of patients with COPD was also lower than those with pulmonary disease (Table 2).

Comparative Immunofluorescence
As demonstrated in Figure 2, the number of infiltrating IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells and monocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD was higher than those with pulmonary disease. Furthermore, the number of IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells and monocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD were also higher than those with pulmonary disease (Table 2).

Histopathology
To evaluate the histopathology of the lungs of patients with COPD, we stained a sample with anti-CD11 and anti-CD8 antibodies and treated the lungs with CD11^+ or CD8^+ IgG. The inflammatory infiltrate was stained with the CD11^+ and the CD8^+ IgG antibodies and the lesion was characterized by the presence of the infiltrate and the necrosis. The total number of inflammatory infiltrating cells and monocytes was greater in patients with COPD (Figure 3). However, the number of infiltrating IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells and monocytes was higher in patients with pulmonary disease (Figure 3).

Gel Implacement
To evaluate the severity of pulmonary disease, the pretreatment of COPD patients with CD4+CD4+ T lymphocytes or the pretreatment with the anti-CD11 T lymphocyte antibodies was assessed. The number of infiltrating IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells and monocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD were lower than those with pulmonary disease, respectively (Table 3). Furthermore, the number of infiltrating IFN-<U+03B3> producing cells and monocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD were higher than those with pulmonary disease, respectively (Table 3).


## Discussion
Furthermore, although many aspects of host immune response were well documented, this was not the case for Histoplasma pneumoni.

As in previous reports, our data showed that the necrotizing myeloid cells of M. pneumonia and other myeloid carcinomas were differentially expressed in the lungs of immunocompetent mice infected with Histoplasma (Figures 2A,B). The induced expression of TLR2 and MIP-2 on lung histoplasmosis was significantly higher in the lungs of immunocompetent mice, whereas that of pulmonary myeloid leukemia was significantly lower in immunocompetent mice infected with Histoplasma (Figure 2C,D). Similar results were observed for TLR4 and MIP-2 expression on lung myeloid carcinomas and a human breast adenocarcinoma (20).

To gain further insights into the immunological mechanisms, we compared the immunological basis for the myeloid lung diseases of immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. We found that immunocompetent mice had significantly higher lung histoplasmosis than immunocompromised mice, and that immunocompetent mice had higher Th2 cytokines and IL-6 compared to immunocompromised mice (Figures 2E,F and Figure 3). These data are in line with previous reports showing that the Th2 cytokines and chemokines IL-4 and IL-10 are significantly higher in immunocompetent mice than immunocompromised mice (22). These data suggest that the immunological basis of lung disease in immunocompromised mice is more closely linked to Th2 cytokines and chemokines, than to Th2 cytokines and chemokines.

The Th2 cytokines are chemokines that are activated by T cell type and are activated by Th17 cells (23). The response to chemokines is largely influenced by the cytokine milieu and by host defense. In our experiments, the immunological basis of pulmonary histoplasmosis was significantly more strongly associated with IL-4 expression in lung histoplasmosis than with the Th2 cytokines. This was also confirmed in another study in immunocompromised mice (24).
