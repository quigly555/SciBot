## Abstract
This review provides a historical overview of the phytochemical compounds isolated from sponge Hyriphysinthus rhodozyma. These represent the first ever isolated medicinal compounds from dead of the sea. The majority of these compounds were isolated from Europe, the United States, and Australia. The majority of these compounds were produced as lead sulfides in the production of citral, tequila, and ruegenco by. Hyriphysinthus rhodozyma is a unique producer of astringent astringent compounds. These compounds have a wide range of pharmacological activities and few described examples of astringent compounds. All of the isolated compounds are known to have several modifications, including, among others, a small amount of flavonoid, sphingolipid, and purine moiety attached to the N-terminal glycine residue. Some of these compounds have been used in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, as agents of, or in addition to, for, cancer treatment.


## Introduction
Fungal pathogenesis is driven by a complex network of cell-to-cell recognition and response. The host immune response to fungal pathogens is generally composed of three interconnected processes. The first step is the recognition and ingestion of the pathogen by the host. The fungus-host interaction is initiated by two types of innate immune cells, macrophages and neutrophils, which in turn function as effector cells to mediate phagocytosis, phagolysosome maturation, and killing of the pathogen. The second step is the recycling of cellular components, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM), from phagolysosome maturation sites and finally adhesion to the fungal cell surface. The third step is the acquisition and maintenance of an antigen-presenting capacity by effector cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (reviewed in Ref. (1)).

The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a commensal organism residing on the skin of approximately 1 million people worldwide. The fungus is capable of causing a wide range of mucosal and/or cutaneous infections, including oral and vaginal candidiasis. C. albicans can be acquired either through the consumption of contaminated food or through the inhalation of aerosolized spores (2). The human immune system is not known to recognize C. albicans as a pathogen but to recognize it as a constituent of the fungal cell wall. This recognition requires the recognition of a set of proteins, which are called pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMs).

## Results
Chitin and TCA are important for cell wall remodelling in A. fumigatus
The A. fumigatus genome contains several genes encoding chitin synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of both chitin and TCA, which are important for cell wall remodelling and remodelling in A. niger. Chitin synthase was recently reported to be required for chitin synthesis in A. niger [14,15]. The A. niger genome contains genes coding for chitin synthase, chitin synthase A and chitin synthase F, all of which are essential for normal cell wall maintenance in A. fumigatus [16,17]. In addition, the genome also contains several chitin synthase-encoding genes, including chitin synthase A and chitin synthase F (ChsA, ChsB, ChsD, and ChsE), which are important for chitin and TCA production [17].

To test whether chitin synthase activity is required for A. fumigatus cell wall remodelling, we tested whether chitin synthase activity was required for chitin and TCA synthesis in A. fumigatus. Cell wall remodelling in A.


## Discussion
The present study provides strong evidence that the Chinese herbal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans has many unique and pathogenic variants in different hosts. As was the case in previous studies of Chinese herbal medicines [3, 6, 10, 11], the Chinese herbalists were able to use a broad range of plants in different treatments. In the present study, the plants used were listed in order of their occurrence and the variety of plant used.
