## Abstract
We assessed the abundance and diversity of these fungi in milk and cheese. We found that in the cheese microbiome, S. cerevisiae is predominant in the dairy microbiome while S. paradoxicum is predominant in the cheese microbiome. By using a subset of gene expression data, we identified genes and pathways that are important for the production of milk proteins, including several proteins whose expression is regulated by the filamentation pathway, as well as proteins involved in the saccharification of lactate products. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, a small subset of these proteins are not present in milk. Further analysis showed that S. cerevisiae is a biotechnologically important fungal community and that its presence is correlated with production of lactate, a major product of industrial fermentations. Our results suggest that the production of lactate is not a major contributor to microbial community diversity and that the filamentation pathway is not a major contributor to the richness and diversity of the milk microbiome. Future research should consider the involvement of these fungal pathways in the production of milk quality.

Microbial communities play crucial roles in human and animal health. While the majority of the microbes found in fruits, vegetables, and legumes have been traditionally cultivated, humans are still scavenging nutrients from the soil, water, and air. Humans and microbes can interact genetically to coordinate disease prevention and abundance promotion. This interplay offers opportunities for microbial ecology to be improved by targeting a subset of microbial pathways. We identified and characterized a subset of genes that are associated with disease risk in humans. We found that several of these genes are expressed during early stages of infection and during milk production. In comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae is significantly over-exposed to antibiotics in humans. We identified and characterized genes that are involved in nutrient sensing during pathogen survival. These findings indicate that the microbial community is not responding to a major adaptive response to a dominant fungal pathogen of humans. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, the virulence of S. cerevisiae was associated with the production of lactate, a major constituent of milk that protects against spoilage organisms. Thus, our findings indicate that the microbial community is not responding to a major nutrient limitation and that the host may have evolved in a response to a dominant pathogen. Our findings provide the first evidence that the host may have developed this microbial response in response to a dominant fungus in a way that is necessary for the pathogenicity of plant pathogens.


## Introduction
The ability to sense and adapt to changes in ambient conditions is vital for the survival of microbes. These changes are caused by changes in external stimuli such as the host immune system, and by the ability of microbes to grow and survive in adverse conditions. The key point in the above-mentioned understanding of the environmental changes occurring in the field of microbial ecology is the realization that the host immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. The immune system is known to be exposed to environmental changes, and has to cope with a variety of stresses. The immune system can respond to environmental changes either by modulating its own activity or by suppressing it. This leads to an immune response characterized by a suppressive and repressive mode of action. The balance between the two is the key element of the immune system response. The immune system can be activated in response to the host immune system response, and in response to its action. The balance of the immune response to external stimuli is determined by the nature of the stimulus and the response to the immune response. The balance between the immune response and the immune response is determined by the cell type, and the cell type responds in the way that is known to be important in the immune response to microbial pathogens. The immune response to a pathogen consists of the following components: the recognition of the pathogen, the pathogen's genome, and the host response. The immune response to a pathogen consists of recognition, by cells of the immune system, of the pathogen's antigens, and the response to the infection. The recognition of a pathogen can be either direct, by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecules (Kandikumar, 2004), or indirect, by the stimulation of immune responses with antimicrobials (Santangelo et al., 2011). The immune response to a pathogen involves the recognition and activation of a pathogen’s immune response (Liu, 2010). The immune response to a pathogen involves the recognition and activation of the pathogen’s immune response. The recognition of a pathogen can be either direct, by the recognition of its genomes, or indirect, by the stimulation of the immune response with antimicrobials.

## Results
In addition, in both conditions, the microbial community structure of goat milk samples was different than that of other milk. In both conditions, the relative abundance of genera and/or species differed significantly in different milk strains. In the in vitro environment of the three milk strains, the relative abundance of genera and species was significantly different (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The relative abundance of yeasts was significantly higher in the in vitro environment of milk strains than in the in vivo environment of the three milks (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

Fungal Community Structure in Rat Milk Is More Independently Related to the Microbial Community Structure
In the in vitro environment of the three milk strains, the relative abundance of genera and species was significantly different (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The relative abundance of genera and species were significantly different between the two conditions (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In the in vivo environment of the three milk strains, the relative abundance of genera and species were significantly different between the two conditions (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In both conditions, the relative abundance of yeasts was significantly higher in the in vitro environment of the three milks than in the in vivo environment of the three milks (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

Fungal Community Structure in Rat Milk Is More Dependent from the Microbial Community Structure
The analysis of the relative abundances of genera and species in the three milk strains by the same media was consistent with the results from the in vitro environment of the three milks (Figure 4). In the in vitro environment of the three milks, the relative abundance of fungal genera and species was significantly different (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The relative abundance of yeasts was significantly different between the two conditions (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The relative abundance of fungi was significantly higher in the in vitro environment of the three milks than in the in vivo environment of the three milks (p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).


## Discussion
 2010.

The extracellular enzymes identified by the survey are almost identical to enzymes that are secreted in other fungal species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and Candida albicans, which are the main pathogens of humans and animals. In contrast, the extracellular enzymes of C. neoformans and C. gattii are both extracellular proteins with a unique characteristic of being soluble in low molecular weight nitrogen (Lorenz and Evans, 2004). The two Cryptococcus species (C. gattii and C. neoformans) have recently undergone whole genome sequencing and are clustered into two distinct clades. The former is more closely related to C. gattii than the latter, which has only been sequenced recently (Lehmann et al., 2013). The latter is a more distantly related species to the latter, which is also more closely related to C. neoformans. The C. gattii extracellular enzyme gene set is similar to the yeast-like proteins from other fungi. However, these proteins are not found in C. neoformans. The C. gattii extracellular enzymes are probably present in C. neoformans because of their ability to degrade nitric oxide (NO) generated by the respiratory burst of C. neoformans and subsequent generation of toxic nitric oxide in the cells (Konrad et al., 2012). The C. neoformans extracellular enzyme gene set is the same as those of C. gattii and C. albicans, but is different from those of C. neoformans.

The fungal extracellular enzymes were enriched in the presence of different types of carbon sources, including glycerol, but the enzyme activity was not significantly different between the three types of carbon sources. The high glycerol concentration in the extracellular environment is thought to be a response to the rapid and efficient utilization of carbon sources, including glycerol, in fungi (Smith et al., 2002). The C. neoformans extracellular enzyme gene set is similar to that of C. gattii, but the genes are less similar to those of C. albicans. The extracellular enzyme activity was higher in the extracellular environment than the extracellular environment. The C. gattii extracellular enzyme gene set is similar to that of C.
