## Abstract
An opportunistic fungal pathogen, the causative agent of the black Sigatoka disease of wheat, Mucor circinelloides, has recently emerged as a major pathogen in wheat rust, causing severe damage to the wheat genome. In the present study, we describe a new family of Ras GTPases in Mucor sp. causing the black Sigatoka disease, Mucor curvata. The K gene and its subpressing protein are found in a constitutive phase at the same position in Mucor. The gene forms highly conserved pseudogenes states and is present in all Mucor genomes analyzed. The gene is highly induced in a Mucor sp. vegetative state. The gene is induced when the protein partner Mucor sp. wheat transduces into a Mucor sp. secondary form, and then into a Mucor sp. dormant form, and so on. We propose that the gene serves as a signaling molecule for the initiation of the Mucor sp. vegetative phase, the time from germination of the germlings to ingestion of the vegetative cells, and the induction of another subset of Mucor sp. secondary forms. These germlings would later propagate into the vegetative stage and contain the Mucor sp. vegetative phase, which is the dormant stage. These findings are important because they establish that the pathogenic Puccinia terreora contains three layers: the germling, the induction, and the onset.


## Introduction
2011.

The fungal pathogens of the genus Candida are both opportunistic and are responsible for more than 200,000 cases of candidemia globally each year (Santos et al. 2004). Invasive candidiasis (IC) is associated with a high mortality rate, with the highest incidence in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Ventola et al. 2013). Although C. albicans is the most frequently isolated Candida species from the bloodstream, its frequency increases during the course of the disease (for review see Boccardo et al. 2017). Furthermore, C. glabrata is the second most common cause of candidemia in patients with HIV infection (Hajiswal et al. 2015). Although C. glabrata has been classified as a yeast species by the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) (IHEAM) and the European Society for Testing and Treatment of Cancer (ESOTA)-A, it is still not included in the standard of care for candidemia (Hajiswal et al. 2015).

There are two main types of antifungal drug-based treatments for IC: polyenes (amphotericin B) and azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole). Azoles are synthetic chemical compounds that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis (Nosanchuk and Raizada 2001). The first type of antifungal, amphotericin B, is a prodrug of the azoles and is used to treat patients with severe fungal infections, including candidemia, with a mortality rate of 40% (Wong et al. 2016). The second type of antifungal, flucytosine, is a triazole drug, which inhibits lanosterol 14a-demethylase, the enzyme responsible for the demethylation of ergosterol, and is often used to treat patients with severe fungal infections (González-Prieto et al. 2017).

C. albicans can adapt to various stresses including drug-induced oxidative stress, drug-induced microbial growth, and host-parasite interactions, leading to drug resistance (Bucher et al. 2006; Hergovich et al.


## Methods
The isolate was cultured on a V8 juice medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) at 37 °C for 24 h and then the culture was transferred to fresh mediu. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 days, the mycelia were harvested. A single colony was picked and used for DNA extraction. In order to confirm that the isolate was in fact a single colony, mycelia of S. fumigatus were washed with H_2O to remove free material and then fresh medium was added to each well. The mycelia of S. fumigatus were transferred to fresh medium at the same temperature for 24 h and then harvested and lyophilized. The DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Plant DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and the products were then purified using the QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA extract was stored at -20 °C until use.

PCR amplification and sequencing of the genomic DNA
All PCR reactions were performed in a Tiangen Bioengineering Institute Shanghai Laboratory (Shanghai, China) with a 5-µL volume of DNA extract as the template. The reaction conditions and the cycling conditions are summarized in Table 1. The PCR primers used in this study were listed in Table 1. The PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 25 µL with 5 µL of sterile water. The PCR amplification products were separated on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The purified PCR products were directly sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The sequences were compared with sequences available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the species identification numbers were assigned as listed in Table 1.

Nucleotide substitution model determination
The conserved domains of each of the seven microsporidia, which were used to determine the evolution of the species, were predicted using the InterProScan software (version 1.8.0.3.4). The sequences of the six gene families were predicted using the S. cerevisiae conserved motifs from the P. digitatum database (http://www.aspergillum.org/). The P.


## Results
crassa and the host, we generated a homozygous deletion mutant (designated homozygosis-susceptible strain) by homologous recombination of the C-terminal glycine-rich region of the eGFP-GFP fusion construct (Figure 5. The resulting strain was named homozygosis-susceptible strain, hereafter designated as homozygosis-susceptible strain (HIS-susceptible). This strain is a diploid (Supplementary Figure S1). Homozygosis of the homozygous mutant (<U+0394>/<U+0394> hgcp1) or its resulting heterozygosis mutant (<U+0394>/<U+0394> tpk1) was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). An additional two copies of hgcp1 were obtained from a single strain. In the transformant background, the homozygous mutant and the corresponding deletion mutant had the same phenotype as the wild-type strain (Figure 5).

Whole genome sequencing of homozygosis mutants and homozygosis mutants confirmed the C-terminal glycine-rich regions of the homozygous mutant and homozygous mutant homozygosis mutants (Supplementary Figure S3). The hgcp1 homozygosis mutant displayed no obvious phenotype on the genome-wide scale compared to the homozygous mutant or homozygous mutant homozygosis mutant, or on the strain-specific scale compared to the wild-type strain. Therefore, the homozygous mutant and homozygous mutant homozygosis mutants were selected for further investigations.

Sugar ion-gating pathway is required for N. crassa tolerance to host-derived stress
Since N. crassa utilizes the S-box to recognize sugar molecules, the S. cerevisiae H99 strain was chosen as a model strain to understand how N. crassa may overcome host-derived stress. The S. cerevisiae H99 strain is a clinical isolate, and has a mutation in the H99 ortholog (S. cerevisiae H99), but no other known H99 ortholog has been identified. The S. cerevisiae H99 strain exhibits increased tolerance to several different stresses, including high salt (SDS) and the oxidative stress (Figure 6A).


## Discussion
In our study, we discovered the gene encoding a putative transcription factor, HSP90, which is also known as an intracellular Ca^2+/calcineurin (Ca^2+)/calcineurin (Ca^2+/calcineurin) [27. The results showed that HSP90, like the Ca^2+/calcineurin, was highly expressed in the lungs of A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. parasiticus, and A. parasiticus. Our results showed that HSP90 is an essential gene in the A. fumigatus cell wall, and that it is involved in cell wall maintenance.

Transcriptional analysis of A. fumigatus genome showed that it is composed of four different orthologs, with only two of them being present in A. flavus and A. parasiticus. Interestingly, three orthologs were found in A. fumigatus, and one of them (HSP90) was found in A. parasiticus. The gene encoding the Mpr-like transcription factor family was also found in A. fumigatus. The A. fumigatus gene encoding the Mpr-like transcription factor family was found to be encoded by HSP90, and it was found to be involved in cell wall maintenance. The A. fumigatus genes encoding the two Dpm-like proteins (A and B) were found to be encoded by HSP90. The two Dpm-like proteins (Dpm1 and Dpm2) are well known for their roles in cell wall biogenesis [28,29]. A. flavus and A. parasiticus have two Dpm-like proteins, Dpm1 and Dpm2, respectively, and one Dpm-like protein was found in A. fumigatus [30].

The deletion of HSP90 in A. flavus and A. parasiticus led to severe lung damage, and the pathogenic role of HSP90 in A. fumigatus has been suggested. The HSP90 gene was found to be upregulated in A. flavus and A. parasiticus, and the A. fumigatus genes encoding the two Dpm-like proteins (Dpm1 and Dpm2) were upregulated in A. parasiticus. The A.
