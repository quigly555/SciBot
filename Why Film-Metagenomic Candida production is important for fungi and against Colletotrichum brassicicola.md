## Abstract
This study was designed to assess the antimicrobial effects of ethyl acetate extract (EA) and its fractions against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results showed that the EA extract exhibited a moderate antimicrobial activity against both bacteria. In addition, the inhibition pattern of the extract was found to be synergic with artemisinin, a natural polyphenol used as a skin penetration agent. The MICs of the extract against these two bacteria were determined by the microdilution-dilution assay. The EA extract displayed a significant reduction in the area under the effective concentration (EC) for both bacteria and fungi. The MICs of the EA extract against both bacteria were determined by the checkerboard method. The results showed that the EA extract was more active against E. coli than with other probiotic extracts.


## Introduction
albicans and . glabrata, that can influence the production of bioactive compounds, and for the development of new antifungal drugs.

Candida glabrata is responsible for approximately 90% of the world's cases of mucosal candidiasis, while C. albicans accounts for less than 5% of the cases [1]. C. glabrata is also the most common cause of superficial mucosal infections, including oral thrush, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mucormycosis, that are caused by C. glabrata [2]. The virulence of C. glabrata is dependent on virulence attributes of this species [3]. The virulence factors of C. glabrata include the secretion of cell-wall-degrading enzymes, phospholipase and proteinase, growth at 37 °C, the production of high-mobility extracellular matrix (EM), and biofilm formation [3]. The virulence factors of C. glabrata are believed to be evolutionarily related to the virulence factors of C. albicans, since the virulence factors of both species have evolved independently to respond to environmental conditions and to host cell injury [4]. Biofilm formation is a highly conserved trait among C. albicans and C. glabrata. Candida biofilm formation is a virulence factor that is responsible for the persistence of the biofilm in vivo [5]. Biofilm formation is generally a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of C. albicans, and the mechanisms by which biofilm formation contributes to the pathogenesis of C. albicans are complex [6,7]. C. albicans biofilm formation is regulated by the cell wall integrity (CLS) pathway [8,9]. The CLS pathway is composed of seven main components that constitute a tight-walled network of proteins and lipids, which allows biofilm formation [10]. The CLS pathway consists of two components, a MAP kinase cascade, the Rho1p-MßRp-GATA-RAPES-RAPES signaling pathway and the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway [11]. The C.


## Methods
We note that the use of a selective medium and the use of a F-630-labeled agar medium are complementary to the use of . graminearum for fungi, which should be considered as a positive control [36].

Chemistry
Chemistry of the antimicrobial compounds is shown in Figure 1. A 1% (w/v) stock solution (Sigma) of 0.05% (w/v) CdCl_2 was used to inoculate the Petri dishes. The Petri dishes were inoculated with 0.5 mL of 0.01% (w/v) CdCl_2, 0.02% (w/v) KCl and 0.05% (w/v) of 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80, and the plates were incubated at 30°C. After incubation, the fungal growth was visually inspected for the presence of inhibition zones. The fungal growth was calculated as the percentage of growth inhibition compared to the growth control.

Phylogenetic analysis
The sequences of each compound are available in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The accession numbers are the respective species, a single colony, and the SSU rDNA sequence. The sequences of the four compounds were compared by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database and to the database of proteins from Ensembl, and the results showed the same result.

Microbial infection
For the biofilm assay, aliquots of 100 µL of 0.05% (w/v) CdCl_2, 0.02% (w/v) KCl, 0.1% (w/v) of 0.5% (w/v) of 0.2% (w/v) of 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 was spread on MH agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and the biofilm formation was visually inspected and the number of CFUs was counted.

Biofilm formation
The ability of the fungi to form biofilms was tested using an inoculum of 1 × 10^4 CFU/mL. Inoculum was prepared from freshly grown fungi grown in liquid YPD medium at 30°C, 25°C, or 37°C.


## Results
The second generation phage (the second generation phage-only) was prepared by using the mature film-like peptide (a-glucan) and the second generation peptide (a-glucose) as a carbon sourc. The second generation peptide was incubated with the mature film-like peptide or the second generation peptide and the two peptides were coupled into a series of recombinant peptides to yield the second generation peptides. The presence of the two peptides in the second generation peptide series was verified by the presence of GXM in the mature film-like peptide. The presence of GXM in the mature film-like peptide was also confirmed by the presence of GXM in the peptide profile of the second generation peptide (Figure 4A). The two peptides were recombinant in a manner similar to the second generation peptide.

From the peptide profile and the peptide profile of the second generation peptide, it was evident that the presence of GXM in the second generation peptide was not sufficient to produce a-glucan-like peptides. To further verify that the presence of GXM in the second generation peptide was not a strong inducer of the second generation peptide, a second-generation peptide (the second generation peptide-only) was also prepared and the second generation peptide (a-glucan-like peptide) was incubated with the mature film-like peptide and the two peptides were coupled into a series of recombinant peptides to yield the second generation peptides. The presence of GXM in the second generation peptide was confirmed by the presence of GXM in the peptide profile of the second generation peptide (Figure 4B).

From the peptide profile and the peptide profile of the second generation peptide, it was evident that the presence of GXM in the second generation peptide was not sufficient to produce a-glucan-like peptides.


## Discussion
Microorganisms are ubiquitous and ubiquitous in nature. They are ubiquitous and ubiquitous in the environment. They can be found in a wide variety of environments, and even in the same household. In the present study, the number of microorganisms detected by molecular methods was greater than in previous studies (21, 22). This study was also designed to reveal the diversity of microorganisms in the polluted environment of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DEG) in Simi Valley, and to reveal the diversity of microorganisms associated with the polluted environment.

Bioassay-based results of microorganisms in the polluted environment of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DEG)
To better understand the dynamics of bioactivity in the polluted environment of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DEG), a bioassay-based analysis was conducted using the Biosyber database (Biotorms) (24) for a set of 12 identified microorganisms.

The results showed that bacteria, fungi and archaea were the most abundant microorganisms in the marine sediments (Figure 2), followed by Archaeobacteria and Proteobacteria (Figure 3) and Eukaryotes (Figure 4).

As shown in Figure 2A, Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla in the marine sediments. However, Archaeobacteria and Proteobacteria were detected in a lower percentage (33.2% and 21.3%, respectively) than the other phyla (Figure 2B). The higher percentage of Archaeobacteria in the marine sediments may be due to the marine environment where Archaea is the dominant genus, and is frequently found in polluted environments such as mines, air, and water (25, 26).

In contrast, Archaeobacteria was the most abundant Archaeobacterium in the polluted marine sediments. This observation is in contrast to the results of previous studies which showed that the highest proportion of Archaea was found in polluted marine sediments (24, 25). The difference in Archaea abundance could be explained by the fact that Archaea is the main bacterial phyla in marine sediments and that it can live in a variety of environmental conditions.

The second most abundant Archaeobacterium was the phylum Lecanoromycetes, which was the dominant phyla in the marine sediments (Figure 2A).
