## Abstract
The essential oil of Tagetes versicolor (TT) is a byproduct of fungal cultivation. It is commonly found in flowers and can be extracted by chemical processes. It has been shown to be particularly effective in preventing fungal colonization of the human oral cavity. However, its absolute and relative amounts have been rarely discussed, given that fungal cultivation involves various physical and chemical barriers. This study aimed to present the content, physicochemical properties and mode of action of the essential oil in Tagetes versicolor (TT) against Candida species and the involvement of the active ingredients. Tagetes versicolor showed excellent antifungal activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and Aspergillus fumigatus and showed a significant inhibitory effect against Candida spp. The mode of action of the essential oil was also determined. The antifungal activity of Tagetes versicolor was inhibited by three different Candida species, including Aspergillus fumigatus, A. oryzae, Paecilomyces lilicosus, and Candida tropicalis. The mode of action of the essential oil was also determined. It was found that the oil was more effective in inhibiting Candida spp. The content of the essential oil was similar to that of the natural drug, but the oil was also effective against A. oryzae, C. albicans, Paecilomyces lilicosus, and Candida tropicalis.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs), mostly caused by Candida, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus, can be fatal. Their incidence has increased significantly during the last decades, which has led to the spread of these pathogenic fungi in the world population.


## Methods
(2012. To prepare the nectar, 1 ml of the nectar was added to 10 ml of the pre-sterilized water and incubated at 20 Â°C for 24 h. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 5 min), and the supernatant was collected. The nectar was then acidified with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (Na_2CO_3), and the mixture was centrifuged again to remove the Na_2CO_3. The acidification process was repeated, with the addition of 0.5% of H_2SO_4. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was used for the determination of the total amount of nectar produced by the method described by Bicha et al. (2012).

The method of Bicha et al. (2012) was used to quantify the total amount of nectar produced by the method of Czapek et al. (2010). The total nectar was prepared by the method of Sunchonnawe (1959) and was used for this study. The nectar was used for the determination of the total amount of nectar produced by the method of Maklitsch et al. (2013).

Yield of the nectar was determined by measuring the yield of the nectar by the method of Kwon-Chung (1998) and compared with that of the nectar of a previous study (Kwon-Chung et al. 2002).

After the preparation of the nectar, the extraction method was used to determine the total amount of nectar produced by the method of Barksynski et al. (2004).

Determination of the total amount of nectar produced by the method of Cox (2008) was carried out by the method of Fyfe et al. (2004).

The total amount of nectar produced by the method of Thompson et al. (2007) was determined by the method of Lanhout et al. (2011) and compared with that of the nectar of a previous study (Lanhout et al. 2011).

Total amount of nectar produced by the method of Maffeo et al. (2007) was determined by the method of Millien et al. (2009).


## Results
In addition to a number of previously described species, IGS has been reported for a few other fungal species such as Leotiomycetes, Capnodiales, and Cryptococcus neoformans [19]. IGS was recently described as the second most abundant fungal species in a study conducted by Jiang et al. [19]. In this study, we selected an additional fifteen previously described fungal species from the fungal kingdom (Table 1). These organisms are characterized by wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and are often associated with endophytic fungi. In addition to their diverse physiological and biochemical characteristics, the specimens we selected were all from the generic fungal taxa described in literature and are therefore included in this study.

In addition to the most abundant fungal species, we also included the new species, Cryptococcus neoformans, an endophytic fungus that can be classified into four different clades. The three newly identified species are described below.

Cryptococcus neoformans (N = 20): Ascomatalia epiphyllae (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans var. grubii (C. neoformans) C. gattii (N = 10): Pycnidiales (C. neoformans var. neoformans var. grubii) C. neoformans var. neoformans (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans (N = 8): Saccharidae (S. saccharidae) C. neoformans var. neoformans var. neoformans (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans (N = 7): Ascarium (A. ascarium) C. neoformans var. neoformans var. neoformans (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans (N = 7): Saccharidae (S. saccharidae) C. neoformans var. neoformans var. neoformans (C. neoformans) C. neoformans var. neoformans (N = 7): Ascarium (A.


## Discussion

The most potent compounds for AMF production were used in the in vitro plant test of spore biogenesi. The AMF activity of the H. clade was tested against the opportunistic pathogen T. indica in the plant host, Candida albicans, and was in agreement with the results obtained by other researchers [37-40].

The plant fungal pathogen T. indica was the most potent AMF producer. The results presented in Table 1 showed that the best yield of the AMF for the fungal pathogen was obtained by H. clade. The results of Table 1 suggest that the H. clade is more efficient in producing AMF than the other fungal groups. The results obtained in Table 1 were consistent with previous reports [37-40]. In a previous study [37], we found that AMF produced by H. clade was not only an excellent fungal producer but also a potent one. The results of the plant fungal pathogen T. indica showed that the H. clade produced AMF more efficiently than the other fungal groups.

The results of the plant fungal pathogen T. indica showed that the best fungal producer was obtained by the C. albicans group. This fungus is a halophilic, saprophytic and pathogenic yeast of plants. The results of the plant fungal pathogen T. indica showed that the C. albicans group produced AMF more efficiently than the other fungal groups.

The results of the plant fungal pathogen T. indica showed that the H. clade produced AMF more efficiently than the other fungal groups. The results of the plant fungal pathogen T. indica showed that the H. clade produced AMF more efficiently than the other fungal groups.
