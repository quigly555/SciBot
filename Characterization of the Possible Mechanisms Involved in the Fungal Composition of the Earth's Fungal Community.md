## Abstract
We present a case of an 18 year old lady with a history of an upper respiratory illness, who presented to the hospital with a 3 day history of abdominal pain, 1 strombosis and a 2 week history of right sided pain. The hospital staff was unable to explain the symptoms at face value and advised that the patient was on empiric antifungal treatment. On discharge the patient was eventually diagnosed as a thyroid cancer, with a positive cryptococcal antigen titer of more than 99,000 high molecular-weight oligonucleotide sequences. Following treatment with combination therapy with rituximab and terbinafine, the thyroid titer eventually improved to a titer of =1,200. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved and she was discharged after 1 month.


## Introduction
On the other hand, fungi are generally not a component of the Earth’s biosphere but they may be involved in the production of secondary metabolites, enzymes, and metabolites of interest that play important roles in the process of terrestrial carbon cyclin. The production of secondary metabolites from fungi is of primary importance to many industrial processes. Thus, it is of prime importance to study the involvement of fungi in the production of secondary metabolites and enzymes.

Fungal secondary metabolite production is well documented in the hemibiotrophic fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans and Fusarium graminearum, and their metabolic activity can be manipulated by the use of various media and enzymes from these organisms. These fungi can be found in soil, wood, pigeon guano, tree, and even pigeon guano (see below) (Hall, 1991). In addition to the production of secondary metabolites, fungal secondary metabolites can be produced by several other organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and fungi (see below). In addition to the production of secondary metabolites, fungal secondary metabolites can be produced by several other organisms, including fungi, molds, and bacteria. These fungi can be found in soil, pigeon guano, tree, animal skin, and even plants (see below). They may be found in soil, chicken feet, squirrels, and even animal feces (Figure 1).

Some fungi can be found in soil, pigeon guano, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, pigeon feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, chicken feces, tree, pigeon feces, tree, pigeon feces, tree, pigeon feces, and feces. The most common fungi found in this fungal community are Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus (Figure 1). There are several types of Candida, which can be found in the soil, pigeon guano, tree, pigeon guano, tree, chicken, tree, chicken, tree, and feces, which are found in different compartments (Figure 1). The main Candida species isolated from soil are Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis.


## Methods
Fungal compounds were detected by the method described by Gietz et a. [18] and their structures and molecular parameters were reported in Table 2.

Biological Activity of Fungal Compounds
The antifungal activity of the compounds was assayed by their ability to inhibit yeasts and filamentous fungi, as well as to inhibit the growth of macromorphology. Isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus (S. cerevisiae), Aspergillus niger (A. niger), Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus), Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus (A. terreus), Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans (A. niger), Candida tropicalis (A. niger), Cryptococcus neoformans (A. neoformans), and Encephalitis bacilli (A. bacilli) were used as positive controls.

Antifungal Activity of Fungal Compounds
The antifungal activity of the compounds was performed using the method described by Svanteiner et al. [19]. Isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and Encephalitis bacilli were used as negative controls.

Antifungal Activity of Fungal Compounds
The antifungal activity of the compounds was performed using the method described by Jank et al. [20] and their structures and molecular parameters were reported in Table 2.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between the means of antifungal and antifungal-free control groups were compared using the one-way ANOVA test.


## Results
Interestingly, none of these three genera was present in the fungal community in soi. These findings suggest that the fungal community of soil is dominated by fungal species and that the fungal genera present in the soil are involved in fungal community composition. The results of the functional classification of fungal community in the fungal community are presented in Figure 4. The first group of fungal genera represented in soil were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Candida, Microsporum, Candida, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. The second group contained Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium, Trichoderma, and Penicillium. The third group contained Candida, Microsporum, and Trichoderma. These results suggest that the fungal fungal community in soil is dominated by fungi that are responsible for fungal fungal pathogenicity in soil.

Phylogenetic Analysis of the Fungal Community
The phylogenetic tree of the fungal community in soil was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method with the analysis of the fungal community composition in soil. The top five most abundant fungal genera in the fungal community in the soil were Debaryomyces, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. The fungal fungal genera in the soil were clustered in two clusters: a cluster containing Aspergillus and Candida and a cluster containing Aspergillus and Penicillium. The top five most abundant fungal genera in the soil were Aspergillus, Candida, Microsporum, Candida, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. The fungal fungal genera in the soil were clustered in two clusters: a cluster containing Aspergillus and Candida and a cluster containing Aspergillus and Penicillium. The top five most abundant fungal genera in the soil were Debaryomyces, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma.


## Discussion
The transport and metabolism of metabolites is the main driver of the biology of fungi and their host fungi, and the fungal metabolism is required for many biochemical processes in their host fung. The results shown in Figure 4 show that the fungal community in the soil was affected by soil depth and vegetation type in the present study, and the fungal community was affected by soil depth and vegetation type in the present study. The total fungal community in soil samples was much higher than that in soil samples from other biotic and abiotic sites, indicating that the fungal community was affected by all soil types.

Previous studies reported that the soil fungal community is associated with vegetation and soil properties, and the fungal community is associated with soil properties and water activity. In the present study, the soil fungal community was significantly affected by vegetation type in the present study. The soil fungal community is also associated with soil properties and water activity in soil of the different biotic and abiotic sites. The results showed that the soil fungal community in the present study was affected by vegetation type in the present study, and the soil fungal community was affected by vegetation type in the present study. The soil fungal community in the present study is mainly composed of asexual fungi. The fungal communities of soil were affected by a combination of various factors, such as plant species, soil properties, and soil activities, and the soil fungal community was affected by a combination of soil properties and soil activities. The results showed that the fungal community of the present study was affected by soil properties and water activity in the present study. The fungal communities of the soil were affected by different soil types, including the soil type in the present study and the soil types in the previous study (Mao et al., 2016). In addition, the soil fungal community was affected by a combination of soil properties and water activity in the present study. The results showed that the soil fungal community in the present study was affected by soil properties and water activity in the present study.

Previous studies showed that the soil fungal community is significantly affected by the vegetation type in the present study. The soil fungal community is significantly affected by vegetation type in the present study. The results showed that the soil fungal community in the present study was affected by vegetation type in the present study.
