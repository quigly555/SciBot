## Abstract
Background. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of Cryptococcus gattii species complex and their interactions with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other pathogens in a general epidemiological staff of an immunological clinic and to investigate the potential associations between clinical symptoms and environmental exposures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Clinical Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory and the Dermatology Department of the Faculty of Medicine of Faculty of Medicine, University of Pavo Santo and Cardinal Marche of Faculty of Medicine, respectively, during the period from January 2011 to December 2012. The collection of clinical samples was carried out for microscopic examinations of the skin and the blood, and the collection of pulmonary and the bronchial samples was carried out for microscopic examination of the lung, the blood, and the bronchial tissues of HIV infected patients. Results. A total of 364 samples were collected from patients with suspected clinical symptoms. From 35% (31/364) to 68.9%, Cryptococcus was detected in 19/364 (92.4%) of the specimens. The incubation temperature for Cryptococcus was -5 Â°C in 27/364 (34.9%) of samples collected from patients with pulmonary and blood manifestations. All the Cryptococcus isolates were positive for HIV. The species spectrum of Cryptococcus was very similar between the pulmonary and bronchial samples (K = 4.9, P = 0.001, respectively). The common environmental risk factors for patients with pulmonary manifestations of Cryptococcus were low CD4+ T-cell counts, healthy weight, non-steroidal and non-tinea co-neuritis or receipt of corticosteroids. All Cryptococcus isolates were negative for other risk factors. Conclusion. Cryptococcus is a heterothallic fungus that mainly infects immunocompromised patients. It can spread through inhalation of inhaled or vomitary material from contaminated vehicles. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the commonest form of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can lead to severe disease outcomes in immunocompromised hosts.


## Introduction

In order to investigate the mechanisms leading to the escape from the phantasmagous state, the phantasmagous cells are protected by the polysaccharide capsul. The capsule protects the cells from external osmotic pressure and from the host immune response. The capsule is composed of proteins that are involved in multiple functions: (i) protection of the cell, (ii) adhesion and spreading, (iii) signaling, and (iv) signaling pathways and activation. Capsule proteins may be recognized by cell receptors and, therefore, the cell can activate receptors for these molecules.

Our group has previously described a series of anti-fungal peptides and cytokines that were found to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and the yeast-to-hypha transition of Candida glabrata. The antifungal peptide LAMP-1, which is synthesized by the glycosyltransferase LAMP, is found to inhibit the hyphal transition in C. albicans and C. glabrata [16]. LAMP has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of C. albicans [16] and C. glabrata [17]. In addition, several anti-fungal peptides, including MIG11 and GAS, have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of C. albicans [18], [19]. LAMP-1 has been shown to induce the morphological transition and to induce cell wall remodeling of the yeast cells in vitro. In addition, LAMP-1 is an immunosuppressant and is used as a vaccine delivery system in mice. The immunosuppression of the mice was evaluated using a mixture of immunosuppressed and immunosuppressed mice given LAMP-1 and administered in the presence or in the absence of an immune stimulus. The immunosuppression of the mice was evaluated by the use of the immunosuppressant drug dexamethasone. LAMP-1 induced the morphological transition, and dexamethasone induced the cell wall remodeling. The dexamethasone-treated mice presented increased germination and production of these cells, which could be detected by qPCR.


## Methods
This method involves a surface-to-volume (SW) cut-off of the P^2 area of the EC. The SW is the number of units within the SW. The P^2 area is the area of the P^2 fluid inside the SW. The P^2 fluid volume is the volume of the P^2 fluid inside the SW. The P^2 fluid volume is the volume of the SW that is inside the SW. The SW is the top layer of the SW. The P^2 fluid volume is the volume of the P^2 fluid outside the SW. The SW is the bottom layer of the SW. The SW is the upper layer of the SW. The P^2 fluid volume is the volume of the P^2 fluid inside the SW.

All the algorithms and steps of this procedure can be found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods section. The SW method is specific to the field of the ECM and the SW is specific to the field of the ECM. The SW-based method is similar to the SW-based approach but with a few modifications. The SW-based method is based on a membrane-based approach. The SW-based method uses a membrane to minimize the P^2 fluid inside the SW. The SW-based method is based on a detergent-based approach. The SW-based method is based on a soluble-based approach. The SW-based method is based on a soluble-based approach. The detergent-based method is based on a solution-based approach. The detergent-based method is based on a solution-based approach. The SW-based method is based on a thermostatic-based approach. The detergent-based method is based on a cellular-based approach.

## Results
The three-dimensional structure of a . neoformans type II intranasal model of a haustorial escape route suggests that haustoria are a consequence of the genes that encode these three-dimensional structures.

From the sequences of the type II intranasal model of a haustorial escape route (Fig 1), we identified a gene that codes for a hypothetical protein. A BLASTp search of the GenBank database with the gene for this gene identified the C. neoformans gene (http://www.genbank.org), suggesting that the intranasal model of a haustorial escape route is not correct. The C. neoformans intranasal model of a haustorial escape route is in general well-conserved in fungal species [10,16,17,22,25,26].

We confirmed the location of this gene in the genome of C. neoformans using a blastp search. The C. neoformans intranasal model of a haustorial escape route was found to be highly conserved (Fig 1). In the genome of the strain carrying the C. neoformans intranasal model, we found a predicted gene product, that is, a hypothetical protein, with identical exons and 3'-UTRs to the C. neoformans intranasal protein.

Astracystis intranasal model of a haustorial escape route
We used the C. neoformans intranasal model of a haustorial escape route to analyze the expression of the three-dimensional structures of the three-dimensional structures. To do this, we used the C. neoformans intranasal model of a haustorial escape route to search for any additional intranasal or intronic gene products that could be identified in the C. neoformans intranasal model. The search was conducted using the C. neoformans intranasal model of a haustorial escape route and the results are shown in Table 1. The C.


## Discussion
The new C. neoformans strain was obtained in the FLC positive medium. It produced a high degree of inhibition in vivo in the C. neoformans. The strain has been isolated from the environment. The majority of strains in this study were obtained from clinical samples and the strains were often isolated from the environment. It was noticed that strains were not always identical. Therefore, we performed molecular typing of the strains. The strain has been isolated from the environment, but the genotype was not identified.

Fungal strain is a good molecular identification tool. However, the strain is not sensitive enough to detect the isolates. The strain is also a good molecular identification tool. However, the strain is not sensitive enough to detect the isolates. Therefore, we performed genetic screening of the strains. The strains were found to be the same as C. neoformans and C. gattii. The genotypes of C. neoformans and C. gattii were also similar to the strains of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. The strains of C. gattii were found to be more resistant to antifungal drugs. However, the strains of C.
