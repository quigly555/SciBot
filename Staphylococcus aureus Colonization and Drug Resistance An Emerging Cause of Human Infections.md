## Introduction
The family Phialophora complex was first described by Nees von Reinking and E.M.D. White [1] and was defined by three subfamilies, Phialophora, Pseudopipermium, and Pseudomonas. These fungi are responsible for several diseases and can cause the most devastating diseases in plants, such as leaf blotch, powdery mildew, root rot, blights, blights in the stem, and fruit rot [2]. In fact, they are so common that they have been isolated from over 80 countries and regions, and are also caused by many other species of fungi. They can cause an economical disease in humans and animals, with a worldwide distribution, called powdery mildew, which leads to 100% mortality in the wart-growing population [3]. Phialophora species are commonly found on diseased leaves and stems, and cause a wide variety of diseases in plant species, including leaf blotch, powdery mildew, root rot, fruit rot, and fruit blight, which can result in high economic losses and even death of the trees [4]. Pseudomonas species are common fungi and are responsible for the diseases caused by these fungi. They are found in most, but not all, genera of fungi, including P. tritici, P. tomentosa, P. toma and P. tola [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].


## Methods
revealed that the VL is associated with a significant increase in bacterial resistance [38. The authors found that C. albicans and C. albicans-related C. glabrata infection in animals infected with C. glabrata was significantly greater in mice infected with C. glabrata than in the control group [39]. Furthermore, a study by Lopes et al. demonstrated that C. glabrata was significantly more frequent in mice infected with C. albicans than in the control group [40]. All these studies showed that the C. glabrata is most often associated with C. albicans infections in humans.

Another important factor that could contribute to the increase in C. glabrata resistance in humans is the level of indoluent antimicrobial activity of the antimicrobial agent [41]. The authors of the recently published observational study suggested that the use of a nanomaterial, nanosilver [42], which is commonly used for antimicrobial testing, represents an important and fast-growing technology [43]. The authors reported that the nanomaterial may be used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the nanomaterials by comparison to a previously developed antibacterial assay [44].

Viral and bacteriostatic assays
In order to investigate the effect of antifungal drugs on the development of C. glabrata resistance, the authors of the recently published observational study reported that the reduction of the growth of C. glabrata to an even higher degree in the untreated control group was due to the reduction of the growth of the drug [45]. In their recent study, the authors of the recently published observational study compared the C. glabrata resistance of animals infected with C. glabrata with the control group, and reported that C. glabrata resistance was more frequent in the animal infected with C. glabrata than in the control group. The authors of the recently published observational study compared C. glabrata resistance of animals infected with C. glabrata with the control group and reported that C. glabrata resistance was more frequent in the animal infected with C. glabrata than in the control group. The authors of the recently published observational study compared C. glabrata resistance of animals infected with C.


## Results
cerevisiae, which are resistant to the antifungal drugs fluconazole and voriconazole, are also susceptible to amphotericin B, we found that the most commonly reported drug resistance in . cerevisiae is drug-sensitive C. albicans (Table 3). In addition, resistance of S. cerevisiae to azoles (e.g. voriconazole) has been demonstrated in S. pombe, where resistance to amphotericin B was found to be approximately 100% (Table 3).

Although resistance has been shown to be a common response in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis, we found that resistance of S. cerevisiae to fluconazole is also often associated with resistance of other Candida species, including C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and S. pneumoniae (Table 3). To address the nature of the resistance in C. albicans, we conducted susceptibility testing in the four species of C. albicans, including C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and S. pneumoniae (Table 4). We found that in the C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata isolates, the most commonly susceptible strains were C. albicans (Fig 2), while resistance to fluconazole was found to be 100% in C. parapsilosis and 100% in C. glabrata (Fig 2). The susceptibility of C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata isolates to fluconazole was also found to be comparable to that of S. pneumoniae (Fig 2).

Voriconazole Resistance of S. cerevisiae Is Associated With Resistance of Candida Species
We further investigated the genotypic heterogeneity of resistant S. cerevisiae strains in the four species of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. We found that S. cerevisiae and C. dubliniensis are genetically similar and exhibit relatively uniform genotypic diversity, with S. cerevisiae being resistant to the azole antifungal drugs fluconazole and voriconazole (Fig 3).


## Discussion
The C-type lectin receptor-like (CLR) complex is a novel ligand for a G protein-coupled receptor, which contains a novel subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that are conserved among fungi and bacteria [41. The CLR family of G proteins is conserved among fungi and bacteria. It contains the C-type lectin receptor, CDR1, and CDR2. It is unique among the CLRs in that it does not contain a C-type lectin receptor. Although the specific binding of CLR to C. albicans CDR1 is required for a complete IL-1ß response, we found that the C-type lectin receptor-like (CLR) receptor and the CDR1-like receptor-like receptor (CDR2-like receptor) have different receptors for IL-1ß, suggesting that the CDR1-like receptor and the CDR2-like receptor may also have a specific role in the IL-1ß response in C. albicans. The results presented here indicate that the C-type lectin receptors are involved in the recognition of C. albicans and that the C-type lectin receptors may have a unique role in the IL-1ß response in C. albicans.

The second novel mechanism by which C. albicans expresses the CLRs is through the expression of the C-type lectin receptors, CDR1 and CDR2. However, the C-type lectin receptors appear to be highly expressed in C. albicans. The C-type lectin receptors are mainly involved in the recognition of C. albicans and are involved in the production of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-a. These receptors are present in other fungi and bacteria as well. However, the C-type lectin receptors are involved in the recognition of C. albicans and are involved in the production of IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a. These receptors are present in other fungi and bacteria as well. Therefore, we believe that C. albicans expresses these receptors in a different way from other fungi.
