## Abstract
Lung cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. It is characterized by a spectrum of carcinogenic, genetic, and inflammatory effects. Tinea capitis (cap-cens) is a benign lesion of the skin, called T-self, which is more severe when it is caused by two sibling tumors. The disease is caused by two independent but distinct etiologies. The first etiology is an opportunistic infection, caused by a rare genus of Candida.


## Introduction
Fungi are a major component of the natural microbiota of many marine environments. A significant portion of fungi live as commensal microorganisms that may contribute to health, development and stress response in the host (Brouwer et al., 2007). In contrast, the fungal community in freshwater ecosystems is highly complex, with the diversity of fungi including most common pathogenic and opportunistic pathogens (Bao et al., 2011). The diversity of fungal communities has been highlighted as a major risk factor for fungal infections (Pfaller and Diekema, 2008). A number of studies have focused on the diversity of fungal communities in freshwater ecosystems (Wernegreen et al., 2006; Cogoni and Diekema, 2009; Bao et al., 2011; Shenoy et al., 2012; Moen et al.


## Methods
 2004) in mice (Figure 1) and overexpressing NLRP3 genes in mouse models of ADH2 (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) and CENP-1 (Li et a., 2011) to induce lethal induced TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-12, IL-17, and TNF-a (Figure 1). For CENP-1 overexpression in human models of spleen leukocytes (DERSHAIL-4, WK2-11, NK2.1), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of AMPK (S. cerevisiae), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TNF-a, spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TLR2 (S. cerevisiae), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TNF-a, spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TLR9 (S. cerevisiae), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TLR4 (S. cerevisiae), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2. For CENP-1 overexpression in mouse models of TLR7 (S. cerevisiae), spleen cells were grown in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C with 5% CO_2.


## Results
We then used the rat brain inflammasome inhibitor nelfinavir or the mouse inflammasome inhibitor cyclosporine B (CsB) to test if the inflammasome activation in the brain is affected by the NLRP3 inflammasome activatio. Consistent with the results from the previous study, there is a significant reduction in the brain inflammasome activation in the brain when the NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inhibited (Fig 4A). Consistent with this reduction, the brain inflammasome activation was also significantly decreased in the mouse inflammasome inhibitor-treated brain compared to the control brain (Fig 4B). These results demonstrate that the brain inflammasome activation is altered in the brain upon NLRP3 inhibition.

In order to determine whether the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to an alteration of the brain inflammasome activation, we monitored the inflammasome activation in the brain in the presence of the NLRP3 inhibitor for the first time. The brain inflammasome activation was significantly decreased in the NLRP3 inhibitor-treated brain compared to the control brain (Fig 4C). These results are consistent with the results of the previous study that showed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is controlled by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

In order to further investigate the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the brain by NLRP3 inhibition, we monitored the brain inflammasome activation in the presence of NLRP3 inhibition. The brain inflammasome activation was significantly decreased in the NLRP3 inhibitor-treated brain compared to the control brain (Fig 4D). These results are consistent with the results of the previous study that showed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is controlled by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.


## Discussion
The large number of non-targeted proteins present in the C. glabrata genome led us to search for novel genes involved in immune cell evasion. However, many of the targets that we found were not specific to C. glabrata. For instance, genes involved in innate immune response, cell cycle regulation and activation of immune cells are not present in C. glabrata. CgCnA/H2AX, a putative IL-17A receptor, is required for the adaptive immune response, and it was shown to play a role in host defense against C. glabrata and other fungal pathogens [23]. In the present study, we found that CgCnA/H2AX is also involved in immunity against C. glabrata. In our previous study, we found that CgCnA/H2AX was involved in the response to pathogen infection, specifically against C. albicans and C. neoformans [23]. The ability of C. glabrata to resist the immune response was also demonstrated in previous studies [21,22]. The lack of CgCnA/H2AX in C. glabrata probably occurs due to the suppression of the production of a gene in the CgCnA/H2AX transcription factor, which is a target of IL-17A. Since CgCnA/H2AX is involved in immune defense against fungal infections [22], it is likely that CgCnA/H2AX plays a similar role in C. glabrata immunity. The role of CgCnA/H2AX in immune defense against C.
