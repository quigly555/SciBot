## Abstract
The impacts of arthroconversions on yeast (w/out fermentation) and plant biomass yields are well documented. However, fermenting Arthroconis arthroconis with a single inoculum of Arthroconis polyacantha are controversial. The aim of the study was to reveal the effects of different fermenting cultivars, management, and cultivation, on the production of the final fermented product, a high-quality yeast biomass, to control the growth and biofilm development of Arthroconis wilt.

A total of 105 Arthroconis cultivars were used. Fermenting cultivars fermented their final product with a single inoculum, and the corresponding biomass was obtained by four means: 4-L, 9-J, and 12-L dilution methods. The dilution method was used to observe the effect of fermentation time, biodegradability index, temperature, and water uptake on the final biomass.


## Introduction
 (MIMT-I)” (1) (Figure 1), including both the transcriptomic and protein levels of the most common pathogenic fungi (i.e., Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, and Cryptococcus neoformans) (2). Such studies have revealed that the number of eukaryotic cells in the host is directly proportional to the number of fungal cells. In fact, the number of eukaryotic cells in the host is a key determinant of the immune response (3). Therefore, the eukaryotic cells present in the host must be able to assimilate substrates that are different from their own, that are involved in pathogen activation and development, as well as nutrients in the host environment. This review focuses on the factors that are commonly associated with the acquisition and maintenance of eukaryotic cells in the host and their implications for host cell fitness, disease and disease.

The microorganisms that are important for the lifecycle of eukaryotic cells include viruses (e.g., herpes viruses and cytomegalovirus) and parasites (e.g., helminths, mites, and nematodes) (4). The main processes of host-pathogen interaction are cell cycle progression and cytokine production (5). The host may be able to detect in the infectious agent, or host immune response, which has an influence on the outcome of the infection (6). The host may be able to prevent the infection by inducing a specific immune response, which in turn leads to the establishment of latent infection (7). The outcome of the infection depends on the host immune response, which is related to factors such as genetic factors, genetic susceptibility, and environmental conditions.

Studies of the host immune response to Candida albicans are based on in vitro studies, and were performed using immunodeficient mice and in vivo studies. The determination of the yeast counts and yeasts abundance in blood, tissues, and the circulation were performed after challenge, and quantitative PCR was done on the host using CLSI-BLAST, followed by a different antibody (sera from sera from mice) to identify the yeasts. The degree of the immune response to C. albicans was evaluated by quantitative proteomics analysis and expression of target proteins. Yeast cells were mainly found in the circulation and on the walls of the mouth and throat.


## Methods
For this, the number of bacteria and fungi was divided by the number of yeasts (n = 17), and the fungal community (n = 2) was divided by the number of bacteria (n = 7. The fecal samples were placed in sterile plastic containers and processed according to the guidelines provided by the Mycology Research Institute (MRI) (Ombe et al., 2015), and the samples were placed in sterile containers and sealed with Parafilm. The samples were processed after centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. The metabolites were identified using the method described by Li et al. (2016). The isolation and identification of the microorganisms were done in accordance with the CLSI M38-A2 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008), which provides a procedure for the identification of microorganisms in the culture medium (Bézawa et al., 2008). The identification of fungi was based on the methods described by Colot et al. (2016).

Animal experiments
Fungal infections with M. tuberculosis were performed in an experimental group of four animals. The mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Turku (accession number: 2018-09-06). The animals were kept in strict animal-control conditions and kept in individually ventilated cages. They were given free access to food and water. All animals were cared for in accordance with the principles of the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Turku (No.27/2017). The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with sterile food and water. The experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of the principles of the ethics committee and with the approval of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Turku (No.27/2017). All animal procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Turku (No.27/2017).

In order to evaluate the performance of the pathogen-free experiments, the animals were euthanized after exposure to a lethal dose of the M. tuberculosis inoculum, and the kidneys were removed. The kidneys were weighed and homogenized in sterile distilled water, followed by filtration through a sterile filter paper.


## Results
destructiva va. destructiva genome were obtained from the NCBI and ENVUSTUS databases using the GenBank BLASTX database. The sequences were classified into 817 fungal taxa based on sequence similarity to known taxa and PHI-base consensus sequences. Based on the BLASTX analysis, a total of 1,913,064 sequences were classified into 1737 classes, with an average of 2,851 sequences per class. The distribution of sequences from the classes represented by the top 16 classifications was similar to that obtained with PHI-base analyses. The best classified fungal sequences were in the order Mycosphaerella, Microsphaeropsis, and Phaeosphaeriopsis, where the lowest numbers were found. The lowest number of sequences were found in the order Diaporthales, where the highest number of sequences were observed with 2,006 sequences per class. Among the classes, the fungal communities of the three studied regions were mainly composed of fungal genera, such as Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Zygomycota (Fig 4a). The bacterial OTUs represented in the bacterial classes were well represented in the fungal communities, ranging from 10,512 in the P. destructiva var. destructiva genome to 1,024 in the P. destructiva var. mycosphaeri genome. The fungal OTUs were classified into 488 families, with an average of 5,066 sequences per family.

The distribution of fungal community based on the PHI-base analyses revealed that the bacterial and fungal OTUs represented in the bacterial communities were mainly diverse. The best classified fungal OTUs in the community of P. destructiva var. mycosphaeri were in the order Mycosphaerella, Microsphaeropsis, and Phaeosphaeriopsis, where the lowest numbers of sequences were observed (Fig 4b). The fungal OTUs in the fungal community were mainly represented by species of the genera Trichoderma, Trichosporon, and Debaryomyces, where the highest numbers of sequences were observed.
