## Abstract

We analyzed the global literature for reports of Histoplasmosis on the Map of HIV-positive Patients with AIDS (HIV+), who are followed at the onset of severe IFI. We included all reports of Histoplasmosis on the Map since its original publication in 1970. We included the following reports from all countries with available international data: Italy, where the last case of Histoplasmosis was reported in 2008, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively; Norway, where the last case of Histoplasmosis was reported in 2014, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Committee on the definition of opportunistic infections (Classification of Histoplasmosis) in 2015; Spain, where the last case of Histoplasmosis was reported in 2017; and United Kingdom, where the last case of Histoplasmosis was reported in 2017. We conducted a systematic review to identify reports of Histoplasmosis on the Map in the countries with available data.

We searched the table of contents for the following reports: 2008, when an estimated 1.2 million cases of Histoplasmosis were reported, 2012, 2013, 2016, in 2016/2017, and in 2019, with an increase in 2.5 million cases. The distribution of the reports shows that 1.2 million cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (2.4 million cases), mainly in Nigeria (1.4 million), Tanzania (1.4 million), and Ethiopia (1.3 million). The most affected age groups were <5 years (Males, Females) and <10 years (Men, <5 years).

The distribution of the reports highlight that there are huge numbers of people living with Histoplasmosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria, Tanzania, and Ethiopia show a high incidence of Histoplasmosis. The spectrum of Histoplasmosis on the Map is very wide and calls for urgent action. Nigeria and Tanzania are among the countries with the highest number of cases of Histoplasmosis. Tanzania has the highest number of cases of Histoplasmosis in sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 1.2 million cases of this disease.

We recommended to the authors the study of histoplasmosis in children and adults, which should be done in every country with a population of under 15 years, and with a prompt diagnosis, to achieve a free and rapid diagnosis.


## Introduction
Chemokines and their receptors are key players in the immune system and play diverse roles in the regulation of cell functions. For example, the nuclear receptor for green fluorescent protein (GFP), NKp46 is a chemokine and a key player in the control of multiple cellular processes. It has a signal transduction pathway that is characterized by the action of two types of receptors: the nuclear receptor for chromatin-associated protein 1 (CSA1) and the nonchromatin-associated protein 2 (CSA2). CSA1 is activated by ligand-mediated interactions with the nuclear receptor for chromatin-associated protein 2 (NKC2) and the nonchromatin-associated protein 1 (NCU1) [1], and the NLCU1 mediates conformational changes that lead to the inhibition of CSA1 [2].


## Methods
We aimed to review the literature and identify the relevant studie. The review included the following groups: (1) ART-naïve patients with HIV diagnosis; (2) patients with clinical signs of advanced HIV disease; (3) patients with Histoplasmosis who had ART; (4) patients with a history of meningitis; (5) patients with Histoplasmosis who had sepsis; (6) patients with a history of meningitis, and (7) patients who developed Histoplasmosis after ART treatment. The full text of the review is available in the online supplemental material (Table 1).

We studied the review process of the relevant studies to identify the relevant studies. The review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (Organisation for Economic and Social Cooperation for HIV/AIDS, 2008, 2006, 2011, 2016), and we used the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ICA) for evaluating the relevance of the criteria developed in this study. The definition of review process is: an interventional review was conducted from the initial review, in which case the review was composed of one expert and two second-reader. The main conclusions were the following: a) the evaluation of the relevant studies was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; b) the review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and the effectiveness of the treatment was considered as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; c) the studies were reviewed and concluded in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; d) the case was classified as definite if it showed good clinical outcomes, and possible partial or definite if it showed no clinical signs of severe disease; e) the case was considered to be uncertain if it showed no clinical signs of meningitis; f) the review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; and g) the case was classified as probable if the primary outcome was death.

We obtained the data from the review process.


## Results
The median age was 56 years (range, 17-78 years) and 100 of them were female (Table 1. The median CD4+ T-cell count was 94 cells/µl (range, 25-249 cells/µl) and 92.5% had an undetectable viral load of 25 copies/ml. The median CD4+ T-cell count was 64 cells/µl (range, 24-192 cells/µl) and 94.5% had an undetectable viral load of 25 copies/ml. Of the 49 patients with advanced HIV disease, 35 had been treated with antiretroviral drugs for at least one month and three had been started on voriconazole and fluconazole.

We found that the frequency of HIV infection among patients with advanced HIV disease was: (1) 6.6% (n=25) in patients with advanced HIV disease, (2) 2.3% (n=22) in patients with advanced HIV disease, (3) 1.9% (n=22) in patients with advanced HIV disease, (4) 3.2% (n=12) in patients with advanced HIV disease, (5) 4.5% (n=21) in patients with advanced HIV disease, and (6) 5.1% (n=22) in patients with advanced HIV disease. Of the total number of HIV-infected patients, 30.7% were male, 58.6% were female, and 40.2% had been on voriconazole and fluconazole for at least one month.

The AIDS status of HIV-infected patients was unknown (Table 2). There was no significant difference in age, sex, CD4+ T-cell count, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV infection by PCP, underlying diseases, or HIV serostatus among patients with advanced HIV disease.

Safety Evaluation of Antiretroviral Drugs
The level of clinical and radiological complications was found to be 3.8% (n=51), 1.9% (n=31), and 2.5% (n=23), respectively. We found that of the 2 patients with advanced HIV disease, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was 5.2% (n=8) (Table 3).


## Discussion
In this study, we investigated the antifungal activity of AmB against S. aureus at concentrations ranging from 0.2 µg/ml to 0.3 µg/ml. The antifungal activity was evaluated by the MIC determination against eight clinical strains. The MIC of AmB was 0.12 mg/mL against A. fumigatus and 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus. The MIC values of AmB ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus. We also observed significant inhibition of growth of A. fumigatus with AmB at concentrations of 0.2 µg/ml and 0.3 µg/ml. The MIC values of AmB were 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus and 1.0 mg/mL against S. aureus.
