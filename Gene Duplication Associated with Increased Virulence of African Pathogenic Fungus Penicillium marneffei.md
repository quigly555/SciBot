## Abstract
This study evaluated the in vitro activity of the essential oil from the aerial parts of Torula glutinis (Pt) against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis (CA). The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oil were determined. The essential oil was fractionated by column chromatography and its absolute mass was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The crude extract was prepared and fractionated by column chromatography and its absolute mass was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The essential oil was prepared fractionated by fractionating tannic acids and its absolute mass was determined by LC-MS/MS.


## Introduction
marneffei) and Pseudallescheria boydii (. boydii) have been characterized [14]. The two species are pathogenic in nature but can also cause disease in humans [15].

P. marneffei and P. boydii are the two most important opportunistic fungal pathogens worldwide, causing significant economic losses [16]. Inhalation of the infectious hyphomycete Penicillium marneffei is the main route of infection of the human host, and can result in life-threatening invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [17]. Inhalation of the infectious hyphomycete Penicillium marneffei is the route of most opportunistic fungal infections in patients with severely impaired immunity [18]. Invasive aspergillosis is the most frequent fungal infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [19]. The severe immunodeficiency conditions, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and acquired de Medicis disease (AIDS) [20], are associated with a higher incidence of P. marneffei infections [21].

Different mechanisms have been proposed to cause fungal infections. Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, is the most common pathogenic agent of candidiasis, a serious worldwide problem [22]. This pathogen is able to cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromized patients [23]. The ability of C. albicans to cause disease in different body tissues, such as the lungs, skin, and central nervous system (CNS), is linked to its morphological transition. In addition, the same cell type can also cause disease in different patients [24]. Thus, the ability of C. albicans to cause disease can be considered a means of communication, which allows C. albicans to directly affect other fungi, such as other pathogens, through host-pathogen interactions [25].

In the past, Candida albicans was considered to be a harmless fungus, and this view has changed with the advent of effective antifungal drugs such as caspofungin and azoles [26]. The emergence of azole-resistant strains that are resistant to both the conventional and alternative drugs is a major global health problem [27].


## Methods
First, we constructed a sequence of the species' DNA sequences, using the BLAST algorithm and all sequences with a homology-to-exo. The sequences of the species were compared with the sequences of the genus Penicillium marneffei (MacCallum, 1992; Flesch et al., 2013), using the BLAST search option (Edgar et al., 2013). The first selection of sequences was used to check if there was evidence of a homologous recombination event. Then, we compared the sequence similarity between the two species. We then calculated the number of genes (K) that are closely related (K = 1), which is defined as the total number of genes that are related to a species (K^2) and the number of genes (K^n) that are close to a species (K^n) (Odds, 2003). We defined K as the number of genes that are closely related to a species (K^n^2).

We generated a matrix of gene duplications (K) using the codeml program in R (R Development Core Team, 2015) (Mackey and Mathieu, 2010). We generated the number of genes from the population of each species, defined as the number of genes in each population (K) (Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Fig S4). Then, we checked whether the duplication process was efficient, and whether the duplication rate was low or high. In order to correct for these two factors, we calculated the number of duplication events for each species in the dataset (K) (Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Fig S4) by dividing the number of gene duplications per species by the total number of duplications per species.

Finally, we calculated the number of gene duplications per species (K) (Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Fig S5).

Bacterial and fungal DNA and RNA analysis
Total DNA was extracted from bacteria using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by the Qiagen Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the RNA was extracted from fungi using the High Pure PCR Product Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Both procedures were performed in triplicate.


## Results
Acetobacter baumannii was found to be the most virulent strain in the insect model of infection, infecting over 100% of the insect organs (Figure 1A. The virulence of the A. baumannii strain was more severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulence of Aeromonas vaginalis. The virulence of the virulent Aeromonas aeruginosa was less severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent C. vaginalis. The virulence of the C. vaginalis strain was more severe in comparison to the virulence of the C. vaginalis strain. The virulence of the C. vaginalis strain was more severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent C. vaginalis strain.

To evaluate the ability of C. vaginalis to invade the host tissues, we analyzed the virulence of the virulent C. vaginalis strain (Figure 1B). The virulence of C. vaginalis strain was more severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent C. vaginalis strain. The virulence of the C. vaginalis strain was less severe in comparison to the virulence of the C. vaginalis strain. The virulence of the C. vaginalis strain was more severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent C. vaginalis strain.

In order to evaluate the virulence of the C. vaginalis strain in terms of pathogenesis, we examined the virulence of the C. vaginalis strain in pathogenic fungi, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus tubingensis, and Aspergillus penicilliosae. The pathogenic Aspergillus fumigatus was the most virulent strain in the host tissue of the infection (Figure 1C). The virulence of the pathogenic Aspergillus terreus strain was less severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent Aspergillus terreus strain. The virulence of the pathogenic Aspergillus tubingensis strain was less severe in comparison to the virulence of the virulent Aspergillus terreus strain.


## Discussion
Our findings suggest that the ability of pathogenic fungal pathogens to infect host cells, to colonize various host tissues, is increased, especially in immunocompromised patient. The use of different fungal species, in combination, can lead to the development of different infectious diseases, such as cryptococcosis, as well as pulmonary disease, whereas in immunocompromised hosts, the infection of host cells is usually less intense, and the disease is mainly acquired by inhalation[32].

In immunocompetent hosts, cryptococcosis has been reported to occur in up to 10% of cases[34]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a typical species of Cryptococcus, and is found in immunocompetent individuals and in HIV-infected individuals[35]. The most common immunological deficits, such as weakened immune system, inflammation, and immunopathology, are seen in immunocompetent hosts. A previous study reported a trend of increased mortality and mortality in patients with cryptococcosis[36].

Regarding the lymphocyte infiltration into lymphoid tissue, Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be more virulent than other yeasts[37]. In HIV patients, the pulmonary fungal infection in HIV-infected individuals is related to an increased lymphocyte infiltration into lymphoid tissue, and Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of lung fungal infections[38]. Another study reported increased frequency of disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans in HIV patients[39].

The increase in the number of fungal infections is the result of several factors, including infection-related immunopathology, the use of immunosuppressant drugs, and infection-related disorders like aging and autoimmune disorders. Among these disorders, the use of immunosuppressant drugs has been found to increase the occurrence of fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphoid infiltration,[40] which is a common condition in HIV patients.[ 21] The former is due to the use of immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, the latter due to the use of steroids and the use of immunosuppressant drugs.
