## Abstract
In recent years, numerous reports of fungal infections have been reported. While it is well-known that fungi are associated with systemic disease in immunocompromised patients, there has not been much attention given to the role of fungi in immunocompetent individuals. In this study, we focused on the role of the fungus Candida albicans in the host response to the high-dose of intravenous (IV) amphotericin B (AmB) and the administration of flucytosine (5FC) followed by AmB. We first observed that the plasma levels of C. albicans protein, hyo- linseed extract, glucoside, and peptone were increased in IV and 24 h of the AmB dose compared with the non-treated animals. The level of C. albicans protein and peptone were also increased in the treated animals after intravenous (IV) amB and 24 h of the AmB dose compared with the non-treated animals. Finally, we evaluated the immunogenicity of peptone treated with the peptone- treated animals. Our results confirm that treatment of animals with peptone increased the levels of C. albicans protein and peptone. Our results suggest that the plasma membrane integrity of the animals after the high-dose of AmB in our experiments and the administration of peptone cause the enhancement of the immunogenicity of the treated animals.


## Introduction
These azoles act by binding to ergosterol and can cause toxic side effect. In addition, as such, there is a need to develop new antifungals that have better therapeutic mechanisms to inhibit the development of fungal diseases and that have better mechanisms to inhibit fungal growth in the absence of ergosterol, and at the same time, at a concentration that is harmless to the organism.

Ergosterol is a natural antioxidant found in all living organisms and is required for the normal growth of most cells. In yeast and fungi, the ergosterol pathway is highly conserved and found in all eukaryotic cells, including humans, plants and fungi. The ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme ergosterol biosynthesis is induced by oxidative stress and is regulated by the stress hormone, echinocandins. The overexpression of the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme ß-oxidationase is a key enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in mammals, fungi, bacteria and plants. It is found in all eukaryotic cells and has been shown to be essential for viability but not for growth. Inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis by the azoles has been shown to impair the growth of some fungal species such as Histoplasmaczus erythroleus, Candida albicans and C. neoformans [5]-[7]. The effects of azoles on ergosterol biosynthesis are mainly mediated by the inhibition of the enzyme ergosterol de novo synthesis [8]. Inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis by the azoles has been shown to impair the growth of some fungal species such as Histoplasmaczus erythroleus, Candida albicans and C. neoformans.

The ergosterol pathway has been studied in several fungal species, including Candida spp. [9] and Histoplasmaczus spp. [10].


## Methods

In Vivo Testing of the Safety and Antifungal Activity of Streptomyces . oryzae
The laboratory method of Vivo-Tests was adapted from the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [39]. Briefly, Vivo-Tests were performed in the Clinical Pharmacology Division of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo. For the evaluation of antifungal activity, the technique was repeated three times.

Two days after the first Vivo-Tests, the yeast was observed by microscopy. A colony was considered to be considered as resistant if it was observed in at least three colonies of the same species [40].

Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of Streptomyces R. oryzae was evaluated using a micro-dilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations [41]. Briefly, the method of Vivo-Tests was performed using a sterile swab, which was then dipped in sterile water and then dipped in a solution of 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The suspension was then diluted in sterile water to get the desired concentrations. The number of colonies was counted in a Bactec^® 1200 BioTek Synergy 2 (Becton Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA). A stock solution of 0.05% DMSO was prepared in sterile water. The dilution was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h and then the optical density was read at 595 nm with a spectrophotometer (BioTek Synergy 2, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).

The concentration of the tested compound was calculated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [43]. The test was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) [44]. The MFC values were calculated based on the lowest concentration that inhibited 50% of growth of the test organism at a concentration of less than 0.01 µg/mL. The experiment was performed in a volume of 0.5 mL.


## Results
Detection and characterization of a novel naphthylamine-producing fungus in piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant (PTAR) mice
Piperacillin-tazobactam was used as a positive control to evaluate the ability of P. vivax to produce a naphthylamine-producing fungus, but we found no differences in the ability of P. vivax to produce a naphthylamine-producing fungus in the PTAR groups. The capability of P. vivax to produce a naphthylamine-producing fungus in the PTAR groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Table 1).


## Discussion
Isolation and phylogenetic characterization of strains
The yeast strains were isolated from the soil samples of several geographic locations, including Malawian mountains, Malawalu, Ciltho, and Ngunrungatungatung in the coastal waters of Malawalu. However, the isolates belonged to two distinct clades, which were different from each other. The first clade was formed by only one strain, which was isolated from the soil sample of the mouth of the Ciltho-Malawalu river, which is the main drinking water source for many Malawian eucalypts, including C. albicans. The second clade was formed by only one strain, which was isolated from the soil sample of Ngunrungatungatung in the coastal waters of Malawalu. All of these two clades are closely related to one another, and therefore, we can speculate that the isolates originated from the same source.

We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses, and compared the genomes of the two clades. The major clades of the C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates, C. albicans and C. glabrata, clustered into two different clades. The C.
