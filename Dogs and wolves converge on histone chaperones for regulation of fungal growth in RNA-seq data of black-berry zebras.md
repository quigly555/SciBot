## Abstract
The natural and anthropogenic effects of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) from the mycotoxigenic fungus Pseudomonas putida on the fungal pathogenicity tree have been studied. The plant pathogenicity was studied by growing P. putida in roots and seeds of non-target plants in the greenhouse or field. The root mycobiome was characterized by the analysis of the distribution and composition of the fungal taxa, as well as the clustering with other fungi. The clustering of P. putida with other fungi was particularly striking, as it was shown that the root mycobiome was dominated by a diversity of fungal taxa. Moreover, the results of bioinformatic analyses revealed that P. putida was the main fungal species in the root mycobiome of maize grown in the field. As an anthropogenic factor, P. putida is probably beneficial to the plant host and for the plant pathogenicity tree. This study represents the first comprehensive characterization of the root mycobiome in the greenhouse field and may eventually contribute to the accurate identification of beneficial and anthropogenic root mycobiomes in the host. The results of the bioinformatic analysis highlighted that P. putida was the main root mycobiome in the root mycobiomes of maize grown in the field. In addition, we found that P. putida was the main fungus in the root mycobiomes of non-target plants growing in the greenhouse.


## Introduction
In these black-berry zebras, the only chaperones in the cytosol are cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc3 and Cdc42, which mediate signaling events that are dependent on transcription factors such as Cdc42 [18. Cdc42 is important for the regulation of transcription factors that include the Protein A, the Ca^2+-binding proteins Cbp1, Cbp2, and Cbp3, as well as the Src complex, a negative regulatory control of the transcription of the red-light response (RH) genes [19]. Cbp1 and Cbp2 are important for the transcription of the Rho1-related genes that govern the phagolysosome and the haemoglobin signaling pathways, respectively, while the Ca^2+-binding proteins Cbp1, Cbp2, and Cbp3 are important for the regulation of the red-light response [19]. A combination of the histone-modifier chaperones and the Ca^2+-binding proteins Cbp1, Cbp2, and Cbp3 are important for the regulation of transcription factors that regulate the red-light response [20]. In addition to the negative regulatory control by chaperones, other transcription factors and signaling molecules are also involved in the control of red-light responses. Cdc42 and other proteins are the major components of the histone-modifier response and are involved in red-light signaling, such as the red-light response regulator LreA [21], the ortholog of the orange-yellow complex (OCC) in bacteria and the Rho1-related protein Nmr1 in eukaryotes [22], [23].

The genomes of the black-berry zebras, and other black-berry phytoplankton, contain hundreds of genes involved in all three processes, such as respiration, autolysis, and biosynthesis of sugars, proteins, lipids, and lipoproteins [16]. The genome of the black-berry zebras contains 11,843 genes that are homologous to the genomes of several other species of the genus, including numerous red- and brown-rotating diploid euploids and haploid fruiting bodies, and the three-celled ascomycetous phytoplankton [24].


## Methods
For example, histone-like genes of the fungal taxonomic level are predicted to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and protein synthesi. Moreover, histone acetylation from the fungal microorganisms and metabolic pathways is known to be involved in fungal growth in RNA-seq data of black-berry zebras. The transcription of histones has been detected by histone acetylation with the use of the KAPA transcription factor system. The KAPA transcription factor system is a transcriptional modification of the KAPA-TAG system [42], with the addition of the C-terminal region to facilitate expression of C-terminal histones [43]. For example, histone acetylation from the bacteria Caenorhabditis elegans and the yeast K. pneumoniae were used to normalize the expression of C-terminal histones. The expression of KAPA was determined by using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method [44]. The histone acetylation from the yeast K. pneumoniae was also used to normalize the expression of C-terminal histones.

Zebrafish morphotyping
Zebrafish embryos were exposed to one zoospin hyphae and one thorax on a coverslip for 10 min at 25°C. A zebrafish embryo was then exposed to a caged group of 20 zebrafish larvae for 1 h at 25°C. Animals were then challenged with 20 µg of either zoospin hyphae or the thorax separately by placing the thorax with an 8 mm sclerotia film over the body of the zebrafish. The zebrafish were then exposed to zebrafish larvae by placing the coverslip over the hind of the zebrafish. The zebrafish were then exposed to zebrafish larvae by placing the hind hind leg of the zebrafish on a coverslip. All zebrafish larvae were then challenged with zebrafish larvae by placing the hind leg of the zebrafish on a coverslip. The hind leg of the zebrafish was then used to measure the total number of zebrafish larvae by counting the number of flies that were fed on each larva.


## Results
The significance of the interaction between wild-type and the subtype HOG1 gene (as determined by a conditional knockout) has been described previously [7], [8. In S. cerevisiae, HOG1 is a part of the Hog1 complex that regulates the expression of a number of stress-responsive genes in response to various stressors [9]. The HOG1 gene is present in all three different eukaryotic lineages of life (fig 1). The HOG1 gene was recently shown to be required for fungal survival in a number of different conditions [10]. The stress-responsive proteins in the HOG1 gene are expressed during cell wall stress in different stress conditions [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], and the HOG1 gene is required for fungal survival in a number of different stresses.

The HOG1 gene is required for filamentous growth and hyphal growth in S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotic organisms
We have previously shown that in S. cerevisiae, the HOG1 gene is expressed in both HOG1 and the other two Hog1-like genes (HOG1 and HOG2) [3], [4], [5], [19], [20]. However, in S. cerevisiae, the HOG1 gene was not fully expressed in the HOG2 gene in a number of filamentous and hyphal species. The HOG1 gene has been shown to be essential for growth in S. cerevisiae, but not in other fungi [3], [4], [5], [19], [20], [21]. It is known that the HOG1 gene is essential for growth in S. cerevisiae but not in other filamentous ascomycetes.

To assess the role of the HOG1 gene in filamentous growth, we grew wild-type and the subtype HOG1 and HOG2 strains in YPD medium. Wild-type HOG1 and subtype HOG2 strains were morphologically indistinguishable from each other in the growth assay, and HOG1 and HOG2 strains were morphologically indistinguishable from each other in the two-hybrid screen (data not shown).


## Discussion
 2008; Zhang et a., 2013). Fungal microenvironments also play an important role in fungal pathogenicity (Kumar et al., 2015). In Ulva’s study, we compared the fungal community composition to the fungal community in the leaves of the black-berry zebras. In Ulva’s study, we observed that the Ulva-pretreated leaves of the zebras contained higher fungal community than the leaves of the black-berry zebras. In contrast, the leaves of the pines contained higher fungal community than the leaves of the zebras. We observed that the black-berry zebras of the pines had a higher fungal community than the leaves of the zebras. This is consistent with the reports that fungal communities vary greatly between the leaves of black-berry zebras and the leaves of pines (Santos et al., 2008; Crous et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016). In contrast, we observed that the fungal communities of the leaves of pines of Ulva had a higher fungal community than that of the leaves of the zebras of the pines. This is consistent with the results of the studies that show that fungal communities of leaves vary significantly in the United States (Crous et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015; Guan et al., 2016). Furthermore, we observed that the fungal communities of leaves of the pines of Ulva and Ulva have a higher fungal community than the leaves of the zebras of the pines. This suggests that the fungal communities of leaves in Ulva and Ulva are more diverse than those in leaves of the zebras. However, this result does not support the hypothesis that fungal communities in leaves of Ulva and Ulva differ in their fungal communities.

We also observed that the fungal community of leaves of Ulva differed significantly from that of leaves of the zebras. This is consistent with the results of other studies (Santos et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016).
