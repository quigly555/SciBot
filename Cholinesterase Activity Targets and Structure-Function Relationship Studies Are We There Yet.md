## Abstract
Fungal infections caused by the etiological agents of cryptococcosis, fungal pathogens, and dermatitis are difficult to treat, and there is an urgent need to find novel immunotherapeutic targets. In this study, we used a novel isolate of Cryptococcus gattii, Scedosporium apiospermum, as a natural complementary to natural or biflavon and used a tRNA-based RNA interference library construction library construction library construction library screening method to detect potential targets for immunotherapy. The targeted RNA molecules targeting proteins involved in virulence were designed and produced by the technique described in detail below. One Scedosporium apiospermum target, Sce4p, was found to be a target of melanin, a natural and versatile pigment with antimicrobial properties. We found that the RNA molecules targeting Sce4p were indeed specifically expressed and that their expression was regulated in response to the pathogen, with Sce4p being the most potent fluorescently-regulated molecule. Our data supports the notion that a melanin-ligand interaction can prime the necessary morphological switch required for a viable infection.


## Introduction
albicans, and they have found that this compound has a strong inhibitory effect on fungal growth and biofilm formatio. However, the experimental findings are not consistent with the results observed with the other thiosulphoxins. The authors conclude that TAT-A has no direct antifungal activity against C. albicans, but that it can exert fungicidal effects against a higher proportion of Candida strains. The authors make several attempts to explain the discrepancy in the results of the experimental and the results reported by the authors, but the main conclusion is that the experimental results are not consistent with the results observed with the other thiosulphoxins.

We would like to point out that the authors of this study did not make a separate Medline search to retrieve all the abstracts and full text of the manuscript. Therefore, the search was performed using the full text of the papers and search terms related to the aforementioned. In addition, we manually searched PubMed databases to retrieve all the references to find all the references to the cited articles. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a scientific journal has released a software package that can retrieve all the abstracts of a biological agent and its corresponding abstracts from an online repository. We have expanded the search functionality by including the ability to search for all the articles retrieved from PubMed or Google Scholar. The resulting databases now contain a large number of papers, which can be browsed and viewed through any computer or mobile device. This software can provide you with the information you need to make a thorough comparison of the data, the data presented, and the conclusions to the published data. Furthermore, it can also alert you to the possibility of a potentially serious infection when the data are presented. If you experience any difficulties in using the software, please contact us.

We hope that you find our work presented in this paper helpful. If you have any questions or concerns, or if there are any concerns about the accuracy of our data sharing policy, please email us at plosone@plos.org.

PLOS has incorporated Similarity Check, powered by iThenticate, as a data privacy policy. Each PLOS undertakes at least two checks and you will need to provide the required confirmation.


## Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution and was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of our institution and was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Ethics Committees of our institution.

2.1. Clinical Trial
In this prospective observational study, all patients with P. brasiliensis clinical syndrome (PbSS) were included in the present study. All patients were admitted to our hospital for diagnosis of PbSS between November 2016 and November 2017, and were admitted to our university hospital for diagnosis of PbSS between January 2016 and June 2017.


## Results
The peptide-free assay was applied in the presence of 25 µM of 10 mM CaCl_2 for 10 min and a reaction was stopped by a dialysis rinse followed by a Sephadex Blue (Fig 1A. The recombinant protein was cleaved by a combination of ammonium sulfate (0.1%) and sulfite ion (0.2%) to yield a recombinant, monomeric protein (Fig 1B). Protein degradation by the peptide-free assay was followed by the use of a copper chelator (50 µM) and an antibody to E. coli GFP (Fig 1C). The recombinant protein was further purified using a gradient centrifugation method for a total of 7.5 × 10^6 Rec in the absence and presence of 10 mM CaCl_2, followed by a high-throughput reaction with 100 µM of peptide-free CaCl_2. Protein degradation by the peptide-free assay was followed by a copper chelator (50 µM) and an antibody to E. coli GFP (Fig 1D). The recombinant protein was further purified using a gradient centrifugation method for a total of 7.5 × 10^6 Rec in the absence and presence of 10 mM CaCl_2, followed by a high-throughput reaction with 100 µM of peptide-free CaCl_2. Protein degradation by the peptide-free assay was followed by a copper chelator (50 µM) and an antibody to E. coli GFP (Fig 1E).

## Discussion

In this study, we analyzed the genome of . lagenarium, a fungal pathogen and a common potato in the Amazon. The pathogenic fungus C. lagenarium was first isolated from soil contaminated with herbivores from the Venezuelan National Food Supply (VNS). The tree pathogen C. neoformans was first isolated from soil contaminated with herbivores from Brazil, China, Japan, South Korea, and China, and then from tree hollows of pine trees of the Amazon region (Nash et al., 2012). C. lagenarium was reported to cause over 10 million fungal infections in South America (Jolly et al., 2007; Jolly and colleagues, 2010). The current study showed that C. lagenarium is one of the most prevalent fungal pathogens in the Amazonian forest of the Amazon Basin and it has become one of the most frequently occurring pathogens in the Amazon. This fungal pathogen was originally discovered in soil contaminated with herbivores from the Amazonian forest (VNS). During the last years, a new fungal species has been reported in the Amazonian forest of the Amazonian region and it was reported that it was capable of infecting and causing disease on trees of the Amazonian region (VNS). It was found that it has a strong capacity to infect and cause diseases on various tree species of the Amazonian region (VNS). In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the fungal community in the soil and soil samples of the Amazonian region and the results showed that C. lagenarium was the most dominant species in the soil samples. This species was also found in the soil of several plant species in the Amazon. For example, C. lagenarium was reported to be associated with the wood of Quercus and Pinus in the Amazon (VNS). However, in this study, C. lagenarium was found in the soil of different plants. Furthermore, we also analyzed the genome of C. lagenarium in the soil and soil of Quercus. The results showed that C. lagenarium was present in the soil of both the soil and soil samples.
