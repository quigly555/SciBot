## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus Candida albicans causes superficial and systemic infections in susceptible individuals. The ability of the fungus to undergo self-renewal after infection is fundamental to its pathogenicity. The fungus expresses a set of secreted proteases, called ATPase, which react with the host proteins to form ATP-rich plasma. In order to understand how these reactions occur, we investigated the proteomic response of C. albicans to different proteins in the plasma membrane.

The secretome of infected C. albicans was analyzed. The protein-protein interaction network included a set of secreted proteins, which were related to virulence, stress response and tolerance. The proteome comparison between wild type and mutant strains indicated that the protease-rich plasma membrane proteins had a large and complex set of interactions. The protease-rich plasma membrane were more active than the other membranes. The secretome was more similar between mutant and wild type C. albicans cells.

The protease-rich plasma membrane could be a useful target for the development of novel antifungal drugs against C. albicans.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and have high clinical relevance [1,2]. IFIs are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic yeast pathogen that can cause infection in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS [3]. IFIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE patients, although also with a low frequency in other sub-groups of SLE patients [4]. Furthermore, IFIs are associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infection in SLE patients [5]. In addition, there is increasing evidence that the incidence of IFIs is increasing in industrialized countries with a greater prevalence of ART [6].

Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is a fungal pathogen that can cause infection in immunocompromised patients. The infection can be asymptomatic or disseminated. Cryptococcus neoformans is also known to be the cause of opportunistic infections in apparently immunocompetent patients, such as bacterial and viral meningitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and even respiratory infections [7,8]. In addition, C. neoformans is also a human pathogen, which can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients [9,10].


## Methods
After 4 h, the blood samples were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3X, 10X, 20X, and 25X) and Western blot analysis using the anti-GFP antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA. The concentration of Ghatsaucee-induced GIS protein was determined using the Mouse GIS Protein Assay Kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.


## Results
In total, the total number of proteins was significantly different among the strains studied (Fig 4. The number of proteins was significantly lower in the Ghatsauceus mutant, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.3) (Fig 5). The number of proteins was significantly higher in the Ghatsauceus mutant than in the other two strains, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.7). The number of proteins was significantly higher in the Ghatsauceus mutant than in the other two strains, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.4) (Fig 5). These results indicate that Ghatsauceus mutants have a reduced ability to produce proteins.

We analyzed the protein levels of transmembrane proteins using the Tris-H^+-TEM kit (Supplementary Figure S3). The protein level of transmembrane proteins was significantly lower in Ghatsauceus mutants than in the other two strains (Fig 6). The protein level of transmembrane proteins was significantly lower in Ghatsauceus mutant than in the other two strains, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.6). These results indicate that Ghatsauceus mutants have a reduced ability to synthesize transmembrane proteins.

Transcriptome Analysis of Protosporella Fungi in Response to Ghatsauceus Mutant
To investigate the transcriptome of Protosporella in response to Ghatsauceus, we conducted RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis in the presence and absence of Ghatsauceus. The RNA-Seq data revealed the transcriptome of Protosporella in response to Ghatsauceus (Fig 7). The total number of genes in each transcriptome was significantly higher in the Ghatsauceus mutant than in the other two strains, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.1) (Fig 7). The total number of transcripts was significantly lower in the Ghatsauceus mutant than in the other two strains, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.7) (Fig 7).


## Discussion
The RNAi-mediated gene silencing was carried out in . coli and Protosporella cells from the <U+0394>GAT1-2 strain and the <U+0394>GAT1-3 strain (Figure 4B). After 18 h of incubation in the presence of the mutant protein, all of the Protosporella cells contained a low copy of Ghatasauceptine (Figure 4A). To identify a putative Ghatasauceptine transporter gene, we deleted the <U+0394>GAT1-3 gene (Figure 4B). In the <U+0394>GAT1-4 strain, Ghatasauceptine and its transporter protein were detected in the secretome of the cell wall (Figure 5B and Figure 6B). These results indicate that Ghatasauceptine is required for Ghatasauceptine-mediated gene silencing of the Protosporella transcriptome. In contrast, the <U+0394>GAT1-4 strain did not contain Ghatasauceptine (Figure 4B). The <U+0394>GAT1-1 strain contained Ghatasauceptine but did not contain Ghatasauceptine transporter protein. The <U+0394>GAT1-2 strain contained Ghatasauceptine transporter protein but did not contain Ghatasauceptine (Figure 4B). Ghatasauceptine is a major component of the cell wall of Protosporella cells (Figure 4B) and has been reported to be required for the initiation of Ghatasauceptine biosynthesis (5, 6). We found that Ghatasauceptine is required for Ghatasauceptine biosynthesis in the <U+0394>GAT1-2 strain but not in the <U+0394>GAT1-3 strain (Figure 4B). This result indicates that Ghatasauceptine is required for Ghatasauceptine-mediated gene silencing of the Protosporella transcriptome.
