## Abstract
The present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the ethyl acetate extract (EA) and the ethyl acetate extract (Et) fractions against a panel of fluconazole-resistant Candida species, the selected clinical isolates, and four Candida species and to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the different fractions against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, A. terreus, and M. uvarum. The MIC50 values of EA and Et fractions were determined using the broth microdilution method. The MIC50 values of EA and Et fractions against Candida albicans, A. terreus, and M. uvarum were determined using the non-parametric method R2 and the most significant two combinations were selected for further analysis. The results showed that the EA and Et fractions exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the selected Candida isolates, with the exception of A. terreus and A. voriconium, where the minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.08 mM and 0.32 mM, respectively. In addition, the EA and Et fractions exhibited an MIC50 concentration (4.4 µg/mL) which was higher than the recommended minimum concentration of 0.06 µg/mL in the current study. The EA and Et fractions showed antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. The MIC50 values of the EA and Et fractions ranged from 1.25 to > 64 µg/mL, while the MIC50 values of the A. terreus and M. uvarum ranged from 2 to 32 µg/mL, and 4 to > 32 µg/mL, respectively. These data indicated that the EA and Et fractions exhibited a relatively selective activity, performing poorly in the tested concentrations. This study suggested that EA and Et fractions might be potential alternatives for the development of new antibiotics.

Response: The data from the figure and references are retrieved and validated. The reference to “Cotton fed maize fed (Acretti et al. 2015)” is outdated and does not represent the actual cotton-to-eiculin conversion process. The conversion of “Cotton fed maize fed (Acretti et al. 2015)” to “Et tu” is not a factor determining the actual cotton-to-eiculin conversion process.

Line 72: Correct reference. In the subsection headed “Giant cell wall composition and biological function of P. brasiliensis grown in a carbon-e-regulated medium (Acretti et al., 2015) fed as yeast-to-eiculin and fed as maize fed (Acretti et al., 2015), fed as cotton with maize fed (Giant cells)”, line 72 and reference need to be re-done.

Response: The subhead “Giant cell wall composition and biological function” has been removed. The reference has been replaced by “Giant cell wall function”.

## Methods
Strains and media
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains were obtained from the culture collection of the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC), and stored at -80 °C.

Plasmid construction and cloning
The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. To construct the pBluescript plasmid, a PmeI-linearized version of the pBluescript II vector was used.


## Results
mellonella larvae with 100 µM of 200 µM GP. We inoculated the G. mellonella larvae with 5 × 10^3 bacteria and monitored their survival over an 8-day period. We found that the number of bacteria recovered from the larvae was significantly higher than that recovered from the control group (Fig 5A). In addition, we monitored the survival of the larvae inoculated with 500 µM GPs compared to the control group (Fig 5B). In both experiments, we found that the number of bacteria recovered from the larvae was significantly higher than that recovered from the control group. In addition, we measured the fungal burden in the larvae infected with the GPs and measured the CFU per gram of larvae recovered from the larvae that were infected with the GPs. The CFU per gram of larvae recovered from the GPs was significantly higher than that recovered from the control group (Fig 5C). Taken together, these results indicate that G protein-coding genes may play a role in Gammaproteobacterial development, stress response, and disease-related pathogenicity in response to infection with G. mellonella.

G. mellonella larvae are more susceptible to G. mellonella-induced brown mold infections
Our next goal was to characterize the impact of G. mellonella infection on G. mellonella survival and to understand the patterns of infection across different host species. We found that larvae infected with G. mellonella infected with 500 µM GPs were significantly more susceptible to brown mold (Fig 6A). We observed a clear trend in the number of CFU recovered from the larvae infected with G. mellonella infection compared to the control group (Fig 6B). However, we observed that larvae infected with 500 µM GPs were significantly more susceptible to brown mold infection (Fig 6C). We then compared these CFU values between the G. mellonella larvae infected with the G. mellonella-induced brown mold and the control group. For this, we measured the CFU of the larvae infected with 500 µM GPs in response to the G. mellonella infection. The CFU values in the larvae infected with G.


## Discussion
roqueforti
A total of 28,637 contigs representing 79,070 contigs were sequenced and assembled into 18,955 contigs representing 6,714 contigs representing 95% of the genom. The number of genes encoding proteins involved in signaling pathways and the regulation of cell morphology, cell wall biosynthesis, and pathogenicity was significantly enriched in the genome compared to the genome of P. roqueforti (Table S2). The molecular pathways involved in cell cycle progression, mating, transcription regulation, oxidative stress, and nutrient acquisition are also enriched in the P. roqueforti genome. The glucose metabolism gene, rca1 was significantly enriched in P. roqueforti compared to P. blakesleeanus, and the cell wall biosynthesis gene, grx2 was significantly enriched in P. roqueforti compared to P. blakesleeanus (Table S3).

The transcription factor, yap1, was significantly enriched in P. roqueforti compared to P. blakesleeanus. The glucose metabolism gene, cmk1, was significantly enriched in P. roqueforti compared to P. blakesleeanus. The cell wall biosynthesis gene, yap1, was significantly enriched in P. roqueforti compared to P. blakesleeanus (Table S3).

A total of 8,162 genes were potentially transcribed during the vegetative growth phase of P. roqueforti. The vast majority of these genes were upregulated during the sexual development of P. roqueforti. The transcriptomic profile of P. roqueforti was found to be significantly more expressed during the vegetative growth phase (Table S4). In contrast, the expression profile of P. roqueforti during the sexual development of P. blakesleeanus was significantly downregulated during the sexual reproduction phase (Table S5).

Gene expression analysis of pheromone biosynthesis was significantly different between the two species. The pheromone biosynthesis genes, pher1, pher2, pher3, pher4, and pher5 were significantly upregulated during the sexual reproduction phase (Table S5).
