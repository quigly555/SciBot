## Abstract
The dematiaceous (melanised) fungus Fusarium graminearum is the main agent of human helminthiform dermatitis. Melanin protects fungal tissues from thermal stress, and pretreatment of the fungi with a- and ß-glucan have protective effects. In this study, the effect of ß-glucan on the synthesis of a-1,3-glucan by the fungal hyphae was investigated. A-1,3-glucan was synthesized by three hyphal forms: a-1,4-glucan, and glucoamylase-1,3-glucan.


## Introduction
Eugenia is a genus of plants native to the Eurasian and North Pacific oceans and used as a traditional medicine (Kirk et al. 2010). The genus Eugenia (syn. E. castellani, E. peruviana, E. peruviana, E. castellani, E. peruviana, E. peruviana, E. peruviana, E. japonica, E. albosa, E. rueba, E. doungkong, E. mackenziei, E. peruviana, E. soudaniflora, E. siessia, and E. virginica) has been cultivated for over two thousand years (Babitha 2000) and is considered to be the “gold standard” in tropical and oleaginous plants for medicinal chemistry (Babitha et al. 2006; Kirk et al. 2010). Eugenia species are widely distributed throughout the world, which makes them an attractive source of plant-derived natural products.

The genus Eugenia is divided in three families, known as Eugenia, Periapulis, and Microascus (Babitha et al. 2000). The family Eugenia includes species that are distributed throughout Asia and North America (Eugenia japonica, Periapulis japonica, and Microascus japonica) (Kirk et al. 2010). Species in the genus are typically small to medium-sized, typically between 6-8 µm in diameter, and are mostly observed in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in China and Indonesia (Kirk et al. 2010).

The genus Eugenia is a member of the family Venturiales, which was recently divided into several subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S rDNA) (Sancho et al. 2011).


## Methods
 mg/ml of purified rat albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), .4 mg/ml of purified rat beta-tubulin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.25 mg/ml of purified rat mitomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/ml of purified rat methionine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.005 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.005 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.015 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.3 mg/ml of purified mannan (Sigma-Aldrich) [18].

Lectin purification
For purification of the 16S rRNA gene, the first step was to isolate the genes from A. fumigatus grown in PDB, and then the second step was to isolate the genes from the hyphal phase. A total of fivefold enrichment of the 16S rRNA gene in fungi growing in PDB was performed using the primers 515F (5'-GCGCCAGCCGCAGCAGG-3') and 515R (5'-CGTGGTCCGTACCCTGAC-3') [19]. A total of 100 µl of each reaction mixture contained 1 µl of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 µM of each primer (5×), 0.2 mM of dNTPs (0.5 mM each), 1.5 mM MgCl_2, and 0.2 µM of each primer.


## Results
As expected, the 16S receptors were detected in the 16S-receptors of all Fungi except the two fungal genera Cryptococcus and Botrytis, which were not included in the analysis (Table 1.

The relative amounts of the 16S receptors in each fungal community were calculated by taking the minimum concentration of each receptor as a measure of the relative amount of the 12S and 16S receptors. For the fungal community, the relative amounts of the 12S receptors were higher than the 12S and 16S receptors.

The relative amounts of the 16S and 12S receptors in the four Fungi were calculated as follows: in the two Fungi, the 16S receptors were more abundant than the 12S and 16S receptors; in the two Fungi, the 16S receptors were less abundant than the 12S and 16S receptors; and in the two Fungi, the 12S and 16S receptors were more abundant than the 12S and 16S receptors.

## Discussion
A large number of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region of the proteins was shown to bind to target proteins through the PbsG_2 domain of the Ras GTPase subunit (Ras G217) [40], [41], [42. Furthermore, Ras G217 is the target of the mammalian Ras G protein. Ras G217 was shown to mediate adenine nucleotide translocation from the ER to the Golgi-associated cytosol [43] and serve as a translational activator in yeast [44]. Furthermore, an unexpected number of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region of Ras G217 were shown to be implicated in Ras G217 and Ras G217A signaling [45]. In addition, a large number of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region of Ras G217 were also found to be implicated in the signaling pathways of Ras G217A, Ras G217D, and Ras G217F, in which hydrophobicity is essential for pathogenicity [46], [47].

A large number of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region of Ras G217 were found to be involved in Ras G217B and Ras G217D signaling [48], [49]. Another interesting finding was that a large number of hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region of Ras G217 were implicated in Ras G217A and Ras G217D signaling [48]. This result is similar to the study reported in the genome-sequencing studies in which the G217A and G217D genes were identified by a combined analysis of multiple genes from different strains of Aspergillus species [50]. In addition, in a genome-wide analysis of serotype A, A. fumigatus and A. nidulans the genes from Aspergillus nidulans were identified as encoding Ras G217A and Ras G217D [51]. These results suggest that the 16S Receptors may be highly expressed in this fungus.

The proteome analysis of the fungi in this study showed that the 16S Receptors have diverse functions.
