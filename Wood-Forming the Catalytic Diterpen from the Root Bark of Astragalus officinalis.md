## Abstract
Although Candida albicans is the second most common cause of candidiasis, their prevalence is rising worldwide, especially in developing countries. The incidence of invasive candidiasis has increased significantly during the last decades and is thought to be rising again in our leading countries. The objective of this study was to determine the antifungal susceptibility patterns of clinical isolates of C.


## Introduction
Tinea nigra is an endemic plant of South and Central America. It is one of the most important crops in Brazil. The disease symptoms are the same as those of other leaf diseases. The disease symptoms are mostly chlorosis and necrosis, but there are some cases of peroxide, gibberemia, borreliosis and other types of life-threatening white-rot symptoms. The symptoms can be as acute as chlorosis and as severe as borreliosis. The symptoms can be localized to the leaf and may last for months or even years. In many cases, symptoms are indolent or even complete. The symptoms are usually asymptomatic. The disease starts as a pale brown to black powdery necrotase, and it progresses to a deep necrotic tissue. In some areas, the disease may progress from superficial lesions to acute necrosis, accompanied by reddish-brownish discoloration and swelling. The necrosis is different from other leaf-dispersal diseases. The early symptoms of necrosis are chlorosis and necrosis. It may be asymptomatic. The symptoms may be asymptomatic. The symptoms may be asymptomatic. In some cases, the symptoms are complete or only partially asymptomatic. In some cases, symptoms may persist for months or years. The disease symptoms can be asymptomatic. The symptoms can be asymptomatic. The symptoms can be asymptomatic. The symptoms may be asymptomatic. The pathogenicity of M. lugens is related to the Brazilian chytridiomycetidae.

In the present work, a novel M. lugens-infecting fungus was isolated. The mechanism of infection, caused by this pathogen, is under investigation. The isolate was obtained by ultracentrifugation and molecular cloning.


## Methods
The identification of the plant was done with the help of M. John L. Lachance at the University of New South Wales Tropical Forestry Research Unit. It was named The Catalytic Diterpen because it was named after the root of Astragalus officinalis. The root bark of Astragalus officinalis was obtained from the root of Ancylostum subsp. pacificus [10]. The root bark of Astragalus officinalis was obtained from the root of Ancylostum subsp. pacificus. The root bark of Astragalus subsp. pacificus was obtained from the root of Ancylostum subsp. pacificus.

## Results
The two main enzymes were the aromatic hydrolysis and the aromatic hydrolysis of aromatic hydrolysis (Fig 3, Table 2. The aromatic hydrolysis was performed on water, acetone, and acetone and the hydrolysis of the aromatic hydrolysis was performed on acetone, acetone, and acetone (Fig 4). The aromatic hydrolysis was performed on water, acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, and acetone (Fig 4). The carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, and acetone (Fig 4). The carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone and acetone and the carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone and acetone (Fig 4). The carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, acetone, and acetone (Fig 4). The carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone and acetone and the carboxylic acid hydrolysis was performed on acetone and acetone (Fig 4).

The most common species of the Ascomycota, which are divided into two phyla, are represented by eight genera, namely A. australiensis, A. asperum, A. eucalypti, A. fumigatus, A. griseovelaceus, A. hystrix, A. lunatus, A. nigra, A. oryzae, A. polonica, A. rotundifolia, A. sahitoi, A. viscosa, A. tauri, and A. thalassiosus (Figure 4). The order Ascomycota comprises only a few species, namely A. niger, A. oryzae, A. niger, and A. turkisis, which are classified as distinct genera. The order Basidiomycota is represented by six genera, namely A. apiculatus, A. apiculare, A. thalassioides, A. sydowii, A. dictyopus, and A. yunnanensis, which are distinguished by their numerous and diverse genera. The order Ustilaginomycetes comprises only two genera, namely A. uroboraxense and A. delavayi, which are distinguished by their diverse genera and species (Figure 3). The order Lipidomycetes comprises only one genus, namely Ustilago globulosa, which is distinguished by its numerous genera and species. The order Hypoxiasporales comprises two genera, namely A. pullulans and A. pullulans, which are distinguished by their diverse genera and species (Figure 4). The order Eurotiomycetes comprises three genera, namely, A. oryzae, A. robertsii, A. polonica, A. oryzae, and A. pulcherrima, which are distinguished by their numerous genera and species (Figure 3). The order Hypoxiaspora comprises only two genera, namely, A. pullulans and A. robertsii, which are distinguished by their numerous genera and species (Figure 3). The order Sporidiobolales comprises only two genera, namely, A. pullulans and A.
