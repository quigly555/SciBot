## Abstract
The parvulin-like protein (PVLß) and the ß-parvulin complex (PVLc) are carbohydrate/carbonyl-CoA synthetase genes from fungi that encode enzymes for carbohydrate recognition, carbohydrate-coupling and beta-oxidation, and asexual sporulation. The fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a leading human pathogen that causes parvulin resistance, the most important virulence trait. The ß-PVL genes are also found in other fungi including the plant-associated Aspergillus fumigatus and in the human pathogen Candida albicans.

In this study we performed a genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis to gain insight into the structure/function of the PVLß genes and their role in fungal pathogenicity. The 17.


## Introduction
subtilis and . amyloliquefaciens, a bacterial species with similar morphology. They are distinguished based on their colony morphology and transcriptome analysis. In the APB model, the exopolysaccharide produced by the bacteria is considered to be the infectious agent, followed by virulence. B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, and B. subtilis-amoeba have been detected in the lungs of patients with APB, although their taxonomy has been largely unknown. This bacterial species was identified by ITS sequences of the isolates from the lungs of four patients (four patients), while B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis-amoeba were detected in the lungs of seven patients. The authors attributed their findings to the phenotypic characteristics of the isolates.

Bacteria from the lungs of patients with APB, but not APB-induced blastomycosis, have been characterized by the presence of large colonies of colonies in the air, which are followed by necrotic lesions. Bacteria from the lungs of patients with APB, but not APB-induced blastomycosis, have been described as having similar colonies to the patients' exopolysaccharides. In the same study, the presence of these bacteria in the lungs of patients with APB, but not APB-induced blastomycosis, had been reported. The authors speculated that the presence of these bacteria in the lungs of patients with APB may be related to the immune response of the patients, since the patients developed long-term suppressive pulmonary therapy (PD) and intense pyrexia after the treatment. However, the presence of the clinical evidence of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis-amoeba in the lungs of patients with APB-induced blastomycosis has not been reported.

The biological characteristics of Bacteria from the lungs of patients with APB, but not APB-induced blastomycosis, have not been investigated. Here, the clinical evidence of the presence of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis-amoeba in the lungs of patients with APB, but not APB-induced blastomycosis, was provided.


## Methods
Briefly, 20% PDA was added to each well of the colony and the plates were incubated for 3 days at 25 °. For microorganisms, PDA plates were inoculated with 100 µl of 1 × 10^8 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Samples were plated on PDA for colony counting, and colony forming units were counted at the same time. The results were reported as the percentage growth inhibition relative to non-infected control (total inhibition of growth) and as the decrease in growth relative to infected control (total inhibition of growth).

The best-performing PDA control (PDA-PDA) (5 µg/ml) was prepared from 10% PDA. Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 48 h. The PDA-PDA plates were then inoculated with 10 µl of the fungal suspension (0.5 × 10^3 CFU/ml) and incubated for 2 days at 25 °C. At the end of incubation, the mycelia were harvested, washed with PBS, and homogenized in a mortar with pestle. The homogenate was serially diluted (1:100) and spread onto PDA. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 25 °C and colony counts were determined.

Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
MICs were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 document (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008). The M27-A3 guideline established the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fungi [38]. Briefly, two fungicides (FLU, 0.5, 0.125, and 1 mg/ml) were used in the cultivation of PDA-PDA. They were prepared in sterile saline to prevent bacterial growth, and when necessary, it was diluted in sterile saline to achieve the desired concentration. The fungicides were sub-inoculated in sterile saline to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5 and 0.125 mg/ml for PDA, respectively, and then the mycelia were homogenized and subjected to the same procedure. The growth of each strain was recorded after 24 h incubation at 25 °C.


## Results
Of these, a new species, Cryptococcus merolae (CBS 40.95), was recently identified by our group (Wu et al. 2015). Interestingly, the genome sequence of the new species is much more complete than that of the CBS 401.95 (Pseudocercospora bifurcationans) strain (S4 Fig). It also includes multiple genes encoding endo-ß-1,3-glucanases, and a putative endo-ß-1,3-glucanase gene.

A few other taxa are common to both the new and existing panomycosis clusters. Some species of A. fumigatus are isolated from both the two new clusters (e.g. P. carinii and S. japonicus), and the genus M. japonicus has been isolated from both the two new clusters. P. carinii and S. japonicus have been isolated from both the two new clusters, but M. japonicus is a member of the Mucorales. The two new panomycosis clusters of P. carinii and S. japonicus are distinct from the panomycosis clusters of other fungi, and the panomycosis clusters of P. carinii and S. japonicus are distinct from the panomycosis clusters of other fungi (Fig 3).

Mucorales in the Panomycosis Cluster
Our in silico analysis of the Mucorales in the Panomycosis cluster identified several new species. These included two isolates, P. lutzii (CBS 124862) and P. lycopersici (CBS 102211), both of which are described as M. lycopersici, and two members of M. lutzii, M. polycephalum (CBS 130943 and CBS 130944), both of which are described as M. polycephalum, respectively.

The two new species are clearly distinct from the panomycosis clusters of the other fungi (Fig 3). The P. lutzii isolate was isolated from the same country, and the P. lycopersici isolate was isolated from the same country. Both were isolated from the same country, and both were isolated from the same country. P.


## Discussion
ostreatus showed that the gene was transcribed from a mitotic strain with a minimum of 5 kb and a maximum of 32 b. The gene was thus generated and sequenced. The gene sequence of the monokaryotic blastomycosis gene cluster from P. ostreatus was also used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster of P. ostreatus. This gene is involved in the process of cell cycle arrest [25] and is mainly conserved among blastomycosis strains [26]. However, the gene cluster in P. ostreatus had a low identity with the gene cluster of P. tuberculosis in P. syringae [27], suggesting that the gene was either mis-localized, or duplicated. This result is in agreement with the previous finding that P. syringae genome contains the gene cluster of P. syringae [28].

The gene cluster of P. ostreatus had a high sequence similarity to a gene from C. neoformans (encoded by the orthologous gene in P. syringae). The C. neoformans gene was originally isolated from an isolate of an unnamed pathogenic fungus and showed similarity to a gene from C. gattii (encoded by the orthologous gene in C. neoformans) [29]. The other C. gattii gene cluster was also found in P. ostreatus, and it was named after the fungus. The P. ostreatus gene is involved in the process of cell cycle arrest and cell wall stress [30].

The monokaryotic blastomycosis gene cluster from P. ostreatus was also used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster. The gene was generated and sequenced. The gene was used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the cancer cell cycle gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the tumor cell gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the tumor cell gene cluster. The gene was then used to construct the gene cluster of the tumor cell gene cluster.
