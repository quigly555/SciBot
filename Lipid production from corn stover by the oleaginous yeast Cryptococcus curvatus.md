## Abstract
Candida species are the most common cause of candidemia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. Candida albicans is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen that presents most of the clinical challenges in these patients. The recent availability of a broad range of tools for studying pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal infections presents a challenge. The ability of C. albicans to adapt to environmental stressors, the availability of an adapted strain for strain characterization and identification of the genes required for such adaptation are crucial for successful infection of the host. Here we review current and future stressors, host responses, and stress-tolerance mechanisms of Candida species including C. albicans.


## Introduction
van Dijk et a. 2010) and Cryptococcus curvatus-filamentous yeast (P. van Dijk et al. 2012). However, the most common oleaginous yeast species isolated from corn stover (S. cerevisiae) are also the most frequently isolated yeast from corn stover and they are isolated from a wide variety of substrates including the seeds, the air, the soil, the tap water, and the liquid feed. The lipid content of the corn stover is significantly higher than that of other substrates, and the presence of such yeast in the stover does not necessarily indicate a high sugar content.

The presence of yeast in the corn stover does not necessarily indicate that the starch is oleaginous. Moreover, the number of yeast species isolated from corn stover is not always a good indicator of the sugar content, because this may reflect the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, and/or the absence of nutritional yeast or the presence of other microbial species such as Hanseniaspora, Saccharomyces, and Kluyveromyces (Pelletier et al. 2000, van Dijk et al. 2002).

The presence of yeast in the corn stover is not always a good indicator of the presence of oleaginous yeasts. However, the yeast genera (Candida, Rhodotorula, Kluyveromyces, and Rhodosporidium) that have been identified in the corn stover were identified by PCR analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) gene of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) gene, and the internal ribosomal DNA (ITS3) gene of the rRNA gene. The yeast genera (Pichya, Metschnikowia, Rhodosporidium, and Trichosporon) were also identified by PCR analysis of the rRNA gene of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA gene and the LSU rRNA gene.

The present study is a genome wide analysis of the yeast diversity in corn stover and its implications for the economic, ecological, and geographical importance. It includes all known yeast species from different countries, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Canada, and identified more than 70 species.


## Methods
.


## Results
The results are presented in Tables 2 and . The rate of Lipid production was significantly higher in the corn stover treated with DMSO than in the control corn stover treated with LPS. No significant difference was found between the concentrations of DMSO and LPS. The lipid production was not significantly different between DMSO and LPS.

3.5. Lipid Production by Cryptococcus curvatus in the Presence of LPS
The lipid production by Cryptococcus curvatus by the oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus curvatus was also measured. The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The lipid production by Cryptococcus curvatus was significantly higher in the presence of LPS than in the absence of DMSO. No significant difference was found between DMSO and LPS.

3.6. Lipid Production by Cryptococcus curvatus by the Bifidoglycan Enzymatic Activity
The ability of the Cryptococcus curvatus to produce lipids was further evaluated using a fluorescence assay. Lipid production was significantly higher in the presence of LPS than in the absence of DMSO. No significant difference was found between DMSO and LPS. The analysis of the effect of the Bifidoglycan enzymatic activity on the lipids produced by the yeast Cryptococcus curvatus revealed that the concentration of the enzyme did not affect the lipids production by the yeast.

3.7. Antifungal Activity of Cryptococcus curvatus against the Yeast Cryptococcus
The antifungal activity of Cryptococcus curvatus against the yeast Cryptococcus is shown in Table 4. The inhibition zone was slightly higher in the presence of LPS than in the presence of DMSO. The concentration of LPS did not affect the MIC values. The results of the MIC were consistent with those of the MIC.

3.8. Cytotoxicity of Cryptococcus curvatus against the Yeast Cryptococcus
The cytotoxicity of Cryptococcus curvatus against the yeast Cryptococcus was evaluated by the IC_50 values of the Cryptococcus curvatus against the yeast and the control cells. The IC_50 values of the Cryptococcus curvatus were significantly higher in the presence of LPS than in the absence of DMSO. No significant difference was found between the concentrations of DMSO and LPS.


## Discussion
krusei, . gloeosporioides, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. In the case of corn stover, C. curvatus was the dominant yeast in the corn stover of the field in this study. The highest yield was achieved by C. krusei in the field at a yield of 1.4 g/L. As the second highest yield of 1.4 g/L, C. krusei was reported in other fields, such as in the field at a yield of 0.16 g/L, and at a yield of 0.5 g/L, in which the high yields were achieved by C. curvatus [28,29].

The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was obtained by C. krusei in the field at a yield of 1.8 g/L, which is close to the highest yield achieved by the other oleaginous yeasts, including C. curvatus and C. albicans. The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was obtained by C. albicans and C. krusei in the field at a yield of 0.34 g/L, which is higher than the highest yield achieved by C. curvatus and C. albicans. The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was obtained by C. krusei in the field at a yield of 0.44 g/L, which is higher than the highest yield achieved by C. albicans and C. krusei. The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was achieved by C. albicans and C. krusei in the field at a yield of 0.30 g/L, which is higher than the highest yield achieved by C. curvatus and C. albicans. The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was obtained by C. krusei in the field at a yield of 0.29 g/L, which is higher than the highest yield obtained by C. albicans and C. krusei. The highest yield of 0.65 g/L was achieved by C. krusei in the field at a yield of 0.32 g/L, which is higher than the highest yield achieved by C. curvatus and C. albicans. The highest yield of 0.
