## Abstract
Our understanding of the origin of microbial communities in organic matter (OM) buried under solar- and bioremediation buildings has been incomplete because most buildings had only one microbial community per floor, and most only one community per sub-unit; the predominant community was E. coli. To understand the microbial communities in the building, we analyzed dust from adjacent units and observed the composition of the community by high-throughput metabarcoding.


## Introduction
It is a complex structure consisting of a lipid bilayer of a central hydrophobic lipid, the hydrophilic lipid having a high mobility and charge, the hydrophobic lipid being enclosed in a bifurcation-complexed structure. It is composed of two proline rich groups, one of which is a proline at its core and the other a hydrophilic group, the hydrophobic group having a low molecular weight and having a hydrophobic charge (Davoli et al. 1999; Savouskina et al. 2003; El-Omera et al. 2005). This bilayer contains an active molecule called gallium BBCM, which is structurally similar to a-1,3-glucans, and a-1,4-glucans (Davoli et al. 1999). In order to understand the mechanism of BBCM formation, the bilayer is covered by a thin layer of P, N, N-diphenyl group, and a layer of C-alkyl groups, forming the active molecule (Figure 1). The C-alkyl group is produced from the breakdown of P and is highly stable at a-1,3-carbonyl group level. The P and N diphenyl group is produced from N-alkyl groups and are separated by a chain of a-1,4- and a-1,2-lipoxychains (Davoli et al. 1999). This complex structure is composed of two layers: one is a branched structure with two lipid chains, formed by a-1,3- and a-1,6-glycosidic linkages, and the other a branched structure with one or two chains. The active molecule can be obtained by a variety of routes and is produced by many different ways (Figure 1).

## Methods
The fungus was then inoculated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and washed twice with RPMI 1640. Five ml of each culture were then inoculated with 100 µL of 1 × 10^4 cells/mL and incubated at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected and stored at -20 °C for subsequent use.

Cell viability assay
Total cell viability was determined by the method of Domsch and Schiestl (1977). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Greiner Bio-One) at a density of 5 × 10^5 cells/well and were seeded at 10 µM in a 96-well plate. A total of 10 µL of DMSO (2%) was added to each well of the tissue culture plate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the plate was washed with PBS and cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cell viability was determined using a Cytofix/Cytoperm assay (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with a MTT-red cell stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a propidium iodide (PI) staining (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Flow cytometry
A549 GS-FLC-50-GFP-CdcM cells were infected with 1 × 10^5 (100 µL) of cells and were treated for 24 h at 37 °C with the corresponding protein inhibitors. A 1.5 µg/mL suspension of each inhibitor was then added to a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. A single spore of each strain was then added to a 96-well plate and incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C, to allow the formation of a dead cell population. The wells were washed with PBS and a cell suspension was then prepared.


## Results
The AMPs-proteolysis profiles showed that the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide was relatively active against AMP peptide (.58-fold increase compared to the other AMPs), and the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide was highly active against AMP peptide (2.28-fold increase compared to the other AMPs). The AMP peptide was also highly active against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.28-fold increase compared to the other AMPs). The AMP peptide-protease-related peptide was also highly active against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.29-fold increase compared to the other AMPs).

The AMP peptide is the most active peptide against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.32-fold increase compared to the other AMPs), which is important for the stimulation of AMP peptide-protease activity in some types of microorganisms [15, 19, 20, 23]. The AMP peptide-protease-related peptide was also highly active against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.29-fold increase compared to the other AMPs).

We also analyzed the AMP peptide-protease activity against a selection of AMP peptides. AMP peptides (2.49-fold increase compared to the other AMPs), (2.32-fold increase compared to the other AMPs), and AMP peptides (2.25-fold increase compared to the other AMPs) were active against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.32-fold increase compared to the other AMPs).

In addition, the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide was highly active against the AMP peptide-protease-related peptide (2.29-fold increase compared to the other AMPs).


## Discussion
The extracellular space of grape fruit is the main body of a mature grape cell, and it is the main material for the outer cell of the cell wal. When the grape fruit is growing in the extracellular space, it provides a structure that contains the nutrients and bioactive substances. These are used in the growth process for the biofilm formation. In this study, we showed that the extracellular space of grape fruit was the main material for the biofilm formation. The extracellular space of grape fruit also contains proteins such as transporters, ion channels, nucleases and other enzymes, which facilitate the growth of the biofilm.

The overall stage of the biofilm formation involves the formation of the biofilm with a structure that is recognized by the host's immune system. In this study, we found that grape fruit extracellular space of extracellular matrix is the main material that allows the formation of the biofilm. The extracellular matrix of grape fruit consists of two major components, a hydrophobic and a non-hydrophilic matrix composed of cellulose and hemicelluloses. In the extracellular matrix, the hydrophobic component acts as a permease, and the non-hydrophilic component acts as a permease. However, in the extracellular matrix, the hydrophobic component is responsible for the formation of the biofilm. In this study, we found that the extracellular matrix of grape fruit is a major material for the biofilm formation.
