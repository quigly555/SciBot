# The Taxonomic Presentation of the Fungi in: taxonomic conserved terms and hydrological conditions
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
An international survey of house dust collected from Central and Eastern Europe was carried out to determine the presence of micro-dilution microbials of the antifungal compound eugenol in the collected dust of house dust of veterinary medicine practitioners. Forty-seven dust samples were collected during two weeks in November 2014, in four veterinary clinics in the former City of Cuiabá, in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. The dust samples were analyzed using the EUCAST-MIME-Tape type system and classified according to the MICU-MS/MS method. The antifungal profile of eugenol was determined by the microdilution method and validated by the dilution technique. The MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.

ITS and ITS sequences of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
The ITS sequences are generally conserved among taxa, but the nrRNA sequences are scarce. ITS sequences are present in all taxa, although the nrRNA sequences are present in some genera. In the following text, we will use the term “heterothallism” in this sense.

We discuss the taxonomic history of the ITS sequences in three main settings: (1) the ITS sequences of the ribosomal RNA gene (13S and LSU; n = 23), which has been sequenced in a previous study; and (2) the ITS sequences of the rDNA (ITS, ITS, LSU and rDNA) genes, which are widely distributed.

We have compared the phylogenetic history of the ITS sequences in the order Capnodiales (southern Europe), especially in the order Mucorales (Sutton 1980, 1982, 2000, Goodwin et al. 2001). These sequences are available from GenBank and can be easily obtained by e-colocation (see “Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the Mucoromycotina” section in the Results section) (Figure 1).

We also consider the phylogenetic history of the ITS sequences in the order Mucorales (Sutton 1980, 1982, 2000). Mucoromycotina species are generally monophyletic (see “Mucoromycotina evolution” in the second subsection) and phylogenetic studies of the ITS sequences are usually restricted to Mucorales (see “Genetic studies of Mucoromycotina” section in the Results section). This restriction applies to the rDNA and LSU sequences as well. However, the rDNA sequences of Mucorales are available from a few European species databases (see “Mucoromycotina evolution” in the third subsection). The rDNA sequences of Mucorales are widely distributed in different families and taxa (see “Comparative phylogeny, phylogenetics and morphology of Mucoromycotina” section in the Results section).


## Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. NIH-NRA-01-06) and in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Commitee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (FWD-Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil).

Animals
Male BALB/c mice (10 weeks old; approximate weight of 50-55 g; purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment, in the animal facility of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFR), under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were infected with 20 µl of a 1 × 10^8-CFU/ml suspension of C. albicans ATCC 9002, which was cultured overnight at 37°C. On the following day, mice were injected with 1 × 10^5 CFU of C. albicans, which was cultured overnight at 37°C. On the following day, the mice were humanely euthanized by CO_2 inhalation.

Animal experiments
Four to six week old male BALB/c mice (5-6 weeks old) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, in the animal facility of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, and were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment. Mice were infected with C. albicans at a MOI of 1.

Animal experiments
An additional colony of C. albicans was isolated from a fresh culture of C. albicans in a sterile 0.85% saline solution in the presence of a sterile solution of isopropanol. This colony was subcultured into RPMI 1640 medium with L-glutamine, without sodium bicarbonate and without sodium bicarbonate, and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h. After culturing, the cells were collected and washed three times with PBS.


## Results
. C. albicans Isolated from the Internalized Clot by Bacterial Exhaustive Aeration
To investigate the bacterial extracellular proteome of the hog1<U+0394> mutant, the cell extracts from the hog1<U+0394> mutant were subjected to a multiple-step bioassay, which contained biotrophic induction with biotrophic growth (Fig 1). After biotrophic induction, the initial extracellular proteome was degraded to a ratio of one to two copies per cell (Fig 2A). The lower and upper concentration of the biotrophic proteome (1.4 × 10^4 to 1.5 × 10^6) were used to evaluate the extracellular proteome. The results indicate that, compared to the wild-type and hog1<U+0394> cells, the extracellular proteome of the hog1<U+0394> mutant in the absence of biotrophic growth is markedly decreased (Fig 2B). In addition, the extracellular proteome of the hog1<U+0394> mutant in the presence of biotrophic growth was markedly reduced (Fig 2C). The results indicate that the extracellular proteome of the hog1<U+0394> mutant is significantly affected by biotrophic growth, as indicated by the increased intracellular proteome, whereas the extracellular proteome in the absence of biotrophic growth is not significantly affected (Fig 2D). These results suggest that the extracellular proteome in the hog1<U+0394> mutant is significantly affected by the biotrophic growth.

## Discussion
The genome database contains a total of more than 1,100,000,000 taxa and one thousand new species, and the sequenced taxa have been classified into 33 phyla, and have been classified into 57 families of taxa, including genera with an estimated number of 4,250,00.

In this study, we have examined the relationships among fungi and their occurrence in various ecosystems across the world. We have not identified a single group of fungi that is unique to this group, as there is no clear group that is unique to the fungi. This has not been the case for the fungi in this study.

In this study, we found that there is a clear relationship between fungi and their occurrence in different ecosystems. The number of fungal taxa is nearly twice as large as the number of bacteria, and in all ecosystems, the number of fungi is twice as large as the number of bacteria. This is consistent with previous studies in which the number of fungi was reduced by only a few orders of orders, and even a few orders of genera, [18].

The presence of a particular fungus in a particular ecosystem is only one of many factors that could be involved in the occurrence of fungi in these ecosystems. The number of fungi in a ecosystem is often underestimated, because the number of fungi in a community is often unknown, and because of the unknown ecological conditions in these ecosystems.

We found that the number of fungi in each ecosystem is significantly higher than that in the study in Figure 2. This is consistent with previous studies, where the number of fungi in the community was only marginally higher than that in the community with the lowest environmental parameters [18]. This is a reasonable explanation for the low number of fungi in the community with the lowest environmental parameters, and in the community with the highest environmental parameters. This supports the hypothesis that the fungal communities in the ecosystem are more complex than the soil fungi, and that the fungal communities in the community with the lowest environmental parameters are more complex than the soil fungi.

The numbers of fungi in each ecosystem are similar. The number of fungi in each ecosystem is also similar, and the number of fungi in each ecosystem is much higher than the average number of fungi in the community with the lowest environmental parameters.
