## Abstract
The biology and epidemiology of meningitis and its treatment are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing among persons with and without meningitis.

We retrospectively enrolled participants from Myanamia, Thailand where meningitis was the commonest form of meningitis. Participants were followed up for 10 years. We compared data from India, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Indonesia, Indonesia, Italy, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, S. aureus, Toxoplasma gondii, Vesicola toxinosi, and Zymoseptoria tritici. We assessed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fungal burden, risk factors, and treatment response.

We included 124 participants and median age was 37 years. Median baseline CD4 count was 29 cells/µL. Forty percent of participants had CSF cryptococcal antigen test positive. Mean CSF Toxoplasma gondii load was 1,437 copies/mL. Thirty-two (6%) of participants had positive CSF fungal culture. Only one (1%) had CSF Toxoplasma gondii positive. Severely immunodeficiency was identified in one case and treatment response was characterized by failure to respond with fluconazole and failure to respond with voriconazole.

We reported a high rate of CNS fungal infection with the zoonotic manifestation of meningitis. The occurrence of meningitis in the absence of CSF testing was 50% in our study, and in some cases as high as 100%, indicating that CSF testing is not a reliable method to predict outcome. In conclusion, we found that CSF Toxoplasma gondii can be a valuable tool to identify patients at risk for CNS infections and to reduce relapse of meningitis.


## Introduction
It involves formation of a rigid C-terminal endoproteome that binds the carbohydrate matrix and triggers cell deat. This recognition triggers a cascade of events that allow the dissemination of Candida cells into the bloodstream, including Candida-associated pathology, the formation of organ-specific granules that produce abundant intracellular traps (Candida-induced killing of host cells is an emerging concept).

As a mechanism of host defense, the innate immune system plays a crucial role in the response to Candida invasion. The innate immune response is activated in the early stages of infection by signals from C. albicans. In the phagocytic cells, C. albicans can disseminate and invade the host through the lymphatic vessels that are specialized in cell-mediated immunity. However, C. albicans can survive within these phagocytic cells and induce local immune responses, including the production of anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1ß and TNF-a) and, in some cases, the production of antifungal antibodies (e.g., C-F and F-18). In addition to the key role of the innate immune response in the induction of host cell-mediated immunity, C. albicans also elicits immunoregulatory responses. The importance of the innate immune response is underscored by the fact that C. albicans can survive intracellularly by the secretory pathway and can survive intracellularly by the haematogenous pathway. The body makes up an enormous proportion of the host's microbiota, and the innate immune response is highly regulated in the body and is likely to be one of the major actors in the host-pathogen interaction [5,6].

The phagocytic cells are a major source of infectious microorganisms. C. albicans can survive within the phagocytes, and it can escape from the phagocytes, being able to infect and kill macrophages, neutrophils, and other cells of the phagolysosome [7,8]. The phagocytic cells can also cause tissue damage, such as cancer [9].

## Methods
cerevisia. In brief, S. cerevisiae is an avirulent yeast strain obtained from the wild-type strain of A. fumigatus (MATa) [16]. In order to identify the N-acetylglucosaminidase enzyme that caused inhibition of N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, the yeast cells were cultured at 37°C and 150 rpm for 48 h. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of fresh culture medium. The cells were cultured at 37°C and 150 rpm for 24 h. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M NaCl, and the supernatant was removed and the pellets were washed with 0.1 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. The pellets were washed with 0.1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and re-suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate. Then, the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate-buffered saline (KPH) and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were washed with 1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (KPH). Then, the pellets were re-suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate. The pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate. The pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (KPH). Then, the pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium citrate.


## Results
fumigatus stress on Candida albicans proliferation and survival, we examined the effect of BSA on viability of . fumigatus-deficient and wild type strains. BSA reduced viability of all strains tested, except for the strains expressing a single TcB promoter in addition to the BSA inducer (Figure 1A). In contrast, only strains expressing a single TcB promoter showed significant reduction in the viability of the strains (Figure 1A). These results suggested that A. fumigatus stress induces a significant cytotoxic effect on A. fumigatus.

A. fumigatus Stress Reduces Candida Growth and Host Survival
To assess the role of A. fumigatus stress in A. fumigatus-mediated host survival, we examined the impact of A. fumigatus stress on the fungal viability of A. fumigatus-deficient and wild type strains. As shown in Figure 2A, the Candida albicans and A. fumigatus-deficient strains grew well in the presence of A. fumigatus stress, while A. fumigatus-expressing strain did not exhibit any significant growth defects. Consistent with the findings observed in the above data, BSA was able to reduce the growth of A. fumigatus-deficient and wild type strains in the presence of A. fumigatus stress (Figure 2B). These results indicated that A. fumigatus stress-induced cytotoxic effects on A. fumigatus are mediated by a cell-wall stressor.

A. fumigatus Stress Induces Intracellular Trap and Candida Albicans-Candida Interaction
We have previously shown that A. fumigatus stress causes a cellular immune response that is triggered by intracellular pathogen-derived molecular patterns (i.e., the influx of reactive oxygen species) and cell wall stressors (e.g., heat stress, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress). To examine whether A. fumigatus stress triggers a cell-wall stressor in A. fumigatus-deficient or wild type strains, we monitored the interaction of A. fumigatus with the host cell wall or the extracellular matrix of the host using a fluorescent probe.

## Discussion
We found that the killing of infected macrophages was significantly more intense than that of infected yeast cell. However, macrophages were more responsive to Mucor circinelloides in infected mice than yeasts cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Mucor circinelloides induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IFN-<U+03B3> by macrophages, that are upregulated in the Mucor circinelloides-treated M2b cells. Furthermore, we found that the TNF-a response was less intense than that of the Mucor circinelloides-treated B cell line, B11-2. B cell lines were also less responsive to Mucor circinelloides than B7-2, but the percentage of TNF-a response was more intense than that of B11-1. However, macrophages were still more resistant to Mucor circinelloides in infected mice than yeast cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Mucor circinelloides induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IFN-<U+03B3>, that are upregulated in the Mucor circinelloides-treated B cell line.

To further explore the effects of Mucor circinelloides on the inflammatory response, we used IFN-<U+03B3> to investigate the response of macrophages to Mucor circinelloides in infected macrophages. IFN-<U+03B3> is a key cytokine in the development of the immune response against fungi [32]. Mucor circinelloides induce the production of IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-10, and TNF-a in macrophages [32]. Our data show that Mucor circinelloides induce the production of IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-10, and TNF-a in infected macrophages.
