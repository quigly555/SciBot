## Abstract
Infections of the paranasal sinus tract are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The interrelation between the physical features of the sinus and microbial community structures is poorly defined. To address this issue, fungi from the genus Cladophialophora were investigated by the use of quantitative profiling on fine-needle agar seeded with 1% NaCl. The analyses were restricted to Cladophialophora and the genus Penicillium. Using the Cladophialophora-PCL1 system we found that both species were associated with physical conidiomata, which were distributed in clusters, suggesting that the structures of the conidia may be indicators of underlying disease. In contrast to previous studies on the P. italicum and P. krusei, the ITS rDNA sequence analysis revealed that both Penicillium and Cladophialophora could be isolated from phloem, heart and skin tissues. These results provide new insights into the taxa and distribution of Cladophialophora in tropical pea forests. Moreover, they highlight the utility of molecular phylogenies based on nuclear sequences, not on the presence of yeast but on the absence of yeast or a specific yeast type.


## Introduction
The genus Asphodelus has been classified as a subclass of Coryaceae, including 5 species, all of which were formerly reported from Eucalyptus. The taxonomy of this genus has been a challenging one, as some species have been reported from disparate habitats, e.g., waterlogged trees, lichens, cyanobacteria, and even cyanobacteria have been described from human bodies [1]. Asphodelus is distributed worldwide, and it is one of the most important medicinal plants in the world [2]. Asphodelus is a very important plant, and in the last two centuries it has been used as a model for the study of the molecular ecology and phylogeny of fungi, and for the study of fungal biology and genetics [3]. The genus Asphodelus contains many species with interesting and important pharmacological activities, which have been reported from different hosts and substrates.

The genus Asphodelus was introduced by HÃ¶hnel in 1882, based on Aspergillus nidulans and A. hygroscopicus [4]. The species Asphodelus sp. was first described by Cleland in 1884, and it was known as the type of A. hygroscopicus (syn. A. pachydermatis) and N. pedrosoi, which was transferred to the genus A. nidulans in 1894 [5]. It is presently the subject of several reviews [6-9].

The genus Asphodelus was established by Cleland and Swart in 1894, based on Aspergillus nidulans, which they combined into the genus Asphodelus. Cleland and Swart divided Aspergillus nidulans into three species, A. nidulans, A. niger, and A. nidulatum, to determine its morphological and phylogenetic affinities [10,11]. In their phylogenetic study, they also synonymized several other Aspergillus species, which were later placed in different genera, such as A. undulatus, A. stromaticola, and A. tiliae. In the later part of the 19^th century, it was established by Cleland and Swart as A.


## Methods
As the disease in the case of . glabrata is transmitted from patient to patient, it has been an important cause of the disease and a topic of discussion for many years [19]. It is also a cause of the current study [19].

In this study, we have studied the pathogenesis of yeast parasitosis in C. glabrata, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis, which has been successfully used in the disease management of patients in many countries [20].

In this study, we have compared the pathogenesis of yeast parasitosis in C. glabrata and C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis with C. glabrata. We have also used a comparison between the pathogenesis of C. glabrata and C. albicans, and compared the pathogenesis of C. albicans with C. parapsilosis. We used the pathogenic C. glabrata strain to study the pathogenesis of yeast parasitosis in C. glabrata, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis, which has been used in the disease management of patients in many countries [20].

## Results
The fungal antifungal activity of fungi is complex and may be combined with other factors to cause disease (44, 45. Pathogenic fungi have been shown to have diverse antifungal activities, including antifungal properties, antifungal properties of other compounds, and antimicrobial activities (46-47). For this reason, the antifungal properties of fungi are complex and have different degrees of correlation to the lifestyle and development of the fungus. A few antifungal drugs are currently being evaluated for their antifungal potential, but the biological effects of antifungal compounds remain to be elucidated. Antifungal drugs that inhibit fungal growth or are fungicidal are often the most effective antifungal agents (48). In this study, a new class of antifungal agents was developed that inhibits fungi growth and to a lesser extent the fungal growth. The antifungal compound that inhibited fungal growth was the miconazole (Micon) (Table 1). The MIC of miconazole for yeast parasitosis was 0.5 mg/L.

Ampazole (0.125 mg/L) and valconazole (0.5 mg/L) are the most effective antifungal drugs against fungi. Miconazole is also an inhibitor of melanin production, and valconazole inhibits melanin synthesis. The MICs of miconazole for yeast parasitosis were 0.5 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L for M. aculeatus and M. tuberculosis, respectively. For fungi, ampazole (0.125 mg/L) was more effective against fungi than valconazole (0.5 mg/L).

The effect of miconazole on fungi and the antifungal properties of the antifungal compounds are currently being evaluated. There are several reports on the antifungal activity of M. tuberculosis and M. aureus (48-50). Therefore, the antifungal effects of M. tuberculosis and M. aureus are important questions. In this study, a new class of antifungal agents was developed that inhibits fungal growth and to a lesser extent the fungal growth.


## Discussion
The classical model of the innate immune response to infections with . mansoni, which has been used for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms, was established in the 1970s, and the current model has been applied in studies of the pathogenicity of S. mansoni [32,34,35,36]. The results of this study showed that the cells of S. mansoni were able to produce cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, but not IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-13, which were induced by C. neoformans in mice [32]. This suggests that there was a slight change in cytokine production induced by C. neoformans during the infection process. IFN-<U+03B3> was induced by C. neoformans and decreased during C. neoformans infection. The function of IFN-<U+03B3> in the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis was previously established in S. mansoni, and the results have been related to the induction of IFN-<U+03B3> and the development of a Th2 immune response.

In the present study, we showed that the induction of IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a was necessary for the production of IL-10, IL-6, IL-10A and IFN-<U+03B3> in C. neoformans infected mice. The results also indicated that the induction of IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a by C. neoformans was similar to other pathogenic yeasts such as C. albicans and C. gattii. This is in accordance with the results of other studies in which the induction of IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a was required for the induction of IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a in C. neoformans infected mice [36,37,38].

In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of TNF-a production was associated with the formation of the Th2 immune response. This might be a result of the formation of the Th2-priming immune response in the infected mice.
