## Abstract
Melanised microorganisms are of increasing concern in terms of human health and agricultural production. Therefore, molecular diagnostics should be able to confirm the existence of the microorganism, identify its lifestyle and environmental risk factors, and guide its treatment. Molecular diagnostics represent a very powerful tool to identify the molecular determinants underlying infections, diseases, and diseases. The purpose of this review is to focus on molecular diagnostic approaches to avoid consuming large chemical and genetic resources that are not readily accessible for large scale application. In this context, the aim of this review is to synthesize molecular diagnostic approaches to avoid consuming large chemical and genetic resources that are not readily accessible for large scale application. Specific examples of application of molecular diagnostics to combat plant disease or to discover novel treatments for plant diseases are also highlighted.


## Introduction
The term ‘virulence’ is derived from the ability of a microbe to cause disease. Virulence can be defined as the ability of a microbe to cause disease (i.e., to cause disease in) or the ability of an organism to cause disease in any form (i.e., biofilm, invasion, or disease). Virulence is defined as the capacity of a microbe to produce an infectious agent in a microenvironment, which can be either free living or parasitic. Free-living microorganisms have been used as a model organism to study the processes involved in the production of virulence factors and to investigate the mechanisms by which these factors impact disease (e.g., biofilm formation, invasion, or disease).

Free-living microorganisms are among the most common cause of diseases in plants. However, they can also cause diseases in animals and humans as well as other animals and plants (reviewed in reference 1). Free-living microorganisms are generally regarded as virulent, while parasitic microorganisms are generally considered as pathogenic (reviewed in reference 2). Free-living microorganisms have been used as model organisms for studies of infection processes, host infection, and virulence. However, they are not considered as virulent for infection in many studies, and their ability to cause disease in animals and humans is largely restricted to the latter. In addition, these microorganisms are difficult to study in vitro and it is unclear how these microorganisms can cause disease in mammals. For example, the ability of some free-living organisms, such as the dermatophytes or Spirochaetes, to cause disease is limited to mammals and their lack of host recognition limits its usefulness in studies of infection and disease (reviewed in reference 3).

Because of their large body size and small body plan, microorganisms can easily be isolated from the host tissues of healthy hosts and, therefore, from pathogenic microorganisms. These microorganisms can be isolated from the host and spread from the body cavity, often to other organs, although this approach is not applicable for parasitic microorganisms (reviewed in reference 4).


## Methods
We used published data for the treatment of cryptococcal infections from patients in the IC. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CEPH), and data was collected between January 2013 and January 2016.

Mice
To determine the effect of infection on the fungal burden, mice were inoculated intranasally with 0.1% (w/v) diluent and were sacrificed at specified time points. The mice were then sacrificed by CO_2 inhalation and the brains were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml sterile PBS. The homogenate was serially diluted and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18-24 h. The numbers of CFU/g of brain were counted after incubation. The animal infection was repeated three times.

Pathogen
C. albicans strains were grown overnight in YPD broth at 30°C. Then, they were inoculated into EMM, YPD or YNB medium at 30°C. The mixture was shaken at 200 rpm and 200 rpm for 3 days. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and then washed three times with PBS. The cells were then adjusted to the appropriate density by optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The OD600 of the final cell density was measured with a microplate reader. The data were analyzed using the FLUOstar software.

Growth of C. albicans in the Presence of S. pneumoniae
To determine the effect of S. pneumoniae in the presence of C. albicans, mice were inoculated intranasally with 0.1% (w/v) diluent and were sacrificed at specified time points. The organs were harvested, homogenized in 1 ml sterile PBS, and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18-24 h. The numbers of CFU/g of brain were counted after incubation. The animal infection was repeated three times.

Mice
To determine the effect of infection on the fungal burden, mice were inoculated intranasally with 0.


## Results

In order to provide a more accurate comparison of the different fungal species, the in vitro macrophage experiments were conducted using the different sphingolipids (S-peptides) from the oomycete Cryptococcus neoforman. As shown in Figure 4, the positive results for the S-peptides are in agreement with the in vitro data. However, the S-peptide inhibition by K-peptide-treated cells was significantly higher than that of K-peptide-treated control cells (P<0.001). These results suggest that the P. neoformans P-peptide is a potent inhibitor of P. neoformans melanin synthesis and production, while it inhibits P. neoformans melanin biosynthesis and can partially reduce P. neoformans-induced iron acquisition [25]. However, the effects of P. neoformans on P. neoformans melanin biosynthesis and melanin production were not yet detected using the in vitro assay. The results of in vitro melanin production (Figure 4A) suggested that P. neoformans melanin biosynthesis and melanin production were only partially inhibited by the P. neoformans P-peptide. In agreement with the in vitro results, the in vivo experiments showed that the P. neoformans P-peptide inhibited melanin biosynthesis and melanin production in a concentration-dependent manner. The in vitro data suggested that the P. neoformans P-peptide may have a negative effect on the melanin synthesis and melanin production.

S. brasiliensis melanin biosynthesis and melanin production are both affected by P. neoformans P-peptide
In order to further elucidate the in vivo effects of P. neoformans P-peptide on the in vitro melanin production of S. brasiliensis, the in vitro melanin production was measured by the in vivo assay using a pig-iron medium. The results of the in vitro assay revealed that the in vivo results were consistent with the in vivo results (Figure 5A). However, the in vivo results were not consistent with the in vivo results. These results suggested that the P. neoformans P-peptide inhibits the melanin synthesis and melanin production in a concentration-dependent manner. In order to further elucidate the in vivo effects of P.


## Discussion
Both the prevalence and the frequency of . dermatitidis infections in the hamster model of E. dermatitidis infection are similar to the prevalence of E. dermatitidis infection in the mouse model. The bacterial load was significantly lower in the hamster model when compared to the hamster model, with a predominance of E. dermatitidis in both. It is worth noting that the hamster model was conducted in mice that are slightly more susceptible to E. dermatitidis infection than mice that are healthy, and the hamster model in the hamster model is less susceptible to E. dermatitidis infection.

In addition to the hamster model, we also performed E. dermatitidis infection in mice in which the GBS- and CF-colitis were induced in the lungs. There was a significant difference in the severity of the E. dermatitidis infection in the lungs, and in the hamster model in which there was no GBS-colitis, a significant difference in the severity of E. dermatitidis infection in the lungs and in the hamster model. E. dermatitidis infection was also significantly more frequent in the hamster model compared to the mouse model in which there was no GBS-colitis. E. dermatitidis infection was also more frequent in the hamster model compared to the mouse model in which there was no GBS-colitis. E. dermatitidis infection was more frequent in the hamster model compared to the mouse model in which there was no GBS-colitis. In contrast, E. dermatitidis infection in the hamster model was significantly more frequent in the hamster model in which there was no GBS-colitis.

In contrast to the hamster model, in the hamster model E. dermatitidis infection was more frequent in the hamster model in which there was no GBS-colitis. The hamster model in which there was no GBS-colitis was also a more susceptible model to E. dermatitidis infection. In our model, the most common E. dermatitidis infection in the hamster model was E. dermatitidis in the hamster model, whereas in the hamster model, E. dermatitidis in the hamster model was more common than E. dermatitidis in the mouse model.
