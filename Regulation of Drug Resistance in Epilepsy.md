## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intrauterine zoonosis (INZ) and maternal diploid aneuploid a-diphtheria (a-diphtheria) on the development of Inz- cryptococcosis, and its possible link with maternal mortality.

The incidence of INZ and the incubation time of the microorganisms in INZ- and a-diphtheria-infected newborns and infants was evaluated.

Two hundred and eighteen newborns were enrolled in the study, of whom 80% were infected with the mother-fated pathogen. The incidence of in- and out-patenting was 84%. The incidence of ZO- and out-patenting was 10.3% and 0.08 mg/mL respectively. The incidence of ZO- and out-patenting was 46.2%, 11.7% and 0.03 mg/mL respectively.

The incidence of ZO- and out-patenting was higher in the mothers than in the newborns, but no statistically significant differences were observed in the mothers and newborns.

The study highlights the importance of the proper use of INZ and the use of antioxidants to prevent and treat mother and newborn infections. Prevention and intervention should be intensified for better prognosis.


## Introduction
Activation of CINTS is mediated by the transcription factors Acl-1 and Acl-2 [9], which regulate CINTS expression [10. During CINTS, Acl-1, a member of the cysteine protease family, activates its target proteins to inhibit CINTS and other antifungal drugs, leading to enhanced antifungal drug susceptibility [11]. In addition to the action of Acl-1, Acl-2 are also important for CINTS [12]. Recently, a gene encoding a protein that mediates a cation transport chain in fungi [13] has been shown to be important for CINTS-dependent regulation. In the model ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans, deletion of the cation transport regulator Acl-1 results in significantly reduced sensitivity to fluconazole [14]. In A. nidulans, a cation transport inhibitor, CINTS1, is a factor that is required for CINTS-dependent regulation of cation transport [15]. These results suggest that the cation transport and drug resistance genes may function as drug efflux pumps.

The synthesis of metal ions, metal-containing compounds, and the secretion of antifungal drugs have been reported to be important for the survival and pathogenesis of fungi in the environment [16,17]. A number of fungi have been shown to secrete metal ions in the form of copper, zinc, cadmium, titanium, or magnesium into the extracellular space [18-20]. Metal ions in fungal cells can be sensed by a number of receptors that are important for their responses to the environment and to the pathogen [21,22]. The sensing of metals in fungi involves two pathways, namely endocytosis, which releases metals from the endolysosomes, and exocytosis, which releases metals from the extracellular environment [23,24]. Endocytosis is initiated by the interaction between the endolysosomal end moiety and the native metal ion.


## Methods
ESI-MS analysis was performed using a TripleTOF System (TripleTOF™) (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA. Cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.45 M NaCl, 0.15 M EDTA, 1% NP-40, 2 mM CaCl_2) was added, followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 with H_2O and the samples were centrifuged at 6200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new 96-well plate, which was then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 2 mM PMSF and the absorbance was measured at a 450 nm excitation and an emission wavelength of 490 nm. The data was analyzed by a 3-D ELISA reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Construction of the Recombinant Vector
The plasmid pCA2-HIS was used for the recombinant plasmid construct of the recombinant plasmid pCA2-HIS, which was constructed by the fusion of two fragments of pCA2-HIS and the recombinant plasmid pCA2-HIS. The pCA2-HIS-F and pCA2-HIS-R constructs were constructed by fusion of the fragments of pCA2-HIS and pCA2-HIS-F with the pCA2-HIS-F fragment, which is composed of the two fragments of pCA2-HIS and pCA2-HIS-R. The fusion was performed by the fusion PCR strategy, which consisted of the following: (1) pCA2-HIS-F, pCA2-HIS-R, pCA2-HIS-F, (2) pCA2-HIS-R, pCA2-HIS-F, pCA2-HIS-R and (3) pCA2-HIS-R-F.


## Results
For this, we investigated the transcript levels of both the PLB2/IFNAR1 and IFNAR1-dependent transcription factors PRR1 and TCR1 in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant (Fig 5B. We found that the PRR1-dependent transcription factor (TCR1) transcript was significantly decreased in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant in the absence of exogenous arginine (Fig 5C). The TCR1-dependent transcription factor transcript in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant was reduced in the presence of exogenous arginine. We also found that exogenous arginine did not influence the expression of PRR1 or TCR1, but decreased their transcript levels in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant (Fig 5D). These data indicate that the PLB2/IFNAR1 pathway is required for drug resistance in Epilepsy patients.

The PLB2/IFNAR1 pathway regulates adhesion molecule expression
We further investigated the expression of adhesion molecule (AIM) in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant. We found that the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant expressed higher AIM levels than the wild-type control (Fig 6A). We also found that the expression of AIM was significantly decreased in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant. In contrast, the expression of AIM was increased in the wild-type control, but not in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant (Fig 6B). We found that the expression of AIM was decreased in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant. In addition, the expression of AIM was significantly decreased in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant. These results suggest that the PLB2/IFNAR1 pathway regulates adhesion molecule expression in the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of AIM-mediated drug resistance in Epilepsy patients.

We further evaluated the expression of AIM in the plasma membrane. The expression of AIM was significantly increased in the PLB2/IFNAR1 mutant in the presence of exogenous arginine. In contrast, the expression of AIM was decreased in the wild-type control.


## Discussion
In the present study, we aimed to find out the genetic basis for drug resistance in Epilepsy patient. We observed that the gene expression of the 14 genes was induced during the first 6 h after exposure to 3 mg/kg of C. albicans and that they were up-regulated in the gastric epithelium and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue, and down-regulated in the oral cavity. In addition, we also observed that the gene expression of the 14 genes was up-regulated in the gastric epithelium and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue, and down-regulated in the oral cavity. These results suggested that the 5 genes coding for C. albicans are involved in C. albicans-induced drug resistance and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue. Our results also indicated that the 3 genes coding for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis are involved in drug resistance and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue. These results indicated that the 3 genes coding for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis are involved in C. albicans-induced drug resistance and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue.

In our previous work, we found that C. albicans induces a considerable amount of mRNA and protein in the oral cavity in Epilepsy patients, whereas C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis were not detected [13]. The present results revealed that C. albicans-induced gene expression of the gene encoding C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis, were significantly higher in the gastric epithelium and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue of Epilepsy patients, whereas C. albicans-induced gene expression of the gene encoding C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis, was undetectable in the oral cavity of Epilepsy patients. This result indicated that the 3 genes coding for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis are involved in C. albicans-induced drug resistance and colitis-associated lymphoid tissue.
