## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is capable of causing life-threatening meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. C. neoformans infection in immunocompromised hosts is regulated by the TLR4/STAT type trierratic signaling pathway, which contains the Yap1 and Yap2 regulatory effectors. We previously identified two novel TLR4/STAT-related genes in C. neoformans. Deletion of either R265 or R272 in strain R272 revealed that, unlike in R265, Yap2 not only has a constitutive role in nutrient acquisition but also functions as a suppressor for the malnutte strain R369. In a murine model of cryptococcosis, we found that R272 is only partially expressed in the spleen, and Yap2 is only partially expressed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the control strains. In other mouse models, we found that both Yap2 and Yap2-/- R272 were unable to generate a protective Th2-type effect.


## Introduction
This disease, also known as mycosis, is endemic in Latin America and the Caribbea. The genus Paracoccidioides includes 15 species, three of which (P. brasiliensis, P. lusitaniae, P. restrepiensis and P. lusitaniae) cause a worldwide distribution. In Brazil, the most common species are responsible for the disease: P. restrepiensis is the most common cause of PCM, followed by P. brasiliensis and P. lusitaniae. This disease is considered to be endemic in Brazil and has a high prevalence in rural areas (Matute et al., 2009; Blasi et al., 2012; Peralta-Filho et al., 2015).

The main etiological agents in PCM are of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex (Pb01-like) complex (Schoch et al., 2012; Neves et al., 2015). The P. brasiliensis complex is classified into two subfamilies: Pb01-like (Pb01-I) and Pb01-II (Schoch et al., 2012; Neves et al., 2015). Pb01-I subfamilies are classified based on the molecular phylogenetic features of the locus, genes encoding proteins with known functions, and the production of conidia. Pb01-II subfamilies are classified based on the presence or absence of steric structures on the protein surface, which differ in length and composition from the corresponding steric structures (Barras-Aguilar et al., 2010). Pb01-I subfamilies are divided into four groups: a) Pb01-II and b) Pb01-C (Díez-Real and Morais, 2014). The Pb01-I subfamilies are divided into three subgroups: a) Pb01-II and b) Pb01-III (Mateo et al., 2012; Castro et al., 2015).

There is an urgent need for the identification of new antifungal drugs against PCM, which will facilitate the implementation of new antifungal therapies.


## Methods
chrysosporium from clinical specimens, we used standard laboratory technique. First, we inoculated the fungal mycelium with a 0.8% (w/w) yeast extract solution. Then, the mycelium was shaken and then inoculated with 100 µl of sterile water. The culture was shaken in a shaking incubator at 30°C for 24 h. Then, the mycelium was collected and crushed by mortar and pestle. The fungal pellets were washed with sterile water and then subjected to filtration and sub-sieved at 15 microns to obtain pure cell wall fractions. The purified cell wall fraction was stored in 50% glycerol at -80°C.

The isolated P. chrysosporium from clinical specimens was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to the CLSI guidelines [16]. P. chrysosporium strain CBS 1198 (serotype D, class I, NIAID, USA) was used as the quality control strain. The purity of the isolate was confirmed by the use of agar strips.

Identification of P. chrysosporium species
The P. chrysosporium isolates were identified using the standard PCR and/or HPLC procedures as follows: 1) cell wall fraction; 2) purified P. chrysosporium from culture supernatant; 3) purified P. chrysosporium from culture supernatant; and 4) isolated P. chrysosporium from agar strip (see Table 1 for additional details). For these four isolates, P. chrysosporium and P. chrysosporium-B-15 were also considered as reference strains.

The purity of P. chrysosporium was determined using the PCR-RFLP method as described previously [17]. The PCR products were purified and sequenced. The ITS region of P. chrysosporium was sequenced and the species was assigned to each of the nine strains using the P. chrysosporium-B-15 as reference species.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The genomic DNA of P. chrysosporium was isolated from the clinical specimens. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and then stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.


## Results
maydis (. maydis) genomes for GO analysis. We first focused on the gene sets with high GO scores and considered the transcriptome as a whole. We then combined the transcriptome with RNA-seq and performed differential gene expression analysis. We found that U. maydis gene sets were enriched with genes involved in the metabolic pathways, and that the transcriptome of the U. maydis genome was enriched with genes involved in metabolic pathways (Table S2). We then asked whether the gene sets that were enriched in the U. maydis transcriptome were being transferred to other genomes. In a previous study, we found that U. maydis gene sets were transferred to the genomes of different fungal lineages, and that the U. maydis transcriptome was enriched in these genomes (Chow et al., 2014). Thus, we hypothesized that the U. maydis transcriptome was being transferred to other fungal lineages.

U. maydis was isolated from a human patient and has been shown to be a pathogenic fungus (Chow et al., 2014). Since our previous study showed that U. maydis could be transferred to other organisms in vivo, we examined the transfer of U. maydis genes to other organisms. We tested the transfer of U. maydis genes to nine different animal models, including a mouse, an animal model of phagocytosis (Fig 1), a rat, a rat model of phagocytosis (Fig 2), a mouse model of hematopoietic stem cell (HSCL) development (Fig 2), and a rat model of fungal infection (Fig 3). We found that transfer of U. maydis genes to other animals occurred in a similar manner. We found that the transfer of U. maydis genes to other organisms was more pronounced in the rat model than in the mouse model. Transfer of U. maydis genes to other animals was more pronounced in the rat model than in the mouse model (Fig 1). The transfer of U. maydis genes to other animals was more pronounced in the rat model than in the mouse model. We found that the transfer of U.


## Discussion
glabrata in the present study, and this was likely due to the high number of cases, including many patients admitted to our hospital, who had not been diagnosed as . glabrata. A previous study found that P. glabrata was a rare cause of clinical illness in our hospital and that it is difficult to diagnose with the aid of molecular methods and histological methods [3]. Thus, the use of molecular methods to distinguish P. glabrata from P. neoformans, P. gatti, and P. babaviae was justified as an alternative method of detection. The only previous study to specifically evaluate the phenotypic characteristics of P. glabrata was conducted in an African hospital where our samples were collected and analysed for their potential to cause disease in patients [8]. In our study, the specimens of P. glabrata were collected from patients who had not been diagnosed as P. glabrata. These specimens were not included in our study because they were missing from other studies. However, the study conducted in the hospital where P. glabrata was collected also failed to identify the P. glabrata species. In addition, although a high number of cases of P. glabrata were reported in the literature, this species has never been considered as a cause of clinical illness in a large study of P. glabrata.

The present study also demonstrated that the majority of patients (66%) had a history of P. glabrata infection, and of P. glabrata infection was present in 48.3% of the cases. However, due to the fact that this is an epidemiological question, further investigation is required to further understand the prevalence of P. glabrata.

The present study also revealed that the majority of the cases (56.7%) had a history of P. glabrata infection, and it was also found that a majority (56.7%) had a history of P. glabrata infection. Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the patients in this study were diagnosed as P. glabrata. The vast majority (76.3%) had a history of P. glabrata infection, which was also found in the present study.

The detection of P.
