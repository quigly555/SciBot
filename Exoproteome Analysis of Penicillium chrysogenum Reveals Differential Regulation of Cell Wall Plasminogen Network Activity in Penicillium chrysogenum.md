## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Sporisorium spp. has a pantropical lifestyle that can fluctuate between low eutrophil predominance, low nuclear envelope density (NFDC), and temperate to tropical vegetation. In this study, we determined the relative abundance of three different Sporisorium spp. taxa in four countries (i.e. Brazilian, Czech Republic, Peru, and United States) using a custom built taxonomical approach. The results indicated that the species in the Brazilian, Peru, and United States populations were more related to Sporisorium species than to Sporisorium globosa. The abundance of Sporisorium spp. in non eutrophic habitats (i.e. grassland, pasture, vineyard, orchard) was also shown to be related to the species of Sporisorium. A comparison of the relative abundance of one representative Sporisorium spp. species in Argentina with several representatives of other countries revealed significant differences in the abundance of all the representatives of Sporisorium. Furthermore, we found that the abundance of representatives of Sporisorium spp. in Argentina was significantly correlated with the abundance of the taxa on the above three countries, suggesting that the tax may be more widespread than first thought. Lastly, we found that the tax may be more widespread in a temperate than a tropical environment. Overall, the results of our study might be useful for resource rich countries where S. spp. can exploit different climate zones.


## Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells constitute the immune system of the human host and constitute the first line of defense against microbial infections. There are approximately 15,000-20,000 pro-inflammatory/inflammatory CD4^+ cells in the human host and approximately 10,000-15,500 pro-inflammatory/inflammatory CD4^+ cells in the peripheral blood [1]. The amount of innate lymphocytes in the peripheral blood is much higher than the number of activated/reactive cells in the blood, which suggests that the host is mainly exposed to microbial pathogens. The mechanisms underlying the immune response are mainly mediated by the production of antigens by B cells, which release cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and secrete IL-10 [2], [3], [4]. The release of cytokines is also associated with the activation of T cells, which produce chemokines such as interleukin-10 (CXCL10) and caspofungin [5]. CXCL10 is a highly expressed cytokine that is expressed in a variety of cell types and is a well-characterized target of the neutrophils [6].


## Methods
Ethics statement

Collection of animals
Wild animal (vegetable) was collected from the Jiangxi province of Sichuan province, China, during the current study. The experimental animal use was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Sichuan (China).


## Results
It is well established that the cell wall is a complex structure that contains several components, including glycoproteins, chitin, mannosyltransferases and other cytosolic glycoproteins [4,5. We asked whether the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum, which also possesses a serine-containing lectin, is related to the cell wall components. To test this, we compared the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum against monoclonal antibodies against human monoclonal antibodies. We found that the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum against monoclonal antibodies was significantly increased when the fungus was grown on the PDB medium (Fig 3C). Similar results were obtained when the fungus was grown on the PDB medium (Fig 3D). These results suggest that the fungus is able to regulate the cell wall components in order to enhance the antifungal activity.

Penicillium chrysogenum is able to produce GXM at different concentrations in the medium [3]. We determined whether the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum was associated with the concentration of GXM produced by the fungus. As shown in Fig 3E, GXM production by Penicillium chrysogenum was not significantly different from that of the untreated control, suggesting that the fungus is able to regulate the cell wall components to the level of the extracellular environment.

For the yeast cell wall component, we evaluated the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum against the monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig 4, both the fungicidal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum and the antifungal activity of Penicillium chrysogenum against the monoclonal antibodies were significantly increased when the fungus was grown on the PDB medium (Fig 4A). This results suggest that the fungus is able to regulate the cell wall components to the level of the extracellular environment.

In addition, we analyzed the antifungal activity of the fungus against the monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig 4B, Penicillium chrysogenum was able to produce GXM at concentrations >10 µg/ml.


## Discussion
chrysogenum genome encodes five putative . chrysogenum-specific genes, which are characterized by the presence of multiple cysteine-rich proteins, including multiple cysteine-rich proteins in the outer membrane of P. chrysogenum (Fig 1). These genes have been found to be expressed during the infection of C. neoformans and were found to be required for pathogenicity of this species [20]. Moreover, P. chrysogenum has been reported to synthesize a large number of melanins [40], which have been shown to be involved in pathogenicity of this species [41]. Thus, we predicted the gene expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes in Penicillium chrysogenum and P. chrysogenum grown in liquid media.

The expression profile of the differentially expressed genes in Penicillium chrysogenum and P. chrysogenum grown in liquid media showed similar patterns (Figs. 2A, 5, and 6). The differential expression of the genes (Figs. 2B and 6) were found to be regulated by a number of factors, including the pH, temperature, and light (Figs. 7A and 7B). The differential expression pattern of the genes (Figs. 7A and 7B) was found to be related to the genes involved in oxidative stress response, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity of Penicillium chrysogenum (Fig 8).

The expression profiles of the differentially expressed genes (Figs. 2B and 6) were found to be similar to that of the P. chrysogenum grown in liquid media, which exhibited a maximum of 24 h (Fig 6). The differential expression patterns of the genes (Figs. 7A and 7B) were found to be related to the genes involved in oxidative stress response, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity of Penicillium chrysogenum (Fig 8).

The differential expression of genes (Figs. 2B and 6) (Fig 2) were found to be related to the genes involved in the response to UV light (Figs. 7A and 7B) and the expression of cell wall integrity (Figs. 7A and 7B). The expression of the genes involved in cell wall integrity (Figs.
