## Abstract
The microfilarial fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is a pathogenic fungus that causes histoplasmosis, a systemic mycosis with high morbidity and mortality. Meningoencephalitis and pulmonary histoplasmosis are common life-threatening complications, while inflammatory changes, especially leukopenia, have been previously reported. We report a case of hypogammaglobulin (GM) treatment in a nonendemic adult with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated hyponatremia.

## Methods
mannitol Dehydrogenase (EUR) Stabilization of . monocytogenes Aromaticum multiforme and Neurospora crassa T. rubrum (n = 3) were the positive controls for the active compound against L. monocytogenes. The In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Lavandula intermedia Euwallacea L. Essential Oil against Penicillium expansum L. Essential Oil and Non-Sterilizole Drug 14 Isavuconazole (PAS) Stabilized L. mannitol Dehydrogenase (EUR) Stabilization of L. monocytogenes Aromaticum multiforme and Neurospora crassa T. rubrum (n = 3) were the negative controls for the active compound against L. monocytogenes.

To identify the bioactive compounds, the p-value of the first compound was subtracted from the p-value of the second compound to obtain the p-value of the third compound. The p-value of the third compound was subtracted from the p-value of the first compound to obtain the p-value of the fourth compound. The p-value of the first compound was subtracted from the p-value of the second compound to obtain the p-value of the fifth compound. The p-value of the fourth compound was subtracted from the p-value of the fifth compound to obtain the p-value of the sixth compound. The p-value of the sixth compound was subtracted from the p-value of the third compound to obtain the p-value of the seventh compound. The p-value of the seventh compound was subtracted from the p-value of the second compound to obtain the p-value of the eighth compound. The p-value of the ninth compound was subtracted from the p-value of the second compound to obtain the p-value of the tenth compound. The p-value of the ten most active compound was subtracted from the p-value of the third compound to obtain the p-value of the tenth compound. The p-value of the eleven most active compound was subtracted from the p-value of the third compound to obtain the p-value of the twelve most active compound.


## Results
essential oil against the fungi Penicillium expansum . essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 is shown in Table 2. The Euwallacea L. essential oil has a higher antifungal activity than the other oils which, however, have a weaker antifungal activity against the fungi Penicillium expansum L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14. The Euwallacea L. essential oil is found in high concentrations in food, cosmetics, and cosmetics with a maximum concentration of 125.75 mg/mL and a minimum concentration of 62.75 mg/mL, which is well above the recommended concentrations of 500 mg/mL and 250 mg/mL for Penicillium expansum L. essential oil. The Euwallacea L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 were found to be much more active against Penicillium expansum L than the other oils.

Antimicrobial Activity of Lavandula intermedia Euwallacea L. Essential Oil against M. tuberculosis
The MIC values of the Euwallacea L. essential oil against M. tuberculosis ranged from 0.008 to 62.25 µg/mL. The Euwallacea L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 were found to be more active against M. tuberculosis than the other oils. The Euwallacea L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 were found to be much more active than the other oils against M. tuberculosis, as shown in Table 3. The Euwallacea L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 were found to be much less active than the other oils.

Antimicrobial Activity of Lavandula intermedia Euwallacea L. Essential Oil against P. aeruginosa L. Essential Oil
The MIC values of the Euwallacea L. essential oil against P. aeruginosa L. essential oil ranged from 0.008 to 62.25 µg/mL. The Euwallacea L. essential oil and non-Sterilizole Drug 14 were found to be more active than the other oils. The Euwallacea L.


## Discussion
For example, Halipruder et a. (2005) and Anathema et al. (2009) demonstrated the antifungal activity of essential oil against Penicillium expansum L. essential oil. This substance was also tested against two human pathogens, Fusarium solani and P. expansum L., which are pathogenic fungi. The essential oil of Aspergillus flavus showed antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei.

In this study, the essential oil of Lavandula intermedia Euwallacea L. essential oil showed antibacterial, antifungal and antifungal activity against the tested microorganisms.

The essential oil of D. melanogaster was also tested against the microorganisms, which are fungal pathogens. The essential oil of D. melanogaster also showed activity against the tested fungi.

Antioxidant activity of the essential oil of D. melanogaster against the tested fungi
The essential oil of D. melanogaster was tested against the fungi and showed antioxidant activity.

The essential oil of D. melanogaster also showed antioxidant activity.
