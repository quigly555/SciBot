## Abstract
This review focuses on three major fungal classes: members of the Ascomycota phylum, members of the Basidiomycota, and the non-alcoholic Trichoderma reesei. While the latter are predominant in water, A. reesei, Fusarium and Aspergillus spp. are less common, and our knowledge of their diversity is very limited. The most recent specimens from water samples of the Mekong delta were identified as new species of Trichoderma reinhardtii. To our knowledge, this is the first report of new fungi introduced in water samples of the delta. In addition, the new species are basal to the genera Penicillium and Trichoderma. These fungi are the first to be introduced in Malaysia, and their association with human infections has been extensively documented. The Penicillium spp. are isolated only from water and their presence in air must be suspected. The members of the Ganjosomycesa and Grosmannia are basal to the genera Fusarium and Penicillium, while the genus Scythosomyces is known only from water and soil.


## Introduction
Amino acids are ubiquitous components of the cell membrane and play important roles in cellular function by mediating their effects. The production of a range of biologically important amino acids by the action of a variety of enzymes is well known to be vital for the growth and survival of microbial pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans. However, the biological functions of amino acids are more complex than these molecules and often involve other molecules as well. The evolutionary origins of some amino acids and their metabolic activities have been studied. In addition, some amino acids and their biosynthetic pathways are relatively conserved among different organisms. Moreover, and most importantly, the status of free amino acids (FFAs) and their chemical structures has been studied. The free amino acids are a common product of the primary metabolism and are synthesized as byproducts, such as fatty acids (FAAs) or amine (AAs) by some organisms. FFA are substrates for many enzymes, which function by catalyzing the transfer of amino acid moieties to synthesize second messengers. The absence of these intermediates leads to inefficient cell function and ultimately death. FAAs are also involved in the biosynthesis of other amino acids, such as cysteine (Cys) and prostaglandins. SDS is a compound that is mainly produced by the action of two major classes of enzymes: thioredoxin-type thioredoxin and cysteine kinase (KCT). KCT are characterized by the production of thioredoxin and cysteine inducible enzymes, and the absence of cysteine in thioredoxin leads to the inhibition of enzyme activities. In fungi, thioredoxin and cysteine are found to be indispensable for their function [1],  [2]. In mammals, the thioredoxin and cysteine kinases are found to be involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes, such as adhesins, chitinases and a variety of laccases.


## Methods
The identity of the isolates was checked using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, and the obtained sequences were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) databas.

Molecular identification
The genomic DNA extract from the root-associated fungus was subjected to molecular identification using the primer pairs for the ITS region (F: 5’-CGATTCAGTTTCACGG-3’, ITS1: 5’-GGACTTCCGTAGGTGAACCT-3’; R: 5’-CACTTCCGCTTATTGAACT-3’; S: 5’-CACTTCCGCTTATTGAACT-3’) and the D1/D2 domains (F: 5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGAACT-3’, D1/D2: 5’-GCTCAGTATTGAACCTC-3’, D2/D1: 5’-CAGCTCCAGTTCCTT-3’). The primers ITS3 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990) were used as amplification primers for PCR amplification of the D1/D2 domain of the rDNA operon of the pathogenic fungus. The DNA was purified using an enzymatic PCR cleanup (Sigma) and the purified product was ligated into pMD-18 plasmid, which was transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells. The transformed cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth for 18 h and the OD_600 nm was measured after the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The purified DNA extract was subjected to subsequent biochemical and electrophoretic procedures to obtain the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA operon. The ITS region was amplified using the primer pair ITS4 and ITS5 (White et al., 1990), and the PCR product was ligated into pMD-18, which was transformed into Escherichia coli, and the transformants were screened by colony PCR.


## Results
. Purification and Characterization of D-Citric Acidic Antimicrobial Activity
The cationic acid profiles of the tested compounds were determined against the three fungal strains of Candida spp. by HPLC-MS. The results showed that compounds from the two most common fungal species, Cryptococcus spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, had a higher MIC values against C. albicans, C.


## Discussion
The remaining isolates have not been analyze. Based on the molecular markers, we cannot confirm the identity of the isolates and do not know the exact genotype of the isolates, which are in accordance with other studies.

The current study is of great interest to the ecology of this species. Since the early stages of cultivation, pathogens in this fungus have been detected and most of the isolates have been studied. However, due to the difficulties in obtaining reliable molecular markers and the lack of suitable experimental conditions, the identification and genotype of the species has been difficult. The present study was based on the four major taxonomic groups of the conifer roots and analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the isolates. In addition to the four major groups of the conifer roots, we also analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the isolates from the other three groups of the root. Based on these results, we investigated the conifer root phylogeny based on the four major groups of the conifer roots and were able to identify 38 strains of the major group of the conifer roots and 15 strains from the other three groups of the roots.

In the present study, the conifer root genotype was different for each of the four groups of the conifer roots. The results showed that the isolates from the other three groups of the roots showed different genotypes and that the genotype of the genotype from the other three groups of the roots was more similar to the genotype from the other three groups of the roots.

The two genotypes of the genotypes in the present study, H5N9 and K2P3, were also different from each other. The genotype from the other three groups of the conifer roots was found to be H5N9 and K2P3, which means that the genotype of the genotype from the other three groups of the conifer roots was different from that of the genotype from the other three groups of the roots. In the present study, the genotype of the genotype from the other three groups of the conifer roots was H5N9 and K2P3.
