## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes a deadly meningitis in AIDS patients. The fungus can persist inside macrophages, where it can cause life-threatening disease. In this study, we discovered that a novel in vitro glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid A (GPI-anchored lipid A) could act as a vaccine candidate against C. neoformans infection in mice.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes a fatal meningitis in patients with AIDS, with up to 90% of cases attributable to immunocompromised patients. While the underlying mechanism of immune dysfunction in immune responses to this fungus has been extensively described, the precise nature of the disease caused by C. neoformans has remained elusive. We report that the in vitro GPI-anchored lipid A promotes maturation of C. neoformans in macrophages. This effect is dependent on the lipid A content of the lipid A-sugar cluster and occurs even after the fungus has been isolated from a macrophage strain. Our findings suggest that macrophages exposed to the lipid A inducers secrete an immunogenic cytokine, chemokine, or complement, which neutralizes C. neoformans infection and induces murine protective immunity.


## Introduction
It has been well established that C. albicans is able to adapt and adapt to different stresses. It can grow in different environments, such as a hostile and nutrient-limited space, nutrient deprivation, or in nutrient-poor microenvironments (1, 2). C. albicans possesses two critical post-translational enzymes, namely acyl CoA reductase (CA) and acyl CoA:CoA oxidase, which have been well characterized in other species, such as C. albicans and Candida tropicalis (3-7). In C. albicans, the CA oxidase has been well characterized. Activation of CA is the key factor involved in the stress responses (8-11). However, the CA-mediated signaling pathway, which is associated with many aspects of stress tolerance and virulence, is poorly understood in C. albicans.

The CA:CoA oxidase is a heterodimer composed of two catalytic subunits, catalytic subunit 1 and regulatory subunit 2.


## Methods
ITS sequences were aligned using ClustalW [25. In addition, we employed the MEGA 7 software to study the similarities between the sequence data of the eight fungal species. In the MEGA 7 software, the homology between the sequences of the eight fungal species was calculated and confirmed by the presence of the nucleotide-based similarities among the sequences of the two species. For each of the 16 fungal species, the homology between the sequences was calculated and confirmed by the presence of the nucleotide-based similarities among the sequences of the two species.


## Results
The analysis of the ITS-based data of . reesei revealed the presence of four recombination events in the T. reesei genome, which are typical of yeast/yeast hybrids and had to be discarded as nonsense-colonization events, because they can be found in genome sequences of other fungi. The T. reesei haplotype data were included in the analysis. The T. reesei Tg1 haplotype was the only gene detected in all samples. The distribution of the tAIF was similar to that of the T. reesei haplotype data, with an average of 1.56 bp for the tAIF and 0.79 bp for the Tg1 data (Table 1). The distribution of the tAIF showed similar trends to that of the T. reesei haplotype data, with an average of 0.15 bp for the tAIF and 0.24 bp for the Tg1 data (Table 1). However, the tAIF distribution did not show any significant differences between the two data sets.

The Tg1/tiASF is a unique gene
To analyze the distribution of the tAIF and tAIF gene in T. reesei, a tAIF gene was cloned from a single copy from the whole genome of a T. reesei strain and transformed into a T. reesei strain. The gene was located on the left arm of chromosome 4 and contained no nucleotide differences. The chromosomal copy of the gene was then cloned into a potato dextrose broth (PDA) medium and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The transformant of the tAIF gene was able to grow on PDA at 37°C. The chromosomal copy of the gene was then transferred to PDA medium for a further 2 h, and the resultant strains were identified as the T. reesei tg1 and tg2 strains, respectively. The transformant of the tAIF gene was then transferred to PDA at 37°C for 1 h, and the resultant strains were identified as the T. reesei tg2 strain. The T. reesei tg1 and tg2 strains were identified as the T. reesei tg1/tiASF strain.


## Discussion
neoformans

To test if the global global spread of ST3 is spread over the next generation, we used the ThiT gene in . neoformans to amplify the thiT gene and the GATA transcription factor that encodes the T-DNA. We performed the amplification by a transposon-specific triplication step. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The resulting DNA was amplified by PCR followed by gel electrophoresis followed by restriction enzyme digestion to generate the amplicons. The generated amplicons were deposited in GenBank. The resulting genomic DNA was further amplified by the next PCR step in order to establish the gene expression pattern. The resultant amplified DNA was sequenced using the TEM system to establish the gene expression. The resulting gene set was then examined for gene expression by FACS. The results are summarized in Table 2.

As shown in Figure 2, the gene expression pattern of C. neoformans was determined to be very similar to that of C. gattii and C. deneoformans. This pattern was consistent with the expression of the same genes in both species. This pattern was also observed in other studies of global spread of ST3. In S. cerevisiae, ST3 has been shown to be expressed by up to 25% of the total cellular population [37]. In C. neoformans, we observed that the expression of the global ST3 gene was significantly up-regulated at 24 h of growth, but not at 24 h of growth, as shown in Figure 3. This was due to the fact that the global expression of ST3 was not reduced in the presence of the T-DNA. We speculated that the T-DNA and T-GATA proteins might be involved in the development of the global spread of ST3 and that the gene expression was up-regulated at 24 h of growth. However, no more T-DNA or T-GATA gene expression was detected in the presence of the global ST3 gene, as shown in Figure 3.

Stigma-induced gene expression changes were observed in C. neoformans and C. gattii with the transposon-specific triplication step. The results are summarized in Table 3. This showed that the global ST3 gene was up-regulated at 24 h of growth.
