## Abstract
The development of a protective vaccine against fungal infections continues to be a topic of concern, with some studies implicating protective immunity against invasive fungal disease (IFD) in the immunocompromised host. The goal of this study was to determine the in vitro immunogenicity of recombinant human CD4+ T-cell to develop a vaccine against IFD in mouse models of infection. Using mouse models, we first established a previously-validated murine infection model of experimental pulmonary infection with fungal infection that included murine CD4+ T cells following IFD treatment. Using this infection model, we subsequently demonstrated an IFD-like phenotype in CD4+ T-cell following infection, supporting the protective function of CD4+ T cells in IFD. Using the infection model in mice deficient for CD4+ T cells, we then evaluated the protective effects of CD4+ T cells in mice deficient for IFD. These in vitro studies demonstrated that CD4+ T cells activated murine inflammatory responses, stimulated fungal clearance, and prevented fungal growth. In vivo studies using a mouse model of experimental IFD showed that CD4+ T cells stimulated a robust and controlled inflammatory response in the lungs of infected mice, with IFD-like tissue manifestation and fungal clearance in the lungs of IFD-treated mice. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of CD4+ T cells to protect against IFD, and the requirement for protective immunity to this fungal infection. This study suggests that recombinant human CD4+ T cells are the next generation of multiproteolytically expressed CD4+ T cells for IFD, and that the use of CD4+ T cells in the treatment of experimental pulmonary infection with fungi is compatible with the development of a vaccine against IFD.


## Introduction
The innate immune system is composed of the specialized cells involved in the detection of microbial infections, phagocytosis, and the clearance of them by the phagocytic cells. The phagocytic cells detect pathogens by their cytokine production, and then, with the activity of phagocytic cells, they produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are involved in the destruction of the pathogens. A number of these species are involved in phagocytosis, phagolysosome maturation, and phagolysosome re-absorption [1].

There are two types of phagocytic cells: those of the hematopoietic origin and those of the innate immune system. The hematopoietic origin cells have a macrophage-like architecture and are constitutively activated by the action of macrophages. Upon phagocytosis, macrophages undergo a morphological change from the classical phagocytic cells into the more polarized astrocytic cells (i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells). The polarized astrocytic cells are characterized by the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-21.


## Methods
Yeast cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and inoculated into YPD mediu. A 2-h interval was used to inoculate the plate with the same volume of PBS. The resulting cell suspensions were then transferred into 96-well microtiter plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C in the dark. The cell suspensions were then rinsed with PBS to remove unbound yeast, and then kept in PBS until use. For in vivo assays, the yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium for 24 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min, and then washed with PBS. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in PBS. The cell number was determined by the number of yeast cells that were counted in each well. The control plates were prepared by adding equal volumes of PBS to the yeast cells. The number of yeast cells in each well was determined by counting the number of cells per cell in each well, and the control plates were prepared with the same volume of PBS.

Culture conditions and determination of C. neoformans-specific mRNA levels
For analysis of the C. neoformans-specific mRNA levels, the in vitro assays were performed as described previously (32). Briefly, yeast cells were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C and then washed with PBS to remove unbound yeast. The cells were then resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 10^5 cells/ml, and then mixed with YPD medium. The mixture was incubated for 48 h at 30 °C in the dark. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min, and then washed with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in PBS and subjected to RT-PCR. The gene for the cDNA synthesis was used to normalize the expression level of the gene for each strain. The C.


## Results

In order to evaluate the role of HapX in Cryptococcus infection, we performed a multi-gene genetic complementation analysis of HapX-R1 (i.e., HapX-R1-R1) and HapX-R2 (i.e., HapX-R2-R2) genes in Cryptococcus neoformans infection. The complementation analysis was carried out using the corresponding best complementation gene, HapX-R2, in which the Tg(0) was replaced by a serine-proline-rich motif (Figure 1A). The results showed that the Tg(0) gene was strongly repressed in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain (Figure 1B). The comparison of Tg(0) and Tg(1) genes revealed that the Tg(1) gene was highly expressed in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain, whereas the Tg(0) gene was highly expressed in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain (Figure 1C). The expression of the HapX-R1-R2 gene in the cryptococcal infection strain was highly up-regulated by ~40-fold (Figure 1D). The result indicated that HapX and HapX-R2 genes were highly up-regulated by Cryptococcus neoformans infection in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain.

To analyze the expression of the Tg(0) gene in the HapX-R1-R2 strain, the expression of the HapX-R1-R2 gene was analyzed in Cryptococcus neoformans strain, and the results revealed that the Tg(0) gene was significantly induced by ~40-fold (Figure 1E). The expression of the Tg(1) gene was significantly up-regulated by ~60-fold (Figure 1E). The results indicated that the Tg(1) gene was highly expressed in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain.

To analyze the function of the Tg(0) gene in HapX-R2 strain, we performed a complementation analysis using the corresponding best complementation gene, HapX-R2. The results showed that the Tg(0) gene was repressed in the Cryptococcus neoformans infection strain (Figure 1F).


## Discussion
infection in Cryptococcus neoforman.

C. neoformans is a potent and virulent agent that has the potential to cause severe disease in humans. The prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans infections in children is estimated to be approximately 40% [39]. The major risk factor for the development of Cryptococcus infections is the use of immunosuppressant drugs, such as rifampicin [40]. Cryptococcus spp. are often the causative agents of pulmonary infections in children and adults. Cryptococcus spp. have been associated with increasing prevalence of cryptococcosis in HIV-positive adults [41]. The development of cryptococcal infection has been linked to the development of symptoms in many immunocompromised patients, including patients with hematologic malignancies, organ transplants, solid organ transplants and those with immunosuppressive treatment [42-44]. Cryptococcus spp. are also responsible for the development of chronic pulmonary infections in HIV-positive children [45]. The incidence of chronic pulmonary cryptococcosis has been reported to be 1.4% in the immunocompromised population [45]. Chronic pulmonary cryptococcosis is caused by Cryptococcus spp. [45].

Type IV secretion of type IV secretion was induced during infection with Cryptococcus neoformans in this study. In contrast to the response of type IV secretion in Cryptococcus spp., no secretion of type IV secretion was induced during infection with Cryptococcus spp.

C. neoformans hypoxia-responsiveness was induced during Cryptococcus spp. infection in this study. This was previously reported in an experimental murine cryptococcosis model, where mice were immunosuppressed and immunosuppressed with fluconazole or caspofungin [46]. C. neoformans also induces the secretion of a variety of proteins from Cryptococcus spp., such as extracellular adhesion molecule (EAM), proteinases, phospholipase A, endo-1,3-ß-glucanase, and phospholipase B [47]. However, the levels of the phospholipase A were low in Cryptococcus spp.
