## Abstract
Fungal infections are life-threatening infections, but remain a major cause of exclusion in most health care systems, and need urgent and appropriate investigation to avoid the unacceptable mortality rates observed in resource-limited settings. Few published reports have explored the host response to fungal infection. Here we present a review of the response of Candida albicans to four common antifungal agents: 1) broad-spectrum, broad-spectrum deoxy- and azoles, and flucytosine; 2) broad-spectrum, broad-spectrum deoxy- and azoles, and other agents; 3) multiplex antifungal agent administration; and 4) amphotericin B, oral swab, and blood cultures. Of the 30 patients with cultures positive from all four agents, 28% were HIV-infected and 13.5% had received intranasal empiric therapy. At the end of treatment, Candida was more likely to present a negative serum test, be orally swabbed, and be blood culture positive than to have markedly increased susceptibility. We conclude that antifungal therapy with multiple agents, especially amphotericin, is ineffective in preventing and treating invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis. Amphotericin-resistant Candida should be actively investigated to avoid similar outcomes in patients already receiving antifungal therapy for other conditions.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is a common opportunistic infection in the CNS, accounting for 15% of all cases of meningitis [1].


## Methods
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Araraquara, and a gold standard was established for the identification of infectious agents and infectious disease.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult patients (aged =18 years) were recruited from the medical wards of the University Hospital of Araraquara, Araraquara, Argentina. They were infected with HIV using a previously described method [33] and had no known infectious disease prior to enrollment into the study. According to the previous report [35], HIV-infected adults and children were identified from our previous study [36] with slight modifications. The number of infected individuals was limited to 5 per the geographical region of origin. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Araraquara, and a gold standard was established for the identification of infectious agents and infectious diseases.

The infectious disease burden of the patients was also determined using the Wright-Giemsa staining method [37] and the present study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Araraquara.

The study was conducted according to the recommendations of the Committee on the Ethics of Research of the University Hospital of Araraquara (CERADEA-UH), which has previously approved all of the clinical methods approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Araraquara, Argentina. The committee has since approved the use of our laboratory tests and all of the patient procedures.

Ethics statement
The research was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Human Subjects by the United Nations High Representative for Human Rights, Resolution 13-17/2007, and in accordance with the ethical principles outlined by the World Medical Association (MTA) (Protocol No. 18.5/2008).

Design, sample collection, and infection
The study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [38] with the exception that the blood sample was excluded from the study. The experiment was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the CLSI (CLSI Protocols 1.3.2.2 and 1.3.3.


## Results
In the present study, we identified . fumigatus as the most common opportunistic pathogen causing cryptococcal meningitis in children and adults. The pathogen has been reported as a potential source of systemic infection in the elderly and those with compromised immune system. In addition, there are several cases of patients with an apparent liver abscess in which the underlying organ is a very high risk of infection and the underlying tissue is not viable. The current data provide further evidence that an infectious agent could be the cause of death in a patient with an apparent liver abscess.

Isolation of A. fumigatus from blood samples
An isolate of A. fumigatus was isolated from a blood sample of a 3-year-old boy in whom the cause of death was a respiratory tract infection with an unknown etiological agent. All blood cultures, cultures, and cultures of the boy were normal. Two of the three blood cultures were normal (Figure 5). No obvious pathological signs were observed in the normal blood culture or in the blood culture of the 3-year-old boy. The PCR results are presented in Table 1.

A. fumigatus was isolated from a blood sample of a 3-year-old boy in whom the cause of death was an abdominal pain with a granulocytopenia, with no signs of bacterial infection, and a white staining of lymphadenopathy. The PCR results are presented in Table 2.

A. fumigatus was isolated from a blood sample of a 3-year-old boy in whom the cause of death was a urinary tract infection with an unknown etiological agent. The PCR results are presented in Table 3.

## Discussion
As infection can occur in any organ, even in immunocompromised patients, it is critical to avoid the use of these tests in order to improve the prognosis and avoid unnecessary treatment of infection. Although HIV disease is frequently reported in association with cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients, in recent years, cryptococcosis has been reported more frequently in immunocompromised patients, especially in Japan [9, 10]. In recent years, there have been several studies that suggested the existence of a relationship between HIV infection and cryptococcosis [6, 9]. The reasons for this association are unclear, but it is believed that the HIV infection can cause a local immune response that leads to cryptococcal meningitis [11].

In the present case, the patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the patient was diagnosed with cryptococcosis. The patient was treated with fluconazole 400 mg/day for 3 days, and then it was switched to voriconazole 400 mg/day for 8 days. Fluconazole 400 mg/day was discontinued for the maintenance phase of treatment. The patient was started on maintenance therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 3 days. The patient was treated with fluconazole 800 mg/day for 8 days. Then, the patient was started on second-line therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 4 days. The patient was switched to second-line therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 8 days. The patient was started on second-line therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 4 days. The patient was switched to second-line therapy with fluconazole 400 mg/day for 8 days. The patient was switched to third-line therapy with fluconazole 400 mg/day for 8 days.

In the present case, the patient was diagnosed with cryptococcosis in a patient with a history of HIV infection. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy and the patient was switched to fluconazole 400 mg/day for 8 days. Fluconazole 400 mg/day was then switched to voriconazole 400 mg/day for 8 days. The patient was switched to second-line therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 8 days.
