## Abstract
Monocyte-derived monocytes (MDCs), considered key cells of immunity in the peripheral blood of immunocompromised individuals, play a central role in regulating the development, control of connective tissue diseases, and cancer progression.


## Introduction
albicans

Spore production is a fundamental feature of Paracoccidioides pathogenesi. In the model organism C. albicans, the spore stage is a complex structure consisting of two discrete conidia and a spore cell. The conidia differentiate into germ tubes that differentiate into a germ tube phenotype. The spore cell forms a mature spore and the germ tube develops into a mature spore structure. The germ tube differentiation is dependent on the coordinated expression of the corresponding genes. For example, the genes coding for the proteins involved in germ tube differentiation in the model yeast S. cerevisiae are organized in a homologous gene cluster and they regulate the gene expression of these genes (45). These genes are involved in the development of the spore-specific germ tube (45). Differentiation between germ tubes and the germ tube phenotype is dependent on the genes for germ tube elongation, germ tube formation, and germ tube secretion (45). Differentiation is regulated by the expression of specific gene products and their regulatory functions (45). For example, the transcription factor ArrTS plays a role in the transcription of the genes for germ tube elongation and the genes for the spore cell differentiation genes (45).

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of germ tube differentiation in Paracoccidioides, we analyzed the effect of the antifungal drug fluconazole on germ tube development. The antifungal activity of fluconazole was found to be inhibited by three distinct mechanisms, namely, low affinity affinity binding to ergosterol and pheromone, interference of the morphological transition from the yeast to the filamentous phase, and inhibition of hyphal growth (45). These mechanisms are dependent on the interaction of antifungal drugs with fungal sterols, and consequently the drug-induced formation of hydrophobic pores. In addition, we also investigated the role of the inhibition of germinal growth by the antifungal drug FLC. FLC inhibits the growth of yeast cells by binding with the ergosterol, leading to the inhibition of germinal growth (45). In addition, we analyzed the antibacterial activity of FLC, which is an important drug in the treatment of bacterial infections (45).


## Methods
brasiliensis . niger
The organism of species Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was obtained from the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (CBS-KNAW, Kiel, Germany) and described in detail in our previous publication [15]. Spore production was performed by growing spores on a malt extract agar (MEA) (yeast extract 3 g/liter, peptone 2 g/liter, glucose 20 g/liter, agar 20 g/liter, and bactopeptone 20 g/liter) at 28 °C for 24 h.

In order to identify the spores as their natural hosts, the spores were collected and cultured on MEA and incubated at 28 °C. The spores were then collected and re-suspended in water, and the fungal spores were counted. The samples of P. brasiliensis grown in MEA were used as controls to determine the effective number of spores, and the number of spores was confirmed using a Neubauer chamber.

For spore production, the spores were resuspended in water and mixed, and then the conidia were extracted by incubation on MEA, and the spores were suspended in water. The samples of P. brasiliensis grown in MEA were used as controls to determine the effective number of spores, and the number of spores was confirmed using a Neubauer chamber.

DNA extraction and PCR amplification
DNA was isolated and purified using a protocol similar to that used for the fungal extraction [12]. The primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used to amplify part of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (LSU). The primers ITS3 (White et al. 1990) and ITS4 (Yu and Rybicki 2006) were used to amplify part of the small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 45 s at 72 °C and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were visualized on 0.


## Results
s., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis R. aculeatus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis W. anomalus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A. niger, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa as potential new pathogenic fungi in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. These genera are known as potential pathogenic fungi of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and the pathogenic fungi of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis L. sp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A. niger, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis W. anomalus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A. niger, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa, that could potentially be pathogenic. In addition, we identified two novel fungi (P. fimbriata and P. zimbabii) that were previously described as being pathogenic as a result of the operation of the various bimolecular mechanisms of action (25). We further analyzed the genomes of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis L. sp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis R. aculeatus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis W. anomalus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A. niger, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A. niger, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa, and found that all these fungi had lost the ability to utilize bimolecular mechanisms to cause disease in either healthy human hosts or in natural hosts. The key finding of the present study was that the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis L. sp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis R. aculeatus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis W. anomalus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis N. crassa, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis A.


## Discussion
albicans occurs in the absence of the capsule, leading to the hypothesis that . albicans lacks the capsule. The conidial germination of C. albicans involves the transfer of virulence factors, including the capsule. In addition, the capsule contains a signaling signal, a protein called "cysteine-rich protein 1 (CRP1), which plays an important role in the morphogenesis and pathogenesis of C. albicans, including virulence in mice [25]. The CRP1 gene is important for the development of C. albicans [25]. In addition, the C. albicans virulence pathway is similar to that of C. neoformans. However, C. albicans and C. neoformans are genetically different [26]. Although C. albicans is a pathogen in humans and C. neoformans is a saprophyte, it is found in different body sites [27]. Although C. albicans is the predominant fungal pathogen, it is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients [28]. The C. albicans genome encodes approximately 20,000 genes [29]. The genome of C. albicans contains 1,857 genes [30]. In addition, the genome of C. albicans contains 2,869 genes [31]. The genome of C. neoformans contains 1,242 genes [32]. The genome of C. albicans contains 1,103 genes [33]. The genome of C. neoformans contains 1,290 genes [34]. The genome of C. albicans contains 1,445 genes [35].

C. albicans is a opportunistic pathogen in humans, but the pathogenic role of C. albicans remains unknown [36]. The association of C. albicans with humans has been reported [36]. C. albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, and the pathogenic role of C. albicans has been reported [36]. C. albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen in immunocompetent individuals and immunocompetent patients [37]. In our study, we observed that C.
