## Abstract
The use of antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infections (OIs) remain major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome(HIV/AIDS). The use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in HIV-infected patients is associated with a significantly lower risk of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of OIs among HIV-infected patients and to determine risk factors for these infections.

This study was a retrospective chart review of HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients from November 2016 to September 2017.

369 HIV-infected patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and the incidence of candiduria was 11.3% (IC 95% 0.5% to 20.1%). The prevalence of non-Candiduria candiduria was 2.9% (IC 95% 0.3% to 4.3%). The most common OIs were cryptococcal meningitis (36.4%), sepsis (25.5%), hepatitis C (19.6%), toxoplasmosis (5.9%), lymphocytic meningitis (3.7%), and hematologic malignancies (3.9%). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were 3.4% (IC 95% 0.7% to 10.9%) and 10.3% (IC 95% 0.6% to 17.4%), respectively. The incidence of all other infections was 9.3% (IC 95% 0.6% to 20.6%).

Among HIV-infected patients, the prevalence of non-Candiduria candiduria was higher than Candida spp. Most of the infections were systemic, i.e.


## Introduction
Many plant species are rich sources of bioactive bioactive ingredients, which play important roles in modern medicine [1]. The natural chemical composition of natural products is a complex mixture of organic, inorganic and inorganic compounds. The use of plant extracts and their pharmacological activities is an important way to find bioactive natural products. However, there is an increasing tendency to discover natural products, which are heterogeneous, complex and often complicated [2,3].

The study of natural products has been mainly based on traditional ethnobotanical studies, based on the knowledge of botany, chemistry and pharmacology. Among the traditionally used in the health care setting, plants are known to be rich sources of bioactive natural products [4]. However, few studies are available that specifically explore the ethnobotanical components of plants.

The ethnobotanical studies are mainly focused on traditional herbs, which are commonly grown in different regions of the world. In this study, the ethnobotanical composition of different herbs is mainly focused on the main ethnobotanical herbs grown in the different regions of the world, and their main pharmacological activities are discussed. The ethnobotanical activities of essential oils (EOs) and their extracts are discussed. The search for natural products is also presented in several supplementary reports. In addition, some secondary metabolites, which are bioactivities of major bioactive ingredients, are discussed. The present study aims to explore the ethnobotanical activities and bioactivity profiles of EOs and their main components.

Piper nigrum, which is native in the Mediterranean region, is a common and abundant plant.


## Methods
Plant Materials
Leaves of Arthrobacter-resistant isolate were collected from a field in Malaya, Thailand, in April 2013. The plant was identified and voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Rural Development, Thailand. The voucher specimens were kept in a refrigerator at 4°C during the year. The voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of the Herbarium of the Institute of Botany, University of Malaya, Malaysia.

Microscopic and Photographs
For the microscopic and spectroscopic observations, the leaf samples were soaked in 0.2% (w/v) potassium persulfate (PWS) for 24 h and then washed in distilled water for 5 min, in order to remove residual water. The specimens were then observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan) at a magnification of ×1 000×.

For the study, a leaf sample was taken from the bottom of the leaf with a flatbed microscope (Olympus BX51) and the specimen was then observed under a light microscope at ×1 000×.

For the study, a leaf sample was dipped in 0.

## Discussion
[2]

The current study has a high degree of specificity and reproducibility compared to previous studie. The results are highly reproducible and provide important information for clinicians and animal owners alike. The current study has a significant impact on the field of histoplasmosis research in dogs, and the results will be used to guide future studies of histoplasmosis in dogs.

With the current study, we developed a new method of histoplasmosis diagnosis in dogs with severe disease. The results showed that histoplasmosis diagnosis in dogs with severe disease is highly accurate, as well as reproducible. The diagnostic criteria used in this study were similar to those previously described for dogs with severe disease. [1]

The clinical characteristics of the patients in the current study were similar to those of previous studies. Although there was a high degree of similarity, the differences between these studies were mainly related to different geographical regions and conditions of the study. In addition, there were few differences in the two main clinical features of the dogs and dogs with histoplasmosis. [2]

There were a few differences in the type and duration of the disease. The duration of histoplasmosis was mainly determined after 6 months of follow-up in the current study. This may be related to the difference in clinical characteristics of the dogs and dogs in the study. There were several differences in the types and duration of the disease. The dogs in the current study had shorter disease duration than dogs in previous studies. [2] The dogs in the current study had shorter disease duration than dogs in previous studies. [2] There were several differences in the types of lesions and the severity of disease. The dogs in the current study had a high degree of histoplasmosis lesion, whereas dogs in the previous study had a low degree of histoplasmosis lesion. [2] The dogs in the current study had a lower degree of histoplasmosis lesion than dogs in the previous study. [2] The dogs in the previous study had a higher degree of histoplasmosis lesion than the dogs in the current study. [2]

The histoplasmosis lesion in dogs was diagnosed by histological examination and the patient’s condition improved with the addition of treatment.
