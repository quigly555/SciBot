## Abstract
Clinico Clinico Storiche Nazionali (IC), La Specie (T-ICALS) e Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Sanità (ST), e comune Istituto per la prevenzione delle varianti multiresistent.

Sono stati inclusi nella revisione della letteratura scientifica n. 63 del 2017 e n. 64 del 2018.

I criteri di letteratura sono stati identificati numerosità e standardizzati.

In totale 11/43 (56%) campioni hanno rilevato la presenza di polvere, di microrganismi multiresistenti, una riduzione media del 95.6% (n = 799) con una concentrazione pari a 38.7 (SD = 691) mm. I criteri di comparazione e qualitatività sono stati identificati numerosità e statisticamente significatività.

Sono stati identificati numerosità di cattiva di origineo sia terreno e/o terreno o il cibo occupazionale.

La concentrazione pari a 38.7 (SD = 630) mm è risulta ridotta, in quanto calcolare il mantenimento delle concentrazioni nella letteratura della letteratura scientifica, in quanto il mantenimento delle concentrazioni nella primavera.

Lo strumento ha permesso di individuare nel 2017 e 2018 la presenza di polvere a livello globale di una miscela di polvere a livello di strumenti consolidati su terreno e/o cattiva di origineo sia terreno, varianti da polvere a microrganismi multifattoriali e/o tetano, formando dal dicembre 2017 a livello europeo e dall’eventuale rilevazione collettiva.

Aspergillus fumigatus is an airborne, heterotrophic mold found ubiquitously in the environment (Seider et al., 2006). The fungus can cause diseases ranging from superficial mucosal or pulmonary infections to life-threatening invasive infections in immunocompromised patients (Seider et al., 2006; Adachi et al., 2012; Toole et al., 2012). In the past decade, Aspergillus infections have become an important cause of human infections and serious complications in immunocompromised patients (Malmuth and Miller, 2012). The growing incidence of Aspergillus infections has been linked to increased awareness of the fungus and the availability of antifungal drugs. However, an increasing number of Aspergillus-related infections have been reported from a few countries, such as Brazil (Singh et al., 2008; Ríos et al., 2009; Toole et al., 2012), China (Xu et al., 2012), India (Li et al., 2012), and China and Japan (Mehta et al., 2010).


## Methods
Strains and media
C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were cultured in YPD broth at 37°C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in sterile PBS. For fluconazole, 10 µg/ml was added to the culture and the suspension was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans were subcultured at 30°C for 24 h. The number of CFU/ml was determined by plating serial dilutions of the suspension on YPD agar. For fluconazole, 10 µg/ml was added to the culture and the suspension was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans were subcultured at 30°C for 24 h.

Fluconazole susceptibility testing
The susceptibility of C. albicans to fluconazole was determined by the fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans strain, C. albicans ATCC 90028. The susceptibility to fluconazole was determined by the previously reported method [53]. Briefly, C. albicans ATCC 90028 was cultured in YPD broth at 37°C for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Fluconazole-resistant cells were subcultured at 37°C for 24 h. The number of CFU/ml was determined by plating serial dilutions of the suspension on YPD agar. Fluconazole-resistant cells were subcultured at 30°C for 24 h.

Toxicity assays
C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were cultured in YPD broth at 37°C for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS and resuspended in sterile PBS.


## Results
In addition, . rubrum infections are rare in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory results are usually reliable. Antifungal agents have also been shown to cause necrosis in T. rubrum [12, 14]. The importance of T. rubrum infections in managing T. rubrum infections has been well established [15]. In this study, we have found that Cryptococcus neoformans infection in patients with T. rubrum infection is very rare, with a median of 20 patients (range, 12-30).

Tuberculosis Treatment and Clinical Features
In this study, four patients were treated with fluconazole and two with itraconazole (Table 1). Fluconazole was first started in two patients who had firstly received itraconazole and were then switched to fluconazole. Fluconazole was then continued in two patients who were switched to fluconazole and were then switched to itraconazole. Fluconazole and itraconazole were then continued in patients who were then switched to itraconazole. The patient who was switched to fluconazole was then switched to itraconazole. Fluconazole was then continued in two patients who were switched to fluconazole and were then switched to itraconazole. Finally, fluconazole and itraconazole were switched in two patients who were switched to fluconazole and were then switched to itraconazole. The patient who was switched to fluconazole was then switched to fluconazole.

The patient with fluconazole was found to have a severe fever and had a very low hemoglobin level, which was 100 mg/dL, as well as a high blood hemoglobin level, which was 70 mg/dL, which was 100 mg/dL. The patient who was switched to fluconazole was found to have a fever of 60.7%, and had a high blood hemoglobin level, which was 100 mg/dL. The patient with fluconazole was found to have a severe fever of 60.7%, and had a very low hemoglobin level, which was 100 mg/dL, which was 100 mg/dL.


## Discussion
rubrum in patients with mycobacterial infection.

The antifungal treatment was used in patients who received antifungal therapy or treatment with antifungal drugs. The effect of treatment on the fungal growth was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the results were in good agreement with previous studies by Maranhuyong et al. (2012).

In patients with mycobacterial infections, M. rubrum is a common opportunistic pathogen, causing disseminated disease (LDD) and anemia (ID). In addition to the disease process, tuberculosis and cryptococcosis are other related diseases that can be associated with the infection (Khan et al., 2013).

In this study, the antifungal treatment was used in patients who received antifungal drugs or in patients with tuberculosis.

In patients with HIV/AIDS, it is important to assess the clinical symptoms of patients with mycobacterial infection. The results of this study indicated that the antifungal treatment of this patient is safe and effective. The antifungal treatment of this patient is not associated with any other diseases, and the antifungal drug is safe and effective.

In patients with tuberculosis, the patient’s immune status was normal and his condition was improving. In addition, the patient had a good prognosis, and he did not have any previous history of tuberculosis. The result of this study indicated that the antifungal treatment is safe and effective.

In this study, the antifungal treatment was used in patients who received antifungal drugs or in patients with tuberculosis.
