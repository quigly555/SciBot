## Abstract
It is widely held that the emergence of non-neoformans Candida species as opportunistic pathogens has contributed to the evolution of a immune response. This is supported by the epidemiology of recent clinical cases of candidemia, which have revealed the occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We hypothesized that the evolution of the immune response to Candida species was influenced by the size of the human host population. We analyzed Candida clinical and hospital data from the periods 2005-2010, to find out if IRIS was a clinical event or an IRIS epidemic.

We conducted a retrospective case control study.


## Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, rare and often lethal form of lymphohistiocytosis, which can occur in both hematologic and nonhematologic hosts [1]. It is characterized by the presence of scattered lymph nodes and occasionally granulomas [2]. In most cases, the initial diagnosis of HLH is usually based on clinical and radiographic features, such as malignant lymph node enlargement, tumor-like structures, hypokalemia, and absent clinical signs or symptoms [3-6]. However, certain predisposing factors can predispose patients to HLH, such as coagulation, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppressive drugs [7]. In this review, we will focus on the role of cytokines in the etiology of HLH, focusing on our current understanding of their pathogenesis.


## Methods
The first experiment with the blood samples was carried out in a MBC positive (sera) and an MBC negative (measured with a BSA assay) (S4 Text. The second experiment was carried out in a MBC positive (sera) and an MBC negative (measured with a BSA assay) (S4 Text). In the third experiment, the blood samples were also analyzed, and the blood samples were also analyzed, using the blood sample level of the MBC as a reference, for the MBC levels.

The previous experiment (H_2O_2 test) was used to determine the MBCs of the whole blood samples. The MBCs (100 µL) of the whole blood samples were inoculated on SDA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, MBCs were extracted from the plate using the same method as described above and then the MBCs (100 µL) were added on SDA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, MBCs were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. The MBCs (100 µL) were then used to quantify the MBCs according to the method of this study (E-MTAB-3A).

The results of the previous experiment (Diabatic DNA extraction) were analyzed using the method described by Eloff (2000) and the MBCs of the whole blood samples were also analyzed.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
To evaluate the MBCs in the whole blood samples, the first experiment with the blood samples was performed using the qPCR method. The following set of MBCs were evaluated: the MBCs (100 µL) of the whole blood samples were added on SDA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the MBCs (100 µL) of the whole blood samples were mixed, and then the MBCs (100 µL) of the whole blood samples were combined.


## Results
The genomes of the isolates included in this study were derived from the . mellonella and P. blakesleeanus species complex. Both strains were obtained from the P. blakesleeanus species complex. The growth of the strains in synthetic media was monitored daily for two weeks. The strains were grown in either liquid and synthetic media for one month or for the remaining 2 weeks. The strains were also grown in the presence of 1% methanol. After 3 months, a colony was observed (Figure 5A) but it was difficult to detect any difference in the colony color of the strains in either liquid or synthetic media. It is possible that the strains of P. blakesleeanus do not have specific growth phenotypes that are linked with the presence of acetaldehyde in their growth media. In addition, the colonies of P. blakesleeanus are not a typical oval-shaped shape, which can be indicative of a post-harvest disease. The growth of the P. blakesleeanus strains in synthetic media is consistent with the observation that acetaldehyde is not present in the culture medium of P. blakesleeanus.

The results of the experiment were compared with the sequencing results, with the aim to identify putative fungal genes that could be affected by acetaldehyde in the culture medium. The results of the experiment are summarised in Table 3. The number of fungal genes identified in the experiment (18) was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05). The number of fungal genes identified in the experiment was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05). The mean number of genes in the experiment was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05). The number of genes identified in the experiment was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05). The differences in the numbers of fungal genes in the experiment are in agreement with the results of the experiment. The number of fungal genes identified in the experiment was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05). The number of genes in the experiment was significantly higher than that in the sequencing results (6) (P<0.05).


## Discussion
The results of the current study are illustrated in Fig . In this study, we used the 1425×GE and 454×GE reads from the HMMER server to identify the species and taxonomic affiliation of the species, and also to distinguish between the two types of species, as described in previous studies [1, 2, 10, 11]. For species identification, we chose the strain M. sympodialis, a novel species from a different fungal community in Antarctica. M. sympodialis is a typical species in a broad range of taxonomic groups, including species of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, which are difficult to obtain from the traditional methods. Therefore, we used a 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to identify M. sympodialis as the species. The results obtained with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy have the advantage of being applicable in higher organisms, such as fungi, and can be used to identify and classify a species of species of fungi and to identify and classify species of basidiomycetes. This approach can also be used for the determination of the taxonomic status of species of fungi, such as M. sympodialis.

M. sympodialis was originally identified as Cryptococcus gattii, but the genus M. sympodialis is now known to be a monotypic genus of basidiomycetes. Based on the morphology of the basidiomycete, this species has been placed into the clade Cryptococcus gattii, which includes species of Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii, and C. deuterogattii. Furthermore, M. deuterogattii is also a genus of basidiomycetes, which is closely related to M. sympodialis. Therefore, we also evaluated the 18S rRNA gene sequencing profiles and compared them with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiles in the genus Cryptococcus.

The results of the current study demonstrate the successful use of the M. deuterogattii strain H99-A2 for the species identification and species identification of M. sympodialis.
