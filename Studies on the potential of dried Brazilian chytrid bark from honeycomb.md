## Abstract
The availability of new antimicrobial agents from natural sources has given rise to several microorganism production methods. These include bioactive molecules, natural molecules, and synthetic biologicals. The antimicrobial potential of non-traditional antimicrobial delivery methods could be considered as a plus here. These include the oenological, cytotoxic, antimicrobials, antimicrobial resistance, and the toxicology of the most popular drug class, amiodarone. These include antibiotics, biocompromised systems, and immunosuppressants. An essential interest in bioactive molecules like polyenes, flavonoids, triterpenes, and amino acids, could be considered. This review gives an overview of the main research on antimicrobial drugs and other natural sources. The potency and productivity of these natural sources could be considered as a plus. They include, but are not limited to, antibiotics, biocompromised systems, tetracyclines, peptides, and peptides of the drug class, amiodarone.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are a growing problem, especially in immunocompromised patients and patients with implanted medical devices, in which Candida species are the most common species, accounting for about half of all Candida species in the bloodstream and about 10-20% of all Candida infections. Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans are the most common species, with Candida glabrata being the most common. However, these pathogens can cause bloodstream infections that can be fatal. Candida spp. are often associated with hospital wards, and are highly identified as opportunistic pathogens, capable of causing a variety of serious diseases. The condition is most commonly characterized as candidiasis, and the clinical manifestations are often asymptomatic.


## Methods

2.4. Fungal Cultivation
The bark of Eucalyptus cv. Citrus was inoculated with 200 g of dried chytrid bark by placing the chytrid powder on a petri dish (45 mm, 10 g of wet weight). The bark was poured on the surface of a sterile Petri dish (70 mm, 15 ml of lactic acid). After 24 h, the petri dish was vacuum-filtered to remove the bark. The collected bark was then transferred to the nutrient agar (NA) medium. The yeast cells were maintained at room temperature (28°C) and examined daily.

2.5. Lipid Extraction
The lipids were extracted from the dried dried bark using a micrOTOF® Plant Fractionation System (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). In brief, the ethanol extract (2 mL) was mixed with petroleum ether (10.0 mL) to give a final volume of 200 µl of the ethanol extract (30.0 g of ethanol, 50.0 g of petroleum ether and 1.0 mL of d-ether) (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). The mixture was then placed in a centrifuge (45,000 rpm for 15 min) for the extraction of the cellulose fraction (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). The solvent was removed after the centrifuge. The lipids (100 µL) were transferred to a microfuge tube and centrifuged (15,000 rpm for 10 min) to separate the fatty acids from the solvent fraction. The lipid extracts were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using a TLC plate (TLC 3T Silica Gel 60F254, TLC 5.8% TLC) (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) in solvent B (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) for 3 h. The final lipid concentration of the crude oil was determined by the HPLC method, which was carried out with a Shimadzu HPLC-5.


## Results
In order to evaluate the potential of this species for storage of dried Brazilian chytrid bark, we investigated the potential of this species to enhance the yield of honey and honey product.

The honey products were prepared by using a high concentration of water (10%) in a preparation tank of a commercial honey combiner (R-9) and were also shown to have a high yield of honey. The honey products were stored for a period of 12 months in the rain forest before being transported to a storage facility.

3.3. In Vitro Bioactivity
The in vitro activity of the three tested species was compared by using the LC-MS/MS method. The concentration of different antifungal compounds was determined by using the LC-MS/MS method with the concentration values ranging from 0.01 to 0.4 mg/mL.


## Discussion
The aim of this study was to assess the phytochemical composition of the fractions obtained from L. quercophila and the contents of the obtained compounds in the respective fractions. The results showed that the relative contents of the fractions are significantly different. The total monosaccharides of the fractions were higher than the total monosaccharides of the extracts. The results of the study conducted by Zhang et al. (2015) showed that the main components of the fractions are sulfur, glycerides and phenols. In this study, the main components of the fractions are glycerol and acetate. The main components of the extracts are acetate and isoprenoid. The main components of the extracts are isoprenoid and ferulic acid.

The present study showed that the major components of the fractions are: (1) isoprenoid, (2) ferulic acid, (3) isoprenoid, (4) ferulic acid, (5) isoprenoid, and (6) ferulic acid. The main constituents of the fractions are isoprenoid, ferulic acid and ferulic acid. The major constituents of the fractions are: isoprenoid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid.

The present study also showed that the total components of the fractions were higher than the total compounds of the samples. The main components of the fractions are: (1) isoprenoid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid. The main components of the fractions are: (1) isoprenoid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid.

The present study also revealed that the main components of the fractions are: (1) isoprenoid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid.
