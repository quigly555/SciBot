## Abstract
The prevalence of CD4+ T-cell lymphomas in patients with AIDS has been increasing over the last years. However, the relationship between CD4+ T-cell lymphomas and the host immune response remains largely unknown.

We present a case of a 40-year-old African woman with AIDS who presented CD4+ T-cell lymphoma after the operation of the Vestirapneumothri attached to the optic neurone. The patient presented with symptoms and signs of AIDS, which were thought to be of peripheral immunodeficiency. However, the histopathological examination of the lesion revealed that the fibrosis had spread to other sites, including the skin and the lungs.

The treatment with voriconazole, which was well tolerated, led to the resolution of the lesions.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Antifungal agents, such as the azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins, have been the mainstay of antifungal therapy for over two decades. As the mechanisms involved in the resistance to the azoles remain unclear, a better understanding of the azole-based therapeutic strategy is required.

The azoles are an ubiquitous class of antifungal agents that are classically used in the treatment of fungal diseases. Among them, the echinocandins are most commonly used in the clinic due to their excellent activity, low toxicity, and minimal drug-drug interactions. The echinocandins are classically used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis. The echinocandins are also used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections, including those caused by Blastomyces, Fusarium, and Penicillium [1].

The echinocandins are classified into two main groups: the first group comprises echinocandins that inhibit fungal cell growth by binding to the heme-binding protein CCL3 and are classically used in the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous fungal infections [2, 3]. The second group comprises echinocandins that inhibit the fungal cell growth by inhibiting cell wall ß-glucans and by inhibiting ß-glucans-1-phosphate-binding protein (ß-BGPP) and its ligand EPPG [4, 5].

Acanthamoeba spp. are an important opportunistic fungal pathogens that can cause a wide range of diseases including cutaneous and mucocutaneous mycoses, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis, and mucormycosis [6]. However, a more extensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between echinocandins and the fungal cell wall is necessary. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions of echinocandins and fungal cell wall by demonstrating the presence of an in vitro cell wall chaperone in vitro.


## Methods
In order to investigate the effect of the sexual morphological changes on the growth of the host plant, the fungus, which is divided into four classes, was cultivated in the same potting soil, which was divided into two parts, and the mycelium was harvested and transferred into fresh pots of the same po. The surface of the treated soil was cleaned with sterilized tap water and the mycelium was transferred into fresh pots. The soil was kept at a temperature of -20°C. After the mycelium was harvested, the mycelium was extracted with 100% EtOH, and the resulting extract was filtered with 0.22 µm filter. The extracts were dried at 60°C for 48 h. The dried extracts were dissolved in methanol and then diluted with distilled water to obtain the final concentrations of 1.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mg/mL, respectively. The concentrated extracts were dissolved in methanol, and then, the solutions were stirred for 10 min at room temperature and then cooled down to room temperature. The solutions were then filtered and dried in a speed vacuum, and then, the filtered extracts were dried in a speed vacuum and then diluted with distilled water to obtain the final concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 0.8, 0.11, 0.15, 0.25, 0.33, 0.38, 0.50, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, and 0.75, respectively.

The fungus, which is divided into three classes, was cultivated in the same potting soil, which was divided into two parts, and the mycelium was harvested and transferred into fresh pots of the same pot. The mycelium was harvested and then, the mycelium was extracted with 100% EtOH, and the extracts were filtered with 0.22 µm filter. The dried extracts were dissolved in methanol and then, the filtered extracts were dissolved with distilled water and then, the solutions were stirred for 10 min at room temperature and then cooled down to room temperature.


## Results
The bacterial diversity of the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with the human fungal pathogen Rhizopus oryzae is shown in Fig . In total, 24% of the seed bacteria were isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae. The soil microbial communities were dominated by Streptomyces spp., Rhodotorula spp., and Saccharomyces spp. (Table 1).

In addition, soil microbial diversity in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae was highly diverse (Table 1). In the soil-associated fungi, we found that a large proportion (68%) of the total seed bacteria were affiliated with Proteobacteria (R. oryzae) (Table 1). Among the bacterial communities, we observed that the soil microbial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, which was dominant in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae (Table 1). However, the soil microbial community was dominated by a smaller proportion of other soil-associated bacteria (Table 1).

The overall bacterial diversity in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae was similar to the soil-associated fungi associated with other fungal pathogens (Table 1). The total bacterial diversity in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae was similar to the soil-associated fungi associated with other fungal pathogens (Table 1). The fungal community of Rhizopus oryzae was dominated by Ascomycete genera, such as Bionectriaceae, Capnodiales, and Flavobacteriaceae. The soil microbial communities were dominated by genus Aspergillus and genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Penicillium, and Alternaria. The soil microbial community was dominated by genus Alternaria, with the highest levels in Alternaria sp. and Penicillium sp. (Table 1).

In addition, the total bacterial diversity in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae was similar to the soil-associated fungi associated with other fungi (Table 1). The total bacterial diversity in the soil-associated fungi associated with Rhizopus oryzae was similar to the soil-associated fungi associated with other fungi (Table 1).


## Discussion

In the present study, three pathogenic fungi associated with the human fungal pathogens . capsulatum and P. kudriavzevii were isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi. H. capsulatum, associated with the human fungal pathogen H. capsulatum, was previously reported as a pathogen in humans [1, 2, 7]. P. kudriavzevii is a pathogen of wheat and is currently associated with the wheat tree pathogen H. capsulatum in Australia [2, 7]. A study has also found H. capsulatum was able to infect rice and barley plants in Papua New Guinea [28]. In the present study, two isolates of H. capsulatum were isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with H. capsulatum and one isolate from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with H. capsulatum and H. capsulatum-H. capsulatum.

The genus Pseudomonadales is a large family of fungi, which includes plant pathogenic and saprophytic fungi [29]. The genus Pseudomonas has been used in several studies as a valuable phylogenetic tool and as a species identification tool [30, 31]. This genus has been isolated from a number of mangrove-occurring fungi, including Fusarium species, Ochroconis species, and C. capsulatum [31]. These fungi have been shown to be pathogenic to human and animal hosts [32, 33]. The fungi associated with the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with H. capsulatum and P. kudriavzevii have also been isolated from other mangrove-occurring fungi. For example, one isolate of H. capsulatum was isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with the human fungal pathogen H. capsulatum [32]. The same fungus was isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with the human fungal pathogen H. capsulatum [32]. The same fungus was isolated from the mangrove-occurring fungi associated with the human fungal pathogen H. capsulatum [32]. H. capsulatum has been isolated from several different fungal species, including the human fungal pathogens P. kudriavzevii, P. brasiliensis, and H.
