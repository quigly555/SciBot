## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans and animals. The C. gattii genome contains a mutation known as the “Cg mutation” that causes G-CSF protein (GSP) mutations that affect cryptococcal virulence. Here, we examined the role of this mutation in C. gattii. By comparing a large number of C. gattii clinical isolates, we found that a mutation in the A allele of the gene encoding the GSP-GFP (Abs 1, 14), rather than G-CSF homologous recombination (Abs 15), played a significant role in the growth and virulence of C. gattii. Deletion of the GSP-GFP mutation also led to defects in cell wall integrity, melanin synthesis, and a defect in the formation of extracellular matrix. Moreover, we found that the A allele of the gene encoding the GSP-GFP (Abs 15) confers resistance to heat stress and increases the stability of the cell. These results suggest that the GSP-GFP gene is involved in the regulation of the cell integrity response in C. gattii. Overall, the results demonstrate that the cryptococcal virulence factors GSP-GFP and A2 are overexpressed during the infection of humans and that resistance to these stresses is acquired by exposure to stress.


## Introduction
The genus Acaromyces, with its various species, was first proposed by Tode in 1831 and is divided into three subspecies, Acar., Acar., and Acai. Acaromyces species are usually characterized by large basidiomata with visible or subcutaneous stroma, hymenophoral hyphal cells and pseudoparenchyma. These species are distinguished by a conspicuous septation of mitochondria, in contrast to the larger hyphal cells and cell wall, which are pseudoparenchyma and absent in Acariycetes. The genus was separated from Acar by Tode and co-workers (1831, 1831) and now comprises species that are morphologically similar but can be differentiated in species-specific terms (t). In the acariycetes, the subcutaneous stroma is dominant and the hyphal cells are restricted to the ventricles of the stromata. In the acariycetes, the stromatic and ventricles are separated, whereas in the acariidomycetes, the stroma are dominated by the presence of the yeast cells (in contrast to the hyphal cells).


## Methods
The sequencing of the PCR product and the analysis of the size-selected barcodes was performed by PCR with primer pair pks1-up and pks1-down (Table 1. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR product was sequenced by the same company (Genewiz, Kraków, Poland) using the same primer pair (Table 1). The sequences obtained were checked by Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained were further compared with the sequences of the closely related species B. cinerea, and for comparison of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of B. cinerea, we used the primers ITS4 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS5 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') [28].

The ITS sequences of B. cinerea were compared with the sequences of the closely related species B. cinerea (Table 1). The sequences of B. cinerea were also compared with the sequences of B. cinerea and B. pulex [30]. The sequences of B. cinerea were also compared with the sequences of the closely related species B. cinerea and B. cinerea.

The procedure for phylogenetic analysis was conducted according to the method of Gascuel et al. [31]. The nucleotide sequences of the species B. cinerea were compared with the sequences of B. cinerea using the ITS sequences of the closely related species B. cinerea and B. cinerea.

Phenotype of B. cinerea
The production of C. albicans yeast was checked by inoculating 10 ml of conical flasks containing 5 ml of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium with B. cinerea. The contents of the flasks were then filtered and the C. albicans cell mass was determined by light microscopy. The D1/D2 domains of the C. albicans protein kinase were determined by the method of Bligh and Dyer [32].

Analysis of the morphology of the C. albicans cells
The 3D structure of the cells was determined by the method of Zhao et al. [33].


## Results
aeruginosa.

To test whether the putative Trx2 was functional in vivo, we used a growth assay in which Trx2-mediated CRM and CRM-induced cytokines were measured as described previously [15]. The levels of Trx2 in the cytoplasm of GFP-transformed P. aeruginosa cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after 24 h of incubation, and Trx2-induced cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by western blotting. In the absence of Trx2, the levels of Trx2 were lower than in the presence of CRM or CRM-induced cytokines. In the presence of CRM, Trx2-induced cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower than in the absence of CRM. We also found that in the presence of CRM, the T-DNA was present in a highly non-specific manner (Figure 4A). In contrast, the T-DNA was present in a highly specific manner in a high-copy manner in the absence of CRM (Figure 4B). Thus, the T-DNA is present in a highly specific manner in a highly specific manner in both the presence and absence of CRM.

The T-DNA is present in a highly specific manner in the absence of CRM
We next wanted to investigate if the T-DNA was present in a highly specific manner in the absence of CRM. To do this, we transformed recombinant T-DNA into the GFP-transformed P. aeruginosa strain (Figure 5A) and analyzed the growth and cytokine production in the absence and in the presence of CRM. We found that the T-DNA was present in a highly specific manner in both the absence and the presence of CRM (Figure 5B). In the presence of CRM, the T-DNA was present in a highly specific manner in a highly specific manner in a highly specific manner in both the presence and absence of CRM. We also found that the T-DNA was present in a highly specific manner in a highly specific manner in a highly specific manner in both the presence and absence of CRM. These results suggest that the T-DNA is present in a highly specific manner in the absence of CRM and in a highly specific manner in both the presence and absence of CRM.


## Discussion
The F4/80-luciferase gene pool was also used in the design of the F6/80-luciferase gene pool for F6/80-cis-luciferase and F7/80-cis-luciferase genes [66. The second gene pool was developed using the original pool of genes from the F6/80-cis-luciferase pool [33], which has the dual domain activity, and a unique domain architecture. The other genes were designed using a pool of genes from the F6/80-cis-luciferase pool [33]. A total of 4,034 genes were selected for further gene design by Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, which were predicted to be involved in the degradation of the cysteine intermediate, ergosta-5,6-triphosphate and glutamine. The main gene models were putative and each gene was expressed on the basis of two independent experiments.

To further evaluate the function of the F7/80-cis-luciferase gene pool, a pool of 5,259 genes was constructed using the F7 gene pool and the G6/80-luciferase gene pool. The total gene numbers of F7 and F6/80-luciferase genes were 4,964 (9.25%) and 1,724 (6.33%), respectively, which were significantly higher than those obtained in other studies [65,66,67]. The highest gene number (1,724) was in the F6/80-cis-luciferase gene pool. The high gene number (1,667) was also observed in the F6/80-cis-luciferase pool. The presence of more than two genes (2,744) in the pool of genes from the F7 pool compared with the pool of genes from the F6 pool indicates that the F7 gene pool contains a significant number of genes with high expression. The gene number was higher in the F7 pool compared with that of the pool of genes from the F6 pool compared with that of genes from the F6 pool.
