## Introduction
Amino acid oxidase (MAO), a member of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily, catalyzes the oxidative and purifying reaction of glutathione peroxidases. It is present in all living organisms, and its primary function is to oxidize dead organic substrates, thus bypassing the oxidizing glutathione and consequent cellular damage [1]. In bacteria, MAO activity is involved in the oxidative metabolism of free radicals, which can have toxic side-effects such as mitochondrial metal toxicity and hydrogen peroxide production, and hence the use of antioxidant defense systems is emphasized [2,3]. In yeast, MAO is expressed as a pro-oxidant protein, resulting in the accumulation of ROS [4]. In eukaryotes, two types of MAOs are described: superoxide anion-dependent MAO and the non-oxidative, pro-oxidant MAO. Superoxide anion oxidases (SAsO) are among the most widely studied enzymes involved in the electron transfer and scavenging processes. They are involved in a wide range of physiological reactions, including photosynthesis, microorganism metabolism, energy production, metabolic processes, immune responses, oxidative stress, cell membrane permeability, signal transduction, and cell apoptosis [5,6,7]. In this review, we describe the role of MAO in the electron transport, the redox potential and the antioxidant defense mechanisms of eukaryotic cells.


## Methods
Both clinical manifestations were found in the patients treated at the Faculty of Pathology, the University of São Paulo, and at the Instituto Preto de Medicina-Mujejun, Sao Paulo State University, Brazi. The patients were identified as HIV-positive and were treated with antifungal therapy according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Medical Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, Brazil.

2.2. Clinical and Ethical Considerations
Clinical laboratory results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The clinical manifestations of clinical illness were recorded as the median (range) and the interquartile range (IQR). The laboratory results were recorded as the mean ± standard deviation. All the patients were monitored by a neurologist for the diagnosis of systemic mycosis. After the diagnosis of systemic mycosis, the patient was classified as hospitalized. The patient was evaluated in the Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory, University Hospital, University of São Paulo, Brazil.

2.3. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by the Clinical Laboratory of the Faculty of Pathology, University of São Paulo, as previously described [13]. Briefly, the antifungal susceptibility assay was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) [13].

2.4. Caspase-1 Assay
The Caspase-1 assay was performed as previously reported [14]. Briefly, the assay consists of the production of an insoluble matrix composed of Caspase-1 and Streptococcus pyogenes, the enzyme activity, and the quantity. Caspase-1 activity and quantity in C. pyogenes were measured using the amount of the extract [13].

2.5. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The MIC and MBC of the compounds were determined by the broth dilution method according to the CLSI document M27-A3 [15]. Briefly, the yeast suspensions (10^6/mL) were prepared in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) containing 1% (w/v) of the essential oil (2% w/v). The concentrations of the compounds were determined by the method of Reed and Muñoz [16].


## Results
The urinary tract infection was confirmed by endoscopy of the first trimester of the patient (Table 2. The patient presented with short bowel syndrome with prominent abscesses and a small intestinal obstruction, the presence of colitis, and a lesion in the upper right arm (Fig 1A). The patient was admitted for surgical examination at 3 weeks with auscultation, nephrology, and nephronemology. The diagnosis of a urinary tract infection was based on a computerized tomography (CT) of the right anterior vagina and pleural effusion in the right lower vagina (Fig 1B). The patient was admitted for a vaginal candidiasis in which the infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of the Southern blot and by radiography of the right lower vagina (Fig 1C). The patient was diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis by a PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left middle vagina (Fig 1D). The patient was admitted for an encephalitis in which the infection was confirmed by a PCR amplification of the PCR product of the left middle vagina (Fig 1E). The patient was admitted for a mucormycosis in which the infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left posterior vagina (Fig 1F). The patient was diagnosed with a mucormycosis in which the infection was confirmed by a PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left posterior vagina (Fig 1G). The patient was admitted for a urinary tract infection in which the infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left posterior vagina (Fig 1H). The patient was diagnosed with a mucormycosis in which the infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left posterior vagina (Fig 1I). The patient was admitted for a vaginal candidiasis in which the infection was confirmed by PCR amplification of the PCR product of the left middle vagina and PCR of the right posterior vagina (Fig 1J). The patient was diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis by a PCR amplification of the PCR product of the right anterior vagina and PCR of the left posterior vagina (Fig 1K).


## Discussion
Chronic cough and fever are symptoms of MRSA meningitis in both adults and children [5.

All infections reported in our patient were confirmed with direct microscopic examination of CSF. CSF analysis was negative in both cases and anemia was present in the patient's condition. The diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis was based on CSF microbiology, and the patient had a negative endoscopy and endoscopic examination. The patient had undergone a biopsy of the CSF. The patient had been treated with antibiotics in the absence of meningitis. The patient had undergone a biopsy of CSF, and the CSF was positive for bacterial meningitis. The patient had undergone an intravenous antibiotic treatment and had a biopsy performed. The patient had been treated with liposomal amphotericin B and IV antibiotics. The patient had been treated with oral antibiotics and topical antibiotics.

The patient had a history of a history of meningitis, but no meningitis was present. The patient had been treated with liposomal amphotericin B and IV antibiotics. The patient had been treated with oral antibiotics and topical antibiotics. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was observed. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was observed.

In addition, a case of bacterial meningitis has been reported in a patient with meningeal enhancement syndrome [6]. In this patient, the patient had a history of meningitis. The patient had a history of sinusitis. The patient had a history of meningitis.

The clinical presentation of meningeal enhancement syndrome is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings [5]. The patient had a history of meningeal enhancement syndrome, and the patient had a history of sinusitis. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was present. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was present. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was present. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was present.

The patient had a history of the onset of meningeal enhancement syndrome. The patient had a history of meningeal enhancement syndrome, and the patient had a history of sinusitis. The patient had a history of sinusitis and sinusitis was present.
