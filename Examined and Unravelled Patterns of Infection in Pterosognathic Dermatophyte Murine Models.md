## Abstract
We present the draft genome sequence of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as a set of transcription factors (TFs) which are associated with mating and pathogenicity. A comparative genomics analysis of the different alleles of these TFs reveals that they have a common common underlying structure and that the TFs themselves are highly conserved with regard to their expression. They are enriched in the mating domain of the HAG1 TF, which encodes a variant of the HAG of Fission yeast, and in the D1/D2 domains of the HAG of the Agaricomycetes. These two domains share a common common common ancestor, and are highly conserved, suggesting that they could have been acquired independently. We find two D1/D2 TFs in S. pombe mating. A striking similarity to genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe TFs is observed, and an additional 10 TFs are highly conserved throughout the genome. These TFs were also found in two sibling species of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and are highly expressed in females. In contrast to the traits for which high expression levels were found in the mating domain of S. pombe, S. pombe TFs were more highly expressed in the mating tract.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have increased dramatically in the past decade, and constitute an enormous public health problem that has now become even more severe in developing countries (Bovers et al. 2017). Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungal pathogen, which causes up to 1.5 million life-threatening infections each year (Brown et al. 2013). Aspergilloma, a severe invasive aspergillosis, is defined as a disease that: (1) is >100,000 times more frequent than invasive candidiasis; (2) is characterized by high mortality rates; (3) often presents in immunocompromised patients, including those with hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and patients with severe trauma; (4) is often associated with high mortality rates. In addition, the increasing incidence of IFIs in non-neutropenic populations has led to a shift in the epidemiology of IFIs from asymptomatic to invasive infections, and the development of therapeutic alternatives to them (Gupta et al. 2015).

The development of antifungal therapies has been hindered by the intrinsic toxicity of the currently available drugs, which includes the limited number of targets and long-term toxicity of the drug.


## Methods
The original model was constructed by re-amplifying the PbC_Y model, PbC_Y, from a .0-kb P. gramannum genome contig using the Illumina Hiseq platform. The P. gramannum genome assembly was made using the P. gramannum genome database [59].

The original PbC_Y.2 was replaced by PbC_Y.1 (the P. gramannum genome contig was made using the Illumina Hiseq platform), and the P. gramannum genome assembly was made using the P. gramannum genome database. The P. gramannum genome contig was made by a second PCR, using a custom-made cDNA template, and the P. gramannum genome contig was made by a second PCR with the Illumina Hiseq platform. The new P. gramannum genome contig was made by the same method. The P. gramannum genome contig was made by a third PCR using a custom-made cDNA template. The P. gramannum genome contig was made by a second PCR using a custom-made cDNA template.

The P. gramannum genome contigs were compared with the P. gramannum genome contigs using a BLASTn search [60]. The P. gramannum genome contigs were compared with the P. gramannum genome contigs using the BLASTn search [61]. In addition, the P. gramannum genome contigs were compared to the P. gramannum genome contigs using the BLASTn search [62]. The P. gramannum genome contigs were compared with the P. gramannum genome contigs using the BLASTn search [63]. In addition, the P. gramannum genome contigs were compared to the P. gramannum genome contigs using the BLASTn search [64]. In addition, the P. gramannum genome contigs were compared to the P. gramannum genome contigs using the BLASTn search [65]. The P. gramannum genome contigs were compared to the P.


## Results
monsantoi toxin-induced expression of proinflammatory genes is dependent on the dendritic cell line [7. To explore the role of rRNA in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and protect against R. monsantoi infection, we investigated the expression of proinflammatory genes by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig 1A, we observed that expression of proinflammatory genes in rRNA-depleted mice was not affected by the dendritic cell line, as shown by qRT-PCR results. As shown in Fig 1B, the expression of proinflammatory genes was not affected by rRNA-depletion, as shown by qRT-PCR results. These results suggest that rRNA could directly induce proinflammatory cytokine production in R. monsantoi.

We also examined the expression of proinflammatory genes in the rRNA-depleted mice and the control mice. As shown in Fig 1C, rRNA-depletion significantly decreased the expression of proinflammatory genes in the rRNA-depleted mice. These results suggest that rRNA could directly induce proinflammatory cytokine production in the fungal infection model.

To investigate the role of rRNA in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and protect against R. monsantoi infection, we investigated the role of rRNA in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and protect against R. monsantoi infection. We first examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig 2, rRNA-depleted mice showed increased expression of both IL-1ß and IL-6 in response to rRNA-mediated toxin-induced expression. R. monsantoi toxin-induced expression of both IL-1ß and IL-6 was significantly increased in the rRNA-depleted group. These results suggest that rRNA-mediated toxin-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and protect against R. monsantoi infection.

## Discussion
This database covers 14 years of infection, with a total of more than 1 million Lyme patients living in this regio. In addition, the IBDID is a database of detailed information on the frequency of Lyme infection in various regions of the world, with a focus on Lyme disease in Europe. A total of 631 specimens were collected from more than 1,000 patients living in France. This number of Lyme patients is comparable to the number of patients living in France (1,350) and France (734) who were infected with Lyme disease at the time of the collection, but much higher than those who were infected with HIV (891) and with other fungi (1,700) [15]. This number is significantly higher than those from France, where only 25 cases of Lyme disease were reported [15].

The IBDID has a further number of patients living in France, compared to patients living in France. This is in line with the report from a French publication that found that 8.4% of the patients living in France lived in rural areas, including urban centres, compared to a rural area in France (13.6%) [16]. This is a relatively high number compared to the number of patients living in rural areas in France, but higher than the total number of patients living in urban centres, which was 16% [16].

Although the frequency of Lyme infection in France has been increasing, the infection in the United States has remained unrecorded [17]. This is due to the fact that patients living in cities are more likely to be infected with Lyme disease. Patients living in cities are more likely to be infected with Lyme disease. It is therefore possible that patients living in cities are more likely to be infected with Lyme disease. Although the frequency of Lyme infection in France is similar to the frequency of Lyme disease in France, this is not statistically significant. This difference is due to the difference in the method used, which was designed to find the greatest difference in the frequency of Lyme infection between France and the United States. The frequency of Lyme infection in France was not significantly different from that in the United States. This may be due to the fact that people living in cities are more likely to be infected with Lyme disease than people living in cities.
