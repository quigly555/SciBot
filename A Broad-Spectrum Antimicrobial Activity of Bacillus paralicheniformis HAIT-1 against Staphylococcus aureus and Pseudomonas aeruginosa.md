## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are common in immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antifungal effect of the phenolic compound Jia1 in inhibiting the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. The MIC and MFC of the Jia1 compound were determined using the standard protocol of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antifungal activity was measured by the broth microdilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method. The efficacy of the Jia1 compound was evaluated by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The MFC concentration of 100 mg/mL effectively inhibited the growth of A. fumigatus conidia and necrotic mycelia conidia, and the MIC50 concentration of 10 mg/mL inhibited the growth of A. fumigatus conidia and necrotic mycelia conidia. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) for Jia1 were 0.04 to =16 mg/mL, and 2 to =32 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa. The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were 0.04 to =16 mg/mL for both antifungals. These results demonstrate that the phenolic compound Jia1 exhibits antifungal activity against both Aspergillus and A. fumigatus at the concentration of 10 mg/mL.


## Introduction
The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the emergence of multidrug-resistant infections have been observed in recent years. Antibiotics are commonly used to control these infections. The major prophylactic strategies are the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and peptidoglycans (PLs) that are generated by living microorganisms as anionic peptides (e.g., peptidoglycan or PAMP) or phage molecules (e.g., PAMP) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Some of these peptides have shown antimicrobial activity against a wide range of targets. AMPs are able to bind to microbial membrane lipids, such as bacteria, yeast and fungi, and exert their antibacterial activity by binding to specific sites on microbial membranes.

The presence of large number of molecules in the phage structures (e.g., aminoglycosides, aminotrioprodides, peptidoglycan, pyran-1,4-dione) make them a good candidate for antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, peptides (or their analogs) with a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of pathogens and a wide range of substrates has been reported [8].


## Methods
coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa A549, and . tuberculosis (TB). In order to compare the antibacterial activity, the MIC_50 and MIC_90 values were calculated using the Gram-negative and Gram-positive control organisms.

In order to compare the antibacterial activity of the antibiotics, the MIC_90 and MIC_50 values were calculated using the Gram-positive and Gram-positive control organisms.

A standard curve of the antimicrobial activity of the agents was developed using the standard antibiotic (penicillin/l-glutamphenicol) method, which was applied to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the compounds.

In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the antifungal agents, the M. tuberculosis was determined as previously described (58). The test was performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory with a reference strain of M. tuberculosis by fluorescence microscopy.

4.3. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The MIC_90 and MIC_90 values of the test agents were evaluated according to a previously published methodology (45). The agar was serially diluted by 5 µL of each dilution (100 µL) using sterile distilled water and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC_90 value was considered to be the lowest concentration of the tested drug which was able to inhibit growth of the tested organism. The M. tuberculosis was also treated with the same concentration of antifungal agents.

## Results
HAIT-1-B was also highly sensitive to all antimicrobials tested, except for fluconazole, which was more sensitive than fluconazole against all strains tested (Fig 2B. However, the fluconazole MIC for HAIT-1-B was 1 µg/ml, which was comparable to the MIC for the protonated beta-lactamase HAIT-1-B (1 µg/ml), which was 1 µg/ml. Since HAIT-1 was more active than HAIT-1-B against all strains tested, it was suggested that the HAIT-1-B susceptibility was due to the reduced activity of HAIT-1-B against all strains tested.

The antibiotic activity of HAIT-1-B and HAIT-1-B-labeled beta-lactamase against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was compared using the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the MICs for HAIT-1-B and HAIT-1-B-labeled beta-lactamase against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (Table 3). The results of the MICs and MICs are summarized in Table 4.

The fluconazole MIC was 1 µg/ml, which was equivalent to the MIC for the protonated beta-lactamase HAIT-1-B (1 µg/ml) but was lower than the fluconazole MIC for the S. aureus strain (1 µg/ml). The MIC for fluconazole was 1 µg/ml, which was comparable to the MIC for the protonated beta-lactamase HAIT-1-B (1 µg/ml). However, the fluconazole MIC for the S. aureus strain was 0.5 µg/ml, which was lower than the fluconazole MIC for the S. aureus strain (0.5 µg/ml). The MIC for fluconazole was 1 µg/ml, which was comparable to the MIC for the S.


## Discussion
In contrast, the two novel compounds (C and D) were less active against the tested . aureus strains (Table 1) and against all of the other tested bacterial strains tested (Table 3). Although the MIC values for the two novel compounds were relatively low, they had the potential to cause significant toxicity. For instance, B. cereus ATCC 25927 and S. aureus ATCC 6258 were both inhibited by B. cereus HAIT-1. The compounds A and B were inactive against the tested S. aureus strains. Interestingly, two compounds, namely, A and B, were shown to be highly active against both S. aureus strains (Table 1), as was the compound F. adeninivus. The MIC values for the compounds were similar to that reported by Cohen et al. (2007) for the two compounds tested (MIC = 64 µg/mL) [22].

The use of compound B in combination with its antifungal activity was demonstrated in the presented study (Table 1). The most active compound B was also reported to be highly active against A. niger [23]. The same compound was reported to be highly active against the same strain of A. niger [23]. The same compound was also reported to be highly active against the same strain of A. baumannii [24].

The studies presented herein demonstrate that the compound D, which had been previously reported to be active against A. niger [24] and S. aureus [25], was also highly active against the tested S. aureus strains. The compounds F and A were active against S. aureus and S. aureus ATCC 6258, with the lowest activity (MIC = 2.4 µg/mL) against S. aureus. The MIC values of the compounds were also similar to those reported by Cohen et al. (2007) for compounds A and B. However, the compound F was also reported to be highly active against S. aureus.

The present study demonstrated that the compounds F and A exhibited antifungal activity against S. aureus, S. aureus ATCC 6258, and the tested S. aureus strains, with MIC values ranging between 2.5 and 16.
