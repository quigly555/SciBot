## Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a bacterium that causes nosocomial infections that can cause severe hospital and economic losses in outbreaks. The development of resistant A. baumannii strains has led to the need for new antimycotics. In this work, we identified a novel peptide antibiotic, quinazolin-7-carboxypropyl (CoABC) and a novel antibiotic peptide, emtricitabine (EtN-Phe)]. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed that EtN-Phe was present as an insoluble polysaccharide in the cytoplasm of treated bacterial cells under nitrogen-rich culture conditions.


## Introduction
Fungal diseases are difficult to treat and are increasingly being recognized as a major threat to human and animal health. With increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs, especially against HIV, the incidence of fungal diseases has increased over the past decades and has not decreased in a progressive manner (Neme and Deleu, 2012). This is linked to the increasing number of patients with immunodeficiency conditions receiving antifungal therapy and to the increase of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who are on immunosuppressive therapy (Long et al., 2016). Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidiasis, accounting for approximately 30% of invasive fungal infections in hematological patients and up to 40% of all fungal-related deaths worldwide (Rajasingham et al., 2017). Candida albicans is responsible for approximately 30% of all fungal-related deaths worldwide, and the majority of these cases are caused by C. glabrata (Gladysheva et al., 2011). C.


## Methods
Study site and soil sampling
The study site was located in the volcano area of Nakhon Hengkou, a volcano located in the Northeast of China. Nakhon Hengkou is a large volcano with an altitude of 1,000 m and a mean annual temperature of 26 °C. It is a Chinese province with a population of approximately 4000,000 and a mean annual temperature of 8 °C [1]. The volcano is a typical gyre of the summer and autumn cycles, with a maximum annual temperature of 23 °C and a mean annual temperature of 30 °C [7]. In the study period, more than 40 cm of soil from Nakhon Hengkou and 40 cm of soil from Sichuan and Shaanxi province in southwestern China were collected from July 2012 to August 2013. The soil samples were collected at the time of sampling in June 2013 and July 2014, respectively.


## Results
The analysis of the antifungal antifungal potential of different agents showed that the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents and the novel antifungal agents, were able to inhibit the growth of all strains of Candida sp. (Table 3). Antifungal agents of the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents, the novel antifungal agents, and the novel antifungal agents were able to selectively kill the microorganisms (Table 3). The results of this analysis indicate that novel antifungal agents are able to specifically inhibit the growth of Candida spp. at the site of contact with human skin.

Effect of the novel and novel antifungal agents on the growth of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis

Effect of the novel and novel antifungal agents on the growth of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was investigated using the microarrays to test the effect of the novel and novel antifungal agents on the growth of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. The effects of the novel and novel antifungal agents on the growth of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were tested using the microarrays. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 4.

Effect of the novel and novel antifungal agents on the growth of C. parapsilosis

The antifungal antifungal agents were evaluated for their effect on the growth of C. parapsilosis. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 5. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 6. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 7. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 8.

## Discussion
Most of the tested pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Blastomyces dermatidians, are known to produce aflatoxins (1-6), which are produced by multidrug resistance mechanism. In addition, the cell wall of fungi has been reported to be composed of two types of polysaccharides, polygalacturonan and polygalacturonan, which are composed of ß-1,4-glucans and ß-1,6-glucans [32]. However, the effect of polygalacturonan on fungal growth was not examined. Therefore, the roles of polygalacturonan in fungal pathogenesis were not explored.

In summary, this is the first report of the effects of GXM on the pathogenic potential of red mold infection, which is characterized by aflatoxin production by fungi. GXM-mediated mycobiome profiling of the fungal pathogens identified two distinct strains of pathogenic fungi: the bacterium Cryptococcus neoformans, which was more virulent in mice [33], and the yeast Aspergillus flavus, which is more virulent in mice and humans [34]. In addition, a number of GXM-linked proteins have been identified as chemopreventive antifungal molecules, including a-linked mannoprotein, a-1,3-linked mannoprotein, a-1,6-linked mannoprotein, and a-1,6-mannoprotein [35]. These compounds have been proposed to be key in the pathogenesis of these fungi, and have shown promising activity against some of the most commonly used drugs in humans, such as fluconazole and ketoconazole [36]. In addition, a number of GXM-linked proteins have been found to be involved in several cellular functions, such as the regulation of cellular metabolism and proliferation, the activation of macrophages, and the differentiation of eukaryotic cells, such as mitotic cells [37]. Moreover, GXM has been reported to have potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [38].
