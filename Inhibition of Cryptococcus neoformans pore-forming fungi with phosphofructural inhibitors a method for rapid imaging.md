## Abstract
Acanthamoeba castellanii are the causative agent of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a systemic mycosis caused by Acanthamoeba keratitis. The lack of clear molecular data related to the ability of A. castellanii to thrive in vitro is a major obstacle to the development of comprehensive models of this infection. Here, we have investigated the ability of A. castellanii to grow in vitro. We show that cells grown in the presence of a minimal medium containing (mbst) protons produce high amounts of phenolic acid, a derivative of galactose, as well as mycoflora, a type of mycofluticogen, which is also produced by A. castellanii. These results suggest that A. castellanii cells grown in the presence of mycoflora may not induce a rapid endocytosis, but that these cells do. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cell is able to mount an endocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner, and that this is due to its ability to generate a lipid mediator of endocytosis. The lipid mediator Eicosaproides Lecanicola was identified as a lipid mediator of A. castellanii endocytosis. The addition of a lipid mediator to mycoflora significantly increased the growth and lipid content of A. castellanii. Furthermore, mycoflora were found to be released into lipid mediator form, a biphasic fungal endophyte-like phenotype, upon mycoflora arrival. Our data suggest that mycoflora and mycoflora grow in the same medium in which each plays a role, and that the production of mycoflora lipid mediator is driven by the growth conditions that affect A. castellanii lipid content. These results provide insights into the metabolic pathogenesis of A. castellanii, which may help identify host specific determinants that may be able to modulate the virulence of this fungal pathogen.


## Introduction
Plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGMS) require nitrogen for growth. This means that there is a requirement for a common supply for plants with available nitrogen (N_2M), and for a common supply of the organic material required for growth. Plants must have sufficient energy to grow, and therefore need to be able to use the available nitrogen as a source of nitrogen (Koehler and Freeze, 2012). Plants grow by attaching to and diffusing nitrogen from the environment. It has been estimated that the annual nitrogen demand is about 15^9 M^2 (Lang and Pore, 2005), and this is more than that of agricultural crops (Gill et al., 2012). Therefore, plants must possess the necessary abilities to acquire sufficient amounts of organic nitrogen (N_2M), which is required to maintain growth. However, excess N_2M is toxic and causes various detrimental effects, including, in particular, plant growth inhibition (Lee and Seo, 2010), non-coordinated nitrogen transport (NRT) (Wong and Hu, 2009), and soil aeration (Gill et al., 2012) (Fig 1). Thus, plants must possess strategies to reduce the excess N_2M, such as building plant biomass-to-nitrogen (Bayer et al., 2000; Seo et al., 2008).

The role of N_2M in nitrogen fixation has been extensively studied, but no study has been able to quantify the quantity and quality of N_2M. The nitrite cycle is an effective approach to address this issue (Gill et al., 2012).


## Methods
 1987. In this study, the method is described in detail below.

The non-invasive and/or invasive technique of liposomal inhibition is generally accepted as the most efficient method for the detection of P. neoformans-infected yeast cells, and is usually applied in combination with fluorescence-based detection of cytosolic or intracellular P. brasiliensis-associated cells. The method is generally considered to be the most stable method, and usually depends on the P. brasiliensis-infected yeast cells to be detected.

The cellular-based method of inhibition of P. brasiliensis using the cytokines/chemokines is also more suitable for the detection of P. brasiliensis-associated P. brasiliensis cell death and intracellular death of P. brasiliensis. In this study, the method is described in detail below.

The method of inhibition of P. brasiliensis using the specific antibodies/phalloidin/biotin is also effective for the detection of P. brasiliensis-associated yeast cells, but its availability is limited. In this study, the method is described in detail below.

The method of inhibition of P. brasiliensis using the MHC/ELISA technique is also effective for the detection of P. brasiliensis-associated yeast cells, but its availability is limited. In this study, the method is described in detail below.

P. brasiliensis-associated yeast cells are very stable and can be counted up to ~1×10^7. This method is commonly applied in a variety of different cell types, such as Aspergillus, P. lindemuthianum, and T. mentagrophytes. In this study, the method is described in detail below.

Phospholipase-like activities of P. brasiliensis
P. brasiliensis yeast cells (5×10^6/mL) were seeded in 50-mL conical flasks containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and incubated at 37°C. After 18 h, the supernatant was removed and the cells were collected. The cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS.


## Results
This model was used to demonstrate that cryptococcal cells exposed to a high concentration of a fungicide do not induce a rapid proliferation of the yeast cell population in the presence of the fungicid. Rather, the cryptococcal cells grow rapidly after a single exposure to the fungicide (Fig 7A). To further examine the mechanism of fungal cell death, we also used a two-way interaction model to investigate whether cryptococcal cells exposed to a high concentration of a fungicide were able to survive, and that the killing of the yeast cell population was dependent on the fungicide (Fig 7C). We found that in a two-way interaction, the yeast cells survived in a yeast cell population that had survived with a high concentration of a fungicide (Fig 7C). Therefore, the cell death of the yeast population was dependent on the fungicide.

Cryptococcal cells exposed to a high concentration of a fungicide induce rapid proliferation of the yeast cell population and stimulate a rapid proliferation of the yeast cell population in the presence of fungicide
As mentioned above, the yeast cells were the most important cell type in the fungal cell wall, and the large number of yeast cells required to survive with a fungicide might have a negative impact on the cell wall integrity. To further evaluate the effect of a fungicide on the yeast cell wall, we examined whether a fungicide can induce proliferation of the yeast cell population in the presence of fungicide. First, we used a two-way interaction model to test whether the fungicide can induce cell proliferation in the presence of yeast cells in the presence of a fungicide. As shown in Fig 8A, the yeast cells were unable to proliferate in the presence of a fungicide, whereas the yeast cells survived in a high concentration of a fungicide. Thus, the inhibition of fungal proliferation by a fungicide can induce a rapid proliferation of the yeast cell population in the presence of a fungicide.

Next, we used a two-way interaction model to analyze whether fungicide can induce yeast cell proliferation in the presence of a fungicide.


## Discussion
neoformans from . gattii using the C. gattii strain K562 and C. gattii strain H99. The differential diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis using the MALDI-TOF MS has been previously reported in a study of 17 patients with cryptococcosis in Brazil [10]. Our data demonstrate that the MALDI-TOF MS of C. gattii is an accurate and sensitive method to distinguish C. gattii from C. neoformans.

The differential diagnosis of C. gattii with cryptococcal meningitis using the MALDI-TOF MS has been previously reported in a study of 10 patients with cryptococcosis in Brazil [10]. However, the differential diagnosis of C. gattii with cryptococcal meningitis using the MALDI-TOF MS has been reported in only two patients in Brazil [10]. The study revealed that the MALDI-TOF MS is more sensitive than other method in discriminating C. gattii from C. neoformans.

Our results demonstrate that the MALDI-TOF MS is an efficient and rapid test for C. gattii identification in C. gattii. The sensitivity and specificity of the MALDI-TOF MS have been reported in the same study in Brazil [10]. The sensitivity and specificity of the MALDI-TOF MS has been reported in two studies [10]. The study reported that the MALDI-TOF MS could discriminate between C. gattii and C. neoformans in two patients in Brazil [10]. However, the MALDI-TOF MS in Brazil is limited to the ability to discriminate between C. neoformans and C. gattii.

The sensitivity and specificity of the MALDI-TOF MS has been reported in only one study in Brazil [10]. The study reported that the MALDI-TOF MS could discriminate between C. neoformans and C. gattii in two patients in Brazil [10]. The study reported that the MALDI-TOF MS could discriminate between C. gattii and C. neoformans in two patients in Brazil [10].
