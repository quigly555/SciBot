## Abstract
Cholera remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in children. The use of polyritonyl alcohol (PMA) as a treatment for melioidosis is recommended by WHO. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PMA as a prevention strategy on the incidence of melioidosis and the recurrence rate of melioidosis-related mortality in a rural district in Central African Republic.

Between February and April 2007, 118 children aged 5 months to 12 years old were recruited at the community level. Survivors were selected using verbal interviewer administered questionnaires to maintain body PM and demographic information. We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics, melioidosis, risk factors for melioidosis, use of PMA, and antifungal susceptibility. We performed data mining and selection of covariates using Epi-info version 3.5.1.

Use of PMA was significantly associated with mortality (HR = 5.3 [1.54, 8.2]) in the first year of follow-up (p = 0.006). In the second year, the use of PMA was significantly associated with mortality (HR = 3.3 [1.51, 7.


## Introduction
Iron is an essential nutrient for virtually all living organisms, and is also an essential cofactor for enzymes that are crucial for the accomplishment of many biological functions. Moreover, iron is also involved in the synthesis of many important antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents such as the asco-hematophytic polysaccharides, as well as in several forms of apoptosis [1]. This review focuses on iron metabolism, as well as its role in the human body, as it provides an overview of iron's role in the human body and also discusses the important role of iron in the human body in the context of various processes such as immune system development, aging, and cancer.


## Methods

Human PBMCs: PBMCs were obtained from the sputum samples and cultured as described by the manufacturerâ€™s instruction. The data was collected using the FlowJo software, version 5.2.7.

Pneumococcal meningitis
Cryptococcal meningitis was defined as a positive culture of Cryptococcus neoformans from the sputum of a patient with respiratory failure. This is the definition of a pneumococcal meningitis in which the patient has clinical features of meningitis but is not able to walk. The patient is considered to have a negative CSF India ink stain (Pfizer). A complete blood count and CSF opening were also performed on this case. This is a series of blood smears and pleural fluid on the site of the bronchial tubes. The pleural fluid was extracted and recorded. The CSF opening was recorded as the opening that closed in the presence of a red fluid and the CSF opening was recorded as the opening that closed in the presence of a red fluid. A negative CSF India ink stain (Pfizer) was performed on this case. The CSF opening was also recorded as the opening that closed in the presence of a red fluid.

## Results
The PK-dependent degradation of PC9 (and/or the O-mannosyltransferase Hap1)
To further investigate the biological functions of PC9, we created a strain expressing a native Hap1 protein (Hap1p), which was introduced into the yeast S. cerevisiae strain H99 (Figure 1A). The growth rate of this strain was monitored for 72 h by measuring the growth rate of the yeast cells at different pHs of pH 7.5 and 7.6. In this strain, PC9 activity was inhibited by approximately 25% in the presence of 50 mM CaCl_2, while the growth rate of the yeast cells was not affected (Figure 1B).


## Discussion
This is the first report of C. neoformans in a human patient. In a setting where this opportunistic infection is thought to be uncommon and associated with a high mortality rate, this is a relatively rare presentation.

The first report of C. neoformans in a patient with pulmonary cryptococcosis was made in 1979 [14].
