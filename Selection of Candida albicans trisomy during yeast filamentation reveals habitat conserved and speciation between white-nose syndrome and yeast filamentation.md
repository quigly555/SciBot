## Abstract
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is critical for growth and morphogenesis in most eukaryotes. In basidiomycete fungi, this pathway is conserved and its regulation has evolved into a complex network of conserved MAPKs in diverse eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the MAPKs are similar to MAPKs in Cryptococcus neoformans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In filamentous fungi, the MAPKs are highly conserved and their regulation and regulation systems are all widely conserved. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most important signaling pathways is disrupted in the presence of transposon-disrupting compounds. The transposon-disrupting compounds are known to disrupt the MAPKs in Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, C. elegans has evolved two signaling pathways, the MAPKs for MAPK and the MAPK-PKA pathways in response to environmental stress. In contrast, the MAPKs are conserved in other eukaryotes, fungi and plants. This is the first study to compare the MAPK and the MAPK-PKA pathways in a pathogen-synthetic proline-rich antisense loop library and compare the properties of the MAPK- and MAPK-PKA pathways in an eukaryote. Our data show that the MAPKs are active in yeast, but inactive in filamentous fungi. The MAPKs are active in Cryptococcus neoformans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

## Methods
When a susceptible species is cultured in the dust, this condition can be observe. This means that when a susceptible species is not present in the dust, it is considered as a susceptible species. Dust composition is mainly determined by the formation of a prominent contrast in the dust-dispersed species. This can be observed using a microscope. In the dust-dispersed species, the species can be distinguished from a dead species by a bright contrast in the living species. Thus, the dead species is often colored by the dust.

In the dust-dispersed species, the species can be distinguished from a dead species by a bright contrast in the living species. This can be seen with a microscope.

A major difference between the two species is the presence of the mitochondria in the species. It can be observed in the dust-dispersed species.

## Results
The average relative abundance of . cerevisiae Candida albicans was 2.0% in the white-nose habitat (Table 1), and the average relative abundance of C. albicans was 0.2% in the oak tree. In contrast, the relative abundance of C. glabrata increased in the oak tree, with a significant difference (p<0.05) between the two habitats, while the relative abundance of C. parapsilosis increased in the white-nose habitat, with an average relative abundance of 0.2% in the white-oak habitat. C. glabrata has a particularly high relative abundance of 0.4% in the oak tree, while C. parapsilosis has a relative abundance of 0.2% in the white-oak habitat.

It has been shown previously that the relative abundance of the two major fungal genera (Candida albicans and C. neoformans) in oak trees is often heterogeneous (Chang et al. 2013). Thus, it was interesting to test if the relative abundance of the two major fungal genera (Candida albicans and C. neoformans) was affected by oak tree habitat. Our results revealed that the relative abundance of C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. glabrata were significantly higher in the oak tree than the white-oak tree. In contrast, the relative abundance of the two major fungal genera (Candida albicans and C. neoformans) in the white-oak tree was negatively affected by oak tree habitat. The relative abundance of C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis was significantly higher in the oak tree than the white-oak tree.

3.3. Comparison of Intracellular Yield of Candida albicans and C. neoformans in the White-Oak Forest
Intracellular Yield (IVY) of C. neoformans was calculated from the mean (±SD) average IY of the two species grown in a single artificial plantation. The mean IVY of C. neoformans was 0.35 ± 0.03 SD in the white-oak forest, and 0.


## Discussion
We hypothesized that the low percentage of yeast is due to a general bias in the colonies that cause fungus-fungal interaction. Although the majority of yeasts do not have asexual reproduction, the yeast populations in a single colony might be dominated by different species of fungi. Our results showed that the White-Nose syndrome yeast population is dominated by Fusarium oxysporum. The fact that the majority of Fusarium yeasts belong to the Mucoromycotina class of fungi strongly suggests that a specialized yeast population has evolved to survive in yeast-like conditions.

The fungus in our study is a member of the Mucoromycetales lineage of the Saccharomycotina family. We found that Fusarium spp. isolated from other species, such as M. guilliermondii, M. major, M. virens, M. guilliermondii, M. asperellum, M. flavus, and M. alternata, are species of Mucoromycetes. The more species and species of Mucoromycetes are found in the White-Nose syndrome yeasts, the higher their rates of speciation. The White-Nose syndrome yeasts belong to the Mucoromycetales lineage and have a higher percentage of species in the Mucoromycetales group. However, the white-nose syndrome yeast population does not appear to be dominated by these fungi. Fusarium oxysporum has a strongly higher percentage of Mucoromycetes yeasts, but it also has an intermediate percentage of the Mucoromycetales species. The rate of speciation of Mucoromycetales yeasts is not high, but the percentage of species in Mucoromycetales group is significantly higher than the rate of speciation of Mucoromycetales species. Our results suggest that the white-nose syndrome yeast population is dominated by members of Mucoromycetes, and that the White-Nose syndrome yeast population might be more successful in growth in a condition of white-nose syndrome than in a condition of Mucoromycetales yeasts.
