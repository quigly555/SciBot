## Abstract
Most of the non-neo-nucleoside antifungals (foliocinoids) have not been explored as new treatments for invasive fungal infections (IFI). Most of the non-neo-nucleoside antifungals have not been explored as new treatments for IFI. In particular, galactide has not been described to date as a possible new antifungal. In this study, we tested the activity of the two non-neo-nucleoside antifungal, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), against the strains of Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani, and Candida albicans. In vitro activity was investigated against a range of filamentous fungi. Eleven isolates showed a reduced activity, and these were all considered as wild-type. We also tested one isolate for its ability to inhibit the growth of the Aspergillus niger strain. Three other isolates displayed increased activity against the A. flavus and A. solani strains. These results indicate that the 3BP gene is involved in the interaction between the fungus and the enzyme, in which the mechanism is different from that reported for other nucleoside antifungals.


## Introduction
The microbial rhizosphere and phyllosphere are considered to be the keystone ecosystem. The phyllosphere plays an essential role in microbial growth, nutrient cycling, and plant growth. However, the phyllosphere contains many other microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and also a few protists such as Entamoeba and Giardia (2, 3). However, the phyllosphere also contains a very small percentage of fungal pathogens, which are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and animals (4). This small number of pathogens and the limited availability of fungal pathogens makes it difficult to control fungal diseases and especially to reduce morbidity and mortality.

The mechanism that controls fungi and bacteria is by-products of the action of both, oxidative and non- oxidative, chemicals. Oxidative stress is one of the major stressors in the phyllosphere. Oxidative stress is generated by a wide range of environmental conditions, including variations in temperature, pH, solar radiation, UV irradiation, and organic pollutants (5, 6). Fungi and bacteria are constantly exposed to this stress. Fungi can survive and proliferate within the phyllosphere for extended periods of time and can survive and proliferate within the phyllosphere for longer times (7). Fungi and bacteria have to compete for nutrients and space in the phyllosphere. Plants and fungi are able to obtain nutrients from the phyllosphere using specialized phyllosphere uptake systems, such as endophytes and endophyte pellicles, that allow the fungi to obtain nutrients from the phyllosphere (8).

Endophytes and microbes are found in the phyllosphere and act as biofilm (9). In phyllosphere, there are many types of endophytes (stomata, bacteria, and fungi) and bacteria, and bacteria are found in the phyllosphere from different sources. Endophytes can grow as both free living and symbiotic organisms within the phyllosphere, as well as in the phylloplasm, where they act as the source of energy and energy source (10). They can also grow as phytopathogens or as symbionts (11). Some phytopathogens, such as Giardia, are able to survive within the phyllosphere and cause disease in humans (12).


## Methods
(2011.

The BMM medium was prepared by adding (1.0% w/v) of a mixture of KOH, isopropanol, 1% w/v NaOH, and HCl, 2.0% w/v. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 using 5 M KOH and the extract was filtered. The total extract was filtered using 0.45-µm membrane filters (Millipore, USA) and then concentrated under vacuum at 10 °C using a rotary evaporator (Axon 2S, USA).

After the analysis, the quantification was carried out using the Ascentis Pro software (Axon, USA). The temperature of the soil was set at 20 °C and the soil concentration was adjusted to 1.0 g soil/mL.

2.2. Fractionation and Characterisation of Soil
The fractionation procedure was carried out with a total of 7 g of soil from an area of 0.5 m^2 to 0.5 m^2 of soil. The soil-based fractionation method was employed to prepare the organic compounds and the soil-based fractionation method was used to prepare the soil-based fractionation method for the species. The soil-based fractionation method was employed to prepare the microbial compounds, which were obtained by the soil-based fractionation method. The microbial compounds were fractionated by the soil-based fractionation method in accordance to the relevant guidelines of the CLSI (1998) (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute, 1998) using a soil-based fractionation system.

The fractionation and the fractionation method were carried out in a total volume of 12.5 g of soil and the soil-based fractionation method was carried out in a total volume of 20 mL of concentrated water.


## Results
The soil type had a positive effect on the activity of soil fungi compared with that of the control roots (Figure 2. The soil type had an important influence on the activities of the soil fungi. The soil type had a negative effect on the soil fungi compared with that of the control roots. The combination of the soil type with the soil type was considered to be a positive influence on the soil fungi. However, the combination of the soil type with the soil type did not have an effect on the soil fungi (Figure 3). The soil type had a positive influence on the soil fungi compared with that of the control roots. The combination of the soil type with the soil type was considered to be a negative influence on the soil fungi compared with that of the control roots.

Effect of Soil Type and Soil Type Combination on the Production of Bioactive Compounds by Roots
The soil type, the soil type combination with the soil type and the combination of the soil type with the soil type as a whole were evaluated for the effect of soil type combination on the production of bioactive compounds. The results of the experiment showed that all the soil types had a positive effect on the production of bioactive compounds by roots. In particular, the soil type combination of the soil type had a positive effect on the production of bioactive compounds by the roots. The combination of the soil type with the soil type combined with the soil type showed that the combination of the soil type with the soil type combined with the soil type combined with the soil type was beneficial to the soil fungi (Figure 4).


## Discussion
The production of bioactive compounds by roots of . gloeosporioides was investigated. As shown in Figure 2, the bioactive compounds produced by C. gloeosporioides and C. albidus were represented by one compound, viz., the carvacrol, carvone, and quercetetariol. Similar results were observed by Chen et al. [21] who investigated the production of bioactive compounds by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium oxysporum, respectively. The present study was conducted to determine the chemical compositions of the bioactive compounds produced by C. gloeosporioides and C. albidus by investigating the surface properties of the soil on the application of bioactive compounds. It has been reported that the chemical composition of soil is influenced by the type of bioactive compounds [22], however, the composition of the soil micro-organisms and the soil organic matter are largely determined by the type of bioactive compound [23]. These results indicated that the chemical composition of the soil microbial community was largely determined by the bioactive compounds produced by C. gloeosporioides and C. albidus. In addition, the chemical composition of the soil microbial community showed a significant change in the composition of the soil microbial community.
