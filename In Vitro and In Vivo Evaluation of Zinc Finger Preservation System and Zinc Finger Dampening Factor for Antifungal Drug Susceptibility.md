## Abstract
Planktonic fungi are a heterotrophic group of eukaryotes that live in most of the known environments on Earth. The main group of fungi in this group is Mycosphaerellaceae, which is the third most abundant group after Glomeraceae. The fungi that occupy most of the known niches in the human body have not been investigated to date. In this study, we investigated the fungal microbiota of the lower limbs of two patients suffering from axenic PCM and axial radionarrot content of opportunistic fungal infections. By determining the diversity of fungi and their abundance, we were able to identify fungal communities in the skin, respiratory secretions, and most likely other tissues of the body by performing surface assays and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis. We observed that the skin was the main fungal community, followed by the respiratory secretions and the respiratory secretions of 72.4% of the axenic patients and the mycobiome, respectively.


## Introduction
Glycosylation is a highly conserved class of proteins involved in the synthesis of carbohydrate structures and molecules. Glycosylation plays an important role in many biological processes such as cell division, apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation. However, glycans are also involved in several biochemical processes, including cell signaling pathways, cell signaling cascades, cell differentiation, cell differentiation and cell death. In addition, glycosylation is a reversible reaction and can be catalyzed by a variety of enzymes (1). Although glycosylation is not required for cell growth, it is a key factor in the initiation and proliferation of many biological processes (2).


## Methods
 and 1, respectivel. Zinc Finger Dampening Factor was determined in 96-well microtiter plates using the following equation: (A) average Diameter of blank wells; (B) average Diameter of blank wells × (C) average Diameter of blank wells × (D) average Diameter of blank wells × (E) average Diameter of blank wells × (F). The drug susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

The ZDf value was calculated as the ratio of the tested concentration of compound to the lowest drug concentration of the corresponding tested sample. In the in vivo drug susceptibility testing, the in vitro drug susceptibility was expressed as the percentage reduction in the concentration of tested compound by the tested drug, and the ZDf value was expressed as the ratio of the tested concentration of drug to the lowest drug concentration of the corresponding sample.

The susceptibility of the tested compounds to human and animal pathogenic agents was evaluated by measuring their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) on human and animal microorganisms. The MIC values were determined using the broth microdilution method and the protocol was followed according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, USA).

2.3. Antifungal Activity of Zinc Finger Dampening Factor (ZDf)
The in vitro antifungal drug susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method. Zinc Finger Dampening Factor (ZDf) was determined by the MIC of the tested compound, and the protocol was followed according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, USA).

2.4. MIC of Zinc Finger Dampening Factor (ZDf) and the Minimum Fractional Dose (MFD)
The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of Zinc Finger Dampening Factor (ZDf) was determined using the broth microdilution method.

## Discussion
albicans to azole drugs was assessed by zinc finger (ZF) preservation syste. The ZF has been described to be a more sensitive antifungal drug compared to azole drugs (1, 9). The results of the in vitro susceptibility tests showed that the ZF is more sensitive than that of the azole drugs. In the zinc finger Dampening Factor test, the result of the in vitro susceptibility test demonstrated that the ZF was a more sensitive antifungal drug than the azole drugs. The results of the in vivo susceptibility test confirmed that the ZF is a more sensitive antifungal drug than the azole drugs. The ZF in a 2-D structure of C. albicans is represented by a H-bromodomain (BromF) (10).

The in vitro susceptibility tests of C. albicans to azole drugs showed that the ZF has a lower in vivo susceptibility than that of azole drugs. The results of the in vitro susceptibility tests showed that the ZF was a less sensitive antifungal drug than that of azole drugs. The results of the in vivo susceptibility test showed that the ZF was a more sensitive antifungal drug than that of azole drugs. The results of the in vivo susceptibility test confirmed that the ZF is a less sensitive antifungal drug than that of azole drugs. The results of the in vivo susceptibility test showed that the ZF is a less sensitive antifungal drug than that of azole drugs. The results of the in vivo susceptibility test showed that the ZF is a less sensitive antifungal drug than that of azole drugs.
