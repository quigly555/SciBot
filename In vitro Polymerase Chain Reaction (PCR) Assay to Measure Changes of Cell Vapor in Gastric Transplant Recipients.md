## Abstract
Two-component signaling systems (RbC/RbD) were designed to act as transmembrane proteins in yeast. The two-component ChrWAS1R and ChrWAS1R catabolism was characterised using an in vitro biophilic assay, and then expressed as a single-step reaction with the purified ChrWAS1R protein. The in vitro uptake of ß-lactamase by all RbD/RbC/RbD transporters was inhibited by 80% at 10 µg/mL. The ß-lactamase was detected using a rapid in-situ identification reaction against a cDNA library constructed from Staphylococcus aureus BL21. The detection of ß-lactamase in the culture supernatant of two transporters using RbC/RbD showed that they were both targeting the same target gene. In silico modelling, the two-component ChrWAS1R and the ChrWAS1R catabolic transporters were functionally compared using optical coherence tomography (O2) scans. They were highly similar in their transport mechanisms, and were highly similar in their function.


## Introduction
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major organelle for organelle-specific cellular metabolism and home to most of the living organisms. It contains a large amount of proteins that function as signaling molecules, which regulate the expression of various genes and processes in response to external stimuli. The structure of the ER is composed of a central chamber (ERIC) and a chamber (ERIC-barrier) that allows for the movement of proteins across the ER membrane. In the ERIC, proteins are transported to the extracellular space by the transfer of a lipid bilayer, a large variety of sugars (e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose, and galactose) and a small number of proteins with other functions (e.g., exosomes and apoptotic bodies) to be released into the extracellular space (1). The ERIC is a major organelle in the biogenesis of various biological processes, such as cell-cell communication, cell-cell fusion, and cell-cell motility (2-4). The cell, or microbial cell, is the most important organelle for the replication of cells in the ER and in the ER membrane, where proteins are transported and delivered to the ER membrane. Some proteins are found in the ER membrane and are referred to as endosomes and/or exosomes. Endosomes and/or exosomes are secreted by the cell during development and are important in cell-cell communication and intracellular communication (5, 6). Although the secreted proteins and their products are present in the ER membrane, they are also present in the extracellular space.


## Methods
For DNA quantification, 1 µl of each sample was used for PC. For UPCR, 1 µl of each sample was added to a total volume of 25 µl. PCR products were purified using the CFX-96TM PCR DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA concentration was measured using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.).

Polymorphonuclear Microarray Analysis
For microarray analyses, 3 µl of a 2.5 µM stock was used for each sample.

For quantitative PCR, cells were cultured in T-34-stained aspirates and then resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and snap-frozen in liquid N_2. For UPCR, 1 µl of each sample was used for PCR. For DNA quantification, 1 µl of each sample was used for UPCR.

Quantitative PCR, UPCR, and UPCR Assays
Quantitative PCR was performed on a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each reaction was performed in duplicate on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 Touch Real-Time System using the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, with a final elongation step of 72°C for 10 min. The internal standard curve (Ettan SYBR Green I; Biotium, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as a calibrator for PCR reactions. All reactions were performed in duplicate on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 Touch Real-Time System.


## Results

The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the polymers in the colonic mucosa to be delivered into the GI tract, as revealed by the HPLC profiles of polymeric polymers present in the rectum, colonic mucosa, and GI tract (Figure 1A.

We found that polymeric polymers in the colonic mucosa, but not in the GI tract, were delivered into the GI tract in a dose-dependent manner with the relative amounts of polymeric polymers that were delivered in the colonic mucosa being the most abundant (Figure 1A). The proportion of polymeric polymers in the colonic mucosa that were delivered into the GI tract was significantly higher than the proportion of polymeric polymers in the GI tract (P < 0.001, Figure 1A).

The proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the GI tract was significantly higher than the proportion of polymeric polymers in the GI tract (P < 0.001, Figure 1A).

In contrast to the proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the GI tract, the proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa was significantly higher than the proportion of polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1A). The proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the GI tract was significantly higher than the proportion of polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1A). The proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa was significantly higher than the proportion of polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1A).

For both the GI tract and the colonic mucosa, the proportion of polymeric polymers that were delivered into the GI tract was significantly higher than the proportion of polymers that were delivered into the colonic mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1A).


## Discussion
glabrata in vitr. In addition, we have used a comprehensive proteomic analysis to analyze the cellular response of C. glabrata to cell surface-associated polymeric hydrolases.

A considerable number of polymeric hydrolases are known to bind to the host cell surface, and the cell surface polymeric hydrolases identified in this study were able to bind the host cell surface, thus influencing the extracellular growth of C. glabrata. However, our data revealed that the extracellular growth of C. glabrata was impaired in vitro when cells were exposed to polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space. It was observed that the growth of C. glabrata was impaired when the cells were exposed to polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space. The cell surface polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space were also observed to be able to bind to the host cell surface. However, the ability of the cell surface polymeric hydrolases to bind to the host cell surface was not significant when cells were exposed to polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space. It was observed that the cell surface polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space were not able to bind to the extracellular space. The ability of polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space to bind to the host cell surface was not significant when cells were exposed to polymeric hydrolases from the extracellular space.
