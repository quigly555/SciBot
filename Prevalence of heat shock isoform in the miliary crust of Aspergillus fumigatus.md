## Abstract
Infections of the urinary tract are a common cause of orthostatichesia, which is usually caused by infection with a variety of organisms. This paper reports a case of a 26-year-old man with a history of renal stone was found to have a history of urinary tract infection with the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, liposomal amphotericin, and acyclovir, and had a good outcome.


## Introduction
 In the presence of Csf1, . albicans undergoes thermotolerance and growth at 37°C. By contrast, C. glabrata cells survive at 25°C.7

The thermotolerance of C. albicans is not only related to its ability to survive at high temperatures but also involves its ability to adapt to cold environments. Heat shock induction and its subsequent accumulation in the tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, asthma, and cancer.9,10 The lack of a clear correlation between thermotolerance and disease progression has been challenged by the low prevalence of C. albicans in the literature. In a study of <U+03B3>d T cells, ChIP-seq data showed that only ~7% of <U+03B3>d cells from healthy individuals could tolerate high temperature.11 In a similar study of normal individuals, exposure to 25°C for 15 min resulted in >3% of <U+03B3>d cells that responded to temperature, and about half of <U+03B3>d cells responded to high temperature.12 In the light of these observations, it seems plausible that high temperature could be a key factor in the development of C. albicans disease. However, it has been challenged by these studies that high temperature is a transition state in C. albicans. These challenges include the slow growth rate of C. albicans, the existence of a major population bottleneck at the population level and the fact that C. albicans cannot tolerate the presence of low temperature and does not appear to be evolutionarily adapted to high temperature.13

The difficulty in using C. albicans as a model to understand the pathogenesis of C. albicans makes it hard to develop a protocol to monitor the progression of infection. In the present study, we used C. albicans as a model to monitor progression of C. albicans infection in vitro. We found that C. albicans is capable of growth at temperatures up to 37°C. Interestingly, C. albicans appears to be unable to grow at these high temperatures and it is not possible to use the media used for C. albicans infection in the study. Additionally, we found that C. albicans cells were unable to convert glucose into glycoconjugates.


## Methods
In brief, 10^-5 of the macrophage inflammatory responses (.e., cytokines, chemokines, and phagocytotic processes) were calculated as well as 10^-1 of the macrophage inflammatory response (i.e., cytokines, chemokines, and phagocytotic processes) calculated from the above formula.

Statistical analyses
To determine the relationship between the intracellular cytokines/chemokines and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, the relationship between the mCherry signal (p = 0.0114, ^*p < 0.001, ^*p = 0.001, ^*p = 0.0116, ^*p = 0.0001, ^*p = 0.0001, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0116, ^*p = 0.0116, ^*p = 0.0125, ^*p = 0.0125, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0125, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0119, ^*p = 0.0124, ^*p = 0.


## Results
fumigatus strains, as well as their expression in the same miliary aspecifically inoculated with wild-type . fumigatus in the presence of 5 mM H_2O_2 (Figure 1A) are presented in Figure 1B.

In comparison with wild-type A. fumigatus, the expression of the isoforms of the type I, type II and type III A. fumigatus strains in the presence of 5 mM H_2O_2 (Figure 1A) was found to be significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the presence of 5 mM H_2O_2. The isoform of the type III A. fumigatus strain, as well as the expression of the isoforms of the type I, type II and type III A. fumigatus strains in the presence of 5 mM H_2O_2 were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the presence of 5 mM H_2O_2.

## Discussion
albicans and . cerevisiae have been previously reported to have a dual-gasolar metabolism (i.e., high-spin, high-spin, high-spin, and low-spin) as well as a pentose phosphate-binding site, which are known to be required for an extracellular ATP pool to be secreted into the extracellular space [30]. Moreover, the secretion of ATP is a key event in the activation of the yeast-to-hypha transition and in the growth of non-albicans Candida species [31]. Thus, the fungal metabolism of substrate is a key step in the evolution of the fungal lifestyle.

Atomic enzyme production in S. cerevisiae
Atomic enzymes, including transmembrane hydrolase (TMH2), endo-ß-1,3-endo-ß-1,6-endo-ß-1,6-glucanase (EGMP1) and a putative GPI-anchored substrate-binding protein (Fbp1) have been previously reported in S. cerevisiae [32]. In addition, a putative superoxide dismutase (GNS1) was previously reported in A. fumigatus [33]. However, the bacterial orthologue, M. oryzae GPI-anchored superoxide dismutase (GNS1) is only known from S. cerevisiae and not from other fungal species. In M. oryzae, a transmembrane hydrolase (GAP1) was previously reported from A. fumigatus [34]. However, GAP1 is not a fungal hydrolase and its secretion is regulated by the yeast GAP1 orthologue, which does not show any obvious phenotypes in a low-energy carbon source [35]. In this study, the hydrolase GAP1 was detected in the filamentous ascomycete yeast C. albicans and the dimorphic fungus C. neoformans. Similar results were reported in Aspergillus fumigatus and C. parapsilosis [36]. The filamentous fungi, C. neoformans, C. glabrata, C. gattii, and A. fumigatus, were previously reported to have GAP1 expressed in the cell wall [37].
