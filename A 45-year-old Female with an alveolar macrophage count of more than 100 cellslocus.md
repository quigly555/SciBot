## Abstract
Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are serious complications that commonly occur after the development of an extended winter's duration. The present study aimed to analyze the incidence, clinical features, and management of PJIs in a glacier below the Tsimano-Clerch Tsimane-Slovakow’e in order to guide mycological staffs in timely and cost-effective treatment of PJIs. A retrospective chart review of symptomatic snowboarders documented the occurrence of PJIs in the months of October and November of 2015, as well as the months of June and July of 2016, using the International Society for Alpine Ski and Iceboard (ISIAC) classification system. The method used to determine the most frequent PJIs was retrospective chart review. Data extraction and analysis was performed using Epi Info 6.1.1.

In the period from October 2015 to December 2016, 1,502 patients were referred, of which 143 were classified as symptomatic snowboarders. The majority of cases occurred in male predominately, the most prevalent gender ratio was found to be 52.4:1.


## Introduction
Endophytes are microorganisms that live within, or on, plants. Endophytic fungi, or “endophytes,” are defined as fungi that have no known sexual life cycle, but are able to live within the host plants, and can be found in the phyllosphere and on dead, dead-end branches of the tree of life. Endophyte communities are highly diverse and vary from region to region. They can be a cosmopolitan group, which includes both saprophytes and symbionts, and especially tropical and subtropical groups, such as tropical and subtropical plants, insects, and animals. Endophyte communities have been associated with plants for many millions of years, including both plants and animals.

The genus Pseudomonads is a broad-spored, saprophytic group, with a wide range of hosts, including several important tropical plants. Pseudomonads are saprophytes, being in the range of fungi that can cause disease in humans and other mammals (e.g., humans and dogs) and cause opportunistic infections, such as oral and vaginal candidiasis, endocarditis, and rot. Pseudomonads are also parasites, being in the range of fungi that can cause decay in trees, such as fungi and bacteria, and can cause infections in humans, such as encephalitis, otitis, and systemic infections [1,2,3]. Pseudomonads are distributed worldwide, and are common in the phyllosphere of plants, including both asparagines and termites [4,5].

Pseudomonads can cause disease, being at higher frequency in humans, than other pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. They can also cause diseases, such as malaria, typhoid fever, and skin diseases [6,7].

Endophytes have been described as a group of fungi that live on dead, dead-end tissues, and that can be found in plants, in bark and wood.


## Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the University of Exeter Animal Ethics Committee (UKEA-1/2016).

BALB/c mice
Mice were housed under controlled conditions in the Research Laboratory of the University of Exeter (UKEA-1/2016) and were kept under standard laboratory conditions. All animal procedures were conducted according to the regulations of the Home Office and were carried out in accordance with the Home Office regulations and the animal protection act.

Mice
Female BALB/c mice (n = 6) were housed under standard laboratory conditions and were housed in individual ventilated cages.

## Discussion
The M2 macrophages are capable of recognition epitopes in the IL-1 receptor, which is an adaptor molecule on the surface of various innate immune cell. M2 macrophages are also capable of phagocytosis of pathogens such as E. faecalis, an alveolata pathogen [50], and C. albicans [51]. The latter pathogen is often overlooked in the inflammatory immune response and infection models.

In this study, the occurrence of M2 macrophages in the brain was confirmed by the CD4^+ T cell responses, which are dependent on IL-10 production and the production of IL-17A. The CD4^+ T cells are the main cells that secrete IL-17A, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and this is an essential cytokine for the differentiation of the brain. We showed that the CD4^+ T cells, which are also critical for the development of M2 macrophages, are also required for the development of Th2 responses to C. albicans. The CD4^+ T cells are also important for the development of T-cell differentiation. CD4^+ T cells also are required for the development of T-cell responses to E. faecalis, C. albicans, and P. brasiliensis [52]. Our results confirmed that M2 macrophages play an important role in the development of inflammatory and immune responses, in the development of inflammatory diseases, and in the development of immune responses against various microorganisms.

IL-17 was also produced by the CD4^+ T cells, which is an important cytokine for the differentiation of the brain. In our study, the CD4^+ T cell responses to E. faecalis, C. albicans, and P. brasiliensis were significantly higher than those to E. faecalis, which was in agreement with the findings of previous studies [14]. The CD4^+ T cell response to C. albicans was significantly higher than the CD4^+ T cell responses to C. albicans, which was in agreement with the results of studies in the brain [12, 18, 18, 17, 21, 53, 54].
