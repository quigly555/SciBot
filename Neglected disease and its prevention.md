## Abstract
The capacity to alter cell wall composition through various mechanisms has been a subject of ongoing research. Here we use as reference the polyphenolic extract of the root of Piskopitsa rhoifolium (Apia species) by the sequential action of a transhydrazone and of a quinone derivative, which we call dibasic quinones. This compound is the first reported transhydrazones and quinones with a polyphenol content in the fungal root mycelia of living, dead Apia species. The biological activity of the dibasic quinones is to be expected in the above conditions, since they form spontaneously from carbohydrates and are able to form in vitro. As such, these dibasic quinones are attractive antimycotics for the management of cancer, as well as for the treatment of various cancers in different organ systems. For the treatment of non-infectious human mycoses, for example HIV-induced encephalitis, dibasic quinones can be considered as promising therapeutic weapons.


## Introduction
Amphibians are unique among metacestochous organisms in that they can colonize humans for over two billion years without undergoing a human host. This is because the bacteria are long-lived and can colonize the entire body. The microbes colonize the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the respiratory tract. They are most commonly found in the warmer, drier climates of the tropics, Africa, and Asia. They are particularly common in regions with endemic diseases, such as North America, Europe, and Asia. They are also found in tropical countries, particularly in tropical Africa, and are the most common etiological agents of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, tuberculosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The fungal species found in the oral cavity and gut are Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, and Candida lusitaniae (1).


## Methods

Mice
All mice were kept in the Laboratory of Fungal Biosciences, Department of Laboratory Animal, Federal State for Animal Experimentation (CBSFEP) (Permachuss, Germany).


## Results
 in the Indian Plain and .7 in the Moruga Plain. The disease incidence was reported to be 2.8 per 100 000 people [16]. In the Indian Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 1.4 per 100 000 people [18]. In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 0.2 per 100 000 people [18]. The incidence of this disease was reported to be 5.9 per 100 000 people [16]. The frequency of this disease is still unknown.

In the Indian Plain, there was no epidemiological information concerning the incidence of this disease, and the pathogenicity was reported to be restricted to diseased birds of the first common ancestor (i.e., the first common ancestor was the great white-colored bird of the Indian Plain). The incidence of this disease was reported to be 8.4 per 100 000 people [19]. The incidence of this disease was reported to be 1.1 per 100 000 people [16]. In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 4.1 per 100 000 people [16].

In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 0.9 per 100 000 people [16]. The frequency of this disease was reported to be 0.1 per 100 000 people [16]. The incidence of this disease was reported to be 0.5 per 100 000 people [16]. In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 0.3 per 100 000 people [16].

The incidence of this disease in the Moruga Plain was reported to be 0.5 per 100 000 people [16]. The frequency of this disease was reported to be 0.1 per 100 000 people [16]. In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 0.3 per 100 000 people [16]. In the Moruga Plain, the disease incidence was reported to be 0.3 per 100 000 people [16]. The incidence of this disease was reported to be 0.5 per 100 000 people [16].

In the Moruga Plain, the incidence of this disease was reported to be 0.5 per 100 000 people [16]. The frequency of this disease was reported to be 0.3 per 100 000 people [16].


## Discussion
This study provides a novel example of a wide range of non-type-1 and type-2 polymorphisms in a non-type-1 C. gattii strain. Our analyses, which were performed in a single strain, showed that the most prevalent polymorphism in C. gattii was in the cluster for which a single allele is common, consistent with the previous observation [16]. The type-1 and type-2 alleles are genetically close, and genetic distance is known to be important for virulence and pathogenicity in C.
