## Abstract
•Antimicrobial resistance is growing rapidly and fungi are one of the major factors contributing to this proble. •Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as one of the most significant health problems in oncology. •Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance and the resistance-resistance relationships is a key to development of novel treatments.

Fungi are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill oncology. •Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as one of the most significant health problem in oncology.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance and the resistance-resistance relationships is a key to development of novel treatments.

The model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus aureus exhibit potent antifungal activity against diverse pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), cephalosporins, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRS), multi-drug resistant (MDR) and other pathogens. The aim of the present study was to identify the molecular mechanisms of resistance in these model yeasts and to establish appropriate drugs and systems to be used to develop appropriate antifungal therapy. A database search of undescribed S. cerevisiae antifungal agents (c. 2000) was performed on Google Scholar and MicroSSU. Further support for the yeast was obtained from the literature. Several novel drugs and systems were tested for their effector mechanisms of action. Antimicrobial activities were tested against MRSA, VRS, VRS- and VRS-resistant isolates. Finally, the anti-biofilm activity of these compounds was assessed for their susceptibility to azole drugs. Finally, the interaction of these drugs with amphotericin B, flucytosine or fluconazole was tested using a large number of models including human keratitis, lung, kidney, eye and colon. The efficacy of these novel drugs and systems against resistant MRSA, VRS, VRS- and VRS-resistant isolates were tested.

We have demonstrated that the antifungal activity of the novel drugs is coupled with the existence of molecular mechanisms of resistance.


## Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends that the initial HIV testing should be performed in patients with advanced HIV (1-3) or who have previously been seropre-epidemic (4, 5. Although the diagnostic test is used, the process and outcome of the test are not optimized, resulting in a limited number of available HIV diagnostics. As a result, HIV testing has not yet been widely applied in settings with limited resources, and high rates of variability in HIV status have limited its application.

More than 25 countries have established standardized scoring instruments to monitor HIV diagnostics, such as the HIV-1 test, the HIV-C test and the HIV-H test. These instrument designs have been developed in collaboration with HIV testing organizations and the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure that diagnostics are based on the WHO guidelines and the World Health Organization (WHO) own guidelines. The current HIV tests and the HIV-C tests are not developed by government agencies (6, 7), and can be administered by private companies for testing only at low cost. In Uganda, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) HIV test center provides the baseline HIV diagnostics and clinical services for rural and urban populations. By contrast, the NICD HIV test center provides services for population-level HIV testing, which is defined as people living with HIV and testing positive for at least five clinical subgroups (8). These laboratories offer unique facilities and services to meet the demands of high-density HIV testing in low-resource settings (9). The HIV-C test centers serve as a universal point of care laboratory (COT) for HIV testing, providing rapid, easy and reliable testing across the country.

Awareness of the value of the HIV-C diagnostic test in the HIV care system and HIV-related complications will be discussed at a future meeting of the Consultative Group on HIV/AIDS Medical Research.

## Methods
The challenge was performed in a second laboratory for a patient with a non-HIV infectio. This second laboratory was a microbiology laboratory.

The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREEC) of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (TRCEF-CPRH) and the UNAIDS under protocol number 16091-01. The patient was identified as a patient with AIDS. The patients were classified as those with an AIDS-related immunodeficiencies: AIDS-related immunodeficiencies were those with a cell count >100 cells/mm^3. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 20 individuals. Each group was administered 100 µl of a 20 mg/mL solution of P. gingivalis LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then were tested at different time intervals for antifungal activity. The serum levels of antifungal agents were determined by the ELISA method as previously described [12].

The pathogen was isolated from a patient with HIV infection. The patient was identified as the clinical and microbiology laboratory representative of the patients. The laboratory performed an ELISA on the samples and determined the pathogen on the samples with the indicated dilutions. The pathogen was maintained on culture media and stored at -80°C.

The study was performed at the Infectious Disease Institute of the University of Stirling (IDI) School of Medicine, University of São Paulo (UTEP). The study was approved by the Human Investigation and Ethics Committee (HOPE) of the University of São Paulo, and the local ethical committee of the hospital (No. 89/2012).

Infection and Control
The antifungal activity of P. gingivalis LPS was determined by the method described previously [12]. Briefly, the initial 24 h of culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and then the supernatant was removed and diluted to a final concentration of 10 µM. The final drug concentration was 1 mg/mL. The culture medium was removed and the pellet was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).


## Results
Identification of the Proteins of M. cerevisiae

A detailed analysis of the proteomic proteome of M. cerevisiae was carried out using the rRNA probe, which revealed a total of 888,624 and 879,720 protein-encoding genes, respectively (Table 1). The results showed that the proteome of M. cerevisiae was characterized by a highly diverse set of proteases, especially those for the production of proteases (Table 1). The most abundant species in the proteomic proteomic proteome were the KPN family of proteins (Table 1). KPNs are proteins of the KPN5 family of proteins and are members of the KPN3 and KPN4 families of proteins. The KPN2 family of proteins and KPN2 family of proteins were the most abundant species in the proteomic proteome, with an average of 85.5% and 47.6% of the proteomic proteome, respectively. The KPN family of proteins was characterized by the KPN4 family of proteins and KPN3 and KPN4 families of proteins (Table 1). The KPN family of proteins was characterized by the KPN2 family of proteins and KPN4 family of proteins (Table 1). The KPN family of proteins was characterized by the KPN4 family of proteins and KPN3 and KPN4 families of proteins (Table 1). The KPN2 family of proteins was characterized by the KPN4 family of proteins and KPN3 and KPN4 families of proteins (Table 1). The KPN family of proteins was characterized by the KPN4 family of proteins and KPN3 and KPN4 families of proteins (Table 1).


## Discussion
However, in the recent years, efforts have been made to improve the HIV care continuum in Ugandan. We have begun to implement improvements in HIV care in the HIV care continuum in Uganda by adding weekly HIV counselling and a stakeholder education program [38], which is a pilot project in Uganda to test the impact of community-based interventions in HIV care. In addition, we have expanded access to care in HIV care and improved access to care for HIV patients in Kampala, Uganda, which is a centre for advanced HIV in Uganda. There is also a large community-based organisation that provides early warning for the emergence of new and emerging diseases and to the timely provision of care for vulnerable individuals [39]. There are also improvements in the HIV care continuum in Uganda by increasing community education and support, which are in line with those in Uganda [40].

The Ugandan HIV care continuum is a sound model of a much more inclusive community-based HIV care continuum. A comprehensive comparison of the Ugandan HIV care continuum for advanced HIV is needed to assess the impact of community-based interventions in HIV care in Uganda and to further examine these interventions in HIV care. While we have completed our research, there are still gaps in our understanding of the HIV care continuum in Uganda. Our knowledge of the HIV care continuum in Uganda is important to understand the impact of community-based interventions in HIV care. The Ugandan HIV care continuum, which was created in Uganda in 2002, is expanded to include HIV patients with advanced HIV capacity, which would further enhance HIV care in Uganda. There is currently no dedicated treatment program in Uganda for HIV.
