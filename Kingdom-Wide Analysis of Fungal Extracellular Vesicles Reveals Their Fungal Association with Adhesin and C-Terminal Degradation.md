## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the major opportunistic fungal pathogens of humans. Not only is this fungal pathogen capable of causing fatal invasive infections, it can also become resistant to anti-fungal drugs. The fungal cell wall is an essential organelle that ensures the availability of nutrients and the defense against anti-fungal stressors. The microenvironment in the cell wall of A. fumigatus is regulated by numerous factors, such as pH, temperature, oxidative stress, light, hormonal status, light on, and pH, among other effects. To decipher the evolution of the cell wall-related genes in the A. fumigatus genome and to understand the importance of this complex microenvironment in virulence, we undertook a genome-wide analysis of the fungal cell wall microbiome. We identified a large number of genes that are absent in the human genome. We found that the genomes of A. fumigatus are enriched for genes encoding glycosyltransferases, DNA mismatch repair, and xenobiotic biosynthetic genes. We found that a large number of genes are under conserved or novel regulatory roles. Finally, we provide the first large genome sequence of a fungal pathogen and a well-supported explanation of the current understanding of the fungal cell wall microbiome.


## Introduction
The genus Exophiala contains over 200 species of phoretopharyngeal fungi with well-characterized sexual and asexual reproductive structures, which are most commonly found in the mycelial, sporocarial and sexual stages [1, 2].


## Methods
albicans yeast cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and the . oryzae strain, as described in [19] and [21] for the isolation of extracellular vesicles. Fungal cells were harvested from LB plates, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended to an OD_600 of 0.8 in PBS. The fungal suspension was centrifuged at 4000×g for 10 min at 4°C to separate extracellular vesicles from the cell wall. The extracellular vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 4000×g for 10 min at 4°C and washed twice with PBS. The collected extracellular vesicles were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and further centrifuged at 4000×g at 4°C to separate extracellular vesicles. The collected extracellular vesicles were re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS, and the supernatant was transferred to a 1 mL tube for RNA extraction. RNA was isolated using a RiboPure™ Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was treated with DNaseI (Sigma-Aldrich) and reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All reactions were performed in duplicate and the data were analyzed using the BioRad CFX Manager (BioRad).

Fungal microarray data analysis
The data was obtained from an in-house based microarray library, using a combination of 18 fungal species (C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. lusitaniae, C. kefyr, C. asiatica, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. kefyr, C. asiatica, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. kefyr, and C. kefyr), three of which are filamentous fungi. The data sets were generated with a mixture of Geneious Pro v. 7.5.


## Results
Our previous study revealed that the fungal exosome is a major source of fungal V-ATPase in fungi [8. Therefore, we examined whether extracellular vesicles in C. albicans and C. neoformans were associated with the exosome. We detected extracellular vesicles in both species by using a calnexin-specific antibody. Vesicles from both species were enriched in the exosome by measuring extracellular vesicles from the same tissue (Figure 1A). We found that C. albicans and C. neoformans extracellular vesicles were enriched in the C-terminal portion of the C-terminal portion of the exosome, while extracellular vesicles from C. neoformans were enriched in the C-terminal portion of the exosome (Figure 1B). In addition, we found that C. albicans and C. neoformans extracellular vesicles were enriched in the C-terminal portion of the exosome, while extracellular vesicles from C. neoformans were enriched in the C-terminal portion of the exosome (Figure 1B). These results demonstrated that the extracellular vesicles of C. albicans and C. neoformans were enriched in the C-terminal portion of the C-terminal portion of the exosome.

Exosome Extracellular Vesicles from C. albicans and C. neoformans Were Infrequently Infrequent and Likely to Be Nonviable Progenitors
We next determined whether C. albicans and C. neoformans exosome vesicles were highly abundant and likely to be nonviable progenitor. First, we determined the number of exosomes that were nonviable by using an in-gel method. In total, 636,245 exosome exosomes were measured in our study. We found that the number of exosomes in C. albicans and C. neoformans were more similar than that in C. albicans and C. neoformans (Figure 2). After two passages, we found that C. albicans and C.


## Discussion
We also detected numerous vesicles with low molecular weight (.5 × 10^6 protein). The protein composition of the fungal extracellular vesicles is similar to that of the phytoalexin clade. However, a few proteins present in this clade (i.e., sequences of the orthologs of the kinetoplastid kinetoplastids and phytoalexin clades) are highly divergent from the kinetoplastid and phytoalexin proteins, indicating that the fungal extracellular vesicles might have diverged significantly from those of the phytoalexin clade. In addition, the fungal extracellular vesicles have been identified in a number of fungal species. For example, some fungal extracellular vesicles have been found in plants, bacteria and animals, and others in animals and fungi. The role of fungal extracellular vesicles in the pathogenicity of certain fungi is controversial. It is known that certain fungal species have a mating system that is unique to each species and that the mating system of the fungal species is highly divergent [36], [37]. In our study, we identified a large number of proteins with high molecular weight and similarity to the kinetoplastid kinetoplastids. The relative abundance of proteins of the kinetoplastid and phytoalexin clades suggests that the fungal extracellular vesicles might have originated from different species.

We observed that the fungal extracellular vesicles contain a significant number of proteins with high molecular weight and similarity to proteins of the kinetoplastid kinetoplastids. We also observed a significant number of proteins with high molecular weight and similarity to proteins of the phytoalexin clade. The phytoalexin and kinetoplastid clades are highly divergent and differ in their ability to degrade human DNA. The ability of phytoalexin and kinetoplastid species to degrade human DNA is highly conserved [38], [39], [40].
