## Abstract
Aetiology in immunocompromised patients is the most common complication, followed by immunodeficiency and other pathologies. The diagnosis of cryptococcosis is often delayed because of poor clinical outcome or failure of the C-reactive protein (CRP) system. Central nervous system (CNS) malignant transformation is the most common method of diagnosis of cryptococcosis. However, it is challenging to start with it, because there is no rapid, specific, and affordable way to perform the molecular and molecular autopsy.

We report a case of CNS malignant transformation in a 28-year-old immunocompetent female with HIV and tuberculous lesions in a tertiary care hospital. The patient was a 57-year-old woman who had not received any immunosuppressant and a low-dose methylprednisolone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive perivascular and peritoneal lesions. The brain biopsy revealed abundant cryptococcal granuloma cells. A cytology and biopsy of the brain biopsy revealed the presence of a tumor and of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF.

This is the first reported case of CNS malignant transformation in a patient receiving immunosuppressant and a low dose methylprednisolone. Adrenal and peritoneal-derived macrophages were reported as the most appropriate imaging therapeutic target in this patient.


## Introduction
Iron is an essential element for all living organisms and is required for the functioning of almost all biological processes. Moreover, iron serves as a redox mediator in many biochemical reactions in all living organisms, including cell signaling, protein synthesis, and developmental processes. Iron is a cofactor in many enzymes, including metalloproteases, lipases, and catabolic enzymes. Iron is also an essential trace element for many cellular processes, including electron transport, lipid metabolism, and metabolic processes (1-3). Iron is also necessary for many essential cellular processes, such as respiration, biofilm formation, and for the catalytic function of the cytochrome c oxidase (4).


## Methods
. Microorganism and Media
Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (C. albicans ATCC 90028) was used as the wild type strain in this study. For the culture, C. albicans was grown at 30°C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or YPD medium (1% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) for 2 days. For the RNA extraction, C. albicans was grown in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 2 days. For the DNA extraction, C. albicans was grown in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 2 days.

2.2. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
RNA was extracted from C. albicans using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.


## Results
marneffei pyrG-miRNA, we performed a gene ontology (GO) analysis of the . marneffei pyrG-miRNA sequence. First, we assessed if the pyrG-miRNA could be assigned to a cellular process by using the Pareto-specific gene ontology (GO) term “Protein Pyrimidine Oxidase Activity” (PPA; see Table S1). In this analysis, we used the presence of the pyrG-miRNA in the genome of a T. marneffei strain that was recently shown to be virulent in vitro [7]. We identified 733 genes that were significantly up-regulated and 690 genes that were down-regulated in the pyrG-miRNA strain (Figure 4). The GO terms for up-regulated genes in the pyrG-miRNA strain were “biosynthetic gene activity” (GO:001604.1), “protein export from precursor” (GO:0017713.1), “protein kinase activity” (GO:0045124.1), “protein secretion” (GO:0015584.1), “protein transport” (GO:0018002.1), “response to stress” (GO:0055163.1), “response to environmental stress” (GO:0020868.1), “response to environmental stress” (GO:0069230.1), “response to oxidative stress” (GO:0078018.1), “response to osmotic stress” (GO:0050179.1), “response to ultraviolet radiation” (GO:0022552.1), “response to carbon source” (GO:0049502.1), “response to osmotic stress” (GO:0028491.1), “response to ionic stress” (GO:0017083.1), “response to heat stress” (GO:002430.1), “response to oxidative stress” (GO:0014819.1), “response to carbon source” (GO:0015942.


## Discussion
The treatment of viral diseases is evolving and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find effective and effective therapies for these disease. Treatment of viral diseases is a complex and complex process. The individual susceptibility and specificity of the virus for certain diseases, such as COPD and HIV infection, may be very different from others, and these differences may also play a role in the diseases caused by HIV infection [53].

The use of ART in HIV infected individuals is important for the prevention of morbidity and mortality, and to prevent them from developing opportunistic infections. The development of ART in HIV infected individuals is well documented, with the median CD4 counts of patients at this time ranging from 60 to 100 cells/µl [54]. In this study, the CD4 counts of HIV infected individuals ranged from 48 to 249 cells/µl, with an average of 1.6 cells/µl of ART. This can be explained by the fact that HIV infection can occur in HIV infected individuals only in small quantities, with CD4 counts ranging from 200 to 3200 cells/µl [54]. ART has been used in HIV patients in South Africa, with very low CD4 counts in HIV infected individuals [54]. ART has been used for various diseases such as COPD, EBV and SLE, as well as in other infections such as sepsis and meningitis [55]. The use of ART in HIV infected individuals has been widely documented in the literature, with the median CD4 cell counts of HIV infected individuals ranging from 60 to 100 cells/µl [54]. This is in contrast to HIV infection where the CD4 counts of HIV infected individuals are usually 200 to 200 cells/µl, with a median CD4 cell count of 638 cells/µl [55]. The use of ART in HIV infected individuals has been associated with a reduction in the risk of death from HIV infection [54].

The number of cases of cryptococcosis, cryptococcosis and cryptococcosis in HIV infected individuals has been reported to be only about 1% in HIV infected individuals [56]. The number of cases of cryptococcosis is now greater than in the past, with the HIV population being the main cause of cryptococcosis [57].

Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that has the ability to cause disseminated meningitis [58].
