## Abstract
Necrotizing fasciitis with cryptococcal meningitis is a rare condition with few reports. The main etiology of this complication is Cryptococcus neoformans, which has received more attention recently. The purpose of this study was to determine the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis with cryptococcal meningitis in order to guide diagnosis and treatment. A total of 30 cases with 30 episodes from June 2016 to June 2018 were included in this study.


## Introduction
Since the endophytes colonize their epiphytic hosts, they may be considered as the most infectious microorganisms in the host, and their elimination by the host immune system is often followed by the development of a life-threatening infection called epiphytosis.1-3 A recent analysis of the epidemic of candidiasis in the United States highlighted that only about 1% of candidemia cases were reported to be epiphytic.4 As a result, the global incidence of candidemia has remained low, and there are no national guidelines for the diagnosis of candidemia in the United States.5 The worldwide incidence of candidemia is approximately 10%, and it is a sight-threatening condition.

Candida albicans is a normal commensal organism in the gastrointestinal tract. In healthy individuals, it is a harmless commensal of the skin, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. However, when the microbiome is altered, the risk of developing candidiasis increases, and the rate of development of candidiasis has a higher mortality rate than that of bacterial candidemia.6 There are two major types of Candida species. Type I Candida species are commensal organisms and can survive and grow in a variety of environmental conditions, such as the warm-blooded environment and the warm-blooded environment. The type II and type III species are pathogenic yeasts. Candida albicans can survive and grow in the host environment and can cause systemic infections in the immunocompromised, such as neutropenic patients and hospitalized patients. In neutropenic patients, the normal microbiota of the gut and skin are normal.


## Methods
tuberculosis (ATCC number 006/09), . avium (ATCC number 2062/09), M. kluyveri (ATCC number 621/13), and M. tuberculosis (ATCC number 92/09) at concentrations of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 µg/mL and 0.05, respectively.

We evaluated the antifungal activity of Lactoferrin and Enteric Antifungal Drugs (LEC) against the M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. kluyveri, M. kluyveri korikova, M. kluyveri korikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, and M. kluyveri kurikova at concentrations of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 µg/mL and 0.05, respectively.

A dual assays were conducted as described previously [49]. We measured the antifungal activity of Lactoferrin and Enteric Antifungal Drugs (LEC) against M. tuberculosis, M. kluyveri, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, M. kluyveri kurikova, and M. kluyveri kurikova at concentrations of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 µg/mL and 0.05, respectively.

We assessed the antifungal activity of Lactoferrin and Enteric Antifungal Drugs (EUC) against M.


## Results
After 24 h of exposure, the average MIC of Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs was 10 µg/ml and .2 µg/ml, respectively (Table 3). Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs significantly reduced the MICs of Lactococcus spp. of 24 h of exposure to L. pneumophila ATCC 9231 (0.12 µg/ml) in comparison to the MICs of L. pneumophila ATCC 9231 and L. pneumophila L14 (0.12 µg/ml) and 0.2 µg/ml of L. pneumophila L14 in the first 24 h. The MICs of Lactococcus spp. were also reduced by 0.2 µg/ml of Lactococcus L14 in comparison to the MICs of Lactococcus spp. in the first 24 h. Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs significantly reduced the MICs of Lactococcus spp. of 24 h of exposure to L. pneumophila ATCC 9231 in comparison to the MICs of Lactococcus spp. in the first 24 h (Table 3). These results were in accordance with the MICs of Lactococcus spp. and L. pneumophila L14 in the first 24 h.

Sensitivity and Efficacy of Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs against Multidrug Resistant Bacteria in the Laboratory
A total of 202 isolates were tested for susceptibility to Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs using the Fisher's exact test (Table 4). The MICs of Lactoferrin and Enteral Antifungal Drugs were significantly lower than the MICs of Lactococcus spp. in the first 24 h of exposure to L. pneumophila ATCC 9231 (0.12 µg/ml) and L. pneumophila L14 (0.12 µg/ml) in comparison to the MICs of Lactococcus spp. in the first 24 h (Table 4).


## Discussion
We have described two cases of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in a patient with recent cryptococcosis. One patient was a 20-year-old male with a history of skin and nail infections. The other patient was a 31-year-old male with a history of smoking. Both patients had previously been treated with fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, and flucytosine. While voriconazole and flucytosine have been associated with reduced mortality, in vitro susceptibility testing of these agents has been associated with increased mortality. To date, there have been no case reports of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in a patient with cryptococcosis.

Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis is a rare disease in humans. The diagnosis is made by culture of CSF, serum cryptococcal antigen, and serum cryptococcal antigen test [3]. The serum cryptococcal antigen test has been recommended in patients with meningoencephalitis in recent years [3]. In our case, the patient was a 22-year-old male with a history of skin and nail infections. Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in patients with meningoencephalitis is rare and is thought to be uncommon in patients with history of cryptococcosis [2]. In our patient, the patient was a male with a history of having a history of skin and nail infections. This patient had a history of recent skin and nail infection and presented with persistent headache, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status.

Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis is an uncommon disease in humans. It is usually caused by the serotype A Cryptococcus neoformans strain isolated from environmental sources. It has also been associated with an increased risk of death and morbidity and mortality [2]. Other authors have reported that a serotype A Cryptococcus strain was isolated from a patient with tuberculosis [2]. In our patient, the patient had a history of skin and nail infections and presented with headache and nausea and vomiting.

The etiology of the meningoencephalitis is still unknown. Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis is a rare disease in humans. It is usually associated with a cryptococcal strain isolated from environmental sources [2].
