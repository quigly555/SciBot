## Abstract
We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a treatment-naïve patient with extrapulmonary abscess caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. A 78-year-old man with diabetes presented with a two-month history of abdominal pain and vomiting and acute abdominal distention for the first time. Initial laboratory values were normal. His blood pressure was slightly elevated and there was a slight thromboembolism. He was treated with amphotericin B, flucytosine and fluconazole, and was later diagnosed to have cryptococcal meningitis. Amphotericin B was continued and the patient was treated with voriconazole. He received 10 days of fluconazole and recovered fully.

## Introduction
Histoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining opportunistic fungal infection that affects both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. [1] The incidence of histoplasmosis has declined substantially over the past several decades due to the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, the increase in patients with HIV infection and the growing population of patients with organ transplants and neutropenia. [2] However, mortality from histoplasmosis is high, with fatal outcomes of up to 80% in HIV patients. [3] This is associated with poor response to antifungal therapy and highly-toxic drugs. [4], [5] A clear understanding of the biology of histoplasmosis is needed to develop a more effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of this disease.

In a model system, the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that grows as mycelia in the environment and as yeast in the mammalian host. The growth phase begins with the release of conidia from the mycelia. These propagules are dispersed into the yeast and mycelial phase, where cells differentiate into hyphal cells and divide. Hyphal cells then proliferate in the cystic form. The fungus is capable of multiple transitions in the yeast and mycelium, depending on the cellular environment. Yeast cells germinate into conidia, while mycelial cells differentiate into hyphal forms. When the hyphal form reaches 24 hours, the hyphal forms are arrested and the conidia are released into the air. When the conidia are released into the cystic form, the formation of hyphal cells is arrested again and the conidia are released into the cyst. Then, a new state of the mycelia is formed, and the conidia differentiate into hyphal cells. A characteristic feature of yeast cells is the production of an unbranched, extracellular matrix. Complex interactions between yeast and mycelial cells have been shown to be important for the development of the yeast-mycelium transition, as well as for its virulence.


## Methods
This study was carried out by using information from the National Health Census of Chin. The data collection and analysis was carried out according to the guidelines and regulations of the Ministry of Health (MHA) and the country and the five countries as well as the information on the study participants.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Global Health Sciences of China (NIMHSSC #730, June 30, 2016). The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines and regulations of the NIMHSSC.

The study was carried out using a standardized data collection system, which was designed to enable the evaluation of the epidemiology and risk assessment of Cryptococcus and Tuberculosis in this country. The data collection system is comprised of an electronic surveillance system (EMTS) for identifying, analyzing, and/or calling Cryptococcus, Tuberculosis, and fungi in China, and the implementation of the system is based on a commercial database of Cryptococcus, Tuberculosis, and fungi. This system enables the evaluation of the country’s epidemiologic characteristics, its national and local characteristics, and its inter- national differences, as well as the collection of information on the population and prevalence of Cryptococcus, Tuberculosis, and fungi. The EMTS was performed with the most recent date recorded by the user.

## Results
. Liang & L. Yang, published an original Chinese herbal medicine, The Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine, which was established in 1768 (Liu & Yang 2016). The Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine had no clue about the Chinese medicinal and traditional Chinese medicine. However, the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners were very helpful in their understanding of the Chinese medicine and the Chinese traditional medicine practices. In this study, the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine was established in 1768 by Liu & Yang (2016) as an authentic Chinese medicine.

In the current study, the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine and Chinese traditional medicine practitioners have developed a new understanding of Chinese traditional medicine. In this study, the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine has two main pillars in Chinese medicine: (1) The wisdom of the Chinese medicine practitioners was to be shared with those in the other countries, (2) The wisdom of the Chinese medicine practitioners was to be common to the countries, and (3) The wisdom of the Chinese medicine practitioners was to be present in all the medicine- practitioners.

The Chinese traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have been in the process of evolving from the traditional Chinese medicine to the new Chinese medicine. In this study, the Chinese traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have developed a new understanding of Chinese traditional medicine, which has been to be common to the countries. This study provides further evidence that the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine is an authentic Chinese medicine.

## Discussion
Although this does not preclude the possibility of invasive fungal infections, the host immune system remains intact and their proliferation remains uncontrolled (2. While many factors may be involved in the induction of immune responses in the setting of fungal infection, it is important to recognize that most fungal infections are associated with the immune system. The use of immunosuppressive agents has been shown to be associated with the development of fungal infections, such as Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (4). This study demonstrates that the primary immune response in these individuals is monoclonal antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors (data not shown). The primary immune response in these individuals is the Th1 and Th17 response, with the majority of individuals presenting with the presence of T cells. This study demonstrates that this immune response is exacerbated in the setting of fungal infection, as monocytes and monocytes are the predominant cell types that express TNF-a and IFN-<U+03B3> in vitro. This study also demonstrates that the majority of individuals presenting with fungal infection have antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes (data not shown).

In this study, we demonstrate that the majority of individuals presenting with fungal infection have antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors (data not shown). In contrast, individuals presenting with dermatophytic infections have antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors (data not shown).

Our data demonstrate that a higher proportion of individuals presenting with dermatophytic infections have antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors. These antibodies have been shown to be exacerbated in the setting of dermatophytic infection, with the majority of individuals presenting with fungal infection having antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors. This contrasts with other studies that have demonstrated that individuals presenting with dermatophytic infection have a significantly higher proportion of individuals with HIV infection producing a higher proportion of antibodies (6, 9). In this study, we demonstrated that the majority of individuals presenting with dermatophytic infection have antibodies that are produced by monocytes and monocytes from the same donors.
