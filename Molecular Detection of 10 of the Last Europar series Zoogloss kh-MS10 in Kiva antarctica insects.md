## Abstract
Fungal infection is a common cause of severe febrile illness and death in hospitals and intensive care units. Multiple pathogens can cause infection in the immune system, including mycobacteria, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus. Candida is the most common fungal pathogen and is the causative agent of invasive candidiasis. Fungal infection is often fatal without obvious complications, often requiring a neutropenia and/or infection-induced renal nephritis. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a finding of severe and rapidly worsening symptoms and a high mortality rate in fungal infections. The authors report the case of a 68-year-old immunocompetent female who developed symptoms and signs of invasive candidiasis. She was treated with combination therapy of methotrexate, itraconazole, and voriconazole. She also developed renal failure and died of acute respiratory failure at 2 months. Autopsy disclosed numerous, infected fungal hyphae in the respiratory tract. This report highlights the complexity of fungal infections caused by Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Candida, and highlights the need for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms by which these fungal pathogens cause infection.


## Introduction
The genus Conchosporaceae (Euboea, Deuteromycetes) is widely distributed in the Southern Hemisphere and can be found in the tropics, temperate regions, and temperate grasslands [1]. This family includes approximately 150 species, many of which are pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants [2]. The genus Conchosporaceae was proposed by Gams (1918) to accommodate C. elegans, which was introduced from the Dominican Republic in 1798 [3]. Species are characterised by their association with various plant hosts and can be found in numerous genera of genera in the family Conchosporaceae [4,5].

The genus Conchosporaceae is typified by C. fijiensis, which was first described by Thiers [6]. Since then, several species of this genus have been found as plant pathogenic, as colonisers of roots, branches, petioles, or wounds in various natural settings [7]. For example, C. fijiensis is found on dead leaves of Eucalyptus and Eucalyptus trees in Spain [8], and C. fijiensis on Quercus trees in China [9]. In addition, C. fijiensis was recently reported from Eucalyptus trees in India [10].

The genus Conchosporaceae was proposed by Gams (1918) to accommodate C. fijiensis, which was first described from Quercus trees in India and subsequently from Eucalyptus in China [6]. Previously, the genus Conchosporaceae was distinguished from C. fijiensis by Gams (1918) because of the presence of the apical appendages and “paracapillae” [6].


## Methods
In particular, ITS region of the major fungal gene (ITS1-.


## Results
-).5-7.5(-8.5) mM Methylurea Methanol (2.2-)2.6-3.6(-4.5) mM Calciferate (1.2-)1.3-1.6(-2.2) of the last (6.5-)6.5-7.5 mM Methylurea Methanol (2.2-)2.6-3.6(-4.5) mM Calciferate in Kiva antarctica insects was estimated to be less than 2-fold (Table 2).

The MIC (Table 2) was 64.5 µg/ml (v/v) for Kiva antarctica insects; in case of the 12-hour course, it was 2-fold (0.5-0.7 µg/ml) higher than in the case of the 12-hour course (0.3-0.5 µg/ml) and was in the range of concentration of MIC (Table 2). In addition, the MIC of the 10^th (6.5-)6.5-7.5 mM Methylurea Methanol (2.2-)2.6-3.6(-4.5) mM Calciferate in Kiva antarctica insects was determined to be 3.5-fold higher than the MIC for the last (6.5-)6.5-7.5 mM Methylurea Methanol (2.2-)2.6-3.6(-4.5) mM Calciferate in Kiva antarctica insects.

Kiva antarctica insect larval development
After larval development, the larvae were transferred to fresh air for the next 24 h and these organs were harvested at 7-day intervals. The highest number of eggs produced was found in the first week post injection (Fig 1A). The female eggs were recovered from the first week post injection (Fig 1B) and the adult eggs showed a small and slow development, which were comparable to the other two groups. In the first week post injection, the larval development was very rapid and the number of ascospore development was similar to the other two groups (Fig 1C). The eggshells of the larvae developed normally and the mother egg developed a normal, smooth, long, and large body.


## Discussion
amstelae and . siamensis. The proteins were subjected to Protein Data Bank (PDB) analyses and the numbers of the putative interactions were compared to the protein sequences obtained in the present study.

Although V. siamensis and V. krusei have been considered as close relatives, V. krusei is distinct from the V. siamensis-V. krusei-V. krusei complex. The similarities in protein sequences between V. krusei and the V. siamensis-V. krusei complex in terms of the evolutionary history, the presence of mating-type genes and the presence of paralogous proteins suggest that V. siamensis and V. krusei are closely related species in the V. siamensis complex. V. krusei and V. siamensis are closely related to V. siamensis and V. siamensis are closely related to V. krusei, suggesting that V. siamensis and V. krusei are sisters.

Furthermore, the sequences of the conserved amino acids residues in the former protein complex were analyzed in the present study. This has been demonstrated in a previous study (De Beer et al., 2008). Although the conserved amino acids residues in V. siamensis were identified as the same amino acid residues as in the V. krusei complex, the analysis of the conserved amino acid residues was not carried out in this study. Our analysis also revealed that V. siamensis and V. krusei are closely related species in the V. siamensis complex. V. krusei has been isolated from the soil of vineyard plantations and is the second most common genus in vineyards. The identification of V. krusei and V. siamensis as close relatives suggested that V. siamensis and V. krusei could be related to V. siamensis. The phylogenetic analysis of the V. siamensis and V. krusei gene sequences also indicated that V. siamensis and V. krusei are closely related species. It is also known that V. siamensis has the ability to form heteroresidia and produce truella (Romero et al., 2010). The identification of V. siamensis as the close relative of V.
