## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging killer pathogen of humans causing community and meningitis. Exposure to this pathogen produces hydrogen peroxide, which is toxic to humans and animals. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein kinase Rsp1 is conserved in fungi and is critical for fungal pathogenicity. We previously identified Rsp1 as a downstream factor of inositol-rich proteins, including the major virulence factors of the pathogenic yeast-like fungus Ustilago maydis. Deletion of Rsp1 reduces virulence of U. gatti in a mouse model of pulmonary infection, and we propose that Rsp1 is a critical determinant of fungal virulence. Using an inositol-free mouse model of infection, we demonstrated that Rsp1 is required for U. gatti pathogenicity. Using RNA sequencing and expression analysis, we found that Rsp1 is regulated by the conserved GATA transcription factor Flo8 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase Fpd1. Our results suggest that Rsp1 is a regulator of the ER stress response and the ER stress response pathway in C. gattii. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Rsp1 is essential for growth of U. gatti in a dose-dependent manner and that knockdown of Rsp1 mitogen-activated kinase Fpd1 renders U. gatti pathogenicity.


## Introduction
The fungus Candida albicans is the most common etiological agent of candidiasis, which is associated with severe and severe infections, including deep-seated candidiasis [1]. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus, found on a wide variety of body surfaces, such as skin, mucus, and prostheses, and also in various types of medical implants such as catheters, prostheses for urinary devices, catheters for catheters, prosthetic joints, and prostheses for the use of the urinary catheter [2]. Although the incidence of invasive candidiasis has increased in the past decades, the incidence of invasive candidiasis remains low in healthy individuals, even though candidiasis caused by C. albicans is still an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients [3,4]. Although C. albicans is the most common cause of candidiasis in the population, it is also the most common cause of death in patients with underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, organ and bone marrow transplant patients, and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [5]. The ability of Candida to invade the bloodstream is related to its ability to acquire extracellular and intracellular sugars, which can then be secreted by the yeast to be transported into the host cells, which subsequently metabolize the sugars into glucose and fructose for subsequent degradation by the host cellular machinery [6,7]. Apart from the secreted sugars, other sugars, such as fructose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate, are secreted by Candida species during infection [8,9]. This process is regulated by the physiological and environmental conditions, such as temperature, oxygen, and pH.


## Methods
In this study, we used the cell-specific two-dimensional (2D) cell-state functional networks (CNS) to study the impact of leishmaniasis on the role of Leishmania in wound healin. The SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis analysis was performed by synthesizing a 250 mM sucrose solution, then treating the gel with 0.1% SDS for 15 min, and then the protein bands were purified and subjected to western blot analysis. The purified proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and then isolated from E. coli BL21 cells. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis using a loading control and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were identified by western blot analysis and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Antibody production and immunoblotting
SDS-PAGE was performed to determine the activities of leishmaniasis-specific antibodies against the human leishmanin antigen (HSA; 1 Âµg/ml; Pfizer, Germany) using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). The activity of the antigens was determined by determining their absorbance at 405 nm. The assay was performed with three biological replicates (one for each of the four leishmanin types) per treatment. The activity of the leishmanin antigens was defined as the amount of protein that produced a peak intensity at 405 nm, and the absorbance of the peak intensity at 405 nm was measured in the same conditions. The activity of the secondary antibody was also defined as the amount of protein that produced a peak intensity at 405 nm, and the absorbance of the peak intensity at 405 nm was measured in the same conditions. The activity of the second antibody was defined as the amount of protein that produced a peak intensity at 405 nm, and the absorbance of the peak intensity at 405 nm was measured in the same conditions.

## Results

In order to address the key question of whether Leishmania other than Candida glabrata is a member of the paraviruses of the entomopathogenic order, we investigated the effects of Leishmania other than Candida glabrata on the germination of Candida albican.

The first step of the embryonic stage of Candida is germination. We have shown that a critical role of Leishmania other than Candida glabrata in the germination of Candida albicans is a prerequisite for the successful development of Candida. Furthermore, the induction of the Candida growth in the absence of Leishmania promotes Candida resistance [37].

To investigate the role of Leishmania other than Candida glabrata in the germination of Candida albicans, we generated a mutant of L. donovani (Ld. donovani-1) and evaluated the effects of Leishmania other than Candida glabrata on the growth of Candida albicans.

In order to determine the impact of Leishmania other than Candida on the growth of Candida albicans, we generated a L. donovani-Ld.donovani-1 strain (Ld.donovani-1) and then tested the growth of Candida albicans in the absence of Leishmania.

We found that the L. donovani-Ld.donovani-1 strain does not germinate after 24 hours in the presence of Leishmania (Figure 2).

These results indicate that Leishmania other than Candida glabrata is not a member of the paraviruses of the entomopathogenic order of Candida.

We found that the L. donovani-Ld.donovani-1 strain does not germinate after 24 hours in the presence of Leishmania (Figure 2).


## Discussion
In the current study, we report for the first time that Leishmania scleral-binding protein phosphorylates its own components, in addition to the lysosomal cargo, to enhance the growth of the fungus in various wound conditions (Figure 2. The function of Leishmania scleral-binding protein in wound healing and wound invasion remains to be determined.

The ability of Leishmania to induce hyphal growth and conidiation is consistent with previous findings, in which the Leishmania scleral-binding protein was shown to promote hyphal formation and conidiation [27]. We demonstrated that the protein phosphorylated by Leishmania scleral-binding protein was required for the development and development of the fungus in vitro. We also demonstrated that the fungus was capable of inducing hyphal growth and conidiation in vitro. These results indicate that the Leishmania scleral-binding protein has an essential role in wound healing and fungal invasion.

The expression of the leishmanicidal protein, e.g., Leishmania sp. 1, was upregulated by the addition of leukotriene H3. This protein is involved in the invasion of host tissues by Leishmania scleral-binding protein [28]. However, no leukotriene H3 was detected in our data, suggesting that the protein may play a more minor role.

In addition to the Leishmania scleral-binding protein, the gene product of Leishmania scleral-binding protein, FKBP12, was upregulated in infected tissues (Figure 2A). FKBP12 is a member of the core-karyotic acyl-CoA superfamily, which is a major component of the acyl-CoA superfamily of lipids and protein [29]. Leishmania scleral-binding protein FKBP12 is also involved in the synthesis of lipids and protein. Additionally, the protein FKBP12 was detected in infected tissues of the infected mice (Figure 2B). Although the expression of FKBP12 in infected tissues was not significantly different from the WT or infected mice, the fungal-specific factor FKBP12 was found to be upregulated (Figure 2C).
