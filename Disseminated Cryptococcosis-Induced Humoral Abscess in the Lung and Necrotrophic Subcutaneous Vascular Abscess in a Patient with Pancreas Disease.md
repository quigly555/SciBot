## Abstract
We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with AIDS presented with an atypical skin lesions, followed by acute respiratory illness and multiple hemorrhagic lesions over a 6-month period. She was diagnosed with multiple myeloma of the basal leptomeningese thymus and treated with flucytosine and cytotoxic lateral to splenic lymph node. She had a favorable outcome with residual, but not persistent, fever and decreased grade four grade four grade three grade two grade two grade 1a grade change of 0.5. She was treated with liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole. Her fever and altered grade four grade 1a grade 1a grade change were unchanged over a year. She had a favorable outcome with fluconazole-ribavir-susceptible strain A395. She had a favorable outcome with continued intravenous administration of amphotericin and oral verapamil. She had a favorable outcome with continued oral immunosuppressive therapy.


## Introduction
Over the past decade, the number of reported cases of fungal infections has increased significantly, most notably among solid organ transplant (SOT) patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (1). Moreover, the number of patients with CF patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is increasingly increasing (>10%) (2, 3). These clinical features are observed in patients with cystic fibrosis, and the high incidence of fungal infections in the SOT population is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates (4).

Among the various opportunistic fungal infections, the most common are dermatophytosis, candidiasis, mucormycosis, and others. Among them, invasive fungal infections are the most common. Despite the widespread use of antifungal drugs, morbidity and mortality due to invasive fungal infections are increasing (5). The incidence of candidiasis and mucormycosis varies from country to country and depends on many factors, including the site and patient site and the patient population. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in SOT patients in Thailand is about 2.6 cases per 100 000 (6). The most common invasive fungal disease in SOT patients is Candida albicans (7).

The clinical manifestations of IA and mucormycosis vary between different patients and may be nonspecific, including fever, headache, malaise, chest pain, cough, and skin lesions. The most common etiologies are aspergillosis and mucormycosis, which can be found in association with other infectious diseases, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (8). The most common opportunistic fungal infections in SOT patients are Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus (9-12).

Fungal infections have a high morbidity and mortality, and the mortality rate is high in patients with severe mucormycosis, especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13).

The main opportunistic fungal pathogens in SOT patients are Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus.


## Methods
brasiliensis-infected patient with pancreatitis was determined by performing a questionnaire on the patient’s physical and mental health, as well as by performing a nested questionnaire on the patient’s blood and urine sample collectio. The presence of a PRV-associated PRV in the abcess was established by the presence of a thickening of the spleen and the presence of an enlarged and compressed spleen. The PRV-associated PRV was categorized as follows: PRV-associated PRV (PRV-1) 2-3-5, PRV-2-4-5, PRV-3-5-7, PRV-4-5-7, PRV-6-8-8, PRV-9-9-11-12, PRV-11-13-15-17, and PRV-12-13-17-20.

Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute for Health Sciences (NIAH, NIAH-18-063) and the Institutional Review Boards of Clinical Research Laboratories at the Departments of Gastroenterology and Immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina (UMSC-9413-01).

Procedures
The general procedures for the establishment of PRV-associated PRV were performed as previously described (Bilgalov et al., 2016). Briefly, the PRV-associated PRV was purified from the spleen using a Bio-Rad CD-Labs™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The purified PRV was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS. The PRV-associated PRV was then incubated with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. The PRV-associated PRV was then removed by washing three times with PBS. The purified PRV-associated PRV was then subjected to a rheum-spin column chromatography to concentrate the purified PRV-associated PRV. The purified PRV-associated PRV was then subjected to a denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min.


## Results
PREM was not detected in the lung (median 8.2% and 81.7%, respectively), but it was present in the bloodstream (median 23.1% and 23.8%, respectively). In the lung, the average dose of TBM was 4 × 10^4/L (median 1.4 × 10^5/L). The average number of CFU in the lung was 1.8 × 10^3/mL (median 1.4 × 10^3/mL). In the bloodstream, the average dose of TBM was 4 × 10^3/mL (median 1.4 × 10^3/mL). The average number of CFU in the lung was 1.4 × 10^3/mL (median 1.4 × 10^3/mL). The lungs had a median CD4^+ T-cell count of 12 cells/µl (median 5 cells/µl), and a median CD4^+ T-cell count of 4 cells/µl (median 3 cells/µl). The pulmonary and the blood lymphatic function of the patients were normal at baseline. The radiographic features of the patients were normal and normal for all patients, except for the patient with an unspecified PREM.

Clinical Characteristics of the Patients
The clinical features of the patients are shown in Table 2. The patient with PREM had normal weight and normal length of hair, and was quite normal by the clinical and radiographic findings of CT (Table 2). The patient with disseminated PREM had normal weight and normal length of hair, and was almost normal by the clinical and radiographic findings of CT. In the patients with disseminated PREM, the patient with PREM had a normal weight and normal length of hair, and was not dead by the clinical and radiographic findings of CT. The patient with pancreatic cancer had normal weight and normal length of hair, and was not dead by the clinical and radiographic findings of CT. In the patients with disseminated PREM, the patient with pancreatic cancer had normal weight and normal length of hair, and was not dead by the clinical and radiographic findings of CT.


## Discussion
Protein turnover is essential for the biosynthesis of many essential proteins, including the type II ribosomal proteins [17]. Here, we have reported the acquisition of FABP1 and FABP2 by S. aureus strains grown in the presence of LPS and LPS-based media. The results showed that these proteins were not degraded, but rather transported to the extracellular space in the extracellular vesicles. This transport mechanism is conserved in most eukaryotic cells. The acquisition of FABP1 and FABP2 by S.
