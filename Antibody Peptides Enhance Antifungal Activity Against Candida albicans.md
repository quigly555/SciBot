## Abstract
Genomic islands (GIs) are large chromosomal regions that are acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between two different parental lineages, following horizontal marks of selection against their recent acquisition. GIs are of considerable importance in fungal evolution because they provide a useful template for studying genomic adaptations and genome evolution. Many of the fungal GIs have been studied to great extent in order to better understand their role in fungi, however, the majority of their studies have been performed with protozoans. The role of GIs in the evolution of the human disease studio is rather controversial. Some studies have indicated that the Gis are present in all the main human pathogens, some have been transferred to eukaryotic hosts but none of these pathogens have been able to develop in vivo GIs. In this paper, we will review the main aspects of the role of GIs in the evolution of the human disease studio.

## Introduction
As an important part of this mechanism of action, the phospholipid is also of particular interest because it can act as a direct antifungal, providing a strong platform for the synthesis of compounds with biological activity and also as an antioxidant [22.

The major classes of antifungals used for treatment of fungal infections are polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins, which bind to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and thus inhibit fungal growth [23]. The major classes of antifungals used for treatment of fungal infections are the allylamines, polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins. However, due to the antifungal properties, there is a need for the development of new antifungals. In this context, several drug targets have been studied for the development of new antifungal agents. One of these targets, the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, is characterized by the production of sterols via the enzyme Erg11p. Erg11p is a lipid-chelating enzyme that catalyses the first step in the synthesis of ergosterol from the acyl side chain of fatty acids [24].

In this study, we report a study on the inhibition of fungal Erg11p by the azoles and polyenes. A preliminary study showed that azoles and polyenes target the ERG11 gene. The azoles bind to the 14a-demethylase enzyme, which is involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol. The azoles bind to the enzyme 14a-demethylase, which is also involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol from 14-methyl-3-methyl-4-isoxazol-3-yl (1,3)-D-glucopyranose (DGlc) and 3-methyl-4-isoxazol-6-yl (1,6)-D-glucopyranose (1,6) compounds. In addition, the azoles bind to the C-terminal residue of the 14a-demethylase enzyme, which is also involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol from 14-methyl-3-methyl-4-isoxazol-3-yl (1,6)-D-glucopyranose (1,6) compounds.


## Methods
For Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were .5-10 µg/mL, 1-10 µg/mL, and 2-10 µg/mL, respectively. For Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus flavus, the MICs were 10-50 µg/mL, 50-75 µg/mL, and 75-500 µg/mL, respectively. The MICs were not increased above the MICs and were in line with the MIC of fluconazole and voriconazole. The final concentration of the drug that caused 50% inhibition of growth was chosen based on the number of colony forming units (CFU)/mL.

The fungal isolates were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 72 h at 28°C. The mycelia were harvested by filtration using a sterile funnel and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any residual fungal cells. The mycelia were then stored at -80°C in 50% glycerol until use.

Antifungal drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the mycelia were spread on SDA plates. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 72 h. The diameter of the colony was counted with a ruler.

Isolation of compounds
A suspension of 5 × 10^7 conidia/mL in DMSO was added to all the wells of a sterile 96-well microtitre plate (Greiner Bio-One, Diegem, Germany). The microtitre plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, followed by two washes with PBS and one washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The concentration of compounds in the wells was confirmed by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm with a microplate reader.


## Results
albicans and . dubliniensis, peptides were prepared by incubating the cells with a variety of antifungal agents and measuring the reduction of the fungal biomass by measuring the EDTA concentration. It was found that the peptides reduced the growth of both strains (Fig 7A and 7B). The peptides also reduced the fungal biomass in the presence of amphotericin B (Fig 7C and 7D). In contrast, in the presence of 5-FC, the peptides reduced the fungal biomass in the presence of amphotericin B, and significantly decreased the fungal biomass in the presence of 5-FC (Fig 7E and 7F). These results suggested that the peptides inhibited C. albicans growth by inhibiting the growth of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis.

Protein-Protein Interactions of Liposomal Lipids
To further explore the interaction of peptides with lipids in C. albicans, the peptides were prepared by immunostaining with antibodies against proteins identified in the C. albicans genome, including Mpk1, Cdc27, CD11b, and CD86 (Fig 8A). It was found that the peptides reduced the fungal growth of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis by inhibiting the growth of Cdc27 and Cdc27E, respectively, and the peptides also inhibited the growth of Cdc27E and Cdc27EE, respectively. These results suggest that the peptides inhibit the growth of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis.

The results showed that the peptides inhibited the growth of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis by the same mechanism (Fig 8B). These results suggest that the peptides inhibit the growth of C.
