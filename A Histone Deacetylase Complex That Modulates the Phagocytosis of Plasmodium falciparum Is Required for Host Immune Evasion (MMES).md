## Abstract
Peri-abdominal tumor (PA) is one of the most common entities associated with cancer progression. However, its role in progression of cancer is not well-understood. We aimed to study the role of PA in progression of breast cancer in a metastatic progenitor patient.

Data from 52 patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2005-2016 were analyzed.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by two encapsulated yeasts, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii [1,2]. The first, C. neoformans, was first described in 1981 in a patient from Brazil who was admitted to the ICU with a 3-month history of travel to Africa and was diagnosed in 1992 with a rare pulmonary disease of unknown origin, known as cryptococcosis meningitis (CM) [3]. A similar case was reported by Tettelin, who also observed an immunocompromised patient with a history of long-standing hospital-acquired cryptococcosis in Brazil in 2002 [4]. The first case of cryptococcosis meningitis in immunocompetent individuals was reported in 2004, and the majority of cases were due to C. neoformans. Since then, cases have been described mainly in immunocompromised patients, and the most common presentations are meningitis and meningoencephalitis, as well as pulmonary cryptococcosis and brain cryptococcosis [1,2,5,6,7,8].

The most common cryptococcal infection is aspergillosis. The incidence of pulmonary infection has been reported to be 2%-3% in immunocompromised patients [9,10,11]. This is the first case reported in the literature, in which a cryptococcal infection was found in a patient without pulmonary involvement. This case was caused by C. neoformans var. grubii.


## Methods
First, the cell-derived cell debris (CBD) from the protein of the fungus is removed by incubation with 1% SDS (SDS-buffer, pH .4) and neutralization by incubation with 1% SDS. Next, the CBD is removed by incubation with 0.5% SDS (SDS-buffer, pH 7.4) and neutralization by incubation with 1% SDS. Finally, the CBD is removed by incubation with 0.5% SDS (SDS-buffer, pH 7.4) and neutralization by incubation with 1% SDS. The protein concentration of the CBD in the three steps was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Second, the CBDs in the fungal suspensions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking with 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4), the membrane was incubated with an anti-TNF-a mAb (1:1000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4), and the membrane was incubated with a non-specific primary antibody (1:5000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h, and the membrane was incubated with an anti-CD16/32 mAb (1:2000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h, and the membrane was washed three times with PBS. The mAbs were detected with an anti-CD11b mAb (1:3000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) and the membrane was washed three times with PBS. The mAb was detected with an anti-Ly6C mAb (1:3000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) and the membrane was washed three times with PBS. The mAb was detected with an anti-CD4 mAb (1:1000) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) and the membrane was washed three times with PBS.


## Results
neoformans and . albicans in C. neoformans infection models and used a Plasmodium falciparum serotype D (pfa) strain to explore the host immune response during infection. The first step of the Plasmodium serotype D infection model is the induction of the Plasmodium histone acetyltransferase complex. This complex mediates the second step in the virulence pathway, in which the H^+-ATPase activity of the H^+-ATPase complex mediates the activation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a.

We used the H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans and the H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans to investigate the interactions of these three species. We used the MDR strain of C. neoformans to examine the interaction between the H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans and H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans. The H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans is an H^+-ATPase complex that is activated by IL-1ß and IL-6, as well as by the H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans [19]. We used the MDR strain of C. neoformans to determine the interaction between H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans and H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans. We used the H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans to investigate the interaction between H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans and H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans. The H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans is a highly activated H^+-ATPase complex that is activated by IL-1ß, IL-6 and IL-1ß. The H^+-ATPase complex of C. neoformans is a highly activated H^+-ATPase complex that is activated by the H^+-ATPase complex of C. albicans. We used the H^+-ATPase complex of C.


## Discussion
The most relevant and important pathogens in human hosts are humans and animal. In our study, we observed that the yeast was able to colonize multiple hosts. In addition, we found that the yeast was able to colonize the entire globe, with various fungal communities, especially species of the genera Candida and Aspergillus. Interestingly, most of the species in this study were found to be abundant in the fungus but not in the host. Candida species are common in human and animals. C. albicans and C. tropicalis are species that were previously found to be widespread in human and animals, and in this study they were found to be common in the fungus. These species have also been observed to be common in the human environment [59], and are often found in fungal communities in the fungal community of humans and animals [60].

The majority of the species in this study were found to be common in the fungus, and this study found that the species was abundant in the fungus. However, some species were found to be rare, and this study showed that the species was rare in this study. The authors speculate that this could be due to the low yeast numbers in the current study. The species were found to be uncommon in the host, and this study indicated that the species was uncommon in this study.

The yeast was able to grow in all of the host species. The only exception was C. albicans, which was not observed in the study. This is a well-known human fungal pathogen. C. albicans is a common cause of infection in immunocompromised patients. C. albicans is present in the environment and is found in the human body and also in the environment [61]. This species is often found in the environment, and is present in the environment and humans [61]. The authors speculate that the species could be present in the environment and could be present in the human body. The yeast is known to be a pathogen in the lung and liver, which are known to be infected with C. albicans, which could cause the infection in the lungs and liver. The yeast was found to be able to grow in all of the host species. However, we found that the yeast was unable to grow in the lungs of the mice. This could be due to the low concentrations of the fungi in the lungs of the mice.
