## Abstract
In most eukaryotes, mitochondrial morphology is inherited mainly via the maternal half, in which the maternal half is usually found standing still. However, several pathogenic fungi have recently been reported, and the role of mitochondrial morphology in the pathogenesis of invasive myeloid fungal infections is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial respiration in the infection of the opportunistic filamentous fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum, and its relationship with virulence and myeloid fungal survival was investigated. The ability of F. graminearum to survive and replicate inside macrophages was evaluated by infecting mice with a lethal dose of the fungus, increasing the fungal burden and inducing an immune response in vitro. The levels of soluble and insoluble fibrinogen were found to be decreased in the presence of fibrinogen. Dextran localization of fibrinogen in the mother and daughter cell nuclei was found to be decreased in the presence of fibrinogen, and fibrinogen-stimulated caspase-1 expression was found to be increased in the presence of the fungus. Increased levels of fibrinogen in the mother and daughter cell nuclei were found in vitro. Increased levels of soluble and insoluble fibrinogen were found in the lungs of infected mice, and this was dependent on the fibrinogen receptor. Fungal burden was found to be decreased in the lungs of infected mice, and this was dependent on the high l-arginine concentration found in the mother and daughter cell nuclei. Taken together, our results indicate that mitochondria are not the only source of fibrinogen in the mother and daughter cell nuclei, and this is a critical step to understand the pathogenesis of Fusarium infections.

Invasive fungal infections are increasingly being reported in patients with a variety of hematological malignancies, and the contribution of fungi to the pathogenesis of these infections is still largely unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to be a contributor to pathogenicity in many fungal infections, but the role of fibrinogen in fungal pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we examined the mitochondrial respiration of F.


## Introduction
The genus Malassezia includes at least 10 species, which can be found in soil, plant and bird droppings (Cui et al. 2012), the air, water, and even soil contaminated by bird droppings (Grantham et al. 2012). The genus belongs to the group of dimorphic fungi, which are related to plants, including the epiphytic plant pathogen M. graminicola, which was reported from leaf spots of Annonsea and Phragmosa brasiliensis (Cui et al. 2012). M. graminicola is a gramineous fungus that can grow in both ascomata and in the plant tissues (Davoli et al. 2007). In fact, M. graminicola is the most commonly encountered pathogen of bean plants (Chong et al. 2018). M. graminicola is found in various plant habitats, such as: legumes (Agrios, Cavendish, Palm) (Cui et al. 2012), vegetables (Saini et al. 2018), and even fruits (Rosmarinus officinalis, Merlot, Cauliflower) (Cui et al. 2012). It is also found in water and soil (Cui et al. 2012). The fungus can survive in temperatures below 10Â°C, and it can cause disease in susceptible plants. However, temperature, humidity, and even ultraviolet radiation are the most important factors that influence its growth and spread.

Generally, plant pathogenic fungi produce asexual spores (pods) in the form of hyphae (Cui et al. 2012). They can either survive in the environment or in the host plant, and they can be saprophyte or parasitic. The latter case is a very important factor for the development of M. graminicola (Cui et al. 2012). Infection by plant pathogens usually occurs in the form of a (rarely asymptomatic) infection, usually a superficial one, and usually occurs in a few days. However, during this time, it can become a systemic infection, which usually causes tissue necrosis, and can disseminate to other organs (Cui et al. 2012).


## Methods
The remaining patients were referred to the hospital if the diagnosis was not availabl. All patients who were referred to the hospital were confirmed as having osteomyelitis, and had not received any treatment during the first year of follow-up.

Among the 50% of patients who developed osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up, the diagnosis was considered correct if it was proven to be a direct result of infection. If the diagnosis was not available, the patient was referred to the hospital if the diagnosis was not available. The remaining patients were referred to the hospital for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. If the diagnosis was not available, the patient was referred to the hospital for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.

The incidence of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up was calculated as the number of patients who underwent surgery to fix their osteomyelitis, divided by the number of patients who underwent the procedure. A group of patients had a total of 40 osteomyelitis cases, and 10 of these were known to the laboratory. The incidence of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up was calculated as the number of cases of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up divided by the number of cases of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up. The incidence of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up was calculated as the number of cases of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up divided by the number of cases of osteomyelitis in the first year of follow-up.

## Results

.2. Factors Associated With IRIS
A multivariate analysis of risk factors for IRIS was used to evaluate the risk of IRIS (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), p = 0.003). The multivariate analysis included: gender (p = 0.014), type of diseases (p = 0.002), duration of clinic visit (p = 0.004), duration of clinic visit (p = 0.008), use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.001), use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.001), blood culture (p = 0.004), use of cyclosporine (p = 0.001), CD4 count <50 cells/mm^3 (p = 0.004), and use of oral corticosteroids (p = 0.001). In addition, the AOR of IRIS was significantly higher (p = 0.002) in the duration of clinic visit (p = 0.002) and duration of clinic visit (p = 0.004) than in use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.001).

A multivariate analysis of risk factors for IRIS was performed using log-rank test. A significant odds ratio (AOR) was observed for both oral steroid use and use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.0005). The AOR of IRIS for oral steroid use was higher (p = 0.002) than in use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.004). However, the AOR of IRIS for use of oral steroid was lower (p = 0.002) in the duration of clinic visit (p = 0.004) than in use of corticosteroids/iodide (p = 0.002).

## Discussion
albicans osteomyelitis has a good prognosis [19], although infection may be due to direct inoculation or by other infection. It has been suggested that a greater number of patients with C. albicans osteomyelitis were initially treated with antibiotics rather than surgical debridement, which could have led to increased susceptibility of the fungus to antimicrobial agents. However, in our study, antibiotic therapy was not associated with reduced susceptibility to this fungus. Moreover, there was no difference in the number of patients with osteomyelitis and meningeal disease between groups, suggesting that osteomyelitis in women is not as common as in men.

In the current study, C. albicans osteomyelitis and meningeal disease were associated with a significant number of patients who had history of surgery, and osteomyelitis and meningeal disease were associated with a significant number of patients who had history of vaginal or vaginal bleeding. The observed difference in the incidence of osteomyelitis and meningeal disease between the two groups could be attributed to the more recent infection, which was associated with a higher incidence of osteomyelitis and meningeal disease. The reasons for the increased incidence of osteomyelitis and meningeal disease in the current study were not entirely clear. It is possible that a more recent infection is associated with the presence of osteomyelitis and meningeal disease, but there is no evidence to support this. The risk factors for osteomyelitis and meningeal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus are not clear. The incidence of osteomyelitis and meningeal disease in the current study may be due to the history of surgery. The risk factors for osteomyelitis and meningeal disease include a higher frequency of chronic steroid use and a higher frequency of use of intrauterine growth in the setting of diabetes mellitus [20].

The current study also demonstrated a higher incidence of meningeal disease than that of osteomyelitis. The reported incidence of meningeal disease is 1.2 per 1000 patients [21]. It has been reported that a higher incidence of meningeal disease was observed in patients with diabetes mellitus [22], but that the incidence of meningeal disease was not as high in patients with osteomyelitis [23].
