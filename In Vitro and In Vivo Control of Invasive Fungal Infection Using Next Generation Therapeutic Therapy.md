## Abstract
Tuberculosis is one of the top causes of death in human health, and an increasing number of deaths occur in tuberculosis patients despite adequate therapy for the spread of the disease. Multiple treatments are needed to maintain good immune function and control the progression of the infection. The combination of antibiotics and anti-infective drugs has the potential to be a new strategy in managing mycoses. The present study investigated the combination of rituximab, a drug for the mycoses used to treat tuberculosis, with bifenes, a drug used for the mycoses used in the treatment of tuberculosis and with micafungin, a new anti-bacterial drug developed for the treatment of mycoses. Both compounds were well tolerated by both animals and humans. Rituximab alone or in combination with bifenes or micafungin was well tolerated by both animals and humans. However, the synergistic interaction between rituximab and micafungin was very weak and the interaction between rituximab and either antibiotics was very strong.


## Introduction
Although the conventional drug delivery systems of the 1950s were based on synthetic drugs, such as polyenes and tetracycline, the use of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides for bacterial infections has increased. In order to improve the effectiveness of antibiotics, a number of key antibiotics were synthesized by bacteria and their antimicrobial activity has been reported [1,2]. For example, vancomycin and amoxicillin are synthesized by Bacillus anthracis and their antimicrobial activity is generally considered to be a function of their synthesis [3,4]. The biochemical mechanism of vancomycin and amoxicillin is under the control of the enzymes of ß-lactamase (Au) and ß-lactamase (AuL) [5]. These enzymes are found in all Gram-negative bacteria and they can inhibit both ß- and <U+03B3>-lactamases and antibiotics [6,7]. ß-lactamases are mainly involved in the synthesis of antibiotic polymers [8] and the synthesis of antibiotics in the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [9].


## Methods
The detailed data sets were designed and synthesized in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) (accession number: GSE6188) and are available at the GEO portal (accession number: GSE6479.

RNA-seq data sets were analyzed using the RNA-seq technology to identify genes and putative open reading frames (ORFs) as previously described [14]. The ORF annotation was performed using the Bio-Rad Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) (accession number: GSE6188).

The results of RNA-seq analysis were used to assign orthologs to the different fungal species using the BLASTp program in the online version of the FUNGuild website (https://www.expasy.org/).

Gene Ontology and Functional Annotation Analysis
The protein sequences of the annotated genes were aligned using the online version of MAFFT (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) [75] and orthologs were assigned to the different fungal species using the BLASTn program in the online version of the FUNGuild website (https://www.expasy.org/). The genes were selected based on the presence of orthologs to the fungal species and to other fungal species, in order to improve their functional annotation. The default parameters of the BLASTn program were used.

The expression levels of each gene were calculated using the <U+0394><U+0394>C_T method [76]. The expression level of each gene was determined for each of the genes analyzed in this study.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The nucleotide sequences of the different fungal species were obtained from GenBank and aligned using MUSCLE [77]. The amino acid sequences of the different fungal species were retrieved from GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) tool [78]. The orthologs of the different fungal species were identified using the BLASTn tool. The orthologs of the different fungal species were also assigned to different fungal species.


## Results
The antifungal agent was administered by oral gavage of each of the 3-HK and 1-HK in the order of 5 mg/kg for 2 weeks, 20 mg/kg for 3 weeks, and 5 mg/kg for 4 week. The antifungal agent was confirmed to be active by in vivo in the in vitro assay (Figure 1). After the 2-week time point, the fungal load in the lung was much lower in mice receiving the 3-HK than in mice receiving the 1-HK. No significant differences were found in the in vivo data between the 2-week and 4-week treatment time points.

The first and second dose of the 3-HK was combined in a dose-dependent manner in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2). The combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK in the combination was effective in all experimental groups.

The efficacy of the combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK in vivo against invasive fungal infection was investigated by in vitro induction assay (Figure 3). For the in vitro assay, the combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK was effective in a dose-dependent manner in a dose-dependent manner in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK did not have significant effect in the in vitro assay.

In vivo Evaluation of Mucorales-Specific Fungal Infection Susceptibility and Effectiveness
The in vitro test results were compared with the in vivo test results using a 4-week-old murine model of invasive fungal infection. Mucorales infection was the most common invasive fungal infection in the animals receiving the 3-HK and the 1-HK. In the groups treated with the 3-HK, the fungicidal activity of the combination was significantly higher in mice treated with the 3-HK and 1-HK, respectively, compared with mice receiving the combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK. In contrast, the fungicidal activity of the combination of the 3-HK and the 1-HK was not significant in the in vitro assay.

The in vivo test results were compared with the in vitro assay using a 4-week-old murine model of invasive fungal infection.

Interestingly, macrophages from infected mice were able to phagocytose IL-1ß in vivo, which was comparable to a previous study reported in human macrophages [15]. In our study, we observed that macrophages from infected mice were able to phagocytose IL-1ß in vivo, which was similar to previous studies [15, 23, 24].

In addition to phagocytosis, the phagocytosis of C. albicans is important for the virulence of C. albicans. In the current study, we demonstrated that macrophages from infected mice were able to phagocytose C. albicans in vivo, which was similar to a previous study reported in human macrophages [15].
