## Abstract
A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a four-month history of headache, fever, vomiting and deafness for three days. He had recently acquired HIV from another host, which had been acquired by a shared risk factor. He had not been aware that a common risk factor for blindness was represented by this association. He had been exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the hospital environment. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a high percentage of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in the CSF culture. It was positive in all CrAg cultures. He was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and had serial lumbar punctures performed. He had no other underlying conditions. He was treated with amphotericin and flucytosine. He recovered well after initiation of high-dose steroids.


## Introduction
Mucormycosis is a serious fungal disease affecting both humans and animals. While most mucormycosis cases are asymptomatic, asymptomatic individuals can cause severe infections in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The most common clinical form is rhinosinusitis, a disseminated infection in which the focal site is the respiratory mucosa. Although the causative organism is known to be Mucor circinelloides, the murcormycosis is generally limited to the respiratory tract. In this case, however, the case is murcormycosis, a heterogeneous, disseminated form of the disease, caused by M. circinelloides.

Mucormycosis is usually acquired by inhaling aerosolized spores or by direct inoculation with fungal spores. Spores can be found in soil, pigeon droppings, and other environmental niches, and can survive for long periods at temperatures between 25 and 37 °C. The spores can survive and grow for several months. After several months, the spores germinate into a mature, more virulent conidia. After this period of incubation, the infected individual can undergo a series of infections. The infectious process usually involves the destruction of the host lung tissue, with or without the participation of other immune cells. The most common mucormycosis lesions are the respiratory and soft tissues.

There are few reports on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of mucormycosis in humans.


## Methods
Study Area
A total of 99 isolates of Candida spp. and Candida albicans, with clinical and histological characteristics of Candida spp., were obtained from the public health laboratories of each participating state in the Ospedal National University (OSU) and Ospedal Clinical Research Center of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNESP). In addition, three Candida spp. isolates were obtained from the Ospedal National University. The yeast isolates were isolated from the fungal bodies of Candida albicans and C.


## Results
 2013. It is notable that the early diverging strain of Barbatimycete P. eugeniae (CBS 908.30) showed highly elevated susceptibility to P. eugeniae, and the first isolates of P. eugeniae, which were isolated from the type locality of the Chinese province, were also highly susceptible to P. eugeniae. The clinical isolates of P. eugeniae and P. eugeniae derived from the type locality were highly resistant to P. eugeniae, as they were either unable to produce or to synthesize mycotoxins. These isolates also showed higher sensitivity to P. eugenia, and some isolates were resistant to P. eugenia. The isolates of P. eugeniae and P. eugeniae derived from the type locality also showed higher susceptibility to P. eugenia, as they were either unable to produce or to synthesize mycotoxins.

Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Barbatimycete mycotoxin sensitivity
The different susceptibility profiles of the Barbatimycete mycotoxins to P. eugenia, P. eugeniae, P. eugenica and P. sclerotia were further analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, real-time-reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time-reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The whole genome sequencing of the Barbatimycete mycotoxins (Table 1) identified all the Barbatimycete mycotoxins and their derivatives as involved in P. eugenia, P. eugenica and P. sclerotia (Table S2). The Barbatimycete mycotoxins have been shown to be able to produce mycotoxin-specific factors (Gao et al., 2008).

We investigated the expression of the Barbatimycete mycotoxin sensitivity markers in the Barbatimycete mycotoxins.


## Discussion
tricornutinae species analyse. The closest relatives of P. tricornutinae include the genera Trichophoroascus and Cryptococcus, the type species of the genus, the type species of the genus, and species of the genera Cryptococcus, Blastocladium, and Sporobolomyces. The closest relatives of the P. tricornutinae species analysed in this study are the type species of the genus Cryptococcus, the type species of the genus, and the species of the genera Blastocladium, Sporobolomyces, and Cryptococcus. The closest relatives of the P. tricornutinae species analysed in this study are species of the type species of the genus Cryptococcus.

The species of the type species of the genus Blastocladium were retrieved from marine sediment samples of the Netherlands (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017). The species of the genus Blastocladium have been reported in freshwater habitats worldwide, and the type species of the genus has been reported in tropical and temperate regions (e.g., Austria, USA), and in temperate and tropical regions (e.g., Canada, USA), respectively. The species of the type species of the genus Blastocladium were retrieved from marine sediment samples of the Netherlands (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017).

The species of the type species of the genus Cryptococcus have been reported in freshwater habitats worldwide (e.g., Austria, USA), and the type species of the genus Cryptococcus has been reported in temperate and tropical regions (e.g., USA), and in Antarctica (Ellerbeck et al. 2012) (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017). The species of the type species of the genus Cryptococcus have been reported from marine sediment samples of the Netherlands (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017). The species of the type species of the genus Cryptococcus has been reported from freshwater samples of the Netherlands (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017). The species of the type species of the genus Cryptococcus has been reported from freshwater sediment samples of the Netherlands (Van den Wyngaert et al. 2017).
