## Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are the initial step in dispersal of bacteria across the environment, where they establish a persistent infection structure in the human host. Here we report that the microbial dispersal structure in human biofilms is significantly shaped by the antibiotic natamycin, which directly affects the structure of biofilms. The biofilms are surrounded by a dense layer of invaginated and engulfed bacteria, whose genes are stored in novel “localized strains” (lens regions) in the host. We found that the “localized” strains were significantly less virulent than the “immunized” strains in a site-specific manner. The concentration of nystatin in the biofilm was significantly increased in the active pharmaceutical group compared with the “virulent” group. The virulence of the “virulent” biofilms was significantly reduced in a mouse model of infection. This work demonstrates that biofilm dispersal influences the “localized” strain phenotype, which could have significant implications for development of new biofilm dispersal therapeutics.

Biofilms are the initial dispersal structure for the human body. Here, the authors show that biofilms are particularly important for the maintenance of body tissue homeostasis and pathogenicity, as they drive the spread of microbes across the body. These findings suggest that dispersal-related proteins have significant ramifications for the development of new biofilms therapeutics.


## Introduction
The filamentous fungus Epichloë festucae is a causal agent of the Dutch elm disease, which is one of the most destructive diseases in the temperate regions of Europe. E. festucae is reported from a range of sites throughout the Netherlands, including the south east, from the village of van der Westhuizen to the south-eastern region of the country [1]. However, E. festucae is not a major pathogen in the south east, and its disease has been reported from almost all Dutch elm trees. The disease is caused by two distinct species, E. festucae and E. dairenensis. The latter species is found in the forested areas along the west coast of the country, and in some areas, it is also found in trees that are infected by other epichloë trees such as E. dairenensis and E. festucae [2]. The disease is believed to be transmitted by the wind, and it can be caused by two species: E. festucae and E. dairenensis. The latter species is considered to be the most virulent species, and the most virulent species in the south east [2]. It is estimated that the disease affects more than 200 elm trees in the south east of the country, and the disease has a mortality rate of up to 40% [2]. Although the pathogen is reported from a wide range of sites throughout the country, the disease is most commonly caused by E. festucae and is one of the most destructive diseases of elm in the country [3].

The Dutch elm tree, called “davern”, is native to the Netherlands, and the disease is estimated to affect about 280 elms in the south east of the country [3]. The disease has been recorded in some areas of the country, and the mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 70% [4]. However, there are no surveys available in the south east, and there is no information on the local population of E. festucae in the south east.

The aim of the present study was to determine the population of the pathogen in the south east of the country, and to estimate the mortality rate in the affected elm trees by the wind.


## Methods
Briefly, the plasmid pYF/pXS (pYF: C^4, pXS: C^4) was used as a template, and a reaction mixture containing 20 mM of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), 1 mM of 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT), 20 mM MgCl_2, .25 mM dithiothreitol, 1.5 mM imidazole, and 2.5 µM a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was prepared. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then 100 µL of the reaction mixture was added into a 96-well plate. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) and the concentration of crude oil was calculated using standard curves.

Enzyme activity assay
The assays were performed according to the method described by Prakash et al. (2015). Briefly, in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction, the bioactive fractions of 5% (w/w) and 100% (w/w) of crude oil were combined. The reaction mixture was adjusted to the desired concentration using a microplate spectrophotometer. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).

Protein concentration assay
The determination of the concentration of crude oil in the supernatant of a 96-well microplate was performed according to the method described by Prakash et al. (2015). Briefly, the assay mixture (50 µL) was diluted with 10 mM of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (2.5 mg/mL) and 10 mM of 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT).


## Results
S. pombe infection of host cells
To determine the role of host immune cells in fungal pathogenesis, we first tested the effect of S. pombe infection of host cells (green-light-labeled mouse) on the host cell line J774.16 (Figure 1A). The control strain was used as a model for our analyses. To ensure that the effects of S. pombe infection of J774.16 cells were not due to immune cell responses, we inoculated J774.16 cells with either a mouse IgG1 or a mouse IgG2B mAb. As shown in Figure 1B, the addition of the mouse IgG1 or IgG2B mAb did not alter the capacity of host cells to elicit host immune responses, while the addition of the mouse IgG2B mAb altered the ability of J774.16 to initiate the infection. When cultured with a host cell line that was not able to produce IgG2B mAb, J774.16 cells did not exhibit the growth defect described for the mouse IgG2B mAb (Figure 1C).

S. pombe infection of host cells
To assess the role of host immune cells in fungal pathogenesis, we infected J774.16 cells with a mouse IgG1 or a mouse IgG2B mAb and then quantified the percentage of cells that stained with the antibody using a visual assessment.


## Discussion
capsulatum infectio. The strain was susceptible to H. capsulatum infection in vitro, while it was resistant to H. capsulatum infection in vivo. In this study, we were able to identify the molecular weight of H. capsulatum hyphae isolated from H. capsulatum biofilm and assessed its MIC against two commonly used antifungal drugs, fluconazole and amphotericin B. The results from this study suggested that H. capsulatum strain was susceptible to H. capsulatum infection in vitro and susceptible to H. capsulatum infection in vivo.

The MIC and MFC for H. capsulatum infection were comparable to other azole antifungal agents. The MFC values for H. capsulatum infection were similar to those reported for other azole antifungal drugs (Mukherjee et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2014, Kuehn et al., 2017). We also found that H. capsulatum strain showed higher MIC for azole antifungal drugs, with MFC values ranging from 0.28 µg/mL to 0.65 µg/mL (Table 2). Our data showed that the MIC of H. capsulatum was equal to that of the azole antifungal drugs and similar to that of other azole antifungal drugs (Table 3).

In this study, we identified a strain of H. capsulatum with antimicrobial activity and toxicity in mice. The results showed that the dose of the H. capsulatum strain was changed with time. The efficacy of the strain has been reported to be reduced after the addition of C. albicans to the culture medium (Hoehn et al., 2015). However, the data were not consistent and we also observed a difference in the MIC of the strain between mice and rats. Therefore, this strain was used for further characterization of the antimicrobial activity and toxicity.

In our study, we found that the MIC of H. capsulatum strain was greater than that of other azole antifungal drugs (MIC_50 = 0.039 µg/mL for MDR, 0.049 µg/mL for RIM-97, and 0.125 µg/mL for FLC). This suggests that H.
