## Abstract
Granulomatous inflammation of the lung (GIT) is a common symptom of pulmonary disease. However, its clinical features have rarely been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a systemic lupus-associated autoimmune disease. We report a case of SLE with atypical granulomas in an adult SLE patient. Post-NCT-based evaluation revealed an asymptomatic right lower lobe mass with a non-pulmonary necrotic lesion involving the sternum and bronchium. Although the extent of the necrotizing lesion is described as large, the patient was initially diagnosed with a small pulmonary nodule and pathology was subsequently excluded. Autopsy revealed that granulomas in the upper, lower, and upper lobes were diffuse and the lungs were initially suspected to be suspicious. However, the lung pathology report revealed a granulomatous lesion involving both the sternum and bronchium with multiple large, pulcherritic, and haebolic lesions involving the lung parenchyma. The diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation in the lung was subsequently confirmed by bronchiolitis or chronic lung disease tests. SLE patients with pulmonary lesions have a poor understanding of the pathogenesis of granulomas, and it is important to consider these patients when making a diagnosis of pulmonary SLE.


## Introduction
 2016) and is highly relevant for the infection of the host plants (McGinnis et a., 2013; Boekhout et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2017).

The infection process of the fungus E. crassa involves many steps: formation of infection structures such as chlamydospores, stroma, chlamydospores, hyphae, hyphal cells, phoretic cells and hyphal chains (Boekhout et al., 2014). These stages are mainly composed of chains of specialized cells, which are arranged in chains that are able to form new chains. In addition, chains can be associated with different types of structures such as hyphae and hyphae bodies (Krzysciak et al., 2016).

The formation of infection structures in E. crassa requires the activity of the interphase effector proteins (IMPs) (Kim et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2015). The IMPs are a group of high mobility groups (HMG) proteins which are produced by the mycelium during the phase transition. The IMPs are classified as Ca^2+-binding proteins and have been shown to regulate the morphology of the conidia (Jain et al., 2009). The Ca^2+ binding proteins are the high mobility group proteins (HMGs) and are present in all eukaryotic cell types. As a result, the Ca^2+-IMP can bind and be transported to the cell membrane to initiate the intracellular fission reaction, which involves a cascade of intracellular events (Jain et al., 2009).

The IMPs have been shown to be important for the formation of infection structures and in the fission process (Jain et al., 2009). A number of studies have shown that the Ca^2+-IMP is a central mediator in the formation of infection structures. These studies have shown that the Ca^2+-IMP is mainly constituted by proteins from different families such as Actin, Fas, and Phe/ß, as well as proteins from the so called pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Niemelä and Kollmann, 2011; Desjardin, 2013). The IL-4 cytokines are produced by the fungus during the F-b cell differentiation process.


## Methods
This technique is also applicable to yeast and mycelia that are naturally present in the hos. To achieve effective inhibition of eukaryotic pathogen invasion, yeast and mycelia were incubated at 37 °C and 60 °C, respectively, for 24 h before the mycelia were harvested. After cell lysis, the hyphal fragments of the hyphal fragments were collected and frozen. The frozen hyphal fragments were then used to inoculate the freshly prepared PDA (potato dextrose agar, PDA) medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After the suspension was solidified, the hyphae were washed three times with distilled water and then further resuspended in distilled water to the desired final concentrations (50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1000, 1500, 1500 × 1000 mg/mL). The medium with PDA medium was used for the PDA inoculum.

## Results
albicans, but does not produce any virulence factor [8. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of extracellular mycorrhizal fungi on the pathogenicity of E. coli. E. coli LHL1 was used as a positive control to establish the infection model of infection. In this study, the inoculum was used as a positive control. The fungal burden of E. coli LHL1 was evaluated using two different rounds of infection: the first round, which consists of 5 × 10^5 CFU of bacteria, and the second round, which consists of 10^5 CFU of fungi. The number of CFU of E. coli LHL1 was significantly increased compared to that of the first round (Fig 2A). Interestingly, E. coli LHL1 infection resulted in a significant increase of fungal burden in both rounds (Fig 2B). For both the first and second rounds, the fungal burden was significantly reduced compared to that of the first round, but not in the second round (Fig 2C). In contrast, the fungal burden of E. coli LHL1 was significantly increased in the first round and not in the second round (Fig 2D). These data suggest that extracellular mycorrhizal fungi have potent antifungal properties that are unrelated to the growth phase of E. coli LHL1.

Growth of E. coli LHL1 in a Transwell Supernatant Isolated from a Time-Contained Vacuum
Our previous studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungi can be obtained from a time-contained vacuole that can be processed by the microorganism “galactomannan” [7], [11], [12], [13]. To further explore the possibility that fungi are able to enter into the system, we explored the possibility that fungi were able to survive in a time-contained vacuole that is not enriched in the vacuole membrane. In the presence of E. coli LHL1, the fungus was able to survive for up to 2 days (Fig 3A).


## Discussion
. oryz. and Mt. H. oryz. n. n. Mentha triflora) is a rare species of yeast that is capable of causing infections in humans and animals. It is also an example of a promising new antifungal drug. The drug exhibits a broad spectrum of activity against Candida species and other fungi, which is thought to have a potent potential against a wide range of opportunistic pathogenic fungi. This drug has been recently demonstrated to have significant activity against S. aureus [10], which is an important human fungal pathogen. In the present work, we present the drug in a colorless, phenolic, non-polar, hydrophobic gel, which can be easily used in pharmaceuticals and medical centers. The drug is attractive in clinical settings since it is used in combination with existing antifungal therapy.

In the present study, we observed that the drug is effective against the yeast-like pathogen S. aureus in vitro. The MIC values of the drug are used to assess the activity of the drug against S. aureus. The MIC values for the drug against S. aureus were determined in a previous work [11]. It was found that the drug has a weak activity against the fungus Candida albicans. This drug is capable of causing a large variety of infections in humans and other mammals. Although the drug is not active against S. aureus, it is effective against C. albicans, which is an important human fungal pathogen. This drug is active against S. aureus.

To check if the drug is fungicidal, we evaluated the activity of the drug against different fungal species. The MIC values of the drug were determined against S. aureus and C. neoformans. The MIC values were determined in vitro against S. aureus. The MIC values were determined in vivo against the fungal cells. The MIC values were determined in vivo against the infected animals.

In this work, we demonstrated that the drug has broad spectrum activity against S. aureus and other Candida species. The drug was also effective against C. neoformans. The MIC values were determined in vitro against S. aureus.
