## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection that is typically presented as lung infection. The fungal cell walls are the major cell structure that encase fungal conidia and are responsible for evading host immune defenses. Although numerous factors are known to play a role in cryptococcosis, the main impact is on the cell wall itself. Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that can cause life-threatening infections that commonly are misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. A variety of immune cell markers have been reported in the fungal cell wall, including interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-4, tumor necrosis factor a, and interleukin (IL)-12, but the differences in the response of these cells are not clear. Here we used macrophage polarization and polarization of natural killer (NK) cells and DCs as well as natural killer (NKT) cells and T-cells in vitro to identify the characteristics of the fungal cell wall components that affect the immune response against cryptococcal infection. The results presented here show that the fungal cell wall is an excellent target for the development of new anti-cryptococcal therapy.


## Introduction

While the components of the phagocytic process are conserved across taxa, CSF are synthesized in distinct stages during fungal developmen. The process starts with surface recognition by the cell membrane and the fibrillar matrix, where the granules form and enlarge, then the cell polarizes and undergoes a morphological transformation to the budding yeast form. The yeast cells then undergo a morphological transformation to the more prevalent, pathogenic filamentous form in the environment. The latter form is formed by a ‘budding’ yeast phase, which is followed by a phase transition to the pathogenic yeast form [10]. The mechanism of phagocytosis involves several interacting partners, such as the innate immune system, the fungus itself, and host cell defense mechanisms. Fungal pathogens are able to utilize host cell components and cell wall components as virulence factors in order to invade and colonize a host cell and establish infection. However, fungal pathogens also utilize other components of the phagocytic process, such as adherence and motility of the cells, and even secretion of enzymes that facilitate infection [11,12,13,14]. Fungal pathogenic fungi are capable of phagocytosing host cells as well as inducing the cell to produce factors that degrade host cell barriers. In addition, they can also release antifungal proteins that aid fungal survival and progression in the host cell environment [15]. The degree of host cell recognition and interaction is also required for phagocytosis of fungal cells. However, little is known about the interaction of fungal pathogens with host cells and the responses of host cells during phagocytosis.

The importance of the host cell as a host cell defense mechanism during fungal infection has been demonstrated in both aspergillosis and aspergilloma [16,17]. The participation of macrophages and neutrophils in the phagocytosis of fungi has been found in aspergilloma, where these cells promote colonization and killing of fungal cells [16,17]. Antifungal chemokines such as caspofungin, amphotericin B, and 5-flucytosine also participate in the phagocytosis of fungal cells [17,18].


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/cna/info/view/mfca.html)

For the analysis of the functional functional and biological aspects of the Fungal Pathogen VLH1, the Candida S. cerevisiae strain CXF33, the VLH1-encoding gene and the transmembrane domain of VLH1 were separately analyzed by PCR. The primers used for the PCR reaction are shown in Table 1. The fungal protein sequences were obtained from the NCBIs GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).

Determination of the Fungal Fungal Molecular Characterisation
The fungal mycelial mat (total number of spores, mycelia, and conidia) was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder. Fungal mycelial powder was used to inoculate 96-well plates and was kept at room temperature (RT) for 24 h. Mycelia were collected and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min to remove mycelia. The supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate and the fluorescence of the suspensions was measured with a microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The sample was diluted with sterile water to obtain a final concentration of 0.1% w/w. The concentrations of the tested compounds were as follows: a-pinene 5 µg/ml, d-pinene 4 µg/ml, and e-pinene 5 µg/ml. Each well was inoculated with 100 µl of the Fungal Fungus L. (P1) and the concentrations of the tested compounds were as follows: a-pinene 0.5 µg/ml, d-pinene 1 µg/ml, e-pinene 2 µg/ml, and e-pinene 5 µg/ml. The plate was then incubated at RT for 24 h. The absorbance of the suspension was measured at 600 nm. The sterol content of the test compound was determined using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).


## Results
The results showed that the gene encoding the putative effector-encoding gene LrpkA (AMB:GFP) is also present in . neoformans, but with low identity. In addition, the genome of C. neoformans contains a gene encoding a putative homolog of P. brasiliensis Pbss3 (PbSS3) which is a member of the P. brasiliensis homolog group. In addition, the gene encoding the putative homolog of Fungi-Like Transporter (FUT2) is also present in C. neoformans. The results showed that the gene encoding FUT2, which is an essential gene in C. neoformans, is also present in C. neoformans.

In the present study, we also found that the gene encoding the putative effector-encoding gene PbHDR1 (PbHDR1-like protein) in C. neoformans was also present in C. neoformans. The genome of C. neoformans contains a gene encoding a putative homolog of P. brasiliensis PbPbE that is a member of the P. brasiliensis homolog group. In addition, the genome of C. neoformans contains a gene encoding a putative homolog of Fungi-Like Transporter (FUT2) that is a member of the P. brasiliensis homolog group. In addition, the genome of C. neoformans contains a gene encoding a putative homolog of FUT2 (PbFUT2) which is also present in C. neoformans.

Expression of FUT2, PbHDR1, and FUT2-related genes in Cryptococcus neoformans
The expression levels of FUT2, PbHDR1, and FUT2-related genes were found to be similar in the presence and absence of the FURB-HA (Fig 1A). The FUT2 and PbFUT2 genes were expressed at similar levels in the presence and absence of FURB-HA (Fig 1A).


## Discussion
Linnakoski, P.D., in the journal of Microbiology.

We have used an automated and easy-to-use expression system for the detection of the proteins in the genome and in the mRNA sequences of our isolates. The automated system allows the detection of fungal proteins and proteomes of unknown function by two-way ANOVA analysis and the detection of protein-protein interactions and bioinformatics. The automated system also allows the rapid identification of proteins in the genome by the use of the program in MATlab or through the use of the program in Phytochemical Research Institute (PRI). Our results are in line with those of Linnakoski and coworkers who reported that expression of human and fungi fungal genes was not induced by light but by the same light conditions (23). The automatic detection of the fungus in the human genome also relies on the detection of protein-protein interactions by the program in Fungal Transcription Factor-Containing Enzyme Genes (FTENES) Gene Ontology (FTOPENES). The genetic function of the fungus in a species can be determined by the expression of the gene encoding the FTR1 gene, and by the expression of the genes encoding the FTR2 gene. We found that the expression of the genes encoding the FTR1 gene was decreased in the progenitor strains of H99, and the FTR1 gene was upregulated in the progenitor strains of S. cerevisiae. The genes encoding the FTR1 gene are involved in the synthesis of fusarin, an organic compound that is used as an industrial drug. The expression of the FTR1 gene was decreased in the progenitor strains of H99, and the FTR2 gene was upregulated in the progenitor strains of S. cerevisiae. We have also found that the expression of the FTR1 gene was decreased in the progenitor strains of S. cerevisiae.

The RNA-seq data of the hybrid isolates analyzed by PCR showed that the expression of FTR1 gene was increased in the progenitor strains of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. The expression of the FTR1 gene was decreased in the progenitor strains of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and the expression of the FTR2 gene was decreased in the progenitor strains of S.
