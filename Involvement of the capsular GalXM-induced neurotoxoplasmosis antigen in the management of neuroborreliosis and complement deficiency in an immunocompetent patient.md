## Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that causes septicemia, meningitis, and even blindness and has recently been described as a possible cause of catheter syndromes in immunocompromised patients. This pathogenic bacterium is also known to cause respiratory tract infections, septicemia, and blindness in both humans and animals. The recent availability of a bacterial genome sequence for the A. baumannii genome enables us to investigate its pathogenesis and potential mechanisms of virulence. Here we report that A. baumannii has evolved a new virulence mechanism in asexual reproduction mode where cells release germinating capsule-associated proteins known as capsular polysaccharides (CPA). CPA are polysaccharides that belong to the glycoprotein glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and possess a-like domains. Genomic characterization and transcriptomic analyses revealed that A. baumannii contains a large and diverse set of genes that encode at least 23 genes. A. baumannii has acquired a-like gene conversion, which is common in Ascomycota, and a-like gene conversion occurred in other fungi. A. baumannii possesses several virulence factors that could play roles in immune dysregulation. In addition to the cell wall, A. baumannii also contains a-like proteins, which may play a role in the modulation of other virulence factors expressed by A. baumannii.


## Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding endogenous RNA molecules that regulate the expression of genes and their associated proteins in living cells (1). They are present in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms and play important roles in many biological processes. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression, transcriptional silencing, translation, and translation interference (2-4).miRNAs are particularly well-known for their role in cell-cycle regulation, cell-cycle initiation, protein-coding genes, translation initiation, cell-cycle arrest, and gene silencing (5-7).miRNAs are also involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including apoptosis, apoptosis-associated speciation, cell migration, and regulation of cell-cycle progression (8-10). In addition, they are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, including the kinetics of various cell types and the cellular immune response (11). In this review, we focus on the roles of miRNAs in the regulation of the cell cycle, which is well characterized in fungi. We will mainly discuss the role of miRNAs in the signaling pathway of the cell-cycle checkpoint, which is a key component of the cell-cycle checkpoint. Finally, we will discuss the role of miRNAs in the regulation of the translation and translation machinery.


## Methods
The CD4 cell count was measured with the Beckman Coulter CD4 Cell Counter (Beckman Coulter, In., Brea, CA, USA).

2.5. Cytokine Measurements
The serum cytokines were obtained from the Bio-Plex Protein Sequencing Facility (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The following are the reference standards: IFN-<U+03B3>, TNF-a, IL-1ß, IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17, IL-17A, IFN-a, and P-cytosine (Table 1). All assays were performed in technical triplicates and the results are expressed as the mean ± SD.

2.6. Bio-Plex Sequencing and Data Analysis
Bio-Plex Sequencing was performed using the Bio-Plex software (version 5.0.2; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a single lane on a Qiagen automated sequencer. In the bio-injections, data were first trimmed by using Geneious v. 7.0.4 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). For the bio-injection of FLAG-expressing bacteria, the slides were screened and the signal intensity was normalized to the level of the bacteria (injection buffer: 0.3 mM KCl, 0.2 mM MgCl_2, 1 mM CaCl_2, pH 8.0). A total of 2 µM of the fluconazole antibiotic (FLC; TCB, 100 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was included as a negative control.

2.7. Fungal Infection of Brain and CNS
For all the studies, fungal inocula were prepared in brain and CNS from the brain and the CNS of a healthy control (n = 10) and a control strain of C. neoformans strain H99 (a clinical isolate of C. neoformans from the brain of a patient with neuroborreliosis). The tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological examination. For histological examination, the brain was dissected into four halves, separated in equal lengths, and the mean number of intracranial spaces was counted.


## Results
tuberculosi. B cells were immuno-labeled with anti-bovine IgG, B lymphocytes were incubated with M. tuberculosis, and antigen was extracted from mouse brain. Transfection with anti-bovine IgG resulted in an increase of B cell antigen (Fig 3A). The CSF samples from mice inoculated with M. tuberculosis, which were able to detect B lymphocytes from the CSF, were negative for any antigen (data not shown). The same was true for the CSF from mice inoculated with M. tuberculosis, which were negative for any antigen (data not shown). In the control mice, no significant differences were found in the antigen detection by B cell or antigen from the CSF samples from the three groups (Fig 3B).

Because there is only limited data on the impact of capsular polysaccharide on CNS infection, we sought to determine the role of B cell as a source of immune cells in the CNS. B cell (human and mouse) and B lymphocyte (human and mouse) are the primary CNS antigens that are recognized by the immune system by several species of pathogens. These pathogens act in concert to cause CNS infection, and their infections are often acquired through a variety of routes [24-28]. In a recent study, we identified a specific cell type that is responsible for the development of B lymphocytes in a mouse model of cryptococcosis [28]. The M. tuberculosis-induced CNS infection model of a study by Nelson et al. [28] suggested that mice were infected with the B lymphocyte strain of Cryptococcus neoformans and died after a median time of 7 days of survival. In the brain, the mice infected with the B lymphocyte strain of Cryptococcus neoformans were able to survive for 3 to 6 days, although the initial CNS infection was fatal. By contrast, the mice infected with the B lymphocyte strain of C. neoformans were more severely affected. The mice infected with the B lymphocyte strain of C. neoformans died significantly more frequently than the mice infected with the B lymphocyte strain of C. neoformans, and the mice infected with the B lymphocyte strain of C.


## Discussion
In this study, we isolated and characterized the major components of the A. fumigatus ERG1 and ERG7 gene family. A.
