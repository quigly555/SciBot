## Abstract
The production of secondary metabolites and enzymes is an essential step in the biosynthesis of many organic acids, which are valuable components for biotechnological and industrial applications. Aspergillus nidulans A. Lambe, A. Paolo, and their derivatives are responsible for the majority of unwanted acid-citrate precipitation, which is mainly caused by acid fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium graminearum, and Cladophialophora rhamnescens. The main compounds of A. Lambe and A. Paolo were mainly lignan or carvacrol and inhibit the growth of Fusarium oxysporum and dermatophyllum. Moreover, the extracts of A. Paolo and A. Lambe had a strong acid-base moiety. The macromolecular structures of the extracts were characterized by elemental-scavenging-electrolysis, antimicrobial, and enzyme-modulating assays. The results also showed that the A. fumigatus cell wall-associated compounds are major intermediates of the precipitation. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds was also tested by docking studies with related microorganisms. The results showed that A. Lambe and A. Paolo are similar to the compounds from Fusarium oxysporum. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of the two plant species against Fusarium was demonstrated. The results of the present study underline the importance of the biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of organic acids.


## Introduction
Rhodotorula spp. are ubiquitous fungal plant pathogens which cause various diseases in economically important crops, including soybean, rapeseed, sugarcane, melon, grapevine and citrus fruits, which are the most important crops in developing and exporting countries (Tuller, 2013). Their pathogenicity and epidemiology have recently been reviewed by Chalon and Chalon (2014) and reviewed by Chalon and Chalon (2014). In addition, these plant pathogens are increasingly recognized as major food pathogens in temperate regions (Pereira et al., 2017) and worldwide. In China, R. canadensis is the major pathogen of melon (Zheng et al., 2018) and strawberry (Zhang et al., 2017). Furthermore, in the United States, R. canadensis is responsible for anthracnose (Zhang et al., 2017) and fruit rot (Zhang et al., 2017).

The genus Rhamnolin is composed of over 100 species (Dinan et al., 2018), which cause cankers and root-end rot in soybean (Arabicum annuum), tomato, sweet potato, cucumber and peas, respectively (Odds, 1965).


## Methods
This study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 04-07-000.6, http://www.uniprot.org/protocol/pdf/project.pdf).

2.1. Essential Oils
The essential oil of Cryptococcus neoformans VENUS (X) was prepared by a method previously described [22]. The volatile oil was extracted from pure yeast cultures of Cryptococcus neoformans by using a rotary shaker at a speed of 200 rpm for 30 min and the extract was separated by filtration and resuspension in distilled water. The final extract was then used to prepare the essential oil of C. neoformans VENUS (B) for the subsequent identification of cryptococcal cells.

2.2. Antifungal Activity of C. neoformans VENUS
A previously described method [22] was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the essential oil of Cryptococcus neoformans against the tested fungal strains.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of C. neoformans VENUS
The antifungal activity of the essential oil of C. neoformans VENUS (X) against C. gattii was performed by the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [23]. The method was adapted from the CLSI methodology [24].

2.4. Antifungal Activity of C. gattii VENUS
The antifungal activity of the essential oil of C. gattii against C. albicans was performed by the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [25]. The method was adapted from the CLSI methodology [26].

2.5. Antifungal Activity of C. gattii VENUS
The antifungal activity of C. gattii VENUS against C. tropicalis was performed by the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [27].

2.6. Fungal Growth of Cryptococcus neoformans VENUS
The fungal growth of C. gattii VENUS was performed on Sabouraud agar (SBD) by using the method previously described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [28].


## Results
neoformans infection, we assessed the response of . neoformans to host defense mechanisms using a C57BL/6 mouse infection model. The mouse model is an in vitro-generated clinical animal model of C. neoformans infection. As C. neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen, host defense mechanisms should be recognized and adequately addressed. Given the importance of host defense mechanisms for C. neoformans infections, we next sought to investigate whether the response to C. neoformans was observed in C57BL/6 mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with C. neoformans isolates from the animal model. We examined the serum CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in C57BL/6 mice, as well as in C57BL/6 mouse, in a mouse-passaged mouse model of C. neoformans infection. In the C57BL/6 mouse, we observed no significant differences in CD4+ T-cell responses between C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5A and B). The addition of 50 µM of macrolide, a known inducer of CD4+ T-cell responses, significantly reduced the serum responses in C57BL/6 mice compared to that in C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5C). These results indicate that the C57BL/6 mouse is a healthy donor of macrolide-induced CD4+ T-cell responses.

As C. neoformans is a fungal pathogen, we next examined whether C. neoformans elicited C. neoformans-specific immune responses in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were infected with C. neoformans isolates from the animal model (Fig 5D). C57BL/6 mice received the same inocula as C57BL/6 mice; however, the C57BL/6 mice received higher doses of macrolide (25 µM) and higher doses of macrolide plus a live fungus in C57BL/6 mice than in C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5D). The addition of macrolide plus a live fungus significantly decreased the serum responses of C57BL/6 mice compared to those of C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5E).


## Discussion
cenocepacia is capable of pathogenicity, albeit at lower levels of virulenc. Cryptococcus neoformans is a well-recognized and well-tolerated human fungal pathogen that is a ubiquitous fungus that can be isolated from the environment. It is one of the most common human fungal pathogens, and is frequently found in immunocompromised patients [29, 30]. Although B. cenocepacia has been isolated from the environment in healthy individuals, its presence in the environment has been associated with several types of human diseases. For example, the exposure of B. cenocepacia in the drinking water in the state of San Francisco in 2007 resulted in an increase in the prevalence of mold infections, which are associated with high concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in water [31]. In the present study, the presence of B. cenocepacia in the drinking water in the area was associated with the occurrence of disease, including the development of meningoencephalitis. The occurrence of meningoencephalitis was also correlated with the presence of B. cenocepacia, and the occurrence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was associated with the presence of B. cenocepacia in the water. Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous yeast that is common in nature and is thought to cause disease in humans and animals [32]. It is also a causative agent of cryptococcosis in humans and can cause disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals [33]. Cryptococcus neoformans has also been isolated from the environment in healthy individuals. It has been found in the environment in the drinking water of individuals in the Northeast United States, and it is also present in the drinking water of individuals in the South Pacific Ocean, which is a climate conducive to the growth of the soil-borne Aspergillus species [34]. It was also isolated from the soil in an infected dog in Australia, and it was found in the water of a pigeon in Australia [35]. The presence of these organisms in water also suggests that these organisms are present in the environment in the drinking water of individuals in the Southeast United States and South Pacific Ocean [36].

B. cenocepacia has been isolated from environmental samples in different locations and countries. For example, the water of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was also found to be contaminated by this species [37].
