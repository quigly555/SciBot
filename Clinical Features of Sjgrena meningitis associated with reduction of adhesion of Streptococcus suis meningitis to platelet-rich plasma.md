## Abstract
Disease or fungus containment and management may depend on the type of plants and animals sampled and upon their microbiological characteristics. Culturing of microalgae and of yeasts present in most of the samples is performed by means of standard microbiological methods. Identification of different plant or animal species in need of attention could be extremely difficult due to the complexity of the sample and the commercial necessity of incidental sampling of fungi and yeasts in such surveys. The use of microaggressions against sampling as well as other inoculations of fungi or yeasts in these surveys are often undertaken. In most cases, the fungus or microalgae are treated as if they were fungi, but the consequences of this labeling are very serious and include the loss of taxa, the destruction of host communities and the loss of income tax-free. The study of the taxa in microalgae is still in its infancy and no taxonomic or functional classification of these fungi or yeasts is currently known.


## Introduction
Chitin is a polymer of ß-(1<U+2192>6)-D-glucopyranose and a-d-glucopyranose with an outer layer of glucopyranose and glucuronic acid residues (1-8). Chitin is produced by fungi and other organisms as a polymer of ß-(1<U+2192>6)-D-glucopyranose and glucuronic acid with a ß-(1<U+2192>6)-D-glucopyranose side chain, and is mainly present in the cell wall. Chitin is the main component of the cell wall of fungi, in bacteria and in the cytoplasm of the fungi and is involved in their conidial architecture (1).

In fungi, chitin is mainly found in the cell wall and in the outer layer of the cell wall. Chitin is synthesized via a distinct pathway in which two enzymes, chitin synthase (Chs) and chitin degrading enzyme (Chd), are involved (9, 10). In fungi, chitin is synthesized from precursors in the cell wall of the pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum and it is a key component of the cell wall and in the cell wall of pathogenic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Aspergillus fumigatus (9-12).


## Methods
Sample collection and extraction of fungal cultures
Morphological characteristics of the collected samples were documented on May 21st 2016 and July 1st 2017. The samples were collected in the field in Tien-Dalian, China. For field treatment, the leaves were removed and placed in a plastic bag, wrapped in foil, and stored at room temperature. Samples were then placed on ice for one week for storage. A total of 10,000 fresh colonies were counted.

Growth of Fungi
One hundred and twenty-four leaves were collected from three different regions of China (Figure 1). These samples were placed in a plastic bag, wrapped in foil, and stored at room temperature. The leaves were placed on ice for one week for storage. The same number of fresh colonies were counted and placed in a plastic bag and stored at room temperature. Fungi were isolated and identified by the method described by Zhang et al. (2015) [13]. The samples were cultured in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 37°C for 16-18 h, harvested, and stored at 4°C. The fungal biomass was collected by filtration and washed three times with PBS.


## Results
A. fumigatus induces TLR-mediated signaling in response to calcineurin
Previous studies have demonstrated that calcineurin activates TLR4 activation [11, 16], [17], [18].


## Discussion
The results of the present study provide an overview of the population genetics of the C. gattii complex in Korea. We have compared the population structure of C. gattii isolates recovered from patients with or without fungal infections. We found that the C. gattii strains with fungal infections accounted for 93% of all isolates recovered from patients with fungal infections and this was similar to the findings reported in a study in Brazil (7). Our results demonstrate that the C. gattii complex is more diverse than previously believed.
