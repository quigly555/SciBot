## Abstract
The yeast Hylopyriformemus MG37 can cause life-threatening infections in immune compromised hosts. Although it has not been described in the literature, it should raise the suspicion for immune-deficient yeasts in immunocompromised patients. This yeast has been associated with invasive infections, malignant behavior, haemorrhagic events and polycythemia formation. Here we describe the first documented case of H. over 4 over 4 years old. A 62-year old woman had a low body mass index (BMI) which was associated with a high risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic disease. She had a past medical history that included heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and invasive aspergillosis. Diabetes was not diagnosed at the time of hospital admission and the patient remained in good clinical condition for 6 months. The patient was not treated as she died of leukemia and metastatic disease. She had no complications during hospital stay and was not compromised during her transition to an immunocompromised status. The H. over 4 fungus should be considered in the differential of septicemia and liver disease, and to the same extent that other fungi should be included in differential consideration of H. over 4 over 4 years. Treatment and appropriate concurrent surgical resection may improve the outcome.


## Introduction
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in patients with CM, and most patients experience GI symptoms in the course of CM. The term “gastrointestinal” or “gastrointestinal symptoms” implies a typical GI symptom, and GI symptoms are often not seen in patients with CM. The prevalence of GI symptoms in patients with CM is unknown.

In many countries, CM is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 10% of all CM cases in developed countries (WHO, 2014). There are few studies on the prevalence of GI symptoms in patients with CM. Several studies have reported on only two-thirds of patients with CM, with two large studies (Akhurst et al., 2005; Darwish et al., 2006; Kostic et al., 2007; Pashley et al., 2010). Few studies have examined the prevalence of GI symptoms in patients with CM. In one large study, which included 18,557 patients with CM, the prevalence was 2.6% among all patients with cerebrovascular (CVC) CM and 2.3% among all patients with renal cell transplant (Pashley et al., 2010). The prevalence of GI symptoms in patients with CM has not been reported elsewhere. In another large study, prevalence ranged from 6.6% among all patients with CM and 0.3% among all patients with renal cell transplant (Rudy et al., 2013). The GI symptoms in patients with CM are not well described, and the data on GI symptoms in patients with CM are unclear.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively review the data on GI symptoms in patients with CM, with the aim of describing the prevalence of GI symptoms and to elucidate the causes of GI symptoms in patients with CM.


## Methods
Strains and Culture Conditions
All strains used in this study were from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/Fungal_Genome.html) and were grown at 28°C in YPD medium (1% glucose, 2% peptone, 2% yeast extract, and 2% D-glucose) or YPD medium (0.3% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 1.0% ammonium sulfate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulfate, 0.02% ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.02% ammonium sulphate, 0.


## Results
albicans isolates from high-risk HIV-positive patients in the United States was shown in Table . The highest number of isolates of C. albicans were recovered from HIV-negative HIV-negative patients in the United States, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Table 1). Of the C. albicans isolates recovered from HIV-negative patients in the United States, six (3.1%) were isolated from the United Kingdom. Although C. albicans was the predominant fungal burden in the United States, its prevalence was significantly higher in HIV-negative patients (p < 0.001, Figure 1). The majority of C. albicans isolates from HIV-negative patients were isolated from HIV-positive patients who were admitted to the emergency room at the time of HIV infection. The frequency of isolation of C. albicans from the HIV-negative patients who were admitted to the emergency room at the time of HIV infection was similar to that observed in the HIV-positive patients (19.6%) (Table 1).

In addition, C. neoformans was isolated from the bloodstream of nine of the HIV-negative patients (16.7%) (Figure 2). Of the C. neoformans isolates recovered from the United States, three (2.4%) were recovered from the blood of HIV-negative patients and two (1.6%) were from blood of HIV-positive patients who were admitted to the emergency room at the time of HIV infection. The C. neoformans isolates recovered from the United States were predominantly from patients who were admitted to the emergency room at the time of HIV infection (29.5%) (Table 1).

The number of isolates of Candida species recovered from the bloodstream of HIV-negative HIV-negative patients in the United States was similar to that observed in the HIV-positive patients (Table 1). Of the C. neoformans isolates recovered from the bloodstream of HIV-negative patients, five (1.8%) were recovered from blood of HIV-negative patients, and three (2.3%) were recovered from blood of HIV-positive patients who were admitted to the emergency room at the time of HIV infection. Among the C.


## Discussion
,8,9 Although the frequency of opportunistic infections was low in the CARSA isolates, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was higher than previously reported (n = 10) or even observed in the CARSA isolates from high-risk individuals,9 suggesting a new trend in the incidence of opportunistic infection.

In this study, the occurrence of opportunistic infections was associated with the receipt of ART in the CARSA isolates. Most of the CARSA isolates from high-risk patients were not infected with HIV, and thus, they were not included in this study. The findings from this study are consistent with previous findings, where opportunistic infections were more common in high-risk patients.4,5,11

The frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl was higher than the reported rate of 10-40% reported from Taiwan.8 In this study, the CD4 count was lower in patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl, while that of the CD4 count of the patients with CD4 counts =200 cells/µl was higher in those with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl. In addition, our findings are consistent with previous findings, where opportunistic infections were more common in high-risk patients.7,8,9 In this study, the patient with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl had a significantly lower CD4 count compared to the patient with CD4 counts >200 cells/µl.

The frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl was similar to the rate reported from Taiwan,8 but, in the Taiwan study, there was no difference between the frequencies of opportunistic infections and those in the study by Caramoeba sarphinii.3 The frequencies of opportunistic infections were higher in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl, and the frequency of opportunistic infections was higher in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl. This difference was not observed in other studies.
