## Abstract
Fungi are important pathogens that cause fatal diseases in a wide range of plant hosts, but the diversity of fungi found in arid grasslands is also a source of significant environmental and economic impacts. Many of these effects are likely to be attributable to the foliar strategy, which relies on a mixture of livestock and soil management practices. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms with a high degree of specialization in a particular herbicide, and heterotrophic grazers have been shown to have an increased competitive advantage in the open-season grazers. The search for novel fungal species and their associated costs in arid grassland worldwide has been the focus of several investigations for several years. In this paper, we review the available science and discuss them in the light of new data and the significant benefits these fungi might provide to the ecosystem and to the ecosystems around them. We provide several examples to show that these costs can be significantly reduced by implementing the foliar strategy in the grazers that live on arid grasses that are at risk for the foliar strategy or that are ecologically affected. This approach can be particularly helpful in managing livestock grazers and can reduce costs associated with the foliar strategy.


## Introduction
The BIB acts as a “platform” that connects the immune system and the central nervous system, eventually leading to blood brain barrier breakdown [1. In addition, the BIB can mediate intercellular signaling, including both Toll-like receptors (TLR) and interferon-receptor (IRR)-dependent processes, in immune cells [2]. IRR is a conserved type of cell death receptor that binds TLR-2 and recognizes a variety of stimuli, including TLR-2a and TLR-2b, and IRR2-mediated signaling [3,4]. TLR-2 is activated by IFN-<U+03B3> and induces an immunological response termed “immunity-based agonistic response” [5]. In this state, TLR-2 acts as a receptor that induces the expression of immunological and cell-signaling molecules that elicit a pro-inflammatory response [5]. In this state, TLR-2 activates a pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, that triggers cytokines that regulate immune cell activation and the differentiation of macrophages and neutrophils into activation and memory T cells [5,6].

IL-12 and IL-18 are major regulators of the immune response and they regulate the activation of the B-cell and the neutrophil-driven killing of pathogens [7]. The IL-12 and IL-18 are generally known to have dual roles. In mice, IL-12 and IL-18 mediate pro-inflammatory responses to viral infection, whereas IL-18 promotes the control of intracellular pathogens by regulating IL-12 receptor expression and cytokine secretion [7,8]. The IL-12 and IL-18 receptors can act as both receptors by different mechanisms [9]. In mice, IL-12 activates the innate immune response, and IL-18 activates the adaptive immune response, which in turn is responsible for the activation of the B-cell and neutrophil-mediated killing of viruses and bacteria [10,11]. Both cytokines can also act as cytokines and activation of the B-cell and the neutrophil-driven killing of viruses and bacteria [11,12]. IL-12 mediates both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory response to viral infection [13,14].


## Methods
The primers of iQ SYBR Green Supermix and iQ SYBR Premix Exonuclease I (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 16S rRNA gene and the first-strand cDNA was amplified with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA. The gene-specific primers ITS1F (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') were used to amplify the gene of interest. The quantitative PCR assay was performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in a total volume of 20 µL containing 1 µL of 10 × PCR buffer, 1 µL of 1.25 µM of each dNTP (2 mM), 1.25 µL of 10 mM MgCl_2, and 1.25 µL of 20 mM dNTP (25 mM). The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The quantification of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences was performed with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative quantification of gene-specific amplification products was calculated by the method of normalization. The PCR products were visualized with ethidium bromide and the concentrations were calculated using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The comparative quantification method was used to evaluate the difference in relative levels of each gene of interest in relation to the skin barrier.


## Results
The data presented in the present study are consistent with the previous findings, which suggest that septin inactivation contributes to the maintenance of the ski. Thus, we suggest that the function of septin in the maintenance of the skin is not dependent on septin protein activity. In addition, we suggest that the function of septin in the maintenance of the skin is not related to septin protein activity. These observations suggest that septin inactivation could potentially contribute to the structural changes in the skin.

The results of the RNA-Seq analysis of the DNA extracted from the skin samples revealed the presence of different subtypes of septin proteins, which can be differentiated in the three-dimensional space. In particular, the higher level of septin protein in the skin was related to the presence of septins as shown by the higher expression level of septin proteins in the skin of the positive control. Conversely, higher levels of septin protein in the skin of the negative control were related to septins as demonstrated by the lower expression levels in the skin of the negative control. In addition, the expression levels of septins in the skin of the positive control were related to septins as shown by the higher expression levels in the skin of the negative control.

We next tested the involvement of septins in the development of the skin. In particular, we examined the involvement of septins in the development of the skin by using the yeast-like organisms of Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. The results of these studies are consistent with the previous results, which indicated that septins can play a role in the development of the skin.

In contrast, the function of septins in the skin of the negative control was not explored. In particular, the expression levels of septins in the skin of the negative control were not analyzed. In addition, the expression levels of septins in the skin of the negative control were not analyzed. In this regard, the functions of septins in the development of the skin of the negative control were not explored.

## Discussion
It is an important protein in the formation of granulocytes, which are recruited to the brain for fungal invasion and subsequently differentiate into granulocytes for ocular invasion (5, 10. In our study, we found that Dectin-1 plays an important role in the regulation of the brain-peripheral immune response, thereby facilitating the invasion of C. neoformans and fungal invasion. Furthermore, we found that the immune response in the skin is mainly composed of inflammatory cells, which are mainly involved in the skin barrier. These inflammatory cells are the major component of the phagocyte system (5, 10, 23, 24). Our study shows that Dectin-1 is involved in the regulation of the immune response to C. neoformans and fungal invasion. The disease severity was significantly increased in the brain, which may be related to the innate immune response and the development of C. neoformans and fungal invasion. Our results show that the brain infection by C. neoformans and fungal invasion is significantly increased in the brain of mice. This indicates that the innate immune response is involved in the early stages of C. neoformans and fungal invasion. In addition, the amount of TNF-a increased in the brain of infected mice. TNF-a is an anti-inflammatory molecule, which is produced by innate immune cells and is also involved in the development of immunopathology (25). The increased amounts of TNF-a in the brain of infected mice could be related to the increased amount of inflammatory cells in the brain. The increased amount of TNF-a in the brain may be related to the development of C. neoformans and fungal invasion. The amount of TNF-a in the brain is mainly responsible for the formation of the inflammatory cytokines and the production of chemokines and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators (26, 27). TNF-a is involved in the immune response to C. neoformans and fungal invasion (28, 29). Our results revealed that the amount of TNF-a in the brain was significantly increased in infected mice. TNF-a is a cytokine produced by innate immune cells. It is a marker of T cell differentiation and survival.
