## Abstract
Candida spp. are susceptible to common antifungal drugs, especially fluconazole. Candida albicans is a fungal species that is considered to be the most common cause of candidemia in the world. The antifungal potential of fluconazole depends on its ability to induce membrane damage, such as in vitro in the absence of other antifungal drugs. In this study, we determined the in vitro antifungal potential of sodium azide (1-3) and fluconazole (3-C) in the in vitro antifungal activity of the drug. The in vitro activity of azoles was significantly higher than fluconazole (2,50 µg/ml) in two experimental groups (inferior to fluconazole-susceptible and resistant Candida albicans isolates) and the fluconazole-resistant C. albicans (6.29-32.8%, in the 1-C and 3-C, respectively). In addition, the in vitro activities of these antifungals were significantly higher than fluconazole (3.63-4.54 µg/ml) in one group and fluconazole (4.14-12.79 µg/ml) in two groups (P < 0.01 by non-parametric testing). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole and fluconazole alone were determined by CLSI methods. The minimum effective concentrations of fluconazole and fluconazole alone were determined to be 256 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. The antifungal activity of the fluconazole and fluconazole alone was significantly higher than that of fluconazole and it was maintained in higher concentrations. We found that the combination of fluconazole and fluconazole alone had a concomitant antifungal activity, supporting an interaction between fluconazole and fluconazole. This study demonstrates that combination of fluconazole and fluconazole has a considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans. Our results suggest that the combination of fluconazole and fluconazole has a strong antifungal activity against C. albicans.

The pathogen Aspergillus species causes life-threatening invasive fungal disease, which is endemic in many parts of the world. Most cases of invasive aspergillosis occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematological malignancies, solid organ transplants, and patients with AIDS, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and patients with nephrotic syndrome. The disease can be caused by multiple species of Aspergillus and is characterized by the formation of mucosal lesions in the lung and the formation of granulomas. In immunocompromised patients, the pathogen can proliferate, and it can cause disease in multiple host organs, including the brain, skin, lungs, and central nervous system (CNS) and can disseminate from there to other tissues. These findings may include acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and may also lead to pneumonia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome. The clinical manifestations are varied, and the disease can progress rapidly and may progress to invasive aspergillosis (IA). In addition, the pathogen can cause infection of the skin, nails, and nails of both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Although the incidence of IA has been reported to be low, its mortality rate is extremely high, ranging from 40 to 100% and can reach up to 60% in patients with co-infections and/or tumors. Currently, there is no proven treatment for IA and it is difficult to treat and eradicate IA. The current treatment is either chemical, such as azoles and echinocandins, or systemic, such as itraconazole. Itraconazole (ITC) is a fungistatic drug that has the potential to reduce the activity of several enzymes of the fungal cell wall. It has been used for the treatment of several types of aspergillosis.


## Methods
Fungal viability was also determined by PC. To investigate the effect of Fungal Absence on Fungal Stability, the viability of Fungi in vitro was also observed by the presence of Fungi in vivo. The efficacy of Fungal Absence on Fungal Resistance was also tested by measuring the Fungal Activity Index (AFI) of Fungal Absence on Fungal Cells.

Time-Kill Assays
Time-kill assays were performed by the method of Chitin et al. (1957) with modifications. Fungal cells were grown in Sabouraud medium for 5 h at 37°C, and the culture was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 min. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended and treated with 0.25% L-tryptophan for 1 h. Subsequently, 0.5 ml of PBS was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the dark. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the non-phagocytosed Fungal Ab. After incubation with 0.25% L-tryptophan for 1 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The cell density was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm, and the experiment was repeated three times.

Fungal Cell Culture
P. brasiliensis yeast cells (ATCC CRL-3218) were cultured in Sabouraud medium at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and then the cells were resuspended in sterile PBS. The cells were then treated with 0.25% L-tryptophan for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and the supernatant was removed.


## Results
In human and mouse models, the antifungal peptide molecules were used to investigate whether peptides were involved in the inhibition of fungal infection and their possible anti-fungal activit.

We investigated the antifungal activity of human and mouse immune peptides against A. fumigatus and A. terreus (Fig 2). In both species, the peptides were effective against both fungi, and the antifungal peptides were more active against A. fumigatus. However, in A. terreus the peptides were less active than the human peptides, and the peptides were less active against A. fumigatus. Furthermore, the peptides were less effective against A. terreus, and the peptides were more active against A. terreus than A. fumigatus.

Evaluation of Antifungal Activity of Human and Mouse Immunosuppressive Peptides
We evaluated whether the human and mouse immunosuppressive peptides could inhibit the fungal growth and the infection of A. fumigatus. We evaluated the inhibitory activity of human and mouse immunosuppressive peptides against A. fumigatus and A. terreus using a different immunosuppressive system (Immune Activation Research (IA) BioImmuneProt®). The peptides were used in combination with the antifungal peptide agents, and the results showed that the peptides had an inhibition of A. fumigatus growth against A. terreus, and the peptides were more effective against A. fumigatus than A. terreus (Fig 3).

In order to evaluate the importance of peptides in the antifungal activity, the effects of peptides on the antifungal activity of human and mouse immunosuppressive peptides against A. fumigatus and A. terreus were evaluated. The peptides were used in combination with the antifungal peptide agents, and the results showed that the peptides had an inhibitory effect on both fungi.


## Discussion
neoformans Infection
Since the majority of human immunodeficiency/HIV (HIV) infections are caused by . neoformans, we are interested in investigating the pathophysiology of infection caused by this opportunistic fungus.

The innate immune system consists of CD4^+ T cells, which are activated by numerous factors to initiate a cascade of immune responses, including cytokine production, activation of innate immune responses, and apoptosis of cells [41]. There are several types of CD4^+ T cells. CD4^+ T cells are composed of a large number of Type I, T, and C lymphocytes, which are activated by numerous cytokines to stimulate T cell proliferation and differentiation [42]. The expression of the Th1-type cytokines IL-6 and IFN-<U+03B3> in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals has been shown to confer protection against C. neoformans infection [43]. There is also evidence that Th2-type cytokines, such as IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-10, and IL-13, play important roles in C. neoformans-induced Th2-type responses [44]. IFN-<U+03B3> is a potent inducer of Th2-type responses to C. neoformans infection [45].

IFN-<U+03B3> plays a crucial role in the development of Th1-type responses [46]. In our experiments, IL-6 production was increased in C. neoformans-infected mice, which corresponds to the increased expression of IL-6 in the peripheral blood of mice infected with C. neoformans. We also observed the increased IL-10 production in infected mice infected with C. neoformans. The increased IL-10 production in infected mice indicated that IL-10 is produced in the peripheral blood of infected mice. In contrast, we observed increased IL-10 in infected mice infected with C. neoformans. IL-10 production was not increased in infected mice infected with C. neoformans. IFN-<U+03B3> was not increased in infected mice infected with C. neoformans. IFN-<U+03B3> is produced by the T helper cell, T-cell, and humoral immune response to C.
