## Abstract

Ai Medici Igienisti sottolineano come questo rischio le informazioni devono ricevuto knowledge gaps, compresa la disponibilità di uno dei settori incluse le informazioni anche nelle unità di terapia comunicativa (medico, anatomica, visite, diario ambientale ec.).

Sulla base dei dati epidemiologici, per quanto riguarda l’epidemia delle complicanze non solo nelle diverse fasce di età, ma anche nelle seguenti months: recentemente al di fuori delle malattie croniche non trasmissibili; recentemente al di fuori delle complicanze non trasmissibili negli stili di vita, oltre che per i suoi soccorsi assistenziali e nei sua percorsi assistenziali.

In questo studio si pone l’obiettivo di indagare la presenza di tale strumento per il sistema sanitario di rispondere ai criteri di trasmissione nella pratica clinica.

Protegge si ritrova in futuro, in particolare quella di una struttura sanitaria, dall’inversione di un approccio a sviluppare e ampliato uno scenario assistenziale nei sistemi di sostituzione delle persone con malattia cronica. Questo quadro di sensibilizzazione, orientato alla progettazione e alla base delle risorse umane, si ritrovano ad affrontare il concetto delle comunicazioni tra la popolazione attuale e le comunità scientifiche, tra le comunicazioni di base e delle risorse disponibili e delle opinioni del sistema sanitario.


## Introduction
Fungi are ubiquitous and ubiquitous in the environment. They live in associations with many other organisms, living in various habitats such as soil, plants, and insects. Some of these organisms can cause disease in humans as well as pets and other animals. Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, and A. nidulans are the most common etiological agents of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients [1-3]. A. flavus is the main etiological agent of IA in patients with defective host immunity, however, A. niger, A. flavus, and A. nidulans are the most frequent etiological agents of IA in humans [4,5]. In vitro studies using a combination of in vitro culture and animal models have shown that A. flavus causes disease in healthy individuals and that A. flavus is able to induce disease in patients infected with A. flavus [6]. However, due to the low survival of the disease, and the high pathogenic potential of the organism in the host, the incidence of disease is very high in immunocompromised patients. In addition, the virulence of A. flavus is highly variable and its ability to induce disease is dependent on various factors such as the host immune status, fungal infection, and host diet [7]. The human pathogen A. fumigatus has been reported to be relatively resistant to antifungal therapy [8]. The high mortality of IA is due to the lack of a clear, clear cut and rapid treatment. The best treatment options are expensive and the side effects of antifungal treatment are related to high mortality rates, which are high even with the best therapy [9]. Thus, the development of new treatments for IA remains a major challenge.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been identified as promising therapeutic targets against many infectious diseases. They are biosynthesized from microbial metabolic pathways that are present in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and mammals [10]. AMPs are small membrane bound molecules with an amphipathic structure that have a short cytoplasmic tail and have a short half-life. They are mainly produced by Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, but can also occur in other fungal species, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans [11,12].


## Methods
. Shenton et al. (2008).

For the tests of sterility, the tubes were inoculated with 1 × 10^6 conidia/mL of Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose (YPD) agar plate and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. Then, the colonies were counted and the percent inoculated was calculated. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits the growth of the tested fungus.

2.3. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activities of the extract of P. marneffei were evaluated according to the methods of Miller (1966) and O'Toole (1971). The yeast extract was prepared by dissolving a part of the P. marneffei, R. mucilaginosa, and F. terreus in ethanol and then inoculated into the potato dextrose agar plates. The yeast extract was cultivated for 6 days at 30°C. The inoculated plates were then treated with distilled water to remove any particulate material, then examined under a light microscope. The lowest concentration of the extract that completely inhibited the growth of the tested fungus was defined as the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC).

2.4. In Vitro Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was determined by using the microdilution method. In this assay, the yeast extract was serially diluted in RPMI-1640 medium to reach a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 conidia/mL. The RPMI-1640 medium was composed of 15% glycerol, 1% peptone, 2% glucose, and 0.2% sodium as carbonate. The cultivation of yeast, R. mucilaginosa, and F. terreus was performed as described previously (O'Toole, 1971). The final concentrations of the extracts ranged from 0.06 to 1.0 mg/mL. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extracts.

2.5. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
The MIC was determined using the microdilution method. The yeast extract was serially diluted in RPMI-1640 medium to reach a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 conidia/mL.

## Discussion
laurenti. The subfamily C. tropicalis includes a wide array of filamentous fungal species, and includes species with a broad host range, such as C. krusei and C. parapsilosis. In the current study, we showed that C. tropicalis was not only a typical fungal species, but also a member of the genus Candida. We found that C. tropicalis was a representative species of the genus Candida, and that the species distribution of the fungus was consistent with that of C. parapsilosis, which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in children. This is consistent with the fact that C. parapsilosis is not usually associated with hospital or other diseases in immunocompromised patients [5], but it is commonly encountered in patients with severely immunocompromised conditions [6].

A. niger is another representative species of the genus Candida. The species is associated with the same group of fungi, such as A. fumigatus and A. niger, which were found in our study. A. fumigatus is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 50% in immunocompromised patients [7]. A. niger is also a typical fungal species. It was isolated from fungi that are common in hospital settings, including C. neoformans, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis [8]. C. albicans was isolated in the present study from clinical samples from patients with AIDS, but only in immunocompetent patients, including patients with high risk for HIV infection [9]. In addition, C. parapsilosis was isolated from patients with AIDS with rare HIV infection and it was also isolated from patients with immunocompromised conditions [10]. This species is usually reported as being resistant to antifungal therapy, which could also be due to its ability to colonize new niches in the host [11].

Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from patients with infection with Candida albicans. This species is associated with C. tropicalis and C. krusei, which are the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis in humans [12].
