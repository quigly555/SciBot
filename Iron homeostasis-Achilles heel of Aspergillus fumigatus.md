## Abstract
The capability of yeast to survive the environment is often attributed to the hyphal and yeast-like structures of their environment, yet the mechanisms underlying this process have remained largely unknown. Here we report that the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans can successfully colonize the lungs of healthy mammalian hosts, and then germinate in these lungs is able to directly damage the adjacent pulmonary tissue to promote a persistent inflammatory response. This cell-mediated hyphal invasion can result in tissue damage that can be devastating to otherwise healthy hosts. Thus, the environment in which Candida yeast can thrive is the critical point at stake in this interaction.

When a pathogenic microorganism proliferates within a host, it is able to readily identify and destroy invading cells in a host-specific manner. It is this ability that allows the pathogen to colonize and establish a persistent infection. Yeast is thus an environmentally-sustainable and easily used model system to study the cellular and molecular processes underlying the ability of yeast cells to effectively combat microbial growth.


## Introduction
fumigatus to survive within the host is crucial for its virulenc. The most notable virulence-defining step is the loss of the ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells of the lung (Datta et al., 2016). The loss of the ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells is associated with the loss of phagolysosome function. Several studies have demonstrated that the phagolysosome is an important intracellular organelle involved in the production and function of cytokines, chemokines, and proteins (Datta et al., 2016; Cools et al., 2016). Phagocytosis occurs as an activated vacuole that can destroy macromolecules and other cells such as bacteria, fungi, and archaea. Phagocytosis is essential for the accomplishment of many cellular functions, including the metabolism of cell wall components, and therefore, is important for fungal pathogenicity (Muller and Stewart, 2006; Swiegers and Graess, 2010; Pukka et al., 2016). The most important step for phagocytosis is the interaction of the phagosome with the microbicidal granule, the lysosome, and eventually the cytoskeleton (Datta et al., 2016). The lysosome organizes and stores many proteins and enzymes, and thus, the lysosome can be considered a dynamic organelle involved in the detoxification of macromolecules.

In contrast to other eukaryotic cells, fungal cells lack the typical cell wall and do not undergo phagocytosis. Therefore, they are known as “host-defense microorganisms” (Hagler, 1995). They are normally restricted to the cytoplasmic environment and do not acquire nutrients from the cytoskeleton (Scherm et al., 2010). However, certain microorganisms can secrete extracellular polysaccharides that can be used by the microorganism to enhance phagocytosis (Caporaso et al., 2010; Nemergut et al., 2013). In addition, the extracellular polysaccharides are structurally complex and they can be degraded in the phagolysosome to glucose, fructose, and fructose-2,6,7-triphosphate.


## Methods
AChyboxreno-BLAST searches were performed with the BLAST algorithm in order to identify genes with similarity to known Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus luteus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus nige. The search parameters were: minimum e-value of 1e-4, minimum e-value of 1e-20, and maximum e-value of 1e-50. In order to identify known AChyboxreno-BLAST genes, we used a non-redundant list of gene families for the search. For this purpose, we manually curated the genes that could potentially belong to the H. fumigatus or Aspergillus species, and used these genes to query a database, which contained: [1, 4] (S1 Fig), [2, 3], [3, 5], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] and [23].

Molecular characterization of AChyboxreno-BLAST
The genomic sequences of the selected AChyboxreno-BLAST genes were compared with other fungal gene families in the H. fumigatus and Aspergillus genomes. The orthologs of these fungal genes were analyzed using BLASTP against the H. fumigatus and Aspergillus genomes, using the hcl-pyrG and hcl-pyrG sequences as query sequences, respectively.

The orthologs of all the fungal genes were analyzed by sequence similarity using the online tool Inline [24]. The identified orthologs were then aligned with the HMMER web server [25] using the program MEGA 7.0 software [26].


## Results
neoformans for the . fumigatus L1 and L2 of C. neoformans, we next sought to identify a conserved binding site between C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2. The C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 have been previously implicated in host immune evasion [9]. Accordingly, we tested whether the conserved binding site of the L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 is conserved in C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2. In contrast to the previously described L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2, the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 are slightly more similar in the magnitude of binding affinity (Fig 2A). The C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 were also slightly more similar in the magnitude of binding affinity (Fig 2A). This suggests that the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 have a relatively relaxed binding site, similar to that of the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2.

We next sought to identify the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 binding sites. The binding sites of the L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 were highly conserved, with C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 having the highest binding affinity (Fig 2B). This suggests that the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C. neoformans L1 and C. neoformans L2 have a relatively relaxed binding site. This is further supported by the observation that the C. neoformans L1 and L2 of C.


## Discussion
fumigatus to sense and respond to changes in light is regulated by the light response pathwa. The differences in light-regulated light-responsive pathways between A. fumigatus and A. nidulans suggest that the A. fumigatus light response pathway is different from that of A. nidulans. We show that the A. fumigatus light response pathway is regulated by the light response pathway in both A. nidulans and A. fumigatus. We also showed that A. fumigatus and A. nidulans also express the light-regulated light-responsive transcription factor, p38, and that the A. fumigatus and A. nidulans light response pathways are regulated by the light response pathway. Our results show that the A. fumigatus light response pathway plays a key role in the light response pathway.

The A. fumigatus-A. nidulans heterodimeric light response system regulates the A. fumigatus and A. nidulans light response pathway pathways in response to the light response pathway (Figs 5 and 6). Although the A. fumigatus homologue in A. nidulans was reported to be conserved in S. cerevisiae (Gehringer et al., 2007), in A. fumigatus homologs in A. nidulans and A. nidulans were not conserved (Fig 7). In contrast, A. fumigatus homologs in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus were conserved (Fig 7). Thus, it is possible that A. fumigatus and A. nidulans have the same A. fumigatus and A. nidulans homologs. However, our results show that A. fumigatus and A. nidulans also have the same A. nidulans homologue (Fig 7).

We further show that A. fumigatus has the same A. nidulans homologue as A. fumigatus and A. nidulans and that the A. fumigatus homologue in A. nidulans is conserved (Fig 8). Therefore, it is possible that the A.
