## Abstract
The importance of lignocellulolytic enzymes in the control of the yeast Candida albicans infection has been recognised. However, the biofilm formation and the activity of the main virulence factors of C. albicans have not been well documented. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of lignocellulolytic enzymes in the control of the C. albicans infection and their role in this infection.

The strains C. albicans ATCC 10231 and Enterococcus H37 (ATCC 10231/L) were assayed for their lignocellulolytic activity against C. albicans. The biofilm formation and virulence factors expression were evaluated by flow cytometry and the inhibition of biofilm formation by different strains of C. albicans were determined.

Ligulase from the laccase strain inhibited the lignin-induced biofilm formation and inhibited the formation of the biofilm associated with C. albicans biofilm formation. Subsequent to this, the activity of lignocellulolytic and lignin-producing factors was inhibited respectively. Furthermore, the presence of different strains of C. albicans and biofilm did not interfere with the biofilm formation.

The present study demonstrates the applicability of lignocellulolytic and lignin-producing factors for C. albicans infection control. Laccase inhibition by laccase in C. albicans could be a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics used for treatment of this disease. The inhibition of biofilm formation by laccase in this way could be a new strategy for the treatment of C. albicans infections.


## Introduction
There are more than 250,000 described species of fungi in the world’s oceans. They range from small, ubiquitous saprophytes to major groups such as white-rot fungi and ectomycorrhizal (ETM) species [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The mechanisms by which fungi are transported, and their capacity to evade the mammalian immune system and to cause aflatoxins accumulation in the phagolysosome are still poorly understood. However, a plethora of studies have found that the macrophage is an important target for fungal infections [7]. The macrophage represents a key cell population for fungal pathogens, as it generates ROS and NO production from NADPH oxidases, resulting in ROS accumulation, ROS production-regulatory pathways, and NO production-associated signaling pathways [8,9]. There are some reports that the macrophage produces NO in response to antifungal agents, e.g.


## Methods
The following recommendations were followed for the use of these species in clinical and animal medicin.

5.1. Clinical Principles
The following clinical principles were followed in the evaluation of the medicinal plant in this country: (1) the purpose of the study was to understand the medical importance of the medicinal plant in the country, (2) the herbal medicine was not on the basis of a traditional medicine but was based on the traditional practices of the ancestors. (3) the main objective was to observe the medical importance of the medicinal plant in the country. (4) The application of the traditional medicine was considered to be a means of its health, and therefore, the main aim of the study was to understand the ethical and ethical aspects of the practice. (5) The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Biotechnology, Malaysia.

5.2. Clinical Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute of Medical Information and Information (NIMIMIP), which was established in 2002. NIMIP was a registered laboratory-based organization which provides training, research, training, and research services to all health professionals in the field of medicine. NIMIP is a dedicated research center with 40,000 members and a population of over 12 million patients in the country. In the field, NIMIP is equipped with research centers from Thailand to Malaysia. NIMIP has conducted clinical trials, have performed clinical trials, and have conducted research projects. In the laboratory, NIMIP has performed patient-experience analysis.

5.3. Clinical Methods
The clinical procedures of the study were done according to the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki and the recommendations of the European Convention for the protection of animals used in scientific experiments. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study and all tests and protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Biotechnology, Malaysia.

5.4. Clinical Methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals used in scientific experiments. The clinical data was collected using standardized procedures and procedures, and the data was analyzed and analyzed in accordance with the principles of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals used in scientific experiments.

## Results
la., A.J.L. Jones & C.J. Wilson) [39].

Among all the 102 species in this clade, 14 species were isolated in the previous study of P. juglandis. The remaining seven species were isolated in two previous studies of P. juglandis: P. marinus (P. marinum) and P. tasmanicum.

The genus Papiliotrema was originally described from Australia [40]. Papiliotrema was later shown to be a novel genus with a worldwide distribution [40]. This genus was further described as P. juglandis (Agaricales) by Meissner and Dussl [41]. Papiliotrema is a non-metazoan genus with different patterns of taxonomy: It is monotypic in the sense that it is not a member of the Thiabendomycete order, and the type species is a pseudogene. The type species of Papiliotrema is P. marinus (Agaricales), and a worldwide distribution is only described in the present study. Papiliotrema marinus is the first reported member of the genus Papiliotrema.

Papiliotrema marinus is described as having a pustular, ellipsoidal, and an olivaceous green conidial wall with a compact outer surface. The conidia of P. marinus are globose, ellipsoidal, and with a cylindrical or fusoid structure (Fig 2).

Papiliotrema marinus is described as having a fusoid, cylindrical, and long, pale brownish, hyaline, and smooth-walled, germ pores. The conidial dimensions of the type species of Papiliotrema are similar to that of the type species of P. juglandis: 12.5-13.0 × 4.5-6.5 µm (Agaricales), 12.3-14.2 × 5.3-6.5 µm (P. marinus), 12.9-15.0 × 5.6-7.0 µm (Agaricales), 15.4-17.9 × 5.0-6.2 µm (P. marinus), 16.8-17.4 × 5.5-6.


## Discussion
dahliae, as well as in other endemic plant.

In this work, the majority of the Brazilian medicinal plants were identified as asexual species (except for Pooria tibetii, and the corresponding species of Pooria perithecia, as shown in Figure 2). Additionally, the species of Pooria tibetii, Pooria perithecia, and Pooria perithecia were classified as asexual and therefore were not included in this study. The plant species of Pooria tibetii, Pooria perithecia, and Pooria perithecia were assigned to the genera Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium equisetiae. The genus Fusarium (Mycosphaerellaceae) was described as a genus of parasitic on Laccaria. It was also reported as a genus of herbaceous plant-endophytes in Southeast Asia [28]. The generic concept of Fusarium (teleomorph Laccaria) is based on the genus Fusarium. This genus includes plant-associated endophytes that have been reported to have antibacterial, antifungal, and fungicidal activity [29]. The genus Fusarium (Sordariales) was described as a genus of saprophytic endophytes that have been reported to possess antifungal, antifungal-like, and antileishmanial activities [30]. The genus Sordariales (Phialophora) has been reported to have antifungal, antifungal-like, and antileishmanial activities [31]. This genus includes plants with a wide variety of fruiting (Trichopax sylvestris, Alternaria graminis, and Phialophora annularis) and has been reported to possess various biological activities [32]. The genus Phialophora (Lecanoromycetes) was described as a genus of endophytes associated with Thalassiosira spp. in eastern North America, and this genus includes endophytes that have been reported to possess various biological activities [33]. The genus Lecanoromycetes (Myrtaceae) was reported as a genus of endophytes associated with the genus Rhodotorula in southern Europe [34].
