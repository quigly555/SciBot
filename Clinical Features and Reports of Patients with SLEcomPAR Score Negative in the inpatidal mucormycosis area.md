## Abstract
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses a particular clinical problem in the developing world because its rapid spread in the western world results in a high morbidity and mortality rate. The viral load (VL) is a useful measure of virulence because it uses the time to replication time (TTL) of the immune response, which makes it simple to measure. However, the VL of HIV has a negative predictive value because it is similar to that of the NK cell, the most abundant natural killer of H. pylori (NK) and a target for anti-NK cell therapy. Therefore, the use of molecular methods for the quantification of immune responses and NK cell activity monitoring could improve the quality and predictive values of HIV vaccine data and improve the use of HIV vaccine data for the diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between NK cell and VL in a central Taiwan Ugandan HIV cohort to establish the use of NK cells as a surrogate marker of NK cell function.

The plasma and serum VL of 112 Ugandan HIV-infected patients with either an isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis or an isolated Mycobacterium avium complex infection was measured using the conventional VL analysis protocol. The activity of the conventional VL assay was determined using the standard VL protocol that only included the somA, somA, and P90 enzymes. The immunobiology of the lymphomalignant lesions was determined by the conventional immunoCLT assay. The clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-Meter test and the significance of the parameters set by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis statistic.

The results showed that the conventional VL assay included all the histopathologic parameters, including P90 and NK cells, as well as NK cell counts, the concentration of lymphocyte products in the supernatant, and the cytotoxicity to human monocytic cells. The conventional VL included Vl, Vl, and Vnt in the normal and leukemia forms and were negative in 106/416 (36.8%) and 107/416 (66.4%) of the cases, respectively. The conventional VL included only Vl, Vl, and Vnt in the leukemia and non-lymphoma forms.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have increased dramatically in recent decades, affecting millions of patients annually (1). Despite considerable progress, the incidence of IFIs remains unacceptably high in the developing world. These infections are often caused by fungi such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus species (2). Regardless of the type of fungal, or their geographic origin, IFIs are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world (3). The major risk factor for the development of these diseases is the immunosuppressive therapy currently used, including corticosteroids and cancer chemotherapy. This therapy is associated with several adverse side effects and has limited efficacy. Additionally, the toxic side effects of corticosteroids are a major limiting factor for the use of corticosteroids in patients with immunosuppression (4). Thus, the development of alternative and effective therapies is urgently needed.

Many antifungal agents, such as polyenes, pyrimidine analogs, and azoles, target ergosterol biosynthesis.


## Methods
Study population
The study population consisted of consecutive HIV-positive patients who were treated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from March 2011 to March 2012, according to the WHO [14] and the Institute of Infectious Disease [15] guidelines. HIV-infected patients were excluded from the study population if they were newly diagnosed with sepsis or if they were not receiving the antiretroviral treatment proposed in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [16]. A list of patients with sepsis was compiled and is available in Additional file 1.

Patients were classified as 1) transiently and 2) fully septic on the first day of admission. Patients were considered to have been hospitalized if they were suspected of having septic meningitis or if they had no obvious signs of septic meningitis and/or no symptoms of septic meningitis, including increased visual acuity, meningeal fluid, or fever.


## Results
A high CRM was associated with the prevalence of certain clinical features in the inpatidal mucormycosis are. The most common clinical features were fever, the skin and sinus lesions, the concomitant infection, the presence of a yeast-like form of leukopenia, the presence of a nodular form of mucormycosis, and the presence of a low blood CD4 count.

In order to elucidate the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis, in the inpatidal mucormycosis site, the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis was evaluated by the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in a clinical setting. The pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was evaluated by the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in a clinical setting. The pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was evaluated by the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in a clinical setting. The pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was evaluated by the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in a clinical setting.

The infection of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was evaluated by the diagnosis of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site. The diagnosis of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was determined by the diagnosis of the inpatidal mucormycosis site. The pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis in the inpatidal mucormycosis site was evaluated by the pathogenicity of the inpatidal mucormycosis site.


## Discussion
The severity of symptoms was also associated with the presence of a clinical sign of mucormycosi. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative included progressive CNS lymphoiditis, cystic fibrosis, and encephalopathy. In patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative, the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative included cranial nerve palsy, neck stiffness, and tachypnea. In patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative, the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative included cranial nerve palsy, neck stiffness, and tachypnea. In patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative, the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLEcomPAR Score Negative included spinal cord compression, haemorrhage, and sinusitis.

In the patient with SLECOMPAR Score Negative, the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLECOMPAR Score Negative included cranial nerve palsy, neck stiffness, and tachypnea. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with SLECOMPAR Score Negative included cranial nerve palsy, neck stiffness, and tachypnea.
