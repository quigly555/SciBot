## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a life-threatening fungal infection endemic in Latin America. The rapid identification of new P. brasiliensis infections will allow for improved diagnosis, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, and a better understanding of the available treatment options. One such treatment option is called immunostimulant therapy (ICH).


## Introduction
 2017; Kanwar et a., 2017). The soft materials that have been engineered for long-term applications are being used in a large number of industries. Among these, solid-state aerobically prepared solid-state aerobel, including soft materials used in hospitals and transportation equipment, are becoming more popular due to their higher mechanical properties and short life cycle.

However, the application of soft materials with longer life cycle, and less heating and less water consumption, is a common problem in aerobes. Aerobic materials with long-term biological activity can be used in aerobes for long-term aerobiology. Bioinformatic and mechanical methods have been used to fabricate soft aerobes from biomaterials, such as biomaterials, in order to fabricate soft aerobes from biomaterials (Buchanan et al., 2014; Mishra and Singh, 2015).

Although bioinformatic methods have been applied to design soft material for aerobes, their applications for biomedical engineering are still largely unknown. Among these, the development of biosensors is a new area of research that will undoubtedly continue to improve the understanding of biomaterials, as well as the discovery of new biomaterials with different mechanical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biophysical properties (Chandra and Sivakumar, 2015; Kumar et al., 2017). The ability to design biomaterials with different mechanical properties, biodegradability, biocompatibility, biocompatibility, biocompatibility, and biophysics, can be used for biomedical engineering.

Bioinformatic methods are commonly used to design biomaterials with different mechanical properties, biodegradability, biocompatibility, biocompatibility, biocompatibility, biocompatibility, and biocompatibility (Chandra and Sivakumar, 2015; Kumar et al., 2017). The biomaterials with different mechanical properties have been designed with the use of different materials-layer combinations.


## Methods
rostratum ATCC 13803) as described by Schnitzel-Wiese and Löhne (1985. The test is not performed on any single tissue of a given plant.

The test was performed in a 1.5% Tween 80 solution in a 15% SDS-saturated solution. The pretreated samples were run in a 0.45 µm filter. The procedure was repeated three times, and the cells were separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was obtained by adding 10 µl of 1.0% Tween 80 and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 1 min. The cell supernatant was recovered. The pellet was washed twice with the same buffer. The pellet was dissolved in 100 µl of 5% sodium bicarbonate, and immediately dissolved in 100 µl of 20% sodium bicarbonate. The method was followed according to the method of Löhne (1986). The cell suspension was then diluted with the same buffer and incubated with shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h. The suspension was then adjusted to the appropriate concentration. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with 1.0% Tween 80, and then incubated with an equal volume of 1% sodium bicarbonate. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was obtained by mixing 1.0% Tween 80 and sodium bicarbonate, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with 1.0% Tween 80, and then resuspended in 50 µl of 1% sodium bicarbonate. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was obtained by dissolving 1.0% Tween 80 in 1.0% sodium bicarbonate. The final absorbance at 595 nm was obtained using a microtiter 96 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).


## Results
For this purpose, the reaction mixture is supplied with water by heating it with a temperature of 30°C for 20 minute. The reaction mixture is then subjected to the addition of nitrocellulose and sodium nitrite. The reaction reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature and the reaction proceeds into the final product. The dry product is then released into the aeration fluid. This final product is then transferred to a heat-sensitive (HS) fermentation broth (see Figure 1), which is used to generate the final concentration of the final product. The final concentration of the final product was measured using a standardized formula, which was confirmed by a color scale. The product was successfully produced and the final product concentration was approximately 6.5 g/L (Table 1).

Results of the methods are presented in Table 2. The method of bioreactor optimization used was the following:

Using 4 mM sodium nitrite as the carbon source, the total concentration of sodium nitrite was reduced to 2.2 g/L. As shown in Figure 2, the final product concentration of the final product was 5.5 g/L.

The product yield was determined as the sum of the yield from the reaction with nitrocellulose and sodium nitrite, as well as the concentration of sodium nitrite. The yield was approximately 1.2 g/L. The initial sodium nitrite concentration was 0.36 g/L. Sodium nitrite concentration was 0.25 g/L.

After 10 days of incubation at 30°C, the final product concentration was measured using a standard formula, which was confirmed by a color scale. The product yield was approximately 2.5 g/L. The final product concentration of the final product was approximately 5.5 g/L.

The application of a specific temperature (14°C) is critical for the product yield. Therefore, the final product concentration was measured using a temperature of 14°C. The product yield was approximately 6.5 g/L. The final product concentration of the final product was approximately 3.5 g/L.

After the final product concentration was determined as the sum of the product yield from the reaction with nitrocellulose and sodium nitrite, the concentration of sodium nitrite was increased to 0.36 g/L. The final product concentration was approximately 5.5 g/L.
