## Abstract
Acute meningitis is a major cause of death in children less than five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. The mechanisms underlying the resilience of these children to a range of infections as a result of Guillain-Barré syndrome remain largely unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the role of the central nervous system (CNS) in the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

We performed a clinical evaluation of Guillain-Barré syndrome by collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from severely ill children and attending a community-based paediatric emergency department in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. CSF samples were collected from children aged from birth to five years. We also examined the development of infectious diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, in the family to identify the immune mediators mediating the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome.


## Introduction
. 2009).

The genus Pithoascus is a complex of two broad-leaved, subtropical and mesocarpic tree-forming fungi. The species are distributed in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of the world. Pithoascus species are particularly associated with the northern parts of the world, especially Mexico, where they are important as plant pathogens and natural filter through the soil and water for bioenergy production (Jolivet-Smith et al., 2014). In Mexico, Pithoascus species occur in several parts of the country, particularly in the state of Veracruz (San-Blas et al., 2012). In addition, Pithoascus decipiens is the most prevalent species of Pithoascus in the state of Veracruz (San-Blas et al., 2012).

The genus Pithoascus decipiens is based on the genus Pithoascus that was collected from the bark of Eucalyptus (Fries, 1917), Eucalyptus sp., and Eucalyptus vulgaris (García-Martín et al., 2017). The genus is not well-characterized and is often mis-described as Pithoascus sp., Pithoascus sp. subsp. decipiens, Pithoascus sp. subsp. decipiens, Pithoascus sp. subsp. finlandicus, Pithoascus sp. subsp. mitchelli, Pithoascus sp. subsp. avenae, and Pithoascus sp. subsp. communis (García-Martín et al., 2017; Martín-Cardinal et al., 2019). The taxonomic status of Pithoascus decipiens is mainly based on morphological characters, including its conidiomata and conidiophore and hyphal morphology. The most frequently reported Pithoascus species are P. betrariffi, P. betrarina, P. betrarina, P. betrarina, P.


## Methods
HPLC was performed using a Hexane HPLC System (Thermo Scientific) connected to a Pepmap HLC EZ-Separation system (Merck, Germany) using a Waters-Pepmap software (version 1.11.2015) (Waters, USA). The HPLC column was a Q-Exactive Pro-Lab High Pressure Ionized Water (HPLC-Qiagen) column (70 × 2.1 mm, 2.1 × 5 µm, 4 µm) (Dionex, USA) equipped with an E-600 HPLC column (30 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, 5 µm film thickness) (Dionex, USA) and an Agilent 1100 series HPLC column (30 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, 5 µm film thickness). The column temperature was 25 °C. The mobile phase was a 10 mM ammonium acetate gradient. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the solvent program was acetonitrile (2 mL/min) and methanol (0.5 mL/min) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The elution method was as follows: initial temperature was 50 °C for 1 min, followed by an increase of 2 °C/min from 5 to 50 min and from 50 to 75 min.

HPLC system (HPLC-Qiagen)
The HPLC system used was a Quattro ELXA-C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm film thickness) (Dionex, USA) equipped with an E-600 HPLC column (30 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm film thickness). The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the solvent program was acetonitrile (0.5 mL/min) and methanol (0.5 mL/min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The gradient program was linear at 35 °C for 45 min, then a 4-min gradient was applied, with a temperature of 50 °C for 1 min, then a 45-min gradient from 45 to 50 °C.

The main ions were separated on a 1.


## Results
The number of fungal strains in each field was determined from the literature database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). The fungal population in all these countries was identified as the most common with an average number of 24.5 strains per country (Table 1). The number of strains was highest in Africa (28) and South Africa (18). The strains in South Africa were found in all tropical and subtropical countries except India, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East (Table 1). The most common isolates in Asia (n = 12) were found in Japan (n = 3), Mexico (n = 1), and Vietnam (n = 1). The most common isolates in Africa were found in Argentina (n = 2), Australia (n = 1), and the Middle East (n = 1). The number of strains in Asia was highest in Asia (n = 5), followed by South Africa (n = 1). The number of strains in Latin America and the Caribbean were highest in Latin America (n = 4). The most common isolates in Africa were found in the former East Indies (n = 3), Haiti (n = 2), Cuba (n = 1), Venezuela (n = 1), and Brazil (n = 1). The number of strains in Asia was highest in Africa (n = 2), followed by South Africa (n = 1).

## Discussion

The . ovatus genome was predicted to contain 155 K. ovatus homologs. The number of homologs was only modestly higher than that of other tree species, i.e., S. pombe and P. virens (54 Ks, 100 Ks, and 100 Ks, respectively). In addition, the K. ovatus genome contained 23 homologs in the ascomycete Ustilago maydis (33 Ks, 76 Ks, and 74 Ks, respectively). Similarly, the K. ovatus genome contained 10 homologs in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (20 Ks, 30 Ks, and 17 Ks, respectively). The ascomycete yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe also contained 27 and 28 Ks, respectively. The K. ovatus genome contained 53 Ks, 35 Ks, and 50 Ks, respectively. Overall, the K. ovatus genome contained 21 Ks and 31 Ks, respectively, compared to the ascomycete K. rosea genome of 24 Ks, 35 Ks, and 45 Ks, respectively. The K. ovatus genome also contained 59 Ks, 42 Ks, and 32 Ks, respectively.

The phylogenetic analysis showed that K. ovatus contains a phylogenetic signal that is not present in other ascomycetes. The homologs were conserved in all ascomycetes, except for the basidiomycete K. pseudonana, which contained only two homologs. The K. ovatus genome contained 5 homologs in the ascomycete W. commune, which was present in all the ascomycetes except for D. hansenii. In addition, the K. ovatus genome contained 6 homologs in the basidiomycete W. commune, which was present in all ascomycetes except in T. versicolor.

The K. ovatus genome contained the highest number of genes in the ascomycete W. commune, which was also present in all ascomycetes except for M. oryzae. The K. ovatus genome contained 3 genes, which were conserved in all ascomycetes except for D.
