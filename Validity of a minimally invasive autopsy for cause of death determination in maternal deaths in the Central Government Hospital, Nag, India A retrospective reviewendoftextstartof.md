## Abstract
We report a case of a 78-year-old woman who developed pneumonia due to respiratory tuberculosis and a brain biopsy with multiple solitary leptomeninges revealed a solitary leptoma. She was diagnosed with pneumonia related tuberculosis and pneumonia was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and immunosuppressant medication. Despite treatment with corticosteroids and other drugs, she developed acute onset of symptoms, mild fever, and diffuse neurological recovery. Despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy, she deteriorated and was ultimately managed with oral and intravenous amphotericin B. Despite use of immunosuppressant, she died due to acute respiratory failure.

HIV infection and pneumonia are life threatening diseases and are often diagnosed late in the course of infection and often without adequate diagnostic work-up. This causes the early recognition of the illness and late management of its progression. This causes early recognition of the pneumonia and its complications. Prompt work-up of pneumonia is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a 78-year-old woman with pneumonia due to respiratory tuberculosis and a brain biopsy with multiple solitary leptomeninges and highlight the importance of routinely testing for pneumonia in this patient before making the diagnosis and understanding of the possible complex nature of this illness.


## Introduction
In healthy humans, the human body size is typically small, with a size of <.5 cm in healthy people, and <3 cm in healthy people. In severe diseases, the human body size can exceed up to the third digit of the human being. In the late 19th century, it was thought that large people were at risk of contracting infectious diseases because they grew too slowly and became over-fed. Over the past century, the number of people who have died of infectious diseases has increased dramatically in proportion to the growing number of people with immunodeficiency. While the incidence of infectious diseases is not increasing, the death rate of infectious diseases is increasing. The life expectancy of people living with HIV is decreasing. The number of people living with cancer is decreasing. There is a gradual decline in the number of people being treated and admitted to hospitals. The number of people admitted to intensive care units is decreasing. The number of people with cancer is declining. The number of cancer cases are increasing. The number of cancer patients admitted to intensive care units is decreasing. There is an increasing trend of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is increasing. The number of patients with diabetes, cancer and HIV infection is increasing. There is a worrying trend of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which are spreading worldwide and are gaining resistance to all available drugs. The number of people who are hospitalized with diabetes is decreasing. There are many diseases associated with low glucose, low electrolytes and a drop in blood glucose level, including cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, diabetes and various forms of cancer. There is an increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases. The incidence of various autoimmune diseases is increasing. The number of people with cancer is decreasing. There is a growing trend of infections with high incidence and persistent sequelae, which is due to the increased incidence of some types of cancer, including ocular malignancy, esophageal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and mucormycosis. The number of deaths due to fungal diseases is increasing. The number of people with diabetes is decreasing. There is a decreasing trend of infections with high incidence and persistent sequelae, which is due to the increased incidence of some types of cancer, including ocular malignancy, esophageal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and mucormycosis.


## Methods
lusitanicus isolates were studied for morphological characterisation in a total of 40 clinical isolate. The isolates were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Morphological characterisation
To establish the morphological characteristics of the isolates, macro-morphological characters were measured on the samples and stained with a light blue method according to Ospedales (1981) [7].

Morphological characterisation
Microscopic characters were observed under a light microscope (S90E, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (SC-6000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Sections of sporocarps were made of MDF, which was stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) according to Ospedales (1981) [7].

## Results
The PPS structure is composed of four main ß-strands (Fig 1A. The PPS subunit (Fig 1A) is composed of two different ß-strands. The first ß-strand is a flexible segment of polysaccharide polymers and contains a single ß-strand (Fig 1A). The second ß-strand is a flexible segment of polysaccharide polymers and contains a single ß-strand (Fig 1B). The PPS protein has two conserved transmembrane regions (residues 1 to 3) with two polar regions (residues 2 to 4) and four membrane-localized signal peptides (residues 5 to 7) (Fig 1C). The PPS protein contains two conserved signal peptides (residues 9 to 15) and eight signal transmembrane domains (residues 16 to 22) (Fig 1C). The PPS protein also contains a predicted H-2 domain and two transmembrane regions (residues 23 to 28).

PPS is conserved in several fungi, including plants and the nematode C. elegans, with the exception of the C. elegans species complex (10, 11). The PPS protein is also present in many bacteria and archaea, including some bacteria (1, 2). The PPS protein has been shown to be expressed in an elevated level in the presence of co-cultures of both fungi and bacteria (11). PPS, as a substrate of the glyoxylate cycle, is important for the conversion of glucose to glycerol by the P450 enzymes [12]. The PPS protein is also present in plants and other microbes (13, 14). The PPS protein has been shown to be expressed in an elevated level in the presence of co-cultures of both fungi and bacteria (12, 15).


## Discussion
fumigatus, we showed that . fumigatus was able to phagocytose T. cruzi and Fusarium spp. at the same time. We also demonstrated that the presence of conidia in T. cruzi was sufficient to induce the production of phagocytic and bacterial antimicrobial peptides, such as Dectin-1 and TLR4 [11], [13], [15], [16], [17], [18]. This increased phagocytosis of T. cruzi by A. fumigatus in this study may be due to the increased number of conidia in the cytosol of T. cruzi-infected mice. As conidia of A. fumigatus were able to phagocytose T. cruzi and Fusarium spp. at the same time, this phagocytosis was accompanied by the production of bacterial peptides, such as Dectin-1 and TLR4, which was significantly increased in the presence of T. cruzi. The increased phagocytosis of T. cruzi by A. fumigatus in this study may be due to the enhanced uptake of T. cruzi by macrophages, which result in enhanced bacterial phagocytosis [12].

Dectin-1 is a gene that is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and this gene is also necessary for the production of TNF-a [19]. The production of IL-1ß and IL-6 by A. fumigatus is also enhanced in the presence of Dectin-1 [20], [21]. Furthermore, we found that Dectin-1 was increased in A. fumigatus-infected mice. This result indicated that the phagocytic activity of A. fumigatus was enhanced by the increased production of TNF-a and IL-1ß.

The role of IL-4 in the production of antimicrobial peptides and other bacterial virulence factors has been documented in several bacteria, including bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics [22], and in bacteria that are susceptible to conventional antifungal drugs [23], [24], [25].
