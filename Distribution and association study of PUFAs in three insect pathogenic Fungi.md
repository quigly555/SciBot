## Abstract
A case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a 62-year-old woman with multiple refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from the presence of a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) hyperproduction. The presence of anti-dsDNA IgG antibodies and anti-dsDNA IgM antibodies in the serum and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patient’s two dogs indicates that she is at risk of developing CLL. This is the first reported case of disseminated cryptococcosis from a dog.


## Introduction
PUFAs were found in the majority of the studied insects and these PUFA are grouped into four major groups: B1, B2, B3, and B. B1 PUFA, which includes the sesquiterpene B5, and the sesquiterpene B6, are the main PUFAs present in insects. The sesquiterpene B5 is the most common PUFAs, and the sesquiterpene B6 is the most abundant PUFA. PUFAs are classified according to the location in the insect vector, they are found in insect larvae, and they are found in insect gut and gut exudates. The Sesquiterpene B5, and the sesquiterpene C, are the most abundant PUFAs found in insects. The C group is classified according to the mode of action, they are found in insect hemocytes, insects skin, insect gut, insect inner membrane, insect epidermal coat, and insects secretory system. The B group is classified according to the capacity of the PUFAs to produce toxic compounds (e.g., chitosan, furfural, and salicylic acid), and the B group is classified according to the degree of the toxicities produced (e.g., salicylic acid and n-octyl palmitoylglycerol). PUFAs are classified as low- and high-sulfur-content PUFAs, and their content in insect venomous insects is mainly derived from cholesterol and triglycerides. PUFAs have been shown to be efficient in the inhibition of the parasite Escherichia coli PA342, the in vitro inhibitor of pyridone oxidase PA 317, and the inhibitor of metalloprotease PA 482. The main ingredients in the S.mexx-agarosa and C.


## Methods
The laboratory-based study was conducted in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of São Paulo (USP) using a standard clinical sample collection protocol. We used the patient-centrifuge protocol established in the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREEC) of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of São Paulo.

The study was approved by the CREEC Ethics Committee (RES/EC/2011/12/1) and the study was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of the Brazilian College of Pharmacy (registration number: 2013/2012). The sample was collected from patients with acute and recurrent bloodstream infections, and blood culture was performed by the blood culture-negative blood group.


## Results
The PUFA are not only associated with cell wall biosynthesis, but also cell membrane components (Fig 1C. In the case of PUFAs, C2H2-a, C2H4-a and C2H5-a are more abundant in the phytopathogenic Ascomycota than in the non-fungal Ascomycota. The C2H4-a PUFA was present in all three insect pathogenic Fungi (Fig 1A,B).

The distribution of PUFAs in different developmental stages of Fungi is illustrated in Fig 1D. The PUFAs were more abundant in the early stages of the Fungi (early, mid, late, and late stages) than in the early, mid, and late stages of the Ascomycota (early, mid, and late stages). In the case of PUFAs, C2H2-a and C2H4-a PUFA were found in early, mid, and late stages, respectively (Fig 1E). In the case of PUFAs, C2H2-a PUFA was more abundant in the late stages of the Fungi than in the early, mid, and late stages. In the case of PUFAs, C2H2-a PUFA was more abundant in the late stages than in the early, mid, and late stages. C2H4-a PUFA was more abundant in the late stages than in the early, mid, and late stages. The distribution of PUFAs in different developmental stages of Fungi is illustrated in Fig 1F. PUFAs were more abundant in the late stages than in the early, mid, and late stages. In the case of PUFAs, C2H2-a PUFA was more abundant in the late stages than in the early, mid, and late stages. The distribution of PUFAs in different developmental stages of Fungi is illustrated in Fig 1G.


## Discussion
[1], is an emerging lineage with considerable genetic variability that has expanded to include many species of Malassezia [2. The genus Malassezia comprises over 100 species in the order Malassezia [1], [3], [4]. It is a black yeasts that is found in soils, on plants, and on fruits, and is the most abundant black yeasts in the world. The Malassezia genus is composed of multidrug-resistant black yeasts that are able to form biofilms on various substrates and are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [5].

The genus Malassezia is characterized by the ability to form biofilms on plant surfaces and its ability to form biofilm on host plants [6]. The genus Malassezia is reported to be a commensal yeast with the ability to form biofilm on plants [7]. In the current study, Malassezia spp. were isolated from a wide variety of soil samples and were found to be associated with plants. The results of this study showed that the fungus was able to form biofilm on host plants.

The next step in the research was to assess the activity of the plant defense response to the fungus. Our results showed that the plant defense response of plant was enhanced by the fungus, which was enhanced by the presence of H_2O_2. In addition, the defense response of the plant was enhanced by the presence of H_2O_2. In the present study, plant defense was enhanced by the fungus. This result was in agreement with previous studies that reported that the plant defense response of the pathogen was enhanced by H_2O_2 [8], [9].

In the present study, we found that the fungal genus Malassezia was active in the application of antifungal drug. We did not observe any effect of Malassezia spp. on the plants of other Fungi. However, in this study, the antifungal activity of Malassezia spp. was observed in the application of the drug. Therefore, the plant defense response of the pathogen was enhanced by the fungus.

In this study, the plant defense response of the fungus was increased by the presence of H_2O_2.
