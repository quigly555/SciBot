## Abstract
The search for new antifungal drugs is an important issue to reduce the toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. Antimicrobial compounds produced by fungi have the potential to be developed as drug candidates, as the source of drugs and as a source of virulence factors. The search for new antifungal drugs opens new avenues to develop alternative therapies, and new research avenues is leading to the discovery of new therapeutic agents. Over the last decade, several drugs and biological agents have been proposed for the treatment of fungal diseases, including fungal pathogens, as well as a number of pathogens that are environmentally or human causing. These agents and their effects are currently being transmitted through various routes, and new directions are being proposed. One such route involves the evolution of antibiotics that are used as agents in the treatment of many neglected or uncommon fungal diseases. Some of these antibiotics and their compounds are proposed here to stimulate further research concerning their use as therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the history of the natural and synthetic substances containing antifungal agents and their applications as drug leads.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) can be classified as superficial, cutaneous and mucosal-based infections, depending on the type of host. Superficial infections may be defined as those caused by fungi that are difficult to eradicate and difficult to diagnose. Pulmonary infections are those caused by organisms that cause pulmonary disease, such as fungi, bacteria, viruses and parasites. There are two broad categories of fungal infections: mucocutaneous and invasive. Pulmonary fungal infections can be classified into superficial and mucocutaneous. The most common group are those caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, followed by those caused by Cryptococcus and Malassezia species. The most common non-fungal group is those caused by non-albicans species. In terms of mucocutaneous fungal infections, the most common are those caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, followed by those caused by Mucorales and non-albicans species.


## Methods

Preparation of the polysaccharides from P. vitis vivax
Polysaccharides from P. vv. Vitis vivax were extracted from the mushroom plant Fongi (Bukkoryo, 2013) by using a modified method of Zhang et al. (2013) with slight modifications. The crude crude polysaccharides were extracted from the mushroom plant Fongi (Bukkoryo, 2015). The polysaccharides were diluted in water to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and further diluted with water to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The fraction was re-extracted with a solvent mixture of EtOH (3 mL) and H_2O (3 mL) and the solvent mixture was shaken at 150 rpm. The crude polysaccharides were then concentrated to 0.7 mL with a rotary evaporator at 80 °C. The residue was then concentrated to 10 mg/mL in MeOH (5 mL). The residue was then washed with 70% MeOH (3 mL) and evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator at 80 °C. The final concentration of polysaccharides was 0.5 mg/mL. The residue was dissolved in 500 µL of water and evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator at 80 °C. The residue was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol (3 mL) and dissolved in 1 mL of water (3 mL). The solution was shaken (150 rpm) at a constant temperature (24 °C) for 4 h. The residue was then filtered (0.22 µm) and washed with 70% MeOH (3 mL) and evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator at 80 °C. The final concentration of polysaccharides was 10 mg/mL.

## Results

The eukaryotic genome sequences were analyzed for the comparison of the exopolysaccharide exopolysaccharide sequences, including the number of exopolysaccharides in different species, the number of exopolysaccharides in different species, the number of exopolysaccharides in different species, the number of exopolysaccharides in different species, and the number of exopolysaccharides in different specie. The list of exopolysaccharides from the species with the highest number of exopolysaccharides in species was also compared with those of the species with the lowest number of exopolysaccharides in species. For the species with the lowest number of exopolysaccharides in species, we selected Exophiala dermatitidis, Exosporium sp. and Exosporium sp. (Table 2).

Results of the comparative analysis of the exopolysaccharide sequences in Exophiala dermatitidis, Exosporium sp. and Exosporium sp. are presented in Figure 2. For Exophiala dermatitidis, the Exophiala dermatitidis exopolysaccharide sequences were clustered in two separate clades, but in Exosporium sp. the Exophiala dermatitidis exopolysaccharide sequences were clustered in a distinct clade with Exosporium sp. (Figure 2). The Exophiala dermatitidis exopolysaccharide sequences were also clustered in two different clades in Exosporium sp. (Figure 2).

Identification of Polymorphic Exopolysaccharide Genes in Exosporium and Exosporium
The polysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters of Exophiala dermatitidis, Exosporium sp. and Exosporium sp. were classified into six major subfamilies in the GenBank database using the BlastP server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BlastP). The taxonomic distribution of these six subfamilies in Exosporium is shown in Figure 3.

## Discussion
In fact, the Basidiomycota is a dominant class in Fungi but has been shown to be under stress [27. A different group of phylotypes was found in the Fungi community of the Fungi community of the Fungi cluster. The Basidiomycota is the most abundant phylotype in the Fungi cluster and is the most dominant class in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster. The Basidiomycota is the second most abundant phylotype in the Fungi cluster, and has been shown to be highly stressed in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster [26]. The Basidiomycota is the most abundant phylotype in the Fungi cluster and is the most dominant class in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster. The Basidiomycota is the second most abundant phylotype in the Fungi cluster, and has been shown to be highly stressed in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster [26]. The Dothideomycetes is a dominant class in the Fungi cluster. This class is common in the Fungi cluster, and has been shown to be stressed in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster [26]. The Dothideomycetes is a dominant class in the Fungi cluster and has been shown to be stressed in the mushroom-associated fungal community of the Fungi cluster [26].

The community structure of the Fungi cluster was revealed by clustering of the phylotypes in the same fungal phylotypes. The Fungi cluster is composed of phylotypes belonging to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Cryptomycetes phylotypes. The Ascomycota phylotypes showed significant divergence in their phylotypes. This study shows that the phylotypes belonging to the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phylotypes are similar in their phylotypes. The Basidiomycota phylotypes showed significant divergence in their phylotypes.
