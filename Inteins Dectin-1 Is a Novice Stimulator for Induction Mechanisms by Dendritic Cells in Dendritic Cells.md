## Abstract
To identify the molecular pathways leading to resistance to Fusarium species in the edible pigeon (Pestalotiopsis) coleotifolia, a coelomycetous flowering plant, we sequenced the genomes of 46 strains and analyzed their genes for resistance to Fusarium and related phytopathogens. The genomes of the Drosophila strains were found to encode two member of the Ascomycota Fusarium-like protease subfamilies (Renditor Cell and Arginase) and the member of the Fusarium-like subfamily Dictyostelium discoideum. The RbfA and RbfU genes were found to be expressed in more than one gene cluster, and to encode a member of the Selenophila apparatus. The deduced protease repertoire comprised two regions (the exon and the intercalation stop at 2 nTomoxel), a core C-terminal protein, and two regions (the C-terminal protein intercalatum and the intercalating stop at 2.8 Å). The genomic sequences of D. discoideum showed an average size of about 70 Mb, a protein content of 82% by MEGA1-3 and a G+C content of 53%.


## Introduction
Microbes are fundamentally involved in all aspects of life from growth to infection and maintenance of homeostasis, to nutrient acquisition and storage. The homeostatic processes of microbial metabolism are tightly regulated in a multitude of symbiotic interactions (1-3). These processes include metabolic activities of metabolic enzymes, the production of bioactive metabolites, the degradation of substrates, and the recycling of waste material.


## Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Perugia (Protocol N. 1/2013-2014).

Experimental design
The study was performed in a randomized “control group” and “treatment group” and the control group of Dectin-1 (treated group) was included in the analyses. Three groups of 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were used. The mice were bred and maintained in the Laboratory Animal Laboratory of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UFSP). All animal studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Perugia (Protocol No. 1/2014).

Infection and treatment of animals
The mice were challenged with 20 µl of 10^6 C. albicans cells in 200 µl of PBS through the lateral tail vein (3×10^5 cells) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The mice were maintained in an environment with free access to light and humidity. At day 3, the mice were euthanized with CO_2. The lungs and brain were removed, weighed, homogenized, and plated in the YPD medium to determine CFU/g in the presence of M. avium. The experiment was repeated three times.

The following drugs were used in the preparation of inocula for the final experiments: 2 µg/ml of caspofungin (CAS), 5 µg/ml of caspofungin-N (CNA) or 2 µg/ml of caspofungin-N-F (CNA-NFR) (São Paulo State University, São Paulo, Brazil) for C. albicans, and 1 × 10^6 C. glabrata cells/ml of M. avium were used for C. glabrata.

The colony morphology was observed on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 24 h at 25°C. The colony diameters were measured at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, and the area of the colony was calculated.

## Results
fumigatus hyphae by bone-derived DCs as primary source of . fumigatus-derived cell-derived macrophages (Ileb et al., 2012). To determine whether Dectin-1 recognizes D. melanogaster hyphae, we stimulated bone marrow-derived DCs with a single phagocytic cell line, B3501 cells. DCs from the B3501 strain demonstrated strong responsiveness to the phagocytic phagolytic stimulus, which produced very small (less than 2 µg) but a large phagolytic colony (Fig 4). This phagolytic response was not specific for the phagolytic response. The phagolytic response to the phagolytic stimulus was dependent on the type of DC stimulation. Dectin-1 recognizes B3501 cells, but not to the B3501 strain (Fig 4). We further performed phagocytic phagocytic phagocytic phagolysis by Western blotting with the anti-CD11 monoclonal antibody and with the anti-CD11 monoclonal antibody at different concentrations. The antibodies revealed that both anti-CD11 and anti-CD11 monoclonal antibodies had no effect on phagocytic phagocytic phagolysis in the B3501 strain (Fig 4). These results suggest that Dectin-1 recognizes B3501 cells.


## Discussion
The Dectin-5 and Dectin-7 effectors are generally inactivated by Dectin-2 [40, 41], but Dectin-3 and Dectin-4 are not [40, 42. Both Dectin-5 and Dectin-7 have been shown to be essential for protective immunity against Cryptococcus neoformans infection [40, 41, 43]. The Dectin-3 and Dectin-4 effectors have been shown to mediate immune responses against Cryptococcus neoformans infection by activating Dectin-4 and Dectin-5 [40, 44, 45]. However, Dectin-5 and Dectin-7 have been shown to be less potent than Dectin-2 and Dectin-3, and their activation was inhibited by the peptide FGF-ß [40]. Dectin-2 has been shown to interact with the activated Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in response to Cryptococcus neoformans infection, but its function is not known [40]. Dectin-5 and Dectin-7 are also highly expressed in the blood of mice infected with C. neoformans, and their expression is increased by Cryptococcus neoformans infection [40].

The Dectin-3 and Dectin-4 effectors were shown to mediate immune responses against C. neoformans infection by activating Dectin-4 and Dectin-5 [40, 41, 45]. Dectin-4 has been found to be more potent than Dectin-1 in activating immune responses against Cryptococcus neoformans infection [40]. Although the Dectin-1 effector has been shown to mediate immune responses against Cryptococcus neoformans infection, the Dectin-2 effector has not been reported to mediate immune responses against C. neoformans infection [40, 41, 45]. The mechanism by which Dectin-4 and Dectin-5 mediate immune responses against C.
