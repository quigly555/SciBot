## Abstract

In this study, we first compared the results of peripheral blood, lung, and brain from infected mice with CD4+ T cells (n = 39) and then from infected wild-type (n = 41. After 8 weeks of infection, CD4+ T cells were expressed in the lungs and brains from infected mice, as compared to wild-type, and from infected wild-type mice only when the expressions of CD4+ T cells were elevated. Lung and brain CD4+ T cells showed significantly different numbers of inflammatory CD4+ T cells in infected mice than in wild-type mice. CD4+ T cell expression was unaffected by the addition of TLR2 or IL-10. Brain CD4+ T cells from infected mice showed higher expression of interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) and IFN-<U+03B3> compared with wild-type, but they did not differ significantly between infected and wild-type mice.

Our study suggests that IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3> treatment can significantly increase CD4+ T cell activation and promote organ injury in T lymphocytes from experimental experimental pulmonary infection with Trypanosoma brucei. IFN-<U+03B3> and IFN-<U+03B3>/IL-10 may provide novel targets for therapy of trypanosomiasis.

IMPORTANCE Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are common in immunocompromised patients, often associated with immunosuppression or treatment failure. Infections with yeasts have been shown to be associated with lower immunosuppressive drug treatment and survival, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. IFIs are mainly caused by Candida spp., especially C. albicans and can complicate the immune system. There is a need for new effective antifungal drugs to combat this fungus. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has emerged as a promising agent for the treatment of antifungal-induced mucosal damages. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of short-course liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), 5-flucytosine (5FC), in the treatment of clinically relevant fluconazole-resistant Candida strains.


## Introduction
Sphingolipids are basic sugar molecules present in all eukaryotic cells. Sphingolipids are basic lipid molecules that are involved in cell growth, survival, and differentiation. They are among the most important and abundant molecules in the eukaryotic cell, and their composition and structure are largely conserved across the kingdoms of life (1-3). Sphingolipids are rich in sterols and glycerol and also contain many enzymes involved in protein-protein interactions, carbohydrate modification, and cell signaling (4). They are also crucial for signaling pathways that involve cell growth and differentiation.

The family of sphingolipids consists of a family of sialylated sugar molecules (sialyltransferases, GSLs) present in all eukaryotic cells. GSLs are classified into groups 1 and 2, and are classified into group 3 and 4. The group 3 group contains GSL-binding domains, and the group 4 GSLs are responsible for substrate recognition and transport. GSLs are not found in mammals and plants and are present in the cell wall and are mainly present in fungi. The GSLs are highly conserved and found in all eukaryotic cell types. Among fungi, the family of GSLs is divided into two groups, group 1 and group 2 (5-8). Group 1 GSLs are encoded by three genes: GAL, GSL-1, and GSL-2 (9). GSL-1 is present in the genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and GSL-2 in the genome of Candida albicans (10).

Group 2 GSLs are present in animals and plants and are encoded by three genes: GAL-2, GSL-1, and GSL-2.


## Methods
The activity of the CD4+ T cell response was determined by using the antifungal cocktail of fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) at a final concentration of .125 µg/ml. The anti-CD4+ T cell response was determined by using the antifungal cocktail of eBioscience (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The CD4+ T cell responses to the eBioscience cocktail were determined using the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% FBS, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)). The fluconazole drug concentration was 10 µg/ml and the eBioscience cocktail was 20 µg/ml. The antifungal cocktail was used as a control. The CD4+ T cell responses to eBioscience cocktail were determined using the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% FBS, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)). The CD4+ T cell responses to the eBioscience cocktail were determined using the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.


## Results
We next evaluated the efficacy of antibody directed against anti-CD4-tetraploid T cell-targeted proinflammatory anti-CD4+ T cells and their corresponding proinflammatory cytokines in M1-M2 macrophage.

IL-10 was a potent proinflammatory cytokine that binds to CD4+ T cells in vitro and increases expression of the M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor, CD8+ T cell receptor (M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor), and CD4+ T cell-specific T-cell receptor (T-cell receptor) in response to LPS stimulation [30]. IL-10 treatment was limited by the lack of significantly altered expression of CD4+ T cells in these macrophages (Fig 3A). IL-10 treatment did not increase the expression of the M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor or the T-cell receptor in M1-type CD4+ T cell-infected M1-type macrophages (Fig 3A). Conversely, IL-12, a potent cytokine that has a role in the M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor, and IL-17, a potent cytokine that binds to CD4+ T cells in vitro and increases expression of the M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor, induced by LPS [31], elicited a similar response in M1-type CD4+ T cell-infected M1-type macrophages.

In order to determine the effect of IL-10 on the proliferation of M1-type CD4+ T cells in M1-M2 macrophages, we employed the murine M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor, CD8+ T cell receptor (M1-type CD4+ T cell receptor), and the M2-type CD4+ T cell receptor (M2-type CD4+ T cell receptor). We assessed the effect of IL-10 on proliferation and the T-cell cytokine expression in M1-M2 macrophages.


## Discussion
In contrast, innate lymphoid cells, including T cells and NK cells, are highly specialized for specific infections and are limited to pathogens such as HIV and . marneffei [38]. The results presented here suggest that the most important innate lymphoid cells for Th1 differentiation are CD4+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. CD4+ T cells, including CD8+ T cells, are known to be a major component of Th1 differentiation, and are generally activated and activated in the early stages of the infection [38]. The CD4+ T cell repertoire also includes CD8+ T cells and NK cells [38]. However, CD4+ T cells are more abundant in patients with low CD4+ T cell counts, which is in accordance with the results of this study. In patients with low CD4+ T cell counts, CD4+ T cells are also more abundant in patients with underlying infections [38]. Our results suggest that CD4+ T cells play a minor role in Th1 differentiation, which is a prerequisite for infection. The potential function of CD4+ T cells in Th1 differentiation needs to be further investigated in the future.

The Th2 cytokines, IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-1ß, and IL-17, are considered to be critical for the successful infection in patients with solid organ transplantation and organ transplantation [40]. IFN-<U+03B3> is a critical cytokine in the initiation and progression of infection, and is a critical factor for the immune response to T. marneffei [40]. IL-17 is a cytokine required for the successful infection of T. marneffei, and is required for the IL-17 production in infected patients [40]. IL-17 was shown to be critical for the T cell response in mice, and its expression was significantly increased in Th1-deficient mice infected with T. marneffei [40]. However, the cytokine IL-17 levels in infected T. marneffei-infected mice were normal, and IL-17 expression was not decreased in the infection.
