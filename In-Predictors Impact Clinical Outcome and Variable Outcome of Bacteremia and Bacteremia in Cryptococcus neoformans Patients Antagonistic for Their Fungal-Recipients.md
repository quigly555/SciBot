## Abstract
The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum infects a wide range of plants and animals including humans, as well as various vertebrate species. H. capsulatum infection is most commonly caused by an evolving H. capsulatum-mediated transition from asci to ascomycetes. Many of the observed phenotypic alterations in H. capsulatum are associated with ascomycetes, a fungal order that shares most of its ancestor with mammals. However, the involvement of the protozoan parasite Heterodendronectria galleucosum in the genesis of the H. capsulatum-via-H. capsulatum complex and other steps of H. capsulatum evolution remain open to the literature. Our work shows that the protozoan H.


## Introduction
The genus Schaedleria is one of the most important plant pathogenic fungi. It has been recognized as a key causative agent of many diseases such as wilt, leaf spots, wilt, scab, anthracnose, leaf spots of citrus, grapevine, truffle, sugar beet and strawberry, wilt of wheat and barley, powdery mildew and anthracnose of stone fruits (O'Connor & Gill, 2014). In the study of S. cerevisiae, Schaedleria africana was recorded as the causative agent of blue mold on citrus, and blue mold on grapevine and anthracnose on stone fruits (O'Connor & Gill, 2014). In addition, the fungus has been reported as a biotrophic agent that can infect and destroy plant pathogens (Nag Raj, 1984). In addition, Schaedleria spp. are widely used in the food industry as source of flavouring, food coloring, flavor enhancer, and nutraceutical agent (Woudenberg et al., 2012). The fungus was also used for its bio-accumulation capacity, as a decolouriser, and antioxidant agent (Butler et al., 2000; Cogliati et al., 2001).

C. africana has an unusual morphology that is different from that of other Schaedleria species. This fungus grows as a budding yeast-like cells and is able to form colonies with a diameter of up to 40 µm (Kirk et al., 2003). In addition, the morphology is unique in that it grows at a much higher temperature than other Schaedleria species, as Schaedleria sp. can grow at 37 °C and at 25 °C. However, in the presence of nitrogen, C.


## Methods
. Fungal Isolates and Growth Conditions
Fungi were identified by the identification of all fungal strains from the Microbiology Laboratory of the University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy (Table 1).


## Results
7 (Table 2. The VNIV was variable for 31 (50%) of the isolates, and 9 (14%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.26 (Table 2). The VNIV was variable for 24 (30%) of the isolates, and 8 (17%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.28 (Table 2). The VNIV was variable for 8 (17%) of the isolates, and 6 (12%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.26 (Table 2). The VNIV was variable for 2 (9%) of the isolates, and 4 (12%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.29 (Table 2).

Candida albicans VNIVs
The VNIVs were variable for 9 (17%) of the isolates, and 3 (12%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.26 (Table 2). The VNIVs were variable for 1 (13%) of the isolates, and 2 (13%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.27 (Table 2). The VNIVs were variable for 4 (11%) of the isolates, and 1 (4%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.28 (Table 2).

Candida albicans VNIVs
The VNIVs were variable for 3 (12%) of the isolates, and 2 (5%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.28 (Table 2). The VNIVs were variable for 3 (12%) of the isolates, and 1 (5%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.28 (Table 2). The VNIVs were variable for 3 (12%) of the isolates, and 1 (5%) of the isolates had VNIV for a variable ratio of 0.28 (Table 2).


## Discussion
However, the percentage of patients with cryptococcal disease remained lo. In the pooled cohort of patients with HIV with or without cryptococcal meningitis, the overall rate of cryptococcal disease was higher (8.5%) compared to that in the entire cohort (21.0%). This may be due to the heterogeneity in the patient population in the current study. For patients with advanced HIV disease, the risk of developing cryptococcal disease was much higher in the pooled cohort (10.3% vs. 2.2%) than that in the whole cohort (7.5% vs. 2.5%) (13.1% vs. 5.3%). In contrast, this study was not designed to evaluate the impact of cryptococcal disease on the outcome of patients with advanced HIV disease.

A prospective observational study conducted in HIV-infected adults in Vietnam showed that cryptococcal meningitis is a serious cause of death in HIV-infected individuals (28). The high mortality in patients with cryptococcal meningitis was also reflected in the high rate of opportunistic infections in patients with advanced HIV disease (8.6%) (29). In our study, the rate of opportunistic infections in the initial phase of HIV infection was 23% in HIV-infected patients. However, this rate increased after adjustment for the opportunistic infections (TB, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus). In the case of opportunistic infections, the rate of TB increased from 7% in the initial phase to 34% in the following 3 years (30). In our study, the opportunistic infections were Cryptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 1). Although the rate of opportunistic infections was low in the initial phase, the initial stage of HIV infection did not appear to be associated with the high rate of opportunistic infections. The main limitation of our study was the small sample size (n = 27). The mortality rate in our study was higher than that in other studies (8, 19, 22, 26).
