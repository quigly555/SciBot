Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The monotypic genus Minimedrosso was recently introduced to accommodate specimens from Central America. This species is characterised by having the thallus isopropa position sixteenth knurled ribs, and having five distic crowns, two of which are inserted into the base of the rhizoshere. Morphological characters, cultural traits and DNA sequence data are provided for all specimens. Regions and characters associated with other fungi in the world distribution area of M. fujikuroi are delineated. Colour photographs of fungi from different dimensions of South America and Africa are provided. Principal coordinates are provided for specimens in South America, Africa and other parts of the world. Morphological characters and cultural traits are discussed. Colour photographs of fungi from different dimensions of Africa and Latin America are provided. Principal coordinates are provided for specimens in Latin America, Australia, Asia and Oceania.


## Introduction
2010, 2011; Poulin et a. 2011; Raspor et al. 2012, 2013, 2014; Poulin et al. 2013, 2014), USA (Crous et al. 2013; Raspor et al. 2013), and Canada (Poulin et al. 2014). Walnut leaf spots are normally distributed in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world (Díez & Ramos-Bustin 2016).

The genus Walpio (Pers.) P. Fr. is typified by W. r. Fr. (Pers.) P. Fr. (Pers.) (Bartolomeo, 1982) and characterized by globose to corky margin, bluish-green to black gleba, smooth-walled to brown conidiophores, and white, unchanging, smooth-walled, hyaline conidia. Walpio was also recorded in the deciduous to temperate forests of the southern United States (Bailey & Wanscher 1936). Walpio spp. are characterized by their white, unchanging, smooth-walled conidia (Bartolomeo, 1982).

The taxonomic status of Walpio has been debated over the years (Bartolomeo & Ebert 1975, Wanscher & Walpio, 1976, Chaturvedi & Chaturvedi 1978, Poulin & Sirocco 1980, Pezer & Bartolomeo, 1980, Bartolomeo & Ebert 1981, Pezer & Bartolomeo, 1982, Bartolomeo & Ebert 1983, Bartolomeo & Ebert 1985, Bartolomeo & Ebert 1987, Bartolomeo et al. 1990, Bartolomeo & Ebert 1990, Bartolomeo et al. 1990). It was proposed that Walpio’s taxonomic status is related to its ability to grow on pine substrata in association with other Paracercus spp. (Bartolomeo & Ebert 1982). The taxonomic status of Walpio has been mostly accepted as a concept (Eriksson & Bautista-Tunis 1982) because of its economic importance in the pine, especially in the timber industry (Gostincar et al. 2010, T. R. Gostincar et al. 2013).


## Methods
We found a significant number of species associated with leaf spots of Walnut when the genus was grouped with either Fungi or Fungal Fungus species [57. Additionally, we have also found an even number of species that are associated with leaf spots of both Walnut and Fungal Fungus. The genus Walnut is commonly used as a name for plants, and also the most common plant genus in the common garden in southern Tanzania [56].

Comparison of the number of Walnut and Fungal Fungus associated with the number of Walnut in 2013
As the number of Walnut plants is closely related to the number of Fungal Fungus species in the literature, a comparison of the number of Walnut plants in 2013 was performed. In this study, we focused on Fungal Fungus, Fungal Fungus of Walnut and Fungal Fungus of Fungal Fungus. Fungal Fungus was the most frequent Fungal Fungus species in 2012 and 2013. Fungal Fungus species are also present in the common garden in southern Tanzania [58]. The list of Fungal Fungus species in the collection of the Department of Botany, University of Pretoria (DTU) is shown in Table 1. Fungal fungi are mainly found in the soil in eastern Tanzania [59]. In this study, we used the Fungal Fungus species as the representative Fungal Fungus species. The species of Fungal Fungus of Walnut in southern Tanzania were the most frequent Fungal Fungus species in 2012 and 2013, and we also used the Fungal Fungus species in the collection of the Department of Botany, University of Pretoria (DTU) to compare the number of Walnut plants in 2013.

Comparison of the number of Fungal Fungus species in 2013
In this study, we used the Fungal Fungus species in the collection of the Department of Botany, University of Pretoria (DTU) to compare the number of Fungal Fungus species in 2013. We found an abundance of Fungal Fungus species in the collection of the Department of Botany, University of Pretoria (DTU) as well as in the collection of the Department of Horticulture, University of Pretoria (UPR).


## Results
In addition, Fungi are also known to cause disease on wounded leaves of walnut, and Fungi have been observed to cause leaf spots in the stands of the evergreens of Populus (Juglans and Juglans-Nu.) [8, 17, 19, 21, 28].

Fungi are ubiquitous in bark of walnut trees. They have been used in several studies to treat various diseases such as dandruff, rashes, and colds [3, 9, 14, 18, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Fungi can be found in many natural areas, such as on trees, stems, roots, and branches of woody plants [7, 20, 38-40]. The main Fungi species are Sporidiobolales, Fusicladium, and Penicillum. Fusicladium fusiclum and Penicillum fusum are considered as pathogenic to walnut trees [39, 40].

Fungal Fungi
There are many fungi that infect the bark of walnut trees. They are typically associated with asexual development, ascomycetes, and the early stages of asexual development [3, 11, 14, 18, 23, 40, 42, 43, 44]. Fungal fungi are frequently associated with disease caused by plants, as well as by fungi that are pathogenic to plants, such as Aspergillus, Botrytis, Botrytis-Boxi, Phycomyces, Trichoderma, Alternaria, Candida, and many more. They are also associated with the development of foliar development, which can be found on the bark of walnut trees. Fungal fungi are also commonly found in the bark of walnut trees, which are usually associated with woody plants, as well as on a wide range of other fungal species. In addition, Fungal Fungi have been associated with some invasive ascomycetes and a few multicellular ascomycetes. Fungal Fungi are usually found in tree parts of the trunk or leaf of the plant, and they can be found in association with black rot as well as other invasive fungal infections.


## Discussion
foliicola has not been observe. Fungi from the Mediterranean countries, such as Fusarium and Fusarium famata, have been observed.

In the present study, we found the genus Sporobolomyces in the same species as the previous study, and we have analyzed the phylogenetic tree (Fig 4). Sporobolomyces fuckelii, Sporobolomyces sp. 1, and Sporobolomyces sp. 2 are both part of the Pleosporales. Sporobolomyces sp. 2, Sporobolomyces sp. 1, and Sporobolomyces sp. 2 are all basidiomycetous, and they are also known to produce white to pale brown or yellowish conidia. In the previous study, we found the genus Sporobolomyces in the same species as the previous study. However, Sporobolomyces sp. 3, Sporobolomyces sp. 4, and Sporobolomyces sp. 5 are all saprophytic, and they are also known to produce white to pale brown or yellowish conidia. Although it has been observed that Sporobolomyces sp. 3, Sporobolomyces sp. 4, and Sporobolomyces sp. 5 produce white to pale brown or yellowish conidia [20], it has been shown that the former species produce conidial pigmentation and, therefore, they are considered to be saprophytes.

Species of the genera Sporobolomyces and Sporobolomyces belong to the same clade, and they are related to each other only by a single nucleotide sequence similarity. Sporobolomyces sp. 2 (Geomyces sp. 1) is a basidiomycete, and it has been previously identified in the genus Pleosporales [21]. Sporobolomyces sp. 3 is a basidiomycete, and it has been previously identified in the genus Pleosporales [22]. The genus Sporobolomyces sp. 3 was previously detected in the genus Pleosporales [23].
