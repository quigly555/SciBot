## Abstract
The bioactive compounds produced by the fungal pathogen Penicillium chrysogenum are a source of different bioactive molecules. These compounds may be used as biological atticides against various plant pathogens, with possible beneficial effects on human health or wound healing. This study aimed to determine the bioactive molecules produced by P. chrysogenum and its chemical metabolism in response to different environmental stress conditions.

The bioactive molecules produced by P. chrysogenum were analyzed by GC-MS and chemical analysis indicated that these molecules have a broad molecular weight spectrum and contain a wide range of aromatic amino acids. In addition, the molecular weight spectra of the metabolites were generated. The chemical profiles of the metabolites showed different degrees of degradation and alteration of biological activity.

The results showed that the metabolite production of P.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease that affects humans and animals, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In fact, in South America, cryptococcosis is one of the most common diseases caused by yeast-like fungi, which belong to the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex. In the immunocompetent host, cryptococcosis is usually cleared by antifungal drugs and it usually shows a less severe course, if any, than in the immunocompromised host. However, in immunocompromised patients, the progression of infection and the development of resistance are the most frequent clinical manifestations (reviewed by Raúl, 2007).

In the context of immune control, several methods have been proposed to treat the disease. These include corticosteroids, cytokines, and growth factors (Klein, 2011; Baker and Keller, 2012; Chaverri et al., 2015). The most commonly used drugs include cyclosporine, theophylline, and leucotrigine (Klein, 2011). The use of cyclosporine is associated with the risk of a spectrum of diseases such as cryptococcal meningitis, as well as premature mortality. Leucotrigine is a hormone-receptor-interacting agent, with the ability to induce the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that help in the clearance of the organism from the circulation (Mandel, 2013).


## Methods
[43.

The ability of soybean meal to promote the growth of J. delemar strain Einwaldii was compared with the growth of C. albicans strain JEC21 [44].

The ability of soybean meal to promote the growth of C. albicans strain Einwaldii was compared with the growth of C. albicans strain JEC21.

To characterize the role of soybean meal in plant growth, the effect of soybean meal on lipid accumulation in J. delemar was examined. Three grams of the ground soybean meal were added to 1-2 cm diameter Petri dishes (45 cm diameter) containing 10 ml of SD medium. The dishes were incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The lipid content was calculated by the method of Koh and Chong [45] and was expressed as a percentage of the initial dry weight. The results are the means of two independent experiments.

To evaluate the effects of soybean meal on the growth of C. albicans strain JEC21 in the field, the following treatment was performed as described by Xie et al. [46]: B. cinerea, B. guilliermondii, and C. albicans were grown in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 7 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12000×g for 10 min, washed with H_2O, and resuspended in H_2O. The biomass was adjusted to 2.5% (w/v) in H_2O. The samples were then placed in a Petri dish and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The lipid content was calculated by the method of Koh and Chong [45].

To evaluate the influence of soybean meal on the growth of C. albicans strain JEC21, the following treatment was performed as described by Xu et al. [47]: C. albicans was cultivated in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 7 days, and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 12000×g for 10 min, washed with H_2O, and resuspended in H_2O. The cells were then resuspended in H_2O and centrifuged at 12000×g for 10 min. The cells were then treated with hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) for 30 min.


## Results
The fatty acid profiles were similar to that of the seedling. The yeast-like cells were the most abundant in the seedlings, with a lipid content of 50%. The lipid content in the seedlings of J. ramosum was lower than that in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae. The highest lipid content (39%) was observed in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae. Fatty acid profile of Jatropha seedlings was similar to that of the seedlings of S. cerevisiae. However, the lipid content in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae was higher than that in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae. The highest lipids content (53%) was observed in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae.

Protein Kinase and Secretory Protein Kinases play a role in maintaining lipid-richness in Jatropha seedlings
In order to understand the lipid content and fatty acid profile of Jatropha seedlings, the protein kinase and secretory protein kinase activities were analyzed. The proteins with the highest lipid content in the Jatropha seedlings were serine hydroxamic acid (SPA), pectate lyase, citrate synthase, asparagine dehydrogenase, asparagine dehydrogenase, asparagine hydroxylase, asparagine hydroxylase, malate synthase, malate synthase, histidine kinase, asparagine dehydrogenase, tryptophanase, pyridoglycolate hydroxylase, citrate synthase, aldarate dehydrogenase, tyrosine kinase, tyrosine kinase, tryptophanase, glycerol pyruvate dehydrogenase, galactose kinase, sucrose pyruvate dehydrogenase, and tyrosine kinase activity in liquid medium (Figure 3). The highest lipid content was in the seedlings of S. cerevisiae.

The secretory protein secretory proteins, mainly leucine, are involved in the uptake and secretion of small molecules and have antimicrobial activities against Candida spp. and Candida parapsilosis. The secretory protein secretory proteins are involved in the transport of small molecules in the cell, including small molecules that could be used for plant growth.
