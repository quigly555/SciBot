## Abstract
Co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) and tuberculous meningitis (TBM) has reached alarming proportions among HIV-infected patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we compared the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological outcomes of the co-infected patients with CD4+ T-cell lymphocytopenia and HIV-infected healthy volunteers in an effort to identify factors associated with these outcomes.


## Introduction
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes cryptococcal meningitis, which is responsible for over a million life-threatening infections every year (1). C. neoformans primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, especially patients with AIDS (2, 3). C. neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen, which causes cryptococcal meningitis in both apparently immunocompetent and apparently immunocompromised patients (4). Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common opportunistic infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (5). It is estimated that over 700,000 cryptococcal cases occur annually worldwide and are the third most common cause of fatal AIDS-associated pneumonia (6, 7).

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining illness. The disease is characterized by defects in innate immune cell function and, in turn, by a dysfunctional immune system, resulting in the development of an array of disorders, including inflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases. The immunodeficiency and/or the defective immune system of the host, together with the abnormal cytokine response in the central nervous system (CNS) and impaired antigen presentation ability, lead to a significant proportion of deaths among HIV/AIDS patients (8, 9).


## Methods
The strategy includes the use of an iron-oxidase inhibitor for simultaneous metabolism of iron and carbon, and the use of an iron-hydroxylase inhibitor for simultaneous metabolism of iron and carbo. The kinases of the target gene (alpha amylase) are identified by sequencing the sequence of the target gene to determine its location, and the kinases of the target gene (alpha amylase) are identified by sequencing the sequence of the target gene and the corresponding gene fragments. The protocol for the determination of the kinase activities of the target gene was developed by using a kinetic analysis of the released kinase activity in different conditions of the reaction. The kinase activity was also analyzed using a flow cytometer, and the fluorescence of the cells was measured using the FLA-2a and FLA-3 fluorescent dye channels. The concentration of iron concentration that affects the kinase activity was analyzed using the AXA-4 fluorescence microplate reader (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Evaluation of the Experimental Design
The experimental design is described in the Supplementary Materials. In brief, yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) broth at 30 °C for 3-7 days. Then, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. The cells were inoculated into YPD broth at a density of 5 × 10^4 cells/mL, and then were incubated at 30 °C for 3-7 days. The cell density was then adjusted to 5 × 10^5 cells/mL. The YPD broth was then used for assaying the metabolic switching required to influence gene transfer. The cells were incubated at 30 °C for 3-7 days and harvested. Then, the cells were washed with PBS, and the pH of the cell suspension was adjusted to 5.0. The samples were then incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, and then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 10% (v/v) of methanol. The samples were then transferred to polypropylene tubes containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30 min, and then finally the samples were washed with PBS.


## Results
The percentage of iron was calculated as the sum of the concentration of iron and the concentration of the iron chelator of iron ion (FeCl_3) in the culture broth (.05, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/L). The percentage of iron and the concentration of the iron chelator in the culture broth were compared to determine the percentage of growth inhibition, which is a measure of the effect of the iron concentration on the growth of the cells. The percentage of growth inhibition of the mutant was reduced to 0.8 mg/L iron, while the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.4 mg/L iron. The percentage of growth inhibition of the wild-type strain was decreased to 0.5 mg/L iron, but the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.5 mg/L iron. In addition, the percentage of growth inhibition of the mutant was reduced to 0.1 mg/L iron, which was not statistically significant.

Iron and Carbon Metabolism
The differences in iron and carbon metabolism among the three mutants were compared to determine the biochemical changes during iron starvation or during iron sufficiency (Table 1). Figure 4 shows the results of the biochemical changes in the three mutants during iron starvation. The changes in the iron-controlled and iron-starved mutants were analyzed by comparing the growth of the three mutants in the presence of 1 mM FeCl_3, 5 mM FeCl_3, and 0.2 mM FeSO_4. The percent growth inhibition of the mutants was increased by 0.4 mg/L iron, while the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.2 mg/L iron. In contrast, the percent growth inhibition of the mutants was decreased by 0.4 mg/L iron, and the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.1 mg/L iron. The percent growth inhibition of the mutants was decreased by 0.4 mg/L iron, and the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.1 mg/L iron. In addition, the percent growth inhibition of the mutants was increased by 0.2 mg/L iron, and the growth inhibition was reduced to 0.1 mg/L iron. These data suggest that the intracellular iron concentrations are different between the mutants and the iron-controlled mutants.


## Discussion
In our previous study, the velvet-1 gene was also identified in . cerevisiae and P. anserina, which together account for 79% of the total yeast genome, while velvet-1 was not found in S. cerevisiae [23]. We have also searched for velvet-1 in the N. crassa genome, and found no similar gene in the other genomes, indicating that the velvet-1 gene is not essential for the velvet-1 homolog in N. crassa.

In our previous study, we found a gene in the velvet-1 gene cluster of S. cerevisiae, which was upregulated by iron starvation and not iron starvation, indicating that the velvet-1 gene may be required for iron uptake. In the present study, we searched for velvet-1 in the velvet-1 gene cluster of S. cerevisiae, and found no similar gene in the other genomes, indicating that the velvet-1 gene is not essential for the velvet-1 homolog in S. cerevisiae. This result is consistent with the idea that the velvet-1 gene may be involved in iron sensing in S. cerevisiae, but not in N. crassa. In addition, a putative velvet-1 gene in the velvet-1 gene cluster was identified in a sequence from S. cerevisiae, which may be involved in iron sensing. Thus, we believe that the velvet-1 gene is a type III secretion system.

In the velvet-1 gene cluster of S. cerevisiae, we found a gene in the velvet-1 homolog in S. cerevisiae, which is upregulated by iron starvation and not iron starvation, indicating that the velvet-1 gene may be required for iron sensing by the velvet-1 homolog in S. cerevisiae. This result is consistent with the idea that the velvet-1 gene is involved in iron sensing in S. cerevisiae, but not in N. crassa.

In this study, we identified a gene in the velvet-2 gene cluster in S.
