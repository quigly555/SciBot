## Abstract
In the last decade, liposomal structures in eukaryotes have attracted increasing attention both for the spectacular advances that have been made in this field of study and also for the manifold difficulties which have been attendant to its better understanding. These latest developments, however, mainly relate to the great heterogeneity of their polymers. In recent years, different classes of liposomes have been introduced in various organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, insects and plants. These molecules, representing a vast array of versatile polymers and functional units, possess great potential for application as biological scaffolds in biomedical applications.


## Introduction
Some pathogens have developed novel mechanisms to avoid and/or at least survive in the host immune defenses. The ability of Candida albicans to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms provides it with the ability to colonize various environments and host tissues. In the same way, C.


## Methods
Identification of the putative protein kinases by tRNA-Seq
The presence of putative kinases was predicted by tRNA-Seq analysis of the tRNA-Seq data using the software tRNAGO [41]. The software tRNAGO was used to assign protein kinases to the metabolic pathway of the pathogen [42]. The protein kinase sequences of the P. brasiliensis yeast cells used in this study were previously described by Peeters et al. [43]. The protein kinase sequences of the P. brasiliensis yeast cells used in this study were previously described by Tedersoo et al. [43] and by Sørensen et al. [44].

Materials and methods
Plant-extract extract (PEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as a solvent for the determination of the pH. The solvent-free PEM contained the following: methanol, 1.0 mL; dichloromethane, 1.0 mL; anhydrous sodium carbonate, 1.0 mL; chloroform, 1.0 mL; anhydrous ethyl acetate, 1.0 mL; and 1.0 mL of methanol. The solvent-free PEM contained the following: methanol, 0.1 mL; dichloromethane, 0.1 mL; anhydrous sodium carbonate, 1.0 mL; anhydrous ethyl acetate, 1.0 mL; anhydrous ethyl hexate, 1.0 mL; anhydrous anhydrous ammonium, 1.0 mL; and 1.


## Results
Among the 25 patients with S. vertella infection, 10 had S. vertella infection and 7 had S. vecii infection. The median age of the patients with S. vecii infection was 42 years (range, 34-65 years) and the median CD4 cell count was 10 cells/mm^3 (range, 5-18 cells). The median cell count was 4 cells/mm^3 (range, 2-11 cells).

The overall proportion of patients with a baseline serum creatinine value of 0.25 mg/dl (95%CI, 0.25-0.45 mg/dl) was 9.2%, and the proportion with a baseline creatinine value of 0.25 mg/dl (95%CI, 0.25-0.45 mg/dl) was 20.6%. The median CSF opening pressure was 101/mm^3 (95%CI, 67-175/225) and the median CSF white blood cell count was 16 cells/mm^3 (95%CI, 5-190 cells). There were no significant differences in the CSF opening pressure between patients with a baseline CSF creatinine value of 0.25 mg/dl (95%CI, 0.25-0.


## Discussion

The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the four classes of NOD2/KAP2/MSP3 were determine. While the KAP2/MSP3-LRR1/NOD2 class was at a concentration of 4.98 µg/ml (MIC = 4.98 µg/ml), the KAP2/MSP3-LRR2/NOD2 class was at a concentration of 4.96 µg/ml. All the NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes showed a significant increase in their MIC values relative to the control group. The KAP2/MSP3-LRR1/NOD2 class was at a concentration of 5.94 µg/ml. The KAP2/MSP3-LRR2/NOD2 class was at a concentration of 6.94 µg/ml.

The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/MSP3 classes were determined. In comparison to the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes, the MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were lower (MIC = 2.20 µg/ml) relative to the control group. The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were higher (MIC = 2.20 µg/ml) than the control group. The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were lower than the MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes. The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were higher than the MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes.

The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were higher than the MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes. The MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes were higher than the MIC values of the KAP2/NOD2/KAP2/NOD2 classes.
