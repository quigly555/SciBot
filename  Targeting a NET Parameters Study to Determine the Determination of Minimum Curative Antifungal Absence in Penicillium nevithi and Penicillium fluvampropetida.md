## Abstract
The Geico (Gasterio) patens, a widespread genus of dimorphic fungus, was once the only holomycete described in temperate climates, but as recently as the 1970s the taxonomic status of the genus was revived in North America due to the discovery of additional specimens in the Ambrosie genus. The species Geico heterothallica is a generic species in the Ascomycota, and molecular phylogenetic analyses of a wide variety of loci supported the description of this genus within the Ascomycota. However, in the Glomeromycota, the taxonomic placement of Geico is undermined by the occurrence of Geito-like taxa, as well as by the absence of mating morphs in the Gammapartaceae, whose mating is apparently independent of the mating of Geito and the corresponding protistan. Morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses support the concept of a single new species, which morphologically differs from the holomycete species Geito-morophila in the genera Amarycota, Arthrorhynchus, Keroga, Neocerobasidiales and Neurospora. This species is also here described as a new record for the tenth year of molecular phylogenetic analyses.

## Methods
neoformans va. grubii var. grubii, in order to investigate the clinical relevance of the results of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium nevithi and Penicillium fluvampropetida.

Patients were enrolled in the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium nevithi and Penicillium fluvampropetida (DMP) in order to determine the clinical relevance of the results. In addition, the study was also performed to investigate the impact of the specific antifungal agent and the clinical relevance of the results of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium fluvampropetida.

2.3. Clinical Organization of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium nevithi and Penicillium fluvampropetida
The Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium nevithi and Penicillium fluvampropetida was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, it was carried out to evaluate the diagnostic relevance of the results of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium fluvampropetida.

2.4. Clinical Organization of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium fluvampropetida
The study was performed with a clinical evaluation, which was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, by an experienced team of clinical pathologists and pathologists. In addition, it was conducted to confirm the clinical relevance of the results of the Determination of Minimum Curative Antifungal Absence in Penicillium fluvampropetida.

## Results
As shown in Table 3, the PBS and fluconazole MICs were >4 µg/ml, while the MIC for Penicillium nevithi was >3 µg/ml (Table 3. We then evaluated the antifungal efficacy of both the dyes using a range of experimental fungal infections, including the following: Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium fumigatus, and Candida albicans. As shown in Table 4, the MICs of all the tested dyes were >4 µg/ml.

We then compared the efficacy of the dyes in the following experimental fungal infections: Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium fumigatus, and Candida albicans. The MICs of all tested dyes were >4 µg/ml, whereas the MIC for Penicillium nevithi was >3 µg/ml. In the following infection, we evaluated the efficacy of the dyes in the following experiments: Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium fumigatus, and Candida albicans. The MICs of all tested dyes were >4 µg/ml.

## Discussion
The SP1-SP3 and SP3-SP4 doses were individually administered at a dose of 400 mg/day and in combination with fluconazole at a dose of 200 mg/day for a total duration of 4 to 12 weeks and 200 mg/day for 6 to 12 week. The SP1-SP3 dose was separately administered to the patients in SP3-SP4 combined therapy. The results of this study showed that the SP1-SP3 dose was used as a control for fluconazole discontinuation and that the SP3-SP4 dose was given in combination with fluconazole for a total duration of 4 to 12 weeks. The results of this study showed that the SP1-SP3 dose was used as a control for fluconazole discontinuation and that the SP3-SP4 dose was given in combination with fluconazole for a total duration of 4 to 12 weeks.

The formulation of the fluconazole-resistant penicillium-resistant species, Penicillium diphtheriae, can cause a significant decrease in the initial fluconazole concentration [12]. Therefore, a dose-response mechanism must be developed in order to determine the MIC value for penicillium-resistant strains. The MIC value for penicillium-resistant strains was established using a standard protocol using the specific in vitro susceptibility testing of the strains and the susceptibility tests of the patient in the following formulation schedule.

The patient in this study was treated with a high dose of fluconazole for 6 to 12 weeks. The patient in this study was treated with a high dose of fluconazole for 6 to 12 weeks. The results of this study showed that the patient in this study was treated with a high dose of fluconazole for 6 to 12 weeks.

The patient in this study was treated with a low dose of fluconazole for 6 to 12 weeks. The results of this study showed that the patient in this study was treated with a low dose of fluconazole for 6 to 12 weeks.
