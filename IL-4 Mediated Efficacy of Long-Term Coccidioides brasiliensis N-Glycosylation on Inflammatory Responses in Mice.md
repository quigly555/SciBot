## Abstract
The spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) use is large; however, it is becoming a global concern due to the growing number of individuals with HIV/AIDS/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). As such a number of new HIV therapies are approved, the need for a more in-depth analysis of the spectrum of these drugs has been especially evident in patients who present with opportunistic infections. Here we show that CD4+ T-cell deficiency, a new HIV diagnosis, significantly increased the frequency of positive PCR for HIV-1 RNA in serum and significantly decreased the frequency of positive PCR for HIV-1 RNA in CSF. The most significant increases in the CD4+ T-cell count were associated with CD4+ T-cell deficiency. These patients had a higher mortality rate, higher CD4+ T-cell count, and a higher HIV RNA prevalence. Our findings suggest that CD4+ T-cell deficiency is associated with increased opportunistic infections, which may have a detrimental effect on patient prognosis.


## Introduction
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a common complication in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [1]. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (COP) is a well-recognized entity that is a primary cause of death in the CNS [2]. However, CNS involvement due to Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is a major cause of mortality in AIDS patients [3,4].

The most common CNS involvement is caused by C. neoformans. C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast found in the environment in diverse ecological niches such as soil, water, and pigeon droppings [5]. The most common sites of infection are the central nervous system, lungs, and central nervous system lymph nodes [5-7]. The exact location and nature of the central nervous system (CNS) involvement is dependent on the immunological status of the patient. For example, patients with AIDS are more vulnerable to CNS infections compared to those without AIDS, which has been associated with a lower risk for CNS infections [8-10]. The role of immunological processes in CNS infections is currently being studied using immuno-compromised patients [9].


## Methods
Specifically, the susceptibility to fungizone was tested with a concentration of .2 mg/mL in RPMI-1640 medium. RPMI-1640 is a buffered medium with BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and is characterized by a pH of 7.0 and a maximum of 6.0. The MICs were determined by a single colony count, and were calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).

In order to determine the effect of the medium on the viability of a pathogen, the CFU assay of the fungus in the presence of a solution of 0.5% v/v of 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was performed by using an infection medium containing 0.5% v/v of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 10% v/v of sterile distilled water (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (S1 File). The DMSO concentration in the medium was 1.0% (S1 File). The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± SD.

In order to compare the different concentrations of a solution of DMSO and 0.5% v/v of DMSO, the following standard curve was constructed for the different concentration of a solution of DMSO in RPMI-1640 medium. The test of the microdilution method was performed by using a standard curve of 0.5% v/v of DMSO. For the DMSO concentration, the lowest concentration of the solution that produced an MIC of the pathogen was defined as the most active control. The curve was calculated as follows:

In order to determine the antibacterial activity of a solution of 0.5% v/v of 0.5% DMSO in RPMI-1640 medium, the following standard curve was constructed for the antibacterial activity of the solution of 0.5% v/v of 0.5% DMSO in RPMI-1640 medium. The test of the different concentrations of a solution of 0.


## Results
Identification of M. tuberculosis B3501 and M. tuberculosis Mpbs2 genes
To identify Mpbs2-encoded proteins, we generated homozygous deletion mutants of the M. tuberculosis B3501 Mpbs2 ortholog, B3501Mpbs2, and the M. tuberculosis Mpbs2 ortholog, B3501Mpbs2. To determine whether the M. tuberculosis Mpbs2 gene is essential for virulence, we generated a B3501Mpbs2 wild-type strain, which lacks the Mpbs2 gene (Fig 1A), as well as a complemented strain (B3501Mpbs2) that expresses the Mpbs2 gene. The B3501Mpbs2 mutant was also transformed with an empty plasmid to produce a recombinant Mpbs2-mCherry-Mpbs2 strain (Fig 1B). The resulting B3501Mpbs2 strain was used for further analysis. We observed a clear reduction in the growth of the B3501Mpbs2 mutant when grown in the presence of Mpbs2, and in addition, the growth of the B3501Mpbs2 mutant was significantly inhibited compared with that of the wild-type strain (Fig 1C). These data suggested that Mpbs2 and Mpbs2-encoded proteins are required for virulence in M. tuberculosis.


## Discussion
albicans, and . brasiliensis Infections [10, 11, 12, 27-31].

The present study aimed to identify the role of long-term Coccidioides long-term glucosylceramides in macrophage activation. The results showed that glucosylceramides in combination with Coccidioides glucosylceramides have significant impact on the macrophage activation. It is also possible that glucosylceramides might act as a potent inhibitor of CD3^+ T-cell proliferation. It is worth mentioning that the results of the present study demonstrated that the same dose of glucosylceramides (1:4) plus Coccidioides glucosylceramides (3:3) enhanced the macrophage activation of C. albicans. It was found that C. albicans was most susceptible to glucosylceramides (0.05-1.0 µg/mL) as compared to C. neoformans (0.03-2.0 µg/mL), which are amphotericin B (0.08-2.0 µg/mL), and itraconazole (0.04-1.0 µg/mL) as compared to C. neoformans (0.02-0.04 µg/mL). It is also important to note that the effects of glucosylceramides on CD4^+ T-cell proliferation were also reported by our group [14]. In our group, we also found that C. albicans was more sensitive to glucosylceramides (0.09-1.0 µg/mL) than C. neoformans (0.07-0.11 µg/mL) as compared to C. albicans, which is a dimorphic fungus. The effect of glucosylceramides on CD4^+ T-cell proliferation was also reported by our group [13].

The findings of the present study showed that glucosylceramides (1:4) plus Coccidioides glucosylceramides (3:3) enhanced the macrophage activation of C. albicans. It is also possible that glucosylceramides might act as a potent inhibitor of CD4^+ T-cell proliferation.
