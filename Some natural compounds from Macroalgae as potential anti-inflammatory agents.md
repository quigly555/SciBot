## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in individuals with immune deficiencies. Treatment options for cryptococcosis are limited, and treatment with the antifungal drugs flucytosine and azoles has never been attempted. The most important drug, Amphotericin B (AmB), is a drug with broad-spectrum activity against C. neoformans. In addition, in vitro activity of AmB against planktonic cells is reported. There are reports that AmB potently inhibits growth of C. neoformans in a dose-dependent manner in a murine model. To further evaluate the growth inhibitory activity of AmB, we evaluated the possible synergies between AmB and AmB in the nematode model. In the above study, the growth inhibition of AmB was dose dependent and dose-dependent dependent when the drug was applied intravenously. Moreover, the results indicated that the treatment of C. neoformans with AmB caused a decrease in the hemocyte count and altered the protein concentration of the renal internalisation and externalisation of C. neoformans. Our findings suggested that AmB could exert a synergistic action against C. neoformans that was dependent on the interactions of AmB with its substrates, such as amide. The high dose of AmB caused a decrease in the hemocyte count and altered the protein concentration of the renal internalisation and externalisation of C. neoformans, thus suggesting that the activity of AmB might be directed towards counteracting the cellular damage caused by AmB in the host. The results presented here indicate that AmB could be a potential antifungal agent against C. neoformans.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are two distinct species of the genus Cryptococcus that cause cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal disease is caused by two distinct species, C. neoformans and C. gattii. C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can be contained by macrophages and is capable of replicating intracellularly in macrophage phagosomes, which are enriched in HIV positive patients. C. neoformans is found worldwide and is found in avian/feral birds and in soil. The pathogenicity of C. neoformans is mainly related to its ability to adhere and to invade macrophages and their phagolysosomes. The infection occurs in the lungs and can disseminate to other organs, including the brain. Macrophages secrete several cytokines that induce cytokines and chemokines that lead to the activation of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). There are two major classes of PRRs that mediate recognition and killing of C.


## Methods
The standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA.

4.3. Antifungal Activity
The assay was performed as reported in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [28]. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 method [29]. MICs were determined in 96-well microtiter plates. Five µL of RPMI-1640 containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.5% MOPS, 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 200 µg/mL of compounds were added into the wells and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Non-toxic (chlorophyll-free) medium was used as the control [30]. The plate was read on a Versamax microplate spectrophotometer (Model: Sensi-2, United States) at a wavelength of 530 nm. The inhibition of growth was defined as the MIC of the compound that produced an optical density of 0.5-1.0 at 10% [30].

The susceptibility of E. coli ATCC 25922 (Table 1) was performed using a broth microdilution method [31]. This method has been validated for biofilm susceptibility testing [32]. The bacteriostatic activity of E.


## Results

Antibiotic and antifungal activity of natural compounds from the Macroalgae as potential anti-inflammatory agents
Antibiotic and antifungal activity of the natural compounds were compared with those from the synthetic synthetic and natural formulations of the natural product. The antifungal activity was evaluated against six clinically relevant fungi including C. neoformans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. krusei-like, C. krusei-like, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. albicans, C. krusei-like, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. albicans. The antifungal activity was evaluated against three clinical isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. The antifungal activity of the natural products was evaluated against three isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei.

Antibiotic and antifungal activity of natural products
The effects of natural products on the development of clinical infections in the patients were evaluated. The results of the study are shown in Table 1.

The study showed that the natural products showed no effect on the development of C. albicans infection. The natural products showed a slight inhibitory effect on the growth of C. albicans, which were also evaluated in the presence of fluconazole. The effect of the natural products on the development of C. albicans was investigated using the model organism C. neoformans. The results of the study are shown in Table 1.

The study showed that the natural products showed no significant effects on the development of C. neoformans infection. However, the inhibition effect of the natural products on the development of C. neoformans infection was evaluated using the model organism C. neoformans. The results of the study are shown in Table 2.

The study showed that the natural products showed a strong inhibitory effect on the development of C. neoformans infection. The effect of the natural products on the development of C. neoformans infection was investigated using the model organism C. neoformans. The results of the study are shown in Table 3.


## Discussion

Bioactive compounds are known for their antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microbes and fungi [19], and a wide variety of biological activities including protection against various infections, drug resistance, and antifungal activity [20. Here, we investigated the activity of synthetic and natural products from Macroalgae against S. aureus and P. brasiliensis, and found that these compounds were active against both strains. These compounds also showed good antifungal activity against the three Candida species.

The activity of synthetic compounds against S. aureus and P. brasiliensis was assessed by the bioassay and comparison of the results with the traditional antifungal activity. The results showed that the compounds were active against both strains, with MIC values of 0.87 and 0.78, respectively, and this was consistent with the results of other studies in humans [21], a type of bioassay [22] and bioassay using CFW and EFM.

Another interesting observation was the inhibition of bacterial growth. The results showed that the compounds were active against the tested strains, with MIC values of 0.06 and 0.05, respectively. However, the MIC values of the compounds were significantly higher than the standard drugs. The difference in MIC values of compounds may be due to the fact that they are found in natural products, and the selectivity of the drugs to their target.

The action of bioactive compounds against S. aureus and P. brasiliensis could be attributed to their ability to inhibit the growth of these bacteria. However, the antifungal activity of the compounds could be due to their bioactivity in vitro. In fact, the activity of these compounds against S. aureus was greater than that of the standard drugs, such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, and caspofungin. This could be due to the fact that bioactive compounds were more active than those synthesized in vitro [12]. The bioactivity of these compounds could be due to their low toxicity, as shown by their ability to inhibit growth of these bacteria.

The results of this study indicated that the bioactivity of the compounds was due to their ability to inhibit the growth of these bacteria. Previous studies have shown that these compounds have antifungal activity against C. albicans, which is a common cause of fungal meningoencephalitis [24].
