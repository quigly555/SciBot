## Introduction
 2012) has been proposed to be an interesting alternative method to the chemical conversion of acetate (Kumar et a., 2008). Oleaginous fungi have also developed metabolic enzymes that can convert acetate to a-keto-acetic acid in the presence of glucose, ATP, and pH (Costa et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2010; Coleman et al., 2010). The enzymes can be classified into two types: (1) acetate dehydrogenase (ADH), which converts acetate to acetate and (2) acetate oxidase (AOX), which oxidizes acetate to a-keto-acetic acid in the presence of ATP and pH (Coleman et al., 2010). The potential of AOX to convert acetate to acetate in the presence of glucose has been extensively studied and AOX is currently the best-validated conversion method (Kumar et al., 2008). In a recent study, AOX was converted by Candida albicans to acetate (Kumar et al., 2008). However, AOX is not the only enzyme converting acetate to acetate, and it has also been studied on a large number of fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Cryptococcus species (Costa et al., 2007; Coleman et al., 2010; Coleman et al., 2010).

Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen, which is responsible for life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients (Nair et al., 2009; Pfaller and Diekema, 2010). Although C. albicans is not as prevalent as Histoplasma capsulatum, it has been reported that this fungus can survive and proliferate inside macrophages and other immune cells (Kumar et al., 2008). Recently, it was shown that C. albicans can metabolize acetate and acetate oxidase in the presence of glucose (Kumar et al., 2008). However, the metabolism of acetate to acetate in the presence of glucose has not been studied yet.

Several metabolic enzymes belonging to citric acid cycle and catalase have been demonstrated to be important for the conversion of acetate to acetate in the presence of glucose. However, the metabolic features of citric acid citrate cycle and catalase have not been studied yet.


## Methods

.5. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activities of ketoconazole were evaluated using an inoculum of bacteria on the plates of Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco, BD, Franklin, NJ, USA) by the method described by Addison et al. [43] with some modifications. Briefly, yeast cells were incubated at 37°C with agitation for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffered to pH 7 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and then incubated for 24 h at 37°C with agitation. The mycelium were harvested and washed twice with sterile PBS to remove the MOPS. The mycelium were then collected and transferred to a fresh SDA plate containing 1 ml of the appropriate concentration of ketoconazole and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The mycelium were then collected and washed twice with sterile PBS to remove the MOPS. The plates were dried at 45°C for 24 h and then they were weighed. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ketoconazole were determined using the broth dilution method. The reduction in biomass was expressed as mg/ml and the minimum concentrations of ketoconazole were determined using the microplate spectrophotometer Cellometer Reader (BMG Labtech, Ningbo, China) at 450 nm. The MICs were considered to be the lowest concentration of ketoconazole that completely inhibited the growth of the fungus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ketoconazole were determined as the lowest concentration of ketoconazole that completely inhibited growth of the fungus.

3.6. Antimicrobial Activity
The antifungal activity of ketoconazole was determined by the method of Schiestl and Goldman [44] with some modifications. Briefly, yeast cells were incubated with RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M MOPS at 37°C for 24 h. The mycelium were harvested, washed with sterile PBS, and resuspended in sterile PBS.


## Results
The two initial assays were performed on the three synthetic strains of C. neoformans: CEA10, which was sequenced by the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org), and MUMH, which was sequenced by the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org), respectively. In total, 40 strains were selected from a total of 22 clinical isolates (Table 1). These strains were the most commonly identified isolates, including five Candida species (C. neoformans, C. gattii, C.


## Discussion
In the presence of acetate, a reduction in the oleate metabolism may occu. It is possible that the reduced oleate production by the oleaginous yeast yeast is due to the reduction in the oleate metabolism, as it is the main enzyme of the oleate pathway.

In the present study, a model of the oleate biosynthesis was used to show the mechanism of oleate production by the oleaginous yeast. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies in oleate biosynthesis in C. curvatus. A number of studies have been performed to study the oleate biosynthesis in C. curvatus. In the present work, we investigated the production of oleate in C. curvatus using a bioassay method. We were interested in the production of oleate by C. curvatus as well as its role in the oleate biosynthesis by other yeasts, including the yeast Saccharomyces castellii and the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. In this study, we selected C. curvatus and it was cultured in high osmolarity at 25°C for 24 h. C. curvatus was cultured for 24 h, and we observed the production of oleate by C. curvatus was significantly higher than that of other yeasts.

In the present study, we used cell viability as a surrogate to evaluate the oleate biosynthesis. The oleate was produced by the cells of C. curvatus as described previously in other yeasts. Cells of C. albicans and C. neoformans were cultured for 48 h, and the oleate was significantly higher than that of C. albicans and C. neoformans. The production of oleate was not significantly increased in C. curvatus, which may be due to the fact that C. curvatus cells were in a low osmolarity condition and these yeasts did not require oleate for their production of oleate. It has been reported that oleate is a good candidate as a precursor of oleate as a carbon source in C. albicans and C. neoformans [43]. The low osmolarity of C. albicans may explain the higher production of oleate in C. curvatus.
