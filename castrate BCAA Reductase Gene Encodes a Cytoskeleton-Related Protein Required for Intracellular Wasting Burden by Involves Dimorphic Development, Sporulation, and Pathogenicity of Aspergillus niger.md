## Abstract
Invasive pulmonary fungal infection (IPFI) is a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. IFI is caused by several fungal species that infect humans; however, the epidemiology and etiology of IFI in the lungs of immunocompromised patients are not well-studied. We herein report a case of pulmonary infection caused by Aspergillus terreus in a immunocompromised patient who presented with a nonhemorrhagic respiratory failure and pulmonary cryptococcosis that was initially suspected to be Aspergillus voracious and resistant to azoles, suggesting that Aspergillus terreus may have acquired the resistance by exposure to azoles during his or her infection. The patient had low body weight and was immunocompromised with fluconazole. Although the patient had no underlying disease, the treatment was unsuccessful. Although the patient was initially initially initially treated with voriconazole, he subsequently developed symptoms and was then transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient was initially diagnosed with pulmonary infection based on clinical and laboratory features, but it was not possible to exclude the possibility of disseminated disease. Virulence factors of Aspergillus terreus were not evident from the specimens available to rule out disseminated disease. Although the patient was initially treated with voriconazole, the patient subsequently developed neurological symptoms and was subsequently transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient was initially diagnosed with pulmonary infection based on clinical and laboratory features, but it was not possible to exclude the possibility of disseminated disease. Although the patient was initially diagnosed with pulmonary infection based on clinical and laboratory features, but it was not possible to exclude the possibility of disseminated disease.


## Introduction
maydis (.k.a. Erythrogloeaceae), and in some lepidopterans, such as Pyrenophora (Pyrenophora anemone), Phaeodactylum, and the saprophytic human pathogen Nosema (Nosinantoicola). It is known for its devastating impact on economically important crops, such as sugar beet (Nosinantoicola) and maize (Zea mays) (Kong et al. 2017), and for its successful use in decontamination of contaminated soil and water, and its ability to confer protection against pathogens and parasites (Dagobbi et al. 2016). The genus Cytospora was established for six closely related taxa of terrestrial fungal phytoplankton, namely Cytospora, T. subglutinans, T. phlebotinum, T. phlebotrodes, and T. subglutinans (Lass-Flörl, 1996). The genus has a worldwide distribution, which is associated with large populations of soil saprophytes, and it can be found on the decaying wood, leaf, and seed organs of many important crops including maize, peanuts, and soybean (Nosinanto and Alspaugh 2003; Pirbadian 2007). In addition to the phytoplankton, it is also found in several aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, and sea water (Kong et al. 2017). In addition, Cytospora has been reported as an important source of human pathogens such as B. abortus, a pathogen of haematogenic skin and nail infection (Nosinanto et al. 2015), B. leprieurii, and B. subglutinans, which are important causes of superficial mucosal infections and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Sinai et al. 2016).

In this study, we used morphological and molecular tools to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Cytospora from the leaf-associated fungal phytoplankton, and compared the phylogenetic relationships of Cytospora to the leaf-associated fungal phytoplankton.


## Methods
After confirming the presence of the genes encoding the major cytoskeleton components, all mammalian cells from both the axons and the midgut were used for co-culture with . brasiliensis strain BWP17 [14]. Each cell culture was treated with 10% (v/v) PEG/PBS, 30 µM 2-propanol, and 10% (v/v) tritonol (Sigma-Aldrich). To test the influence of P. brasiliensis growth on P. brasiliensis niger, cells were co-cultured with P. brasiliensis strain BWP17 for 3-4 days. Then, P. brasiliensis cells were cultured with P. brasiliensis BWP17 for 1-2 days. The pyridylation-related phenotype was measured by the decrease in the number of pyridylate produced by the cells.

The role of Aspergillus niger on the growth of the phagosomes of the P. brasiliensis yeast cells was determined by co-culturing P. brasiliensis yeast cells in a yeast cell culture at 30 °C for 3-4 days. To this end, P. brasiliensis cells were co-cultured with yeast cells of P. brasiliensis strain BWP17 in a yeast cell culture at 30 °C for 1-2 days. The co-cultures were incubated with P. brasiliensis yeast cells at 30 °C for 5-7 days. To confirm the presence of Aspergillus niger, P. brasiliensis yeast cells were co-cultured with P. brasiliensis yeast cells for 2-3 days. The pyridylation-related phenotype was measured by the decrease in the number of pyridylate produced by the yeast cells.

P. brasiliensis yeast cells were cultured in PEG/PBS for 48 h. Then, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PEG/PBS at a concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/ml. Then, 100 µl of yeast cells were added to 500 µl of PEG/PBS at a concentration of 1 × 10^5 yeast cells/ml. After the addition of 200 µl of 0.


## Results
niger) [30], and the N-terminal truncation of the exonuclease domain of the cleavage site for catalysis, catalytic triad, is a common feature of many specie. Here, we investigated whether N-terminal truncations of the exonuclease domain in Aspergillus niger affected the expression of the key enzymes involved in the splicing and elongation of mature Aspergillus niger spore membranes. We chose the previously characterized N-terminal truncated exonuclease domain (NUT-T1) of Aspergillus niger to compare its expression in A. niger and the other Aspergillus species. We found that the NUT-T1 gene encodes a polypeptide of 25 amino acids with a cysteine group that is absent in the human NUT domain (Figure 2A). The amino acid sequence of the NUT-T1 gene in A. niger is identical to that of A. niger NUT-T1 (Supplementary Figure 1), and the NUT-T1 gene in Aspergillus niger is similar to A. niger NUT-T1 (Supplementary Figure 2). The NUT-T1 gene is flanked by the NUT-T1 gene (Figure 2B) and contains a putative intron of 36 bp (Figure 2C). The NUT-T1 gene is flanked by the NUT-T1 gene and is flanked by the NUT-T1 gene (Figure 2D). We found that NUT-T1 gene expression was strongly increased in Aspergillus niger spores compared to that in A. niger spores (P < 0.001; Figure 2E). However, the expression of the NUT-T1 gene in A. niger spores was not significantly different from that in A. niger NUT-T1 (Figure 2E). Thus, the NUT-T1 gene encodes a catabolic pathway for the degradation of Aspergillus niger spore membranes, which is associated with the macrophage cell membrane and that is not associated with the intracellular life cycle.


## Discussion
cinere. Using phylogenomic analysis, we identified the putative RBCC protein, ERB3, in the pathogenic fungus, Aspergillus niger. The ERB3 family contains an ERB3 gene (GenBank accession number: CAI058184) that encodes a putative ERB3 protein that is required for the degradation of B. cinerea ERBs [42]. A recent study reported that ERB3 is a bona fide ERB3 protein that is essential for ERB3 function in Aspergillus fumigatus, which was able to degrade B. cinerea ERBs by 12.7-fold (21%) [43]. Similarly, the C. neoformans rbcA gene encodes a putative ERB3 protein that is required for ERB3 degradation in C. neoformans, which was unable to degrade B. cinerea ERBs by more than 30-fold [44]. In addition, we identified the putative ERB3 protein, Cdc11, as a putative negative regulator of ERB3 activity in A. nidulans [45]. The ERB3 gene was first identified in Aspergillus fumigatus [44] and then was expanded in the pathogenic fungus A. fumigatus [46]. ERB3 is also required for the vacuolar proteasome, in which the ERB3 protein is required for the degradation of ERBs by 6- to 10-fold [47]. The ERB3 gene encodes a putative negative regulator of vacuolar proteasome activity in A. fumigatus [46]. The results of this study showed that ERB3 encodes a putative negative regulator of vacuolar proteasome activity in A. niger.

The signaling pathways in the ERB3 pathway are involved in the cell cycle, cell wall synthesis, cell division, stress response, and cell wall biosynthesis. The ERB3 family members are involved in the cell wall biosynthesis, sterol biosynthesis, and stress response in fungi [48-50]. We identified the ERB3 family members as a class of proteins involved in the cell wall biosynthesis, sterol biosynthesis, and stress response in A. niger.
