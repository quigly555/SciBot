## Abstract
Sugar refinery washing water (SRWW) contains a rich biodiversity of microbes. SRWW is commonly colonized by E. coli and B-cell Lactobacillales (BCL), which represent a group of potentially drug-resistant pathogens. We previously reported on the detection of STMicroclass B cells in SRWW samples from Bambusa, Zambia, and both sites yielded either positive for Bacteroidetes or classified as STMicro. In this study, we isolated Bacteroidetes from SRWW samples from three hospitals in Zambia. Three STMicroclass B cells were isolated from these samples. Two STMicroclass B were identified from culture and phenotypic characterization. Our results suggest that B-cell Bacteroidetes may be a risk factor for septicemia and sepsis in patients infected by B-cell bacteria.


## Introduction
Eukaryotic cell division is one of the most important processes in eukaryotic cells, often involving both multicellular and unicellular eukaryotic organisms.


## Methods
The higher proportion of positive findings (positive T cell polarization in PM) and less severe case of PM infection (positive T cell polarization in PM) are considered as negative, respectivel.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The significance of data was set at p = 0.05, and the number of samples was set to 2^*10^6 cells/mL. Data were analysed using Student’s t-test. The differences between groups were analysed using the unpaired t-test.

## Results
In order to identify the CD4^+ T cells that produce T cell marker markers, we employed murine murine model of . infection, in which the splenic CD4^+ T cell subset of these T cells was characterized by the CD4^+ marker CD23^+ CD4^+ cells. A murine model of O. infection induced by P. brasiliensis infection was used to investigate whether the enhanced CD4^+ T cell polarization in the O. infection model could be explained by enhanced antigen presentation. In order to confirm the results obtained by the murine model of O. infection, we used a murine infection model of O. infection and performed antigen presentation experiments in a murine model of O. infection. These experiments were carried out by immunofluorescent staining of lymphocytes, which were stained with antibodies specific to a specific T-cell subset of CD4^+ T cells. The antigen presentation of CD4^+ T cells in the murine model was determined by measuring the expression of the CD19 T-cell subunit CD19 and CD4^+ T cell marker CD23 in the murine T cell subsets. The CD19 expression was significantly increased in the O. infection model compared with the murine model (P < 0.0001), which was not seen in the O. infection model (Fig 3A). In addition, the expression of the CD19 T-cell marker CD23 was significantly higher in the O. infection model (P < 0.0001), which was not seen in the O. infection model (Fig 3B). These results showed that enhanced antigen presentation and enhanced cytokine expression in the O. infection model could be explained by enhanced T cell polarization.

Elevated CD4^+ T-cell and CD4^+ T-cell population in an oropharyngeal lesion induces enhanced inflammatory cytokine expression
The oropharyngeal epithelium of O. infection induces extensive production of inflammatory cytokines, which are particularly important for the normal immune response in the early stages of infection [11]. We investigated whether the enhanced CD4^+ T-cell population in an oropharyngeal lesion induced by P. brasiliensis infection could be related to the production of a cytokine that promotes the early stages of the disease.


## Discussion

T cell subsets were also enriched in the overall B cell subsets, although they were not statistically significan. T cell subsets generally contain high levels of intracellular matrix components, and they are generally associated with viral replication. However, there were very few T cell subsets in the subpopulations of the B cell subsets that responded to viral infection. The B cell subsets did not differ significantly from those in the other B cell subsets, except for the LIF-1a and IL-17A subsets, which were significantly enriched in the B cell subsets. These results indicate that T cell subsets are not simply a consequence of an increased B cell response. Rather, it is a response to an enhanced B cell response.

The B cell subsets showed higher levels of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines than the other cell subsets. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly enriched in the T cell subsets, and the B cell subsets did not differ significantly from those in the other cell subsets. However, the B cell subsets showed no significant differences from the other cell subsets.

The IL-17A and IL-13 cytokines were significantly enriched in the T cell subsets, and the B cell subsets did not differ significantly from those in the other cell subsets. However, the T cell subsets did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets.

An IL-17 receptor was identified in the T cell subsets, but the B cell subsets did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets. However, the B cell subsets did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets.

A receptor for IL-4 was identified in the T cell subsets. The B cell subsets did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets.

The T cell subsets showed no significant differences from the other cell subsets.

T cell subsets were also enriched in the T cell subsets, but they did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets.

IL-23 was identified in the T cell subsets, but the B cell subsets did not differ significantly from the other cell subsets.

IL-17 was identified in the T cell subsets, but it was not significantly enriched in the other cell subsets.

The IL-17 is expressed by B cell subsets and it was significantly enriched in the T cell subsets.
