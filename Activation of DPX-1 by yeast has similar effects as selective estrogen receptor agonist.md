## Abstract
Genes in plant genomes are often assigned to chromosomal segments based on sequence similarity. Despite that, the identification of additional genes involved in signalling, storage and degradation of plant biomass has only recently begun to be considered. To discover the full extent of this gene loss, we carried out an extensive analysis of the fungal genomic community to identify the functional roles of this lost gene family. This extensive survey revealed important and potentially unknown roles of the fungal genome for plant signalling, storage and decadal degradation.

Many plant fungal genomes are polycistronic polycistronic. The fungal genome of Sordaria werneckii is a polydisciplinary assembly of completely sequenced genomes, including plant and fungal genomes, which lacks the single duplicated genes and a single, conserved, euchromatin-rich cytoplasm. The multiple roles of the plant fungal genome and the lost fungal genes in plant-pathogen interaction are described in this report.


## Introduction
DPX-1 also binds to the estrogen receptor of mammalian cells, receptor D2 (9,10. In the mouse, it is also expressed in both the ovario-egg and the egg precursor stages (11). The eggs of both ovario-egg and egg precursor are secreted to the extracellular milieu by the mature egg (12). Under physiological conditions, ovario-egg undergoes a strong differentiation process from that of the egg to produce egg (13,14).

There is also evidence that ovario-egg have an additional immune response, a cytokine-mediated immune response (15,16). Immune cells from both ovario-egg and egg can interact with the host, and the cytokine associated with the immune response can be either direct or mediated by endogenous molecules. For example, IL-4 can bind to IL-4 receptor, which is found in the egg precursor and affects the immune response of the host (17,18). In addition, the interaction of IL-4 and IL-13 with the IL-13 receptor in the egg is associated with the production of cytokines that are able to mediate the immune response and promote the host defense against pathogens (19). The cell-mediated immunity mediated by the IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines can be mediated either through the production of cytokines or the secretion of inflammatory mediators (20,21).

The pathogenic fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Cryptococcus neoformans, have been shown to produce abundant IL-12a and IL-18a cytokines in vitro, and their cytokine profiles can be directly linked to virulence in vivo (22,23). IL-12a and IL-18a are produced during the development of the fungal cell and can be produced by all pathogenic fungi (23). IL-12a can also be produced from circulating IL-12a receptor (IL-12aR) in yeast, and it can bind to IL-12aR (23). IL-12aR is a member of the C-type lectin receptor family, a heterodimeric receptor consisting of two C-type lectin-like domains, a C-type lectin and a C-terminal C-type lectin (24).


## Methods
Yeast cells were cultivated in MM for 3 days at 30°. Cell density was adjusted to 1.0 × 10^6 cells/ml and then lysed in 1 ml of PBS by bead beating with a bead beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK).

Determination of cell-associated protein concentrations
BMDM cultures were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies) at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 100 µl of sterile HBSS. Cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method [71] using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

Quantification of the amount of protein required for the transformation of the yeast to the molds
BMDM cultures were cultured in the presence of 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM N-methoxy-N-(d-Fluor) succinate (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) at 30°C with shaking at 180 rpm for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in sterile HBSS. The number of yeast cells required to form a pellet was determined by hemocytometer.

C. glabrata conidial suspension
BMDM cells were cultured in 1 × 10^6 conidia/ml in 1 × 10^6 conidia/ml in 1 × 10^6 conidia/ml in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm for 5 h. The cell-associated protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method [72] with bovine serum albumin as the standard.

Pulmonary C. glabrata strain
For the determination of cell-associated protein concentration, the C. glabrata strain SC5314 (A-72A) was used. The cells were grown in MM at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm for 5 h. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with sterile HBSS. The cell-associated protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method [73].

## Results
To assess the sensitivity of DPX-1 inhibitors to the growth of wild-type cells, we also tested the sensitivity of wild-type and <U+0394>dhp1 mutant cells to DPX-1 inhibitor. As shown in Figure 4B, DPX-1 inhibitors had no significant effects on growth of wild-type or <U+0394>dhp1 mutant cells, but at least some doses of DPX-1 inhibitors caused a significant growth inhibition of wild-type cells. As expected, we observed that DPX-1 inhibitors had no effect on the growth of <U+0394>dhp1 mutant cells. These results suggest that DPX-1 inhibitors may play a role in the regulation of the expression of the DPX-1 transcription factor in the host.

Dhp1 is a non-canonical transcription factor that regulates the expression of a set of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in A. fumigatus
In addition to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the host, Dhp1 is also involved in the regulation of glucose-6-phosphate synthase (G6P), a sugar-repressible transcription factor that regulates glucose-6-phosphate synthase activity in the host [30]. We therefore investigated whether DPX-1 inhibitors could affect the glucose-6-phosphate synthase activity of DPX-1 inhibitors. Wild-type and <U+0394>dhp1 cells were grown in the presence of DPX-1 inhibitors for 6 h and then the activity of G6P and G6P-repressible transcription factors (TFs) was assessed. The results showed that DPX-1 inhibitors were able to inhibit G6P activity, indicating that DPX-1 inhibitors might also regulate glucose-6-phosphate synthase activity.

We next investigated whether DPX-1 inhibitors could interfere with glucose-6-phosphate synthase activity in the yeast.


## Discussion
The DPX-1 is important for maintaining cell-wall integrity and the differentiation of . neoformans (23, 24).

The structure of the C. neoformans epimastigote cell wall contains proteins and lipids that form a complex network that controls the intracellular survival of the fungus. The epimastigote cell wall is a large complex of chitin, mannan, and chitosan, which is synthesized by the cell wall components TGF-ß and FGF-ß (25, 26). In addition to the cell wall components, the cell wall components of C. neoformans also include mannoproteins, mannoproteins, and glucan, which are structurally similar to those of C. neoformans (27). The chitin and mannoproteins of C. neoformans are important for the resistance of the fungus to stress and infection. Glucan is a structural component of the cell wall and is composed of glycoproteins, which are involved in numerous cellular processes including cell wall integrity and cell differentiation (28). The glucan synthase family is a family of proteins which are involved in the synthesis of chitin and mannan, which are important structural components of the cell wall and are involved in the cell wall and development (29). The chitin synthase family of proteins is a group of proteins that synthesize chitin in the cell wall and are also involved in cell differentiation and stress resistance (30). The glucan synthase family is a group of proteins that synthesize chitin in the cell wall and are also involved in cell differentiation and stress resistance (31). The glucan synthase family is a group of proteins that synthesize chitin in the cell wall and are also involved in cell differentiation and stress resistance (32). The chitin synthase family of proteins is a group of proteins that synthesize chitin in the cell wall and are also involved in cell differentiation and stress resistance (33). The cell wall and chitin are essential components of the cell wall of C. neoformans. The cell wall of C. neoformans has been shown to be composed of chitin, mannan, and mannoproteins, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and cell wall functions (34). The cell wall of C.
