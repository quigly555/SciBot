## Abstract
The liver is an important organ in humans and animals, with the aim of keeping track of liver histology. This study, which involved the analysis of extracts from various plant species, was specifically descriptive of the most histologically relevant fungi investigated. A total of 33 different species of fungi were found in the samples, and they were mainly affiliated to the genera Basidiomycota, Fungi, Alternaria, Botrytis, Glomeromycota, Metarhizium, Melanomyces, Myrolyi, Neofibrosum, Paracoccidioides, Pseudotomensiya and Russulales. Among the fungal extracts analysed, we obtained two species of mycobacterium from 20 different plants, one of which was collected from Sichuan Province. Among these, Basidiomycota were the most predominant genus (99.9%), followed by Fungi (38.


## Introduction
The genus Trachyascus (Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Pezizomycetes) is a complex of shrubs, small trees, shrubs and cacti associated with a variety of plant hosts (Wijayawardene et al. 2017). The most important of these are T.regis (Benth.) angulata and T.baculata, which occur in the tropics (Wijayawardene et al. 2017). The two species are most commonly found in association with tropical plants and are considered to be of major importance for the development of plantations and plantations in tropical areas (Clements & Blanchette 2016).

T.baculata is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and is mostly found in tropical areas, particularly in the south of the country and south of the country (Clements & Blanchette 2016). In addition, the species is found in the Andean belt (Clements & Blanchette 2016). The plant hosts are often susceptible to soil-borne diseases, especially as their roots can reach higher soil temperatures than the roots of the plant (Nagalai & Rajamahalu 1975). The soil temperature is the major factor in regulating the plant growth and health, which can be affected by various soil microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes (Wijayawardene et al. 2017). It is well known that the soil microorganisms are responsible for a wide variety of biological activities, such as nitrogen fixation, transport, and osmotic and mechanical effects (Clements & Blanchette 2016). Moreover, soil microbes are also involved in the fermentation of hydrocarbons and other organic molecules (Mather & Nirenberg 2011).


## Methods

Nested PCR amplification of . farrerasco FR1 and FR2 and subunit of C. farrerasco fas-3
Nested PCR was used to amplify C. farrerasco fas-3 (from C. glabrata [FAS-3]) using primers: FR1-F (5'-CCGACGCACCTAGCGTAGC-3') and FR2-R (5'-CCGCCAGCTGCCTCGAGCAC-3') [57]. A nested PCR was performed with the primer set FR1-F (5'-CTCCTGTAGCATCCGTCTCC-3') and FR2-R (5'-ACGCAGCATCCACAGCAC-3') for FR1 and FR2, respectively. The nested PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH5a Escherichia coli competent cells (Invitrogen) and induced growth at 37°C in LB medium. The transformants were selected on LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and kanamycin (10 µg/ml).

Construction of C. farrerasco fas-3 cDNA library and sequencing
C. farrerasco fas-3 cDNA library was constructed using C. glabrata as a template with primers FR1-F and FR2-R, and the products were amplified from the genomic DNA of C. farrerasco fas-3 strain using the thermal cycler cycloheximide method (Invitrogen). The reaction products were purified using QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).

Genomic DNA extraction and pyrosequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from C. farrerasco fas-3 cDNA using the ZymoBIOMICS Plant Mini Kit (Zymo Research). The DNA was extracted from C. glabrata using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The DNA was sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v.3.


## Results
 1998; Kuntz et a., 2009). In this study, we found that Wickerhamomyces farreras is also a transcription factor for the pathway of stress-induced expression of the stress-response protein BaxB (Wickerhamomyces farreras, BaxB; Gresham et al., 1999). Thus, this transcription factor is an important component of the stress-induced pathway of BaxB-mediated stress resistance in W. farreras.

Wickerhamomyces farreras is an important pathogen for tomato by exposing the crop to the plant pathogen M. luteovelutina (Barney and Webb, 1998; Kuntz et al., 2009). M. luteovelutina is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M. pulcherrima, which is a pathogen of wheat and barley by infecting the leaves with M.


## Discussion
The rhizome of . farrerasis is a highly differentiated and highly adapted woody species with a specialised and well-differentiated defense system. According to the results presented in this study, A. farrerasis exhibits a high degree of adaptation to its host tree.

A. farrerasis was first recorded on wheat in China by Wu and Yang (1992) and it has been reported as a highly adapted wood-decaying fungus by some authors (Sionov et al. 2011). The genus has been widely studied in China (Sionov and Chatterjee 2011; Sionov and Sionov 2016) and in other countries (Sionov et al. 2013). In this study, A. farrerasis was found in P. farrerasis and collected on wheat in China. The phylogenetic tree was derived from the ITS1 region of rDNA and revealed that this species is closely related to P. farrerasis.

The species of this genus are abundant in wheat, but their occurrence on P. farrerasis in China is not as high as in other countries. Most of them are phytopathogenic and belong to the genera Hypocreaceae and Perennialaceae (Pereira et al. 2015). Hypocreaceae species are responsible for the deciduous wheat disease occurrence in China (Zhang et al. 2016). The genus also comprises members of the orders Perenniales and Hypocreaceae, as well as species of those species in P. floccosum (Pereira et al. 2015).

Pileus marinus is a true wood-decaying fungus that occurs in several countries (Pereira et al. 2015). P. marinus is widely distributed in the forest ecosystems in the area studied in this study. This fungus is also known as P. marinuschaetosa (López-Santana et al. 2016). The species inhabiting this woody host in China was collected on wheat in China. It is widely distributed on wheat and wheat rusts, but in recent times it has been recorded on P. farrerasis (Pereira et al. 2015). This fungus is also reported as a wood-decaying fungus in several studies in China (Pereira et al. 2015).

Fusarium pseudotuberculosis has been reported in many different plant species (Pereira et al. 2015).
