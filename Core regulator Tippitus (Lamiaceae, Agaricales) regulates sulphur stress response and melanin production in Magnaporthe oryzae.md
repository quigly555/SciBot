## Abstract
The water column surrounding the chemical plant of Bacili amyloliquefaciens (BAM) in the Atacama Desert is characterized by the presence of a number of contaminants, including heavy metals such as chromium, selenium, and radium. Despite the presence of many toxic contaminants, the BAM is still a successful aquatic microsporia. In this study, we used light microscopy to examine the appearance and dynamics of the water column during the growth of BAM in semi-oxygen (S)-secluded sand dunes adjacent to the Baja resort site. We found that the sand dunes had a relatively larger water column at the end of the BAM, which may have been influenced by environmental factors such as exposure to radon or by irradiation with visible light. In addition, our data suggest that the water column was influenced by several environmental factors during the growth of BAM, including rainfall, drenching, wind, and human exposure to radon. In order to better understand the environmental factors that might have driven the growth of BAM during its semi-oxygen life, we performed a functional diversification analysis to identify the functional roles of the water column during the growth of BAM. We found that the water column had a significant negative role in the growth of BAM, due to the presence of a number of contaminants, including heavy metals such as chromium, selenium, and radium. In addition, the negative role of the water column was related to the fact that we observed no significant changes in the transcriptional response of BAM in the presence of radium. The data presented here contribute to our understanding of the influence of environmental factors, Bams, and irradiation on the growth of BAM, and may serve as a starting point for future studies on these issue.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella is represented by more than 30 species in the ascomycetes Eurotiales, Diaporthales, Phaeo-sphae, Togniniomycetes, and Phaeodiaporthe. According to Mycosphaerella’s classification, it is divided into four main clades, which are based on the number of loci (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei). Clade I (EC1.10.9.18) includes the most recent generic and species-defining species. Clade I is most closely related to the species in Cladia (C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) (Kirk et al. 2011), and the three new species (C. eujae and C. petroliphilus) and one (C. sinensis) (Wang et al. 2018) are described based on morphological characters. The genus was described based on four genes (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. pseudohyphal cells) (Fries, 1885; Kobayasi, 1970; Hartmann et al. 1972; Müller and von Arx, 1978; Aoki et al. 2000; Hartmann and Müller, 2001; Chen et al. 2006; Qin et al. 2015), and the number of genes is not known. The authors proposed the name C. sinensis to include two species, C. eujae and C. pseudohyphal, which were later expanded to include all three species, including C. sinensis.

The genus Mycosphaerella is morphologically similar to that of most of the ascomycetes, although the latter has a much wider host range. The asexual morphs are divided into two varieties, namely the ophiostomatoid (sensu C.


## Methods

The dominant glycosylation state of the melanin layer is expressed as the amount of glycosylated (gl) per mg of lipids per ml of wate. Glucose (gl^-) is an essential glycosylation factor and one of the main functions of yeast and fungus in the life cycle. It is also a major component of the cell wall and lipid extraction [12].

In order to identify the different types of melanin and determine their response, we used a simple and reliable method. We used the melanin-glycosylation method to quantify the response of the yeast strain against the control strain (strain Y. lipolytica) and the melanin-glycosylation method to quantify the response of the fungus against the control strain (strain L. sp.).

The melanin layer is a thin layer that contains the main structural components: lipid, glycosylate, coenzyme, and a common molecular name, melanin. It is composed of various lipids, proteins, and glycosylate-lysate complexes. In order to determine the temperature, pH, and temperature changes, we used a simple and reliable method. We used a thermometer to measure the temperature, pH, and temperature changes of the yeast strain against the control strain (strain L. sp.).

2.2. Lipid Extraction, Liposome Assays, and Liposome and Liposomal Analysis
Yeast strains were cultured on rich medium (YPD, 0.7% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, and 2% glucose) for 6 days at 28°C. The lipid extraction was carried out by adding 200 µl of crude extract of the test strain to the medium. The samples were then cooled on ice for 1 min before they were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used to determine the liposomal concentration.

2.3. Lipid and Glycosylate Extraction and Liposomal Analysis
The lipid extraction procedure was as described by Caladara et al. [13]. The samples were extracted with 70% ethanol, and the extraction was repeated twice.

## Discussion
This is an interesting case because we found that the expression of Tippitus increased in the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant, but decreased in the <U+0394>GPD2 mutan. This could indicate that Tippitus regulates the levels of the regulator, but does not regulate melanin production or sulphur stress response. Our data showed that the expression of Tippitus increased in the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant but decreased in the <U+0394>GPD2 mutant. The change in the expression of Tippitus was also observed in other filamentous fungi [20, 22]. The function of Tippitus in filamentous fungi is not clear, but it could be that Tippitus is a regulator of stress response genes in the filamentous fungi.

Tippitus is also a regulator of stress response genes in the filamentous fungi. For example, the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant displays a lower sensitivity to thermal stress than the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant. This could be because the GPD1 is a structural homodimer with one bond in the pentose phosphate residue on the ATP-binding pocket. The homodimer also has a second bond in the pentose phosphate residue. In addition, the pentose phosphate residue can be the substrate for other enzymes, such as sulphur and sodium hydroxide-reductase (SDRC) [24, 25]. In A. fumigatus, Tippitus is required for the filamentous growth, conidiation, and sporulation of Aspergillus [26]. The strain used in our study was also able to form colonies on H_2S media, but the phenotype of the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant was not as suitable as the <U+0394>GPD2 mutant. However, the <U+0394>GPD1 mutant produced as many colonies as the <U+0394>GPD2 mutant. This result indicated that the GPD1 is involved in the regulation of filamentation in A. fumigatus.

The <U+0394>GPD1 mutant was also able to form hyphae. In A. fumigatus, the presence of pseudohyphae was not associated with the presence of the GPD1.
