## Abstract
Many yeast strains have internalized the mitochondria of mammalian cells, which are the primary source of energy for generating the critical processes of growth and reproduction. Mitochondrial energy has been a crucial component of evolution and genetic change in many organisms. Mitochondrial energy has been involved in a variety of independent processes since the first step of the evolution of eukaryotes. Mitochondrial energy has been closely related to many processes that have been central to speciation, chromosome expansion and speciation during the last two super kingdoms of eukaryotes. The structure of mitochondrial genomes has been involved in many independent genes and processes of mitochondrial energy generation and metabolism. The recent discovery of mitochondria in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans provides a unique perspective for understanding the roles of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of this fungal disease. Cryptococcus is a yeast that causes meningoencephalitis, and studies of the functional and metabolic changes in mitochondria of this strain have been reported to reveal mitochondrial energy production as an important process. In this review, we summarize the data on mitochondrial metabolism in the C. neoformans strain <U+0394>hog1, which is also responsible for the pathogenicity of this strain. This strain is also the first to produce many types of small nucleolar superoxide dismutase, which is known to have important functions in the energy metabolism of cells.


## Introduction
Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide, causing over two million annual losses worldwide, especially in Asia, including India. [1] In China, it is the most important rice-infested disease and rice blast disease is responsible for more than half a million deaths annually. In recent years, there has been an increased attention to control rice diseases because of the development of nanotechnology that is used in the manufacturing and distribution of rice-juice and other products. [2] However, many challenges remain with the current control methods and the potential toxicity of the available drugs. The development of novel and effective strategies against rice blast is therefore urgently needed.

Nanotechnology has emerged as an important area of research in recent years in the fields of DNA-based biological control, immunology, and bioengineering. [3] For example, the genetic transformation of T. gondii and T. sorbitii has become a promising strategy for biological control and therapy against rice diseases. [4] The use of tetracycline in the control of rice blast, resulting in a decline in rice yield, has been extensively studied. However, its indiscriminate use has led to serious problems that are difficult to overcome, such as high levels of resistance, low effectiveness, and genetic instability of the natural tetracycline-based drugs. [5], [6] Therefore, novel, less-potent, and safer alternatives have been urgently needed for the control of rice diseases.

With the development of DNA-based biological control, several new and innovative strategies have been developed.


## Methods
All animal procedures were performed according to the regulations and guidelines of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentatio. The animal care was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital of São Paulo São Paulo de Conservação Animal Experimentation. Two group and two group-overlap (group 1: Infected mice, group 2: Untreated mice) mice were used in all the experiments. The animals were monitored daily for signs and symptoms of disease and sacrificed at the end of the study. The kidneys were removed at the end of the study, and the organs were weighed and homogenized in 1 mL of sterile PBS. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min and the pellet was suspended in a 1 mL of sterile PBS. The homogenate was mixed with equal volumes of sterile PBS and kept at -20°C for 10 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was suspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was suspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS and stored at -20°C for use in a sandwich ELISA assay.

Determination of the C. albicans virulence factors
The number of CFU and survival were evaluated by counting the number of CFU on the lung surface after infection of the control group and the infection group plus the group with the parasite. The experiment was performed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the University of São Paulo São Paulo de Conservação Animal Experimentation (HELAPEA/1/2016). The mice were treated with either 1 mL of sterile PBS or 1 mL of sterile PBS in a volume of 100 µL. The number of CFU was determined by plating the lungs of the mice on the basis of the number of CFU per gram of blood. The experiment was performed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration.


## Results

The antifungal drug susceptibilities of different fecal samples were examined using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the early stages of colonizatio. We observed a reduction in the MIC_50, MIC_90, MIC_90, MIC_90, and MIC_90 for C. albicans and C. glabrata strains (Table 1). We also observed a reduction in the MIC_50, MIC_90, MIC_90, and MIC_90 for C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae strains (Table 1). A decrease in the MIC_90, MIC_90, and MIC_90 for C. krusei and C. albicans strains was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation. A decrease in the MIC_90 for C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae strains was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation. A decrease in the MIC_90 for C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation. A decrease in the MIC_90 for C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation. A decrease in the MIC_90 for C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation. A decrease in the MIC_90 for C. albicans was observed at the end of the first 8 h of incubation.

## Discussion
In our study, we used a large pool of clinical and immunological samples to evaluate the impact of fungal antigens on the development of HIV-1-associated IRIS. We found that the most common fungal infections associated with IRIS are C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Most of these fungi are pathogenic to humans and may be considered opportunistic infections, although the latter species are less virulent and more resistant to antifungal therapy [6]. C.
