## Abstract
Microbial communities have important ecological and economic significance in the edible and medicinal sectors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different levels of activity of different water activities (SAR) in the microbial community in the two soil samples.


## Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous molecule, a by-product of chemical reactions, which accumulates in the cells of mammals, including neurons, blood, and wound healing cells of the vertebrates. NO levels range from 0-6 mg/L in healthy human brain tissues, to 20-30 mg/L in pathological conditions and to 30-70 mg/L in normal tissues. NO is a potent inhibitor of the sphingolipid metabolism and a potent inducer of the growth factor a-factor in human peripheral blood. NO is also a potent inhibitor of the CXCL1/type B-1-induced cytokine pathway, promoting the expression of genes encoding genes for those required for cell-mediated immune responses.

Neuroimmune cells secrete NO, which in turn activates their cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and MAPK pathways, leading to the release of various types of extracellular, intracellular, and soluble products (Tiroshima et al., 2010). These products are then released into the extracellular environment, where they mediate immune cell surveillance (Sanglard, 2003; Su and Hung, 2009; Samuels et al.


## Methods
Microorganisms
A total of 130 Cryptococcus sp. from 11 isolates were used in this study. Cryptococcus spp. were used in this study as previously described [25]. The MIC values were determined with a 5% (w/v) cell-inoculum-tube culture. For susceptibility testing, Cryptococcus spp. were grown in a 1.5 L Erlenmeyer flask at 37°C for 24 h in 200 mL of Luria-Bertani broth (LB) medium. The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH.

The MIC of the amphotericin B (0.5 µg/mL), posaconazole (0.25 µg/mL), and itraconazole (0.125 µg/mL) was determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 document [26]. The P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Mantel-Cox method as implemented in the M27-A3 standard operating procedures for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (SOPO, version 6.0, http://www.medcomp.com/symptoms/opole/index.html) [27].

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay
Y2H was performed as previously described [28]. A single-hybrid system consisting of two dsRed oligonucleotides targeting the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of C. neoformans var. grubii CBS 620.81 (identified as VGIIa, VGIIIb, VGIIc, VGIIe, VGIIf, VGIIg, VGIIh, VGIIi, VGIIj, VGIIk, VGIIl, VGIIm, VGIIn, VGIIo, VGIIq, VGIIr, VGIIs, VGIIt, VGIIu, VGIIv, VGIIw, VGIIx, VGIIy, VGIIy, VGIIz, and VGIIy, respectively, were used for the Y2H assay. The dsRed and dsRed^+ dsRed^- were hybridized with 1 µg of pGBKT7-3.2(r,g)-D-tagged yeast recombinant plasmids (Promega, USA).


## Results
neoformans va. grubii (p = 0.0418, log_10 CFU/ml). Antifungal activity was also detected in the C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0319) strain (Table 1).

The MICs of fluconazole were higher for both strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0376) than for the two strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0319) (Table 1). The MICs of amphotericin B for both strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were higher than that of fluconazole (Table 1).

In addition, the MICs of amphotericin B for the strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were higher than those of the strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (Table 1). MICs of fluconazole were higher for the strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0006) than for the strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0304) (Table 1).

The MICs of fluconazole against all Cryptococcus strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were higher than those of the strains of C. neoformans var. grubii (p = 0.0532) (Table 1).

We also examined the susceptibilities of the CAP1-M and CAP2-M strains to fluconazole. The CAP1-M and CAP2-M strains showed greater susceptibility to fluconazole than the CAP1-M and CAP2-M strains (p < 0.0001, log_10 CFU/ml, Table 1). The CAP1-M and CAP2-M strains showed greater susceptibility than the CAP1-M and CAP2-M strains (p < 0.0001, log_10 CFU/ml, Table 1).

We also performed a series of assays to assess the MICs of fluconazole against the Cryptococcus strains of C. neoformans var. grubii.
