## Abstract
A novel formulation of a-neochromatin containing (nuN)3-en/nuN7-en/gstatin was developed and characterized. The anti-Aspergillus effect of nuN7-en/nuN6-en/gstatin was examined by monitoring of the elimination of the intracellular fungal spores and the enhancement of the anti-fungal activity of the anti-fungal peptide. The anti-fungal activity of the peptide was measured by measuring the anti-CD20 and anti-CD20a activities of the peptide. The anti-fungal activity of nuN6 was quantified by measuring the decrease of CD20 and CD20a in fungal cells under treatment with the peptide.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by members of the genus Cryptococcus. This pathogen is known to cause more than 400,000 deaths every year worldwide, which is more than any other organism. It has emerged as a serious public health problem in recent years, because the available drugs and diagnostic tests are time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to administer. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant strains is a major concern. Currently, there are no well-defined treatment options against cryptococcosis, and cryptococcal infections are often reported with high mortality rates.

In a recent study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of certain antifungal agents against the systemic pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, in an attempt to develop a new strategy for treatment of cryptococcosis. The therapeutic potential of several antifungal agents is limited, and therapeutic failure rates are generally higher than those of bacterial or viral infections. Moreover, most antifungal agents are relatively expensive and toxic, and the use of immunosuppressive agents and prolonged treatments have led to drug resistance. Moreover, the emergence of drug-resistant strains is associated with high costs for the clinicians involved. Thus, the search for new and safer drugs is a challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.

The pharmacological activity of natural products has increased significantly in recent years. Among them, the catechol, a chemical derivative of 1,8-phenanthroline-2,3-dianproobenzene (1,8-PEC), was first reported in 1955 [1]. The chemical name of the chemical compound is ENABLED, but some authors have used the abbreviation “Enoombez” for the organism. The catechol is an organic compound with an odiferous di-phenyl moiety.


## Methods
Dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection were treated according to standard procedures and humanely euthanized after neutropenic antifungal therap. In brief, sterile PBS was added to the dog and blood was collected and stored at -20 °C.

In the present study, a control dog with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection was used to assess the survival rate of P. jirovecii-infected animals. The animals were provided with sterile food and water and were allowed to recover at room temperature for 6 h before euthanasia. The control dog was humanely euthanized after treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) and lidocaine (200 mg/kg). The animals were kept in individually ventilated cages (IVC) with a polyethylene bag for 24 h before being humanely euthanized. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. The animals were monitored daily, weighed, and euthanized with carbon dioxide in order to assess their survival.

Data Collection and Analysis
All animal experiments were performed under UK Home Office project license PPL 70/4135 and were approved by the Home Office Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) of the University of Manchester. The animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations.

In addition to the animal experiments, all experiments were performed with animals aged between 6 to 8 weeks at the University of Manchester Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, no. 123, p. 2-6, http://www.atw.int/entreaty/Treaty/Treaties/Html/123.htm). All animal experiments were approved by the University of Manchester Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and were performed under UK Home Office project license PPL 70/4135 and were performed under UK Home Office project license PPL 70/4222.

Animals were housed in a standard environment with a temperature of -20 °C, a relative humidity of 70-85%, and a maximum of 60% relative humidity.


## Results
isolates was determined by killing of the same dog with a 2 × 10^6 CFU of the yeast strai. To determine if the strains were capable of killing dogs at a high level, we first inoculated the dogs with the same number of CFU of each of the different Malassezia spp. strains. The results showed that the number of CFU was significantly lower in the Malassezia spp. isolates compared to the other Malassezia spp. strains. As shown in Figure 1, the number of CFU was significantly higher in the Malassezia spp. isolates than the other Malassezia spp. strains. These results indicate that the Malassezia spp. are able to cause dog infection in a low concentration, although some dogs may not survive, or even die.

Molecular characterization of the virulence factors of Malassezia spp. in dogs
To determine whether the Malassezia spp. strains are able to cause dog disease, we tested the virulence of these strains in dogs. We first determined the number of CFU of each strain in each dog. We found that the Malassezia spp. strains were able to cause fatal dog bite in dogs. The number of CFU of each strain was significantly higher than the other Malassezia spp. strains in the same dog, with the exception of Malassezia sp. R265. The number of CFU of each Malassezia sp. strains was significantly higher than the other Malassezia sp. strains, with the exception of Malassezia sp. R265. The number of CFU of Malassezia sp. R265 was significantly higher than the other Malassezia sp. strains, with the exception of Malassezia sp. R265. The number of CFU of Malassezia sp. R265 was significantly higher than the other Malassezia sp. strains, with the exception of Malassezia sp. R265. The number of CFU of Malassezia sp. R265 was significantly higher than the other Malassezia sp. strains, with the exception of Malassezia sp. R265. The number of CFU of Malassezia sp. R265 was significantly higher than the other Malassezia sp.


## Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the ability of Malassezia sp. to cause pulmonary infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. The studies reported in this paper were conducted in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection and they demonstrated that Malassezia spp. can cause pulmonary infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. We believe that the results of our study and other reports should be considered as a reference for further studies of Malassezia spp. infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.

The ability of Malassezia spp. to cause infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is well established. We observed that dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection were less likely to develop lung lesions. This may be related to the increased likelihood of invasive infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.

Malassezia spp. is common in humans. In our study, we observed a significant reduction in the severity of pulmonary infection in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. This may be related to the fact that dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection tend to be more active in their immune system. This may be related to the fact that dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection are more susceptible to infection by other opportunistic bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. [30].

Meningitis can present as an allergic muffle or muffle muffle, and can present with cough and wheezing. The chest pain and dyspnea may be seen as an allergic muffle muffle. The lack of chest pain may be related to the lack of a local inflammatory response. The dogs in our study were mainly female, but we also found that females were more likely to be involved in the health care system, and dogs in this study were less likely to be neutered.

The dogs in our study were found to be more likely to have a more severe disease, which may be related to the severity of lung lesions in dogs with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.
