## Abstract
Thymetidis brasiliensis is a well-known fungal pathogen of plants, including leaves and fruits. Thymus is the major component of the winter leaves microbiome associated with pathogens, including Thymus vulgaris, Thymus vulgaris, and many fungal pathogens. Several Thymus species have been reported as possible human pathogens, some of which have been isolated in the setting of climate changes or diseases. Here we show that the Thymus community of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC) is characterized by a unique and diverse Thymus community, that differs from other tropical regions by a number of taxa. Furthermore, the Thymus community of Vancouver Island, Canada, is characterized by the collection of new species in the genus, Cladoriella, which are described as members of the new family Cystoylus, and many other species that have not previously been assigned to genera in Thymus. Additionally, the morphology of Thymus species in their updated genomes is described and the results of genetic analysis of their genome will be important for improving the taxonomy and identification of Thymus species. We also report a large number of new species, that have not previously been assigned to genera in Thymus, that have not yet reached in the authors, as they underwent revision and further characterization and phylogenetic analyses.


## Introduction
The primary goal of this study was to determine the effect of essential oils and their lipid derivatives on C. neoformans viability and growth. The study also attempted to characterize the effect of the essential oils and their lipid derivatives on C. neoformans growth and morphogenesis. Therefore, the authors defined the cells that were important for cryptococcal viability and the identification of the cell cycle components. They also quantified the effect of the lipid formulations of the essential oils on the growth and morphogenesis of the yeast cells. In addition, the authors identified that the C. neoformans cytochrome P450-dependent signal transduction is crucial for the yeast cell cycle. Finally, the authors identified that C. neoformans needs to reprogram its metabolism to produce more lipid metabolites for growth and survival.


## Methods
It is considered a likely strategy to identify novel metabolic and drug resistance genes that could potentially be exploited for the discovery of new drug resistance genes in Cryptococcus neoforman. This approach is based on the observation that the human ileum has diverse ecological and economic niches, which can be exploited for drug discovery, and has been used extensively for studying the virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans [7]. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it uses a multiplicity of infection (MOI) approach to identify drug resistance genes that could potentially be exploited for drug discovery.

2.2. Antimicrobial Activity Assays
This approach has been used to identify novel antimicrobial resistance genes in Cryptococcus neoformans and has been applied to test the effect of different antibiotics on the growth of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C. glabrata [4, 8, 14, 19]. The activity of a single antibiotic was compared to the activity of four different antibiotics to determine the differences in their inhibitory activities of different combinations [4, 15, 20]. The inhibition of the growth of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, and C. albicans was determined by inoculating 10 µl of the fungus on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates and incubating at 30 °C. The growth of the yeast was monitored for 6 days and the diameter of the zone of inhibition was calculated.

2.3. Immunomodulation of Cryptococcus neoformans by Immunosorbent Cell Line
The immunomodulation of Cryptococcus neoformans by the polyclonal antibody was performed by incubation of a cell line derived from the brain of a patient with cryptococcosis and modified by differentiation of the cells using a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human C. albicans (Genotype 1a; N315L1). In brief, the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium at 37 °C for 24 h and were then treated with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the cells were infected with C. neoformans by streaking the adherent cell suspension on SDA plates. For intracellular co-incubation, the cells were co-incubated with C.


## Results
The biochemical data of the ECM assay (Figure 5) indicate that the ECM assay detects the phagolysosomal membrane potential of the fungus, which is important for fungal pathogenicit. This result provides an explanation for the low number of viable Cryptococcus species in the bloodstream of the infants.

To evaluate the importance of the ECM assay for cryptococcal pathogenicity, we tested the ECM assay in mice. In this study, we used a P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody that specifically recognizes the ECM pathway, which is known to be involved in cryptococcal pathogenicity [30]. As expected, the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody did not detect cryptococcal pathogenicity in the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-expressing strain (Figure 6A). To further test the significance of the ECM assay in cryptococcal pathogenicity, we also tested the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody in human lung (Figure 6B). In this assay, we found that the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody failed to detect cryptococcal pathogenicity in the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-expressing strain (Figure 6B).

The ECM assay detects the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody in the lung
The role of the ECM assay in cryptococcal pathogenicity remains unclear. Previous studies have indicated that the P _2-conjugated BCG-8 antibody can detect cryptococcal pathogenicity in humans, but the exact role of the ECM assay in cryptococcal pathogenicity remains unclear. To test the significance of the ECM assay in Cryptococcus pathogenicity, we used a P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody (p _2-conjugated) that recognizes the ECM pathway. As shown in Figure 7A, the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-specific antibody failed to detect cryptococcal pathogenicity in the P _2-conjugated BCG-8-expressing strain.


## Discussion

It has been reported that the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii/Cryptococcus ciferrii has a metabolic stability of 50% and a glycolytic rate of 20% (2. However, in this study, we also observed that the fungal isolate Cryptococcus ciferrii (VGIIa) has a metabolic stability of 50% and a glycolytic rate of 60% (2). In addition, the fungal strain Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus ciferrii (VGIIb) has a metabolic stability of 50% and a glycolytic rate of 60% (2). However, the strains Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus ciferrii/VGIIb (VGIIa and VGIIb) and Cryptococcus ciferrii/VGIIb (VGIIc) have metabolic stability of 50% and a glycolytic rate of 60% (2). Therefore, we found that the fungal strain Cryptococcus ciferrii (VGIIb) is a normal commensal in human body and that the fungus is a pathogen that can cause diseases in healthy people. Moreover, the results obtained in this study revealed that the fungal strain Cryptococcus ciferrii (VGIIb) is a pathogen that can cause diseases in humans.
