## Introduction
Macropinocytosis is a type of cell-mediated, intracellular, intracellular, and extracellular endocytosis. It has been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of human macrophage and tumor cells (1). Macrophages are generally classified into two types, phagocytic and non-phagocytic (2, 3). Phagocytic cells are monocytes with a membrane-bound phenotype characterized by the production of cytokines, granules and T-cell-wall, as well as the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines (4, 5). Non-phagocytic macrophages are cell-bound and can differentiate into macrophages (6). Non-phagocytic macrophages are associated with macrophage-like structures, such as the myeloid thymus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, and are divided into two subtypes, phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells (7). The type of macrophage determines the organ-specific functions of macrophages. The type of macrophage can be induced in the presence of a given type of stimuli, such as cytokines, chemokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) molecules, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand (8). A threshold level of cytokine production is thought to be crucial for macrophage phagocytosis (9).

The identification of macrophage receptors has been a subject of interest as they are found in many tissues, including the CNS, skin, bone, joint, joints, and uterus (10). Macrophage receptor family members are divided into at least 13 subfamilies, and each subfamily has been shown to be expressed in different organs. Macrophage receptor subfamily members include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) (11) and C-to-T cell receptor (CTTCR) (12), as well as CD36 and CD163 molecules. In addition, macrophage receptor subfamily members are expressed in different tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and skin (13, 14).


## Methods
. Methods
The minimum standard for the evaluation of Pneumocystis Pneumonia in HIV infected patients is described in detail in our previous study (Deshwad et al., 2018). We used a clinically appropriate reference Pneumocystis pneumonia standard (NINCO) on the basis of clinical symptoms and clinical features in HIV infected patients at the Central Hospital of Pune, India. Atypical presentation of Pneumocystis Pneumonia was defined as a headache, fever, or body temperature >38.5°C, with/without a history of fungal infections (invasive pneumococcal infection). The patients were treated according to standard clinical practices. They were categorised into five main groups (i.e., intermediate, advanced, or unknown) according to the definition of the AIDS group and the others according to the criteria described in the previous study (Deshwad et al., 2018).

2.3. Procedures
The CSF was performed as per the standard of the Institute of Medical Mycology (IMMY) and Diagnostic Laboratory of Mulago Hospital, Pune, India. The CSF was examined in triplicate for the study. The samples of CSF were sent to the laboratory for diagnosis of the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia. The CSF samples were included in the study if they had: (i) presence of positive CSF culture and/or CSF India ink stain on CSF; (ii) CSF white blood cell count >90, and/or (iii) CSF cell count =90 on CSF.

2.4. Phase-Out Study
The first phase-out study was conducted in 2018. The total cost of the study was Rs. 50,000 (approximately US$25,000) and the total time required to complete the study was less than two weeks. The study was conducted in a separate hospital and we had not yet enrolled patients.


## Results
In this study, 8 patients with disseminated candidiasis were enrolled. The mean age was 40.8 ± 16.3 years (range, 9-75 years). Two patients had mild to moderate disseminated candidiasis. One patient had positive CSF cultures in the liver. The other patient had a CSF culture in the kidney. Both patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of the candidiasis diagnosis. The study was conducted with the reference CSF culture from a patient with septic shock in the setting of a high-risk patient with positive culture of PCM. There was a strong association between the clinical and CSF culture results of the CSF cultures and the candidiasis diagnosis.

Clinical Characteristics of the Patients
The clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The majority of patients had low CD4 counts, mean CD4 counts of 104.4 ± 62.6 cells/µl, and median CD4 count of 744.2 ± 6.3 cells/µl (range, 30-1256 cells/µl).

Laboratory Tests
All patients had elevated serum creatinine at enrollment. Aspergillus was positive in the blood cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid was positive in the CSF cultures. In the CSF culture, the neutrophil count was negative in both of the cases. The CSF glucose level was in the normal range (0.69 ± 0.24 mmol/L).

Biologic Test
A positive CSF culture was a positive CSF culture in 7 patients.


## Discussion
However, voriconazole is not currently available in Uganda due to the lack of data and are not widely available in most parts of the worl. In addition to voriconazole, the existing standard of care for patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia is fluconazole, which is now available in Uganda and Europe, with its duration varying from 2 to 8 weeks. However, the current standard of care for patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia is voriconazole. However, voriconazole is not currently available in Uganda due to limited available data and is not widely available in most parts of the world.

There are several factors that lead to the development of pneumocystis pneumonia. As pneumocystis pneumonia is a rare disease, many factors can contribute to the development of this infection. It is a rare condition, and in many cases, it may be acquired as a result of a traumatic event or an allergic reaction. We were able to detect Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, and we detected Pneumocystis pneumonia in more than half of our patients. The majority of patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia had a history of travel history. However, half of our patients had no travel history. We were able to detect Pneumocystis pneumonia in many patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, and most patients were immunocompromised. We were able to detect Pneumocystis pneumonia in some patients, and we detected Pneumocystis pneumonia in many patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. We were able to detect Pneumocystis pneumonia in a majority of patients.

In addition to Pneumocystis pneumonia, other infections, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can also be detected in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. The frequency of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia is about 2-3% (9).
