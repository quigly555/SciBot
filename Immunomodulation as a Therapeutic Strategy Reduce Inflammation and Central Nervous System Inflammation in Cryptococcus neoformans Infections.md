## Abstract
This study compared the effects of commercial isocyanide (IC) benzophenones IC and IC benzophenones (IC) on two-phase growth of Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii) by the use of three different growth media (dilution media = 500 µg/mL, diameters 0.8-1.0 µm) in vitro and three different growth media (dilution media = 5 µg/mL, diameters 0.5-1.0 µm) in three different growth stages (mature and necrotrophic growth). It was shown that the growth of C. gattii was inhibited by IC benzophenones IC and inhibited by IC IC benzophenones (IC) when compared to the stages investigated. IC benzophenones inhibited the growth of C. gattii when grown in the medium supplemented with 2,3-ß-d-glucan, as well as by the medium supplemented with nystatin, and when compared to the stages investigated. When growth was blocked by IC benzophenones treated with these growth media, the growth rate of C.


## Introduction
(.A. Honma et al., 2014; P.A. Honma, 2015)

Treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans infection
The treatment of cryptococcal meningitis should be initiated early. Clinically active agents with high mortality should be administered immediately. The initial phase should last at least 4-6 weeks and should be administered for at least 6 weeks. Clinical response should be monitored regularly.

Cryptococcal meningitis should be treated according to the published guidelines:

The recommended treatment is supportive care:

Immunomodulation using flucytosine and IFN-<U+03B3> (tacrolimus) followed by amphotericin B

The course of cryptococcal meningitis should be monitored:

The frequency of resistance to flucytosine (100%) should be determined. If the frequency is high, treatment should be started immediately. Patients who have low resistance to flucytosine can be treated with fluconazole or amphotericin B. Flucytosine should not be used in patients with low levels of resistance to flucytosine. Patients who have low levels of flucytosine can be treated with fluconazole. Patients who are resistant to flucytosine can be treated with fluconazole. This approach is best for patients with flucytosine resistant to flucytosine. The strategy of treatment for flucytosine resistant patients should be determined after initiation of empirical antifungal therapy.

The treatment for cryptococcal meningitis should be initiated at a hospital:

The ICU should conduct a culture of the cryptococcal antigen. The cryptococcal antigen should be obtained from a competent, licensed laboratory. The patient should be treated in a timely manner. The antifungal agent should be administered as a plasma infusion after amphotericin B is refolded.

Cryptococcal meningitis should be treated according to the published guidelines:

The guidelines recommend that the initial treatment is to be amphotericin B, followed by 5-7 days of maintenance therapy with 5 mg/kg of flucytosine and then 7 days with fluconazole.


## Methods
neoformans strains used in this study were obtained from the ATCC (Table 1. Cryptococcus neoformans strains were cultured in liquid Sabouraud's medium at 30°C for 18-24 h and passaged every 6-8 weeks to ensure stable growth. Cryptococcus strains were cultured at 30°C for 2 days and passaged every 6-8 weeks. The Cryptococcus strains were tested by colony forming unit (CFU) counting as previously described [23]. Briefly, the cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 cells/mL and 100 µL of the suspension was added to 10-mL RPMI-1640 media. The media was then incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The cell suspension was then diluted to 0.5 McFarland standards and plated on RPMI-1640 agar plates. The colonies were counted after incubation for 3 days. The CFU counts were calculated as previously described [22]. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Adhesion and virulence assays
To determine the adhesion ability of C. neoformans strains to C. neoformans, we used in vitro assays to measure the number of C. neoformans cells that adhere to the surface of the adherent cells. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to an area of 1 × 10^7 cells/mL. C. neoformans strains were cultured at 30°C for 48 h. A total of 100 µL of RPMI-1640 media was added to each well and then the plate was incubated at 37°C for 90 min. Then, the adherent cells were removed, and the medium containing C. neoformans was aspirated by centrifugation at 5000× g for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended in PBS, and the number of C. neoformans cells in the supernatant was counted.

To determine the virulence of C. neoformans strains to C. neoformans, we used a mouse model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. The mice were infected with C. neoformans at the final concentration of 10^6 cells/mL. The inoculum was prepared by growing C. neoformans in a yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 30°C for 24 h.


## Results
Therefore, we next attempted to establish a therapeutic strategy that reduced inflammation and peripheral Nervous System Inflammation in C. This strategy relies on the application of a combination of immunosuppressive drugs with rapid treatment to achieve an early therapeutic peak, followed by a thorough healing of the inflammatory inflammasome.

An initial approach is to first develop a well-established anti-inflammatory drug, empiric adjunctive or combined with a combination of immunosuppressive drugs, for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis (currently considered a separate issue). The CNS-derived adjunctive regimen is shown in Fig 1A. The combined regimen is monotherapy with micafungin or gentamicin and is administrated intramuscularly and with a dose-dependent route of administration, i.e., orally, through the nasopharynx or into the bloodstream. The intravenous route of administration is the intravenous route, i.e., through the tracheal route or into the bloodstream. The intravenous route of administration is micafungin or gentamicin with a micafungin MIC of 1.25 µg/ml. The initial therapy is a combination of empiric adjunctive or combined with a combination of immunosuppressive drugs or immunosuppressive agents, i.e., empiric antifungal agents (if current) or corticosteroid agents (if current).

## Discussion
However, previous studies have revealed that human patients infected with Cryptococcus neoformans infection are highly immunocompromised, with higher mortality rates, and high mortality rates are reported among immunocompromised patients [14. In addition, some patients are also in advanced immunocompromised states, and this could be due to their opportunistic infections and/or to their high HIV disease burden [15]. As a result, the therapeutic strategy of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in immunocompetent hosts could be a relatively poor one.

The ability to restore TNF-a levels to the host is critical for protection against Cryptococcus neoformans infection [16]. In this study, the study showed that immunocompetent patients with cryptococcal infection who are also immunocompromised were significantly more susceptible to cryptococcal infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen. In this study, the results showed that the immunocompetent patients in this study were significantly more susceptible to cryptococcal infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen.

In this study, the immune system of immunocompetent patients in this study showed a protective role of TNF-a in Cryptococcus neoformans infection. However, immunocompromised patients were significantly more susceptible to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen.

We further demonstrated that immunocompromised patients were more susceptible to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen.

In this study, the immunocompromised patients in this study were significantly more susceptible to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen.

In addition, the immunocompromised patients in this study were significantly more susceptible to Cryptococcus neoformans infection. This could be due to the protective role of TNF-a in the pathogen.

In this study, the immunocompromised patients in this study were significantly more susceptible to Cryptococcus neoformans infection.
