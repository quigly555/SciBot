## Abstract

. cinerea, A. bacillis, A. fusiformis, A. nordikainis, A. ramosoides, and A. terreus, and the family Cystofilaceae is introduced to accommodate the majority of these species. The family Meloidaceae is characterised by ascospores, inflated asci, inflated asphodel, and fusiform as well as cylindrical, transversely-septate ascospores with a terminal pedipalidia. Phylogenetic relationships of the three genera were inferred from maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses.

Seven genera, representing the entire genera in the fungal kingdom, are recognised. The genera Criptonectria, Cryptophorales, Phaeosphaeria, and Phaeosphaeria are introduced to accommodate the remaining genera in the phylum Parphyriales, while Tetracladium, Pyrenochaenolocha, Leptophyllum, Mucoromycetes, Phlebia, Phlebi, Rhizosphaeromyces, and Rhizosphaeromyces are combined in a single genus. Additionally, the genera Malus, Tetracladium, Rhizosphaeriobolus, and Tetracladium and Rhizosphaeria are shown to be polyphyletic, with Tetracladium gaining overall control over the genera.

The recent introductions of seven new genera including Malus, Tetracladium, Rhizosphaeromyces, Mucoromycetes, and Rhizosphaeromyces provide a solid foundation for the future development of new strategies for the management of fungal plant diseases. Furthermore, the introduction of seven new species in three new genera adds to the diversity in the phylum Parphyriales. Finally, the combination of new combinations, including Malus, Tetracladium, Rhizosphaeromyces, and M.


## Introduction
The number of invasive fungal infections and the antifungal drug resistance is on the rise [1]. Antifungal drug resistance, particularly the azoles, is a major problem that has led to significant concern over the past two decades [2]. Azoles are a group of structurally different, structurally diverse compounds, which are produced by various species of fungal cells, including Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium [3]. Azole drugs target the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme Erg11 or, to a lesser extent, the cytochrome P450 enzyme Erg3, which leads to azole drug resistance in Candida and Fusarium species [4].

The antifungal azoles are commonly used in the management of invasive fungal infections and are generally recommended as the first-line treatment in the clinical setting, with few exceptions [5]. However, treatment of fungal infections is challenging due to the limited number of antifungal agents currently available. A variety of antifungal agents such as polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins are available for the treatment of superficial fungal infections, and these agents are the most commonly used antifungals in the clinic [6].


## Methods
The invasive growth of the spore was determined by the staining of the spore, and spore staining was conducted as described by (Crocardi et a., 2001). Infection was measured by counting the number of spores in a 30-mL conical tube (100 µL) using a hemacytometer. Inoculated spore suspension was filtered through 0.22 µm sterile gauze, and the spore concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 spores ml^-1 using the spore suspension in water. We classified spore infection as the following: (1) non-phagocytosed spore; (2) phagocytosed spore; and (3) phagocytosed spore. In order to assess the effects of the different phagocytosis variables, we compared the survival rates of the spore-infected and the spore-free control groups. For the phagocytosis, the phagocytosis index is the ratio of the phagocytosis rate in the spore-infected and control groups, and the phagocytosis index is the ratio of the phagocytosis rate in the spore-free control group.


## Results
In this study, we have isolated spores of different genera from the plant material of the host plan.

According to the above results, the inoculation of the negative control with the spores of the different genera showed good pathogenicity. However, the inoculation with the positive control with the spores of the different genera resulted in serious disease symptoms in all the infected plants.

The difference in the disease severity between the positive control and the negative control is very significant.

Possible Secondary Susceptibility of the Sporotconciniaceae
To explore possible role of the spores of the different genera in the host plant pathogenicity, the possible role of the spores of the different genera in the pathogenicity was investigated.

Possible Secondary Susceptibility of the Sporotconciniaceae
Infection with P. coccinea has been reported to cause disease in at least one insect [27,28,29,30,31]. In this study, the effects of spores of different genera were studied in the host plants.

The spore of P. coccinea was found to be the most resistant to the symptoms of P. coccinea, but it was not found to be the most resistant to the effects of the spores of P. coccinea and to the effects of the spores of P. mignonii. However, the symptoms of P. mignonii were less severe in the infected plants than in the control plants. In addition, the fungal growth was less affected by spores of different genera than the control plants.

The fungal growth was not affected by spores of the different genera. However, the fungal growth was much less affected by spores of the spores of P. coccinea.

Possible Secondary Susceptibility of the Sporotconciniaceae
The effects of spores of different genera on the pathogenicity of P. coccinea were studied in the host plants.

The spores of the different genera of the Sporotconciniaceae were found to be less susceptible to the effects of the spores of P. coccinea. However, the effect of spores of the different genera on the pathogenicity of P.
