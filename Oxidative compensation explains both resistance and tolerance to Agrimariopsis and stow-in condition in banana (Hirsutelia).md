## Abstract
The centromere Y p46 is a repetitive, manganese-rich DNA molecule with a unique C-terminal centromere that shares homology with Schizosaccharomyces pombe-encoded proteins. In the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the C-terminal portion of the Y p46 is essential for nutrient acquisition in the absence of centromere, a key step in the pathogenicity-related processes during budding. The availability of alternative centromere for C. albicans in the mammalian host opens the possibility of developing novel strategies for antifungal therapy. In this study, we show that a unique C-terminal centromere is required for growth, differentiation, virulence, and morphological switching in C. albicans.

Ypsilon-cadherin-rich centromere containing centromeric proteins (Centromeres), consists of a paralogous core and a non-paralogous core. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the paralogous core is absent in Ypsilon-cadherin-rich centromere. Instead, the centromere is associated with a unique, with two septate cores fused. Deletion of the septate centromere in a strain for C. albicans presented similar phenotypes as those of the septate centromere of C. krusei.


## Introduction
Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi, is one of the most important diseases in the tropics [1]. It is caused by the brown-rot fungus, T. cruzi, which infects and ensnares eggs of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. The disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of tsetse flies, which become fixed in the infected host’s skin and invade the insect's blood vessels. The infected eggs then develop into true bites, which are discharged into the blood stream. The bite of the tsetse fly larva results in a broad range of symptoms, including malaise, shortness of breath, arthralgia, chills, and back pain, which are often asymptomatic. The infection of the germania is often asymptomatic, and it has a very low incidence. The bite of the tsetse fly then reverts to the germania, which is rapidly colonized by the germanic mosquito, meridian mosquito, and the blood-feeding mosquito. The disease is not found in bats, but in at least one bat found an infection in bat venoms, and in this case the infection was confirmed by histopathology [2,3].

The economic burden caused by Chagas disease is estimated to be $6.7 billion, with an estimated recovery in the range of $2 billion and up to $5 billion per year in the United States [4]. In addition, the disease has been reported in 33 countries, including Mexico, Colombia, United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy [4,5].


## Methods
The difference between the Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains can be seen in the difference in the growth of the banana leaves under the stow-in conditio.

2.3. In Vitro Effect of The Stow-in Condition
The in vitro effect of the stow-in treatment on the banana leaves is shown in Fig 2. The stow-in treatment was used for the isolates of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains.

The colony morphology of the isolates of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains was determined by two-point microscopy. The colony morphology of the strains was also evaluated on the control glass slide. The colony morphology of the isolates of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains was evaluated on the glass slide.

2.4. In Vitro Effect of The Stow-in Condition
The in vitro effect of the stow-in condition on the banana leaves is shown in Fig 3. The stow-in treatment was used for the isolates of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains.

The concentration of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were determined by the method of Aumann et al. (2010). The inocula of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl) and the suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 colony forming units (CFU/mL). The inoculum of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl). The inoculum of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. The inoculum of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL.

2.5. In Vitro Effect of The Stow-in Condition
The in vitro effect of the stow-in condition on the banana leaves was evaluated by the method of Cheffal et al. (2015). The inocula of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL. The inocula of Agrimariopsis and other fumigatus strains were prepared in 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL.


## Results
fumigatus by its ability to produce pyomelani. Pyomelanin is the primary production product of the pomelanin gene in A. fumigatus (Zhi et al., 2012). Pyomelanin is produced in the first step of the reaction of pore-forming enzymes to form the final product. After the second step of reaction, the enzymes from the reactions of the enzymes in the reaction pathway are formed and the final product is produced. It was found that the pyomelanin production is more efficient in A. fumigatus (Zhi et al., 2012). It is noteworthy that the pyomelanin production in banana was much slower than that in other varieties of A. fumigatus (Chowdhury et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2009).

Table 4 shows the results of the S. cerevisiae phenotypes and phenotypic attributes of the two experimental banana cultivars. The banana cultivar of the study was distinguished from A. fumigatus by the presence of hemicellulose. In the first step of reaction, the enzymes from the reactions of pore-forming enzymes to form the final product are formed and the product is finally produced. The pyomelanin production in banana was much faster than that in other varieties of A. fumigatus (Chowdhury et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2009). The yellow color of the the fruit may indicate that the initial reaction was poor in the cultivar of the study. The phenotypic attributes of the two cultivars are shown in Table 5. The banana cultivar was distinguished from A. fumigatus by its absence of red color (Table 5). It was notable that the pyomelanin production in A. fumigatus was much slower than that in other varieties of A. fumigatus (Chowdhury et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2009). The reason for the yellow color could be due to the presence of hemicellulose.

Table 6 shows the results of the S. cerevisiae phenotypes and phenotypic attributes of the two banana cultivars. The banana cultivar of the study was distinguished from A. fumigatus by the presence of an ellipsoidal shape on the surface of the fruit.


## Discussion

Effect of Agrimariopsis on banana tissue regeneration
The effect of Agrimariopsis on banana tissue regeneration has been previously described for other pathogenic fungi such as . albicans and the closely related species Cryptococcus laurentii [64, 65]. The authors reported that Agrimariopsis promoted growth of C. laurentii, which is closely related to the pathogen C. neoformans. In this study, we observed significant increase in the biomass of C. laurentii after treatment with Agrimariopsis. The authors showed that Agrimariopsis has a significant effect on the growth of C. laurentii.

The effect of Agrimariopsis on the growth of C. albicans and C. laurentii is shown in Figure 6. After treatment with Agrimariopsis, the fungus in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol was significantly higher than that in the absence of Agrimariopsis. The authors suggested that Tween 80 acts as a carbon source for Agrimariopsis [65]. Although, the authors did not observe any difference in the biomass of C. albicans and C. laurentii in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol, it is possible that Tween 80 acts as a carbon source for C. laurentii. The authors also observed that Agrimariopsis decreased the growth of C. albicans in the presence of ethanol, but the fungus was not as sensitive to ethanol as the fungus in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol. The authors also observed that the fungus in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol was significantly more resistant to the fungus in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol than the fungus in the absence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol.

Effect of Agrimariopsis on the growth of C. albicans and C. laurentii
In our study, we observed that the fungus in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol was significantly higher than that in the absence of Agrimariopsis. This difference in the growth of C. albicans and C. laurentii in the presence of Tween 80, PEG, and ethanol was also observed by the authors of the study [63]. The authors also observed that Agrimariopsis significantly increased the biomass of C. albicans and C.
