## Abstract
In this study, the effects of different pH-responsive signaling molecules on fungal growth, competition, and virulence were evaluated in Zebrafish, an opportunistic pathogen of humans. The growth of Zebrafish was impaired under low-pH pH, pH 2-3 and pH 7-8, with an MIC50 of 6.0 µg/mL. Inulinase activity was observed to be an effective pH signaling molecule and the expression of a transcription factor was stimulated by alkaline pH. Furthermore, the response of Zebrafish to different stress conditions was evaluated by a double hypersaline real-time PCR and the expression levels of two proteins were evaluated. The response of Zebrafish to alkaline pH was higher than the response to pH 7-8. An important PKC, BAD1 and ACT1, which regulate the expression of several stress response genes were down-regulated in alkaline pH-stimulated Zebrafish. These findings suggested that different pH-responsive signaling molecules might regulate different Zebrafish growth phenotypes. In addition, fungal survival in alkaline pH was higher than that in alkaline conditions, with the highest survival rate and the highest survival rates observed in the death-prone and survival time of Zebrafish. These findings suggest that different pH-responsive signaling molecules might regulate the different Zebrafish growth phenotypes.


## Introduction
The presence of antibodies against a single antigen can make a difference to disease outcome [1,2,3,4,7,8,9]. The presence of antibodies in the circulation may influence immune responses in different organs, including the central nervous system, and may be associated with different patterns of disease.


## Methods
The clinical and microbiological outcome of this study were recorde.

2.3. Molecular Data Analysis
The PCR product of the fungus, from the respective colony of the cultured strain, was subjected to the appropriate molecular analysis, to obtain the sequences of the ITS region of the fungal protein, and to obtain the ITS-1-5.8S rRNA region of the bacterial protein. In order to obtain the sequences of the fungal protein, these sequences were obtained from the UNITE database and the GenBank databases, respectively. The PCR products were run on a Quant-iT Peltier Thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, United States) in a gradient of 2-60% (v/v) denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 55°C for 15 s, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min. The amplification products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The purified PCR product was used for the bioinformatic analysis, by using the primer pairs ITS-1 (5'-GTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCT-3') and ITS-4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). The PCR product was amplified in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% ethylene glycol. The assay was performed in a Bio-Rad CFX manager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The bioinformatic reaction was carried out in a Bio-Rad CFX Manager system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The amplification products were analyzed on a Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.0 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) with the following temperature profile: 1 min at 95°C; 35 cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by a hold of 10 min at 72°C.


## Results
ive.org/protocols/index.php?s=article&id=29) and a review of the literature including a review of literature and analysis of the impact of antiretroviral therapy in advanced HIV patients [19].

In this study, the use of antiretroviral therapy is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality (Table 2). The majority of deaths were caused by cryptococcal meningitis (56.8%), among which 7.5% were immunocompromised and 9.2% were immunosuppressed [21]. The remaining 2.9% died from an underlying infection. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant increase in mortality was found when the risk ratio of cryptococcal meningitis (RRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.79-4.56) was calculated as 3.66 (95% CI, 1.20-5.53). The mortality risk ratio of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients was 2.66 (95% CI, 1.06-6.29) and 2.50 (95% CI, 1.04-6.81) for non-HIV patients, respectively (Table 3).

The median CD4+ count (CD4+ T-cell count) was 438 cells/mm^3 in HIV-infected patients and 495 cells/mm^3 in HIV-uninfected patients. The median CD4+ T-cell count was 632 cells/mm^3 in HIV-infected patients and 684 cells/mm^3 in HIV-uninfected patients, respectively (Table 4).

The total RNA isolated was ~450 (median 590). Of the ~450 RNA isolated from HIV-infected patients, ~400 (median 587) copies of the total RNA of cryptococcal meningitis (median 3,914) and ~150 (median 193) copies of the total RNA of HIV-uninfected patients were identified.

The majority of the total RNA isolated from HIV-infected patients was processed by ELISA; ~600 (median 59) of the total RNA isolated from HIV-infected patients had at least one microRNA gene with the Illumina system.


## Discussion
In this study, we found that an isolate of . gondii was significantly more resistant to antifungal therapy than C. neoformans, an isolate of P. gondii resistant to antifungal therapy in patients with HIV. Furthermore, we found that C. neoformans was an organism with the capacity to cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. This result is in agreement with the recent observation of P. gondii infection in HIV patients [23]. These findings are also in agreement with findings of P. gondii infection in the presence of the antifungal therapy, which is a common and effective treatment for HIV infection [16], [17].

As previously mentioned, this is the first report of P. gondii infection in an HIV patient. However, P. gondii infection in HIV patients is rare and is reported in only a few cases [25]. The current study provides important data regarding the survival and progression of P. gondii infection in HIV patients. P. gondii infection in HIV patients is likely to be related to its immunosuppressive status, the role of antiretroviral therapy and the association with treatment failures. Antiretroviral therapy has been shown to significantly reduce the survival of P. gondii in HIV patients [26], and this treatment could potentially lead to a significant reduction in the survival of P. gondii in HIV patients.

P. gondii was isolated from the soil samples of P. gondii in India, but this is the first report of P. gondii infection in an HIV patient in India. The commonest isolates of P. gondii in India are C. neoformans, C. gattii and A. fumigatus [27]. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the commonest common isolates of P. gondii are C. neoformans and C. gattii and the second commonest common isolates are A. fumigatus [28], which may be due to their morphological differentiation into fungal hyphae in the laboratory. We observed a high number of isolates of P. gondii in the soil samples of P. gondii patients, but the high number of isolates was not consistent with the findings of previous studies.
