## Abstract
The efficacy of oral fluconazole treatment against candidemia was evaluated in 34 patients. The mean survival (NPSL) was 20.1 (median 7.2, IQR 9.9, 10.3 years) after treatment and 27.5 (median 20.3, IQR 36.6, 36.4 years) after placebo. The median time NPSL decline was 57 days (IQR, 14), 17 of which occurred within 12 months of starting fluconazole. Patients receiving fluconazole had lower median NPSL values (median and high values) in the first week and the longest median NPSL decline was 12 weeks (IQR, 0.1-0.5 months) after treatment. Fluconazole was given to 34 patients and safety was monitored in six patients. Overall, fluconazole was administered in a third of patients with moderate and one in every three patients with severe fluconazolemia. Patients treated with fluconazole had a median survival of 63 days (IQR, 24), 17 of which occurred within 6 months of starting fluconazole. Safety and tolerability of fluconazole were very good. Fluconazole was given to all patients for a mean of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.


## Introduction
Microorganisms can manipulate the chemical environment of their body fluids, increasing the efficiency of the host immune system during infection. This is especially true for pathogens, such as influenza virus, that must overcome host defences to survive and establish successful viral infections. Host defences, including phagocytes, regulate the immune response in the presence of invading microorganisms. Macrophages play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response in the case of pneumonia. However, when the infection is not controlled effectively, macrophages can produce toxic reactive oxygen species, leading to reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production and oxidative damage of the host tissue. As a consequence, the free-floating population of neutrophils, which can be divided into type 1 and type 2 (1), is recruited to the site of infection. Type 2 macrophages are differentiated into type 1 cells and type 2 cells by the activation of the immune system (reviewed in ref. 2). Once phagocytosed, macrophages may be activated by a number of stimuli, including type 1 (inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and neutrophil extracellular traps) and type 2 (antibiotic, complement, or immune escape) (2). One of these stimuli is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic metabolites that can damage macrophages and kill them quickly (3). The response of macrophages to these stimuli is complex and depends on a number of factors. Factors that control ROS include macrophage apoptosis, macrophage growth factors, ROS-binding proteins, and cytokines. In macrophages, phagocytic killing is an important trigger of ROS, as macrophages are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Macrophages are also the main cells that produce ROS and thus contribute to host defense against invading pathogens (4). In addition, ROS are also secreted by the host immune system, as a consequence of macrophage activation (5).

The macrophage response to infections involves various changes that include the formation of large structures known as granules. These contain high concentrations of ROS (oxidative burst), superoxide anion release, and enzymes that degrade the intracellular environment.


## Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), C. tropicalis (ATCC 700394), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), C. lusitaniae (ATCC 9039), C. dubliniensis (ATCC 9038), and C. tropicalis/C. parapsilosis (ATCC 90118) were used in this study. All strains were maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) slants at 28 °C and used without further purification.

C. krusei (ATCC 6258) was used in this study. It was a generous gift from Prof. Ephélio Guérin (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil). C. krusei was cultivated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) (15 g·L^-1) for 1.5 days at 28 °C. The culture was adjusted to pH 3.


## Results

In order to explore the potential for treatment of any of the Histoplasmosis patient with intranasal treatment, the treatment of Histoplasma pneumonia was conducted in two groups, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or intravenous agents for Histoplasma pneumonia (I-IV), and those receiving corticosteroids and IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) (Table 1). The treatment of I-IV patients was achieved after two rounds of IV and IV administration. The duration of IV administration was slightly shorter than that of IV treatment. The treatment of IV-P patients was performed in one group, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P). The treatment of IV-P patients was done in two groups, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) and those receiving corticosteroids and IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P). The duration of IV administration was shorter than that of IV treatment. The IV-P patients were treated with corticosteroids in two groups, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) and those receiving corticosteroids and IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) (Table 2).

In patients receiving intranasal treatment of Histoplasma pneumonia, the duration of IV administration was longer than that of IV treatment. The treatment of IV-P patients was more expensive than IV treatment. The duration of IV administration was shorter than that of IV treatment. The IV-P patients received corticosteroids in one group, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) and those receiving corticosteroids and IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P). The duration of IV administration was shorter than that of IV treatment. The IV-P patients were treated with corticosteroids in one group, i.e., those receiving corticosteroids or IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) and those receiving corticosteroids and IV for Histoplasma pneumonia (IV-P) (Table 3).

In patients receiving corticosteroids in IV therapy, the duration of IV administration was shorter than that of IV treatment. The treatment of IV-P patients was more expensive than IV treatment.


## Discussion
We also demonstrated that this extract of . sativus had antifungal activity against fungi including Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, and Trichophyton.

V. sativus extract has been isolated from the roots of many plants in different parts of the world, from the soil, and on the fruit surfaces of fruits and vegetables. It is often used as a natural drug and a natural anti-fungal agent [20, 21].

In this study, we found that the extracts of V. sativus from the leaves of V. sativus can also be used as antifungal agents. The extracts of V. sativus from the plant of V. sativus were active against Aspergillus and Candida, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, V. sativus extract exhibited activity against Candida sp. and Aspergillus sp.

The antifungal activity of V. sativus has been reported in studies related to biological control of fungi, such as plant growth promotion [20, 22], and treatment of infections caused by Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans [23, 24].

The antifungal activity of this plant has been also reported by others, such as in vitro studies of the effect of V. sativus on C. albicans [25], and in planta studies of the effect of V. sativus on plant pathogens such as C. neoformans [26], Fusarium oxysporum [27], and Candida albicans [28]. In addition, other reports showed that the antifungal activity of V. sativus was in general similar to that of plant extract [29].

The antifungal activity of the extracts of V. sativus has been also reported by others, such as in vitro studies of the effect of the plant extract on Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans [23, 24]. In the study of Almeida et al. [30] that used the V.
