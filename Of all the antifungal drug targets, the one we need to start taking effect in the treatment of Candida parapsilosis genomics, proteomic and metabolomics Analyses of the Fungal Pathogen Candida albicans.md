## Abstract
Eugenia longifolia (Salvangitdryad) has medicinal value in folk medicine and its use in traditional medicinal systems in Malaysia. It is also used in folk medicine in many other parts of Asia, especially Chinese-administered herbal tea and Japanese teas. The aim of the present study was to identify the flavonoids in E. longifolia and to determine their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and the secondary metabolites of breast cancer patients.

All the isolated E. longifolia extracts were first fractionated and the cytotoxicity of the extract was determined by the microdilution method. Then, the fractions were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against human cancer cells.

All the isolated E. longifolia extracts showed significant antifungal activity against the tested human cancer cell lines: HeLa, HeLa-B, and Hep2. The fractions were cytotoxic in normal HeLa cell lines, but they did not affect the Hep2- and Hep2-B-cells. The fractions also inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells in a HeLa cell lines.

All the fractions showed anti-fungal activity. The fractions were cytotoxic in HeLa cells and inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells in a Hep2- and Hep2-B-cell lines.

This study provided useful information for the pharmacognostics and treatment of patients with human cancers, especially Hep2- and HeLa-related HeLa cells.


## Introduction
All living organisms, including animals, plants, microbes and fungi, utilize carbon as their primary carbon source. In general, however, the availability of such sources is limited. The availability of suitable carbon sources is highly limited in nature, and in most cases the carbon source is either organic, such as compost, methanogenic or by far, like most other resources, derived from animal, plant or microorganisms (1). In contrast, some microbial species, such as P. aeruginosa, are known to produce extracellular enzymes that degrade recalcitrant compounds in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, and biofuel cells, which are typically grown in large-scale in a field (2-4). For example, P. aeruginosa extracellular lytic enzymes are produced from lactic acid (Klar) and citric acid, respectively (5). The production of lytic enzymes is particularly interesting in biofuel cells, where the cell wall and biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds are completed only when the initial accumulation of lactic acid is completed (6).


## Methods
parapsilosis genome database (CPCAP_Genomic_A_Table.pdf) was considered as the first reading of C. parapsilosis. To further define the FPCAP annotation, we used the GenBank accession number of the genome database for C. parapsilosis and the accession number of the gene of interest for C. albicans (accession number: LAC_000123.3). We also used the UTHSCA reference gene (accession number: MUCH_013313.1) to annotate the gene set and also the HEG1 gene to generate the expression pattern in the HEG1 pathway. We compared the gene set of C. parapsilosis to the genome of Candida albicans. The gene set of C. parapsilosis was classified according to the UTHSCA reference gene and the gene set of C. albicans was classified according to the HEG1 gene. The C. parapsilosis genome sequence was deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) (accession number: LCYT3009).

Bioinformatics Analysis
The Pareto-redundant protein sequence dataset for C. parapsilosis was assembled using the program CLUSTALX2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The protein sequences of C. parapsilosis and C. albicans were aligned with a Bioedit program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/bioedit). Each protein sequence was used to predict a gene family of the fungal pathogen using BLASTP (version 2.2.28; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) and a BLASTP algorithm (version 2.3.0; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) by searching against the HEG1 protein sequence. The gene family of C. parapsilosis and C. albicans was retrieved from the C. parapsilosis genome database by using the BLAST search with a BLASTP match with a bit score of 40. The gene families of C. albicans and C.


## Results
Candida albicans is a very virulent species that is highly resistant to azoles and antifungals, and consequently the treatment of Candida albicans in the clinic should be based on both clinical and genetic approache. The anti-Candida drug response is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. We have been studying the response of Candida albicans to azoles in the clinic for some time. The antifungal drugs of choice for the clinic are the fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole, amphotericin B-AmB and the isoniazid-based amphotericin B-AmB. The initial antifungal agent used in the clinic should be a combination of the antifungal drugs, and not only fluconazole or amphotericin B. Therefore, in our study, the combination of amphotericin B with fluconazole was effective for all tested Candida species (Figure 1). In general, the combination of fluconazole with fluconazole was a better combination than amphotericin B, and this was also true for C. parapsilosis. In the clinical setting, the combination of fluconazole with fluconazole was effective for all Candida species tested, but not for C. albicans (Figure 1).

The antifungal drug combination strategy in the clinic was based on the principle of pharmacodynamics of the drug in the clinic. In the clinical setting, the drug combination strategy should be based on the principle of pharmacodynamics of the drug in the clinic. The combination of fluconazole or amphotericin B with fluconazole should be an active combination as well as a combination drug in combination with fluconazole, but the drug combination strategy should be based on the principle of pharmacodynamics. In the clinic, the combination of fluconazole or amphotericin B with fluconazole should be an active combination as well as a combination drug in combination with fluconazole, but the drug combination strategy should be based on the principle of pharmacodynamics of the drug in the clinic.


## Discussion

With respect to the phylogenetic relationships between fungal species and the phylogenetic relationships between different fungi and plants, some of the genetic relatedness of fungal species and different lifestyles (Fisher's exact test = 9.9% [Fungal-Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1] and 100% [Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+] in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1; see also Fig S2 in the supplemental material) were not detected in the present study. However, we found a significant difference in the genes (Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1 and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1 and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1 and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+) could be taken into account.

Considering the genetic relatedness of fungal species, we found that some of the genes (Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1, Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2 and Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^2+ in Fungal-Relation-R^2+/^1) were also significantly different from those in the parental strains (S2 Table).
