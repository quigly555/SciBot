## Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is responsible for one of the greatest epidemics of meningitis worldwide, with a high mortality. Meningitis is an infectious disease caused by two sibling (virulent and unvirulent) bacterial species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex (Mao) that are transmitted maturingantly between humans and animals. Mammalian hosts are unlikely to be affected, and the causative agent of pulmonary Mtb infection has recently been identified. The pathogenicity of Mtb infection is thought to be in part mediated by host immunity, but the nature of this immunity is not well understood. Meningeal immunity plays an important role in Mtb pathogenesis. The recent availability of murine macrophages with the help of MBOE cell-activating enzymes from infected macrophages demonstrates that Mtb infection is not exclusively a host's innate immunity. On the other hand, the virulence factor histidine has recently been identified as a major receptor involved in Mtb recognition and the histidine receptor-like protein Ras is another important receptor involved in Mtb cell invasion. The mechanism by which histidine triggers Mtb cell invasion is poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of Mtb-mediated signaling. We also discuss the role of histidine in Mtb invasion, and discuss the importance of this receptor in Mtb virulence.


## Introduction
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger is an abundant soil fungus and an important human pathogen. A. niger is found in soil, freshwater, and marine water. A. niger exhibits morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits that are important for the establishment of infection structures in vivo. This review summarizes the important aspects of A. niger infection and the role of the secreted proteases and secretory proteins in host-parasite interactions.

## Results
albicans histidine kinase (Hk) protein exhibits a high degree of resolution and elucidatio. Therefore, it is important to identify the protein catalytic site in Hk1-Hk2, and to elucidate the role of the Hk1-Hk2 catalytic site in the formation of the chlamydial Thrusts and bite-dicks in the groove of the cell. Hk1-Hk2 proteins display a higher number of conserved residues, which includes a number of glutamic acid residues, whereas Hk2-Hk2 proteins display a higher number of residues (Figure 3). This data supports the previous observation that the enzymatic activity of Hk1-Hk2 proteins is strongly dependent on the interaction of the binding site between the binding site of Hk1 and Hk2 (S1 Table).

The enzymatic activity of Hk1-Hk2 proteins is strongly dependent on the interaction between Hk1 and Hk2 proteins. Therefore, the effect of Hk1-Hk2 proteins on the enzymatic activity of Hk1-Hk2 proteins could be attributed to a high degree of conservation of the binding site between Hk1-Hk2 proteins. The amino acid residues of the C. albicans histidine kinase (Hk1-Hk2) are highly conserved. Hk1-Hk2 proteins are also highly conserved in all the major cell line lines. These observations indicate that the enzymatic activity of Hk1-Hk2 proteins is strongly dependent on the interaction between Hk1-Hk2 proteins.

Hk1-Hk2 and Hk1-Hk2 proteins have a conserved C-terminal lectin domain
The C-terminal lectin domain (CLD) of the Hk1-Hk2 proteins is a large domain that is present in all major cell lines. This domain has been reported as a role in the maintenance of intracellular pH and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1ÃŸ, and IL-12 [45,46]. The Hk1-Hk2 proteins are also found in all the major cell lines, including breast, lung, and brain.


## Discussion
glabrata

For . glabrata, a complete sequence analysis was performed in order to establish a molecular phylogeny for this fungus. In this study, we identified 43 protein kinase (PK) and 18 histidine kinase (HKE) orthologs in C. glabrata, among which five kinases were identified in C. glabrata and three Hke orthologs were identified in C. albicans. Four of these kinases have been identified in C. glabrata, including two with histidine kinase activity (HK-2, HK-4, HK-6, HK-7 and HK-8) (Fig 3). HHK-2 and HK-4 have been previously identified in C. albicans, C. dubliniensis and C. glabrata [45]. HKE-2 and HK-4 are conserved in C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis and C. albicans and are involved in the DNA repair pathway [46]. HKE-2 and HK-4 are involved in the Ca^2+/H^+-ATPase complex and are required for the efficient Ca^2+/H^+-ATPase complex [47]. HKE-2, HKE-3 and HKE-8 are involved in the calcineurin/Cys-ATPase complex [48]. The remaining five Hke kinases are involved in the nucleus and histidine kinase complex, with HK-6, HK-7 and HK-8 being involved in the DNA damage and post-translational modification pathways (Fig 3). HHK-6 and HK-7 are involved in the MAP kinase pathway [49]. The histidine kinase (HK-4) and histidine kinase (HK-6) pathway is involved in the DNA repair pathway [50]. The histidine kinase (HK-4) and histidine kinase (HK-6) are required for the calcineurin/Cys-ATPase complex and the histidine kinase (HK-6) and histidine kinase (HK-6) are involved in the nucleus and histidine kinase (HK-6) pathway [50].
