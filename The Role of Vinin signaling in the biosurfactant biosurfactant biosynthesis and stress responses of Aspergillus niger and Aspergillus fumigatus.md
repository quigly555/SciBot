## Abstract
In the past several years, the use of CRISPR/Cas genome editing has significantly increased in the scientific literature. In particular, application of CRISPR/Cas genome editing has been indispensable for the successful regulation of eukaryotic pathogens. However, current molecular genetic approaches for controlling the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation still have not been fully characterized. Therefore, this review provides an overview of molecular genetic models and approaches for controlling the expression of genes involved in the normal and adaptive course of an eukaryotic microorganism.

The common molecular mechanisms of action for the different molecular control strategies (Cas and DNA/RNA) are presented. The review further discusses the role of CRISPR/Cas proteins in the normal course of an eukaryotic microorganism, the pathogenicity of fungi and the application of molecular genetic approaches for the treatment of fungal diseases.

In the future, future research should be directed toward the identification of novel molecular mechanisms controlling the development of the eukaryotic microorganism.


## Introduction
Microbial infections are an important problem in agriculture. Infections caused by pathogenic fungi are increasing, and many of them are of public health concern [1, 2]. Among them, Candida spp., are the most common species, and as infection rates decrease, so the number of patients with underlying diseases increases [3, 4].

C. albicans is usually the most susceptible, and it is usually associated with low susceptibility to conventional antibiotics [5, 6]. On the other hand, C. glabrata is also reported as the most frequently isolated microorganism, in which the most commonly occurring infections are among those caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans [7, 8].

C. glabrata is normally harmless, but can cause serious infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV or cancer, and also in patients with other diseases such as tuberculosis, haematologic malignancies, and solid organ transplant recipients [9, 10].

It is reported that C. glabrata has a very low susceptibility to azoles and echinocandins, and even fewer to 5-flucytosine [11, 12]. Some studies showed that C. glabrata is more resistant to amphotericin B than other Candida species, and the resistance rate of C. albicans was reported to be as low as 2.5-fold [13].

Antimicrobial resistance in Candida spp. is a common clinical issue in nosocomial infections, especially among sensitive or otherwise immunocompromised patients [14, 15]. The high level of azole resistance in Candida spp. is a concern in routine care, because the use of such drugs has been increasing. Currently, there are four major classes of antifungals: the polyenes, the azoles, and echinocandins [16, 17].

The polyene class is mainly used for Candida infections because of their low toxicity, good absorption, low cost, and broad-spectrum of activity, being effective against most strains of Candida [18]. The echinocandins are used for treating gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin infections, and for the treatment of invasive fungal infections [19].

The first two classes of antifungals are mainly used in the treatment of fungal infections.


## Methods
fumigatus DNA in the microplate as previously described [15. In addition, the presence of several hundred A. fumigatus DNA molecules and other non-targeting fungal contaminants in the microplate also showed a higher amount of A. fumigatus DNA [10].

The activity of these and other non-targeting fungi in the biosurfactant biosynthesis and stress response of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus was also demonstrated by the presence of several hundred A. fumigatus DNA molecules and other non-targeting fungal contaminants in the microplate as previously described [15]. In addition, the presence of several hundred A. fumigatus DNA molecules and other non-targeting fungal contaminants in the microplate also showed a higher amount of A. fumigatus DNA [10].

Molecular assays
To investigate the ability of Aspergillus fumigatus to respond to different stress conditions, the fungi were cultured on V8 (0.5% v/v) medium for 7 days, and the cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed with distilled water. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged again. The supernatant containing the lysate was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blot was performed as previously described [16].

The activity of Aspergillus fumigatus to respond to different stress conditions was also demonstrated by the presence of several hundred A. fumigatus DNA molecules in the microplate as previously described [15]. In addition, the presence of several hundred A. fumigatus DNA molecules and other non-targeting fungal contaminants in the microplate also showed a higher amount of A. fumigatus DNA [10].

To study the biosurfactant biosynthesis and stress response of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, the fungal strains were grown on V8 (0.5% v/v) medium for 7 days, and the cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed with distilled water.


## Results
A three-fold increase in the antioxidant capacity of the . niger, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus strains was observed in the media with 10 mM glutathione in medium (Figure 1B). The concentrations of glutathione in the medium of A. niger and A. flavus were comparable (Figure 1C). The levels of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. niger were comparable. However, A. fumigatus showed a decrease in glutathione in the medium of A. flavus compared to A. niger. This observation was in agreement with the results of a previous study that observed a similar effect of glutathione in A. niger strains (15). The results of the present study showed that the concentration of glutathione in the medium of A. flavus and A. niger was 3.3-fold higher than in A. niger strains. The accumulation of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. niger was 2.2-fold and 1.6-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the medium of A. flavus and A. flavus was 2.3-fold and 1.5-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the medium of A. flavus and A. niger was 2.1-fold and 1.6-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. niger was 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. flavus was 2.2-fold and 1.6-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. flavus was 2.1-fold and 1.6-fold higher than that in A. niger, respectively. The accumulation of glutathione in the media of A. flavus and A. flavus was 1.


## Discussion
In the present study, the MAPK pathway of Aspergillus niger was activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of the PHK1 gene had a significant effect on the . fumigatus growth and conidiation. In contrast, the PHK1 gene was activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of the PHK1 gene had a significant effect on the A. fumigatus growth and conidiation. These results showed that the MAPK pathway in Aspergillus is highly activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of the PHK1 gene resulted in the abnormal growth and conidiation in the A. fumigatus mutant.

Phosphatidylinositol-6-phosphate kinase (PIK) is a key enzyme in the production of ATP and is critical for the synthesis of ergosterol in eukaryotes (28). In A. fumigatus, the PIK is activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of PIK1 gene had a significant effect on the A. fumigatus growth and conidiation. In contrast, the PIK1 gene was activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of PIK1 gene resulted in the abnormal growth and conidiation in the A. fumigatus mutant. The fact that the MAPK pathway is activated in response to the azole stress and the loss of the PHK1 gene in A. fumigatus resulted in the abnormal growth and conidiation in the A. fumigatus mutant and the inhibition of the MAPK pathway in A. fumigatus resulted in the abnormal growth and conidiation in the A. fumigatus mutant.

In the present study, the expression level of the PHK1 gene in the A. fumigatus mutant was increased in the presence of the azole and the loss of the PHK1 gene led to the abnormal growth and conidiation in the A. fumigatus mutant. The inhibitor of the MAPK pathway, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was used to identify the inhibitors of the PHK1 gene in A.
