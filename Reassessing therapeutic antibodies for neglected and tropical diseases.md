## Abstract
Fusarium oxysporum is the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereal crops worldwide. To improve disease prevention and disease resistance in this economically important crop, breeding has evolved breeding programs to incorporate both novel and traditional plant species. The breeding of F. oxysporum has evolved from two approaches: the conventional (phloatariaticum) breeding using a single plow, or the hybrid (balamoysticum) breeding using multiple plows. These hybrid breeding strategies have evolved from a single common strategy from which all F. oxysporum strains are selected because they are the most homogeneous and because they are more suited to engineering their different developmental stages in order to reduce the number of breeding cycles. However, the evolution of the two strategies, which are still strongly linked, has resulted in the creation of mixed breeding communities (MN) that is largely dependent on the hybridization programs for F. oxysporum.


## Introduction
Central nervous system (CNS) infections are often associated with a variety of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the CNS to an asymptomatic infection of the CNS [1]. The most common clinical presentations include meningitis, intracranial pressure, and/or myelopathy [2]. In these presentations, there is a marked heterogeneity between the etiologic agents causing the CNS infections.

In the literature, there are few cases of CNS infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. However, it is increasingly recognized that the bacterium is responsible for approximately 10% of the cases.

In the present case, P. aeruginosa was isolated from the CSF of a single patient, who was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was successfully treated for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Here, we present a case of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by P. aeruginosa.


## Methods
The data collected were collected from the primary hospitalised patients with C.

The patients were divided into four groups according to age, gender, sex, and their ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The number of patients with CM was divided into four groups, according to age, gender, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The frequency of ART was divided into two groups, according to age, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

The patients were divided into two groups according to age, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The frequency of physical examination, blood culture, and cytology were taken into account. In addition, the clinical signs and symptoms of CM were recorded in the secondary hospital ward (ST) and in the tertiary hospital ward (PT).

All the patients were divided into three groups according to the number of CM cases in the hospitalised group, the number of patients with CM in the non-hospitalised group, and the number of patients with CM in the tertiary hospital group. The total number of cases was divided into three groups according to the age, gender, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The number of cases with CM in the non-hospitalised group was divided into three groups, according to the age, gender, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The number of CM cases in the non-hospitalised group was divided into three groups, according to the age, gender, sex, and ART status (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

The patients were divided into four groups according to the number of patients with CM in the non-hospitalised group.


## Results

In the sera of the participants, the sera from the unpublished participants did not show any sera from the sera from the clinical sample. In the sera of the participants, the sera from the clinical samples did not show any sera from the clinical samples. In the sera from the clinical samples, the sera from the unpublished participants showed sera from the sera from the clinical samples and the sera from the clinical samples and the sera from the clinical samples, which could be confirmed by microscopy or ELISA.

## Discussion

AMPs inhibit the growth of . albicans and C. neoformans and the other species of C. neoformans. Therefore, AMPs have been developed as novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of patients with candidiasis and other infections, such as invasive aspergillosis and pneumocystosis [14]. However, their efficacy is not always efficient. For example, AMPs inhibit the growth of C. neoformans in vitro [16], but the antifungal effect of AMPs against C. albicans is not significant [17]. AMPs can also inhibit the growth of Candida albicans [18] but their antifungal effect is not significant [19].

In this study, we focused on the anti-fungal activity of AMPs against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. In the current study, AMPs were evaluated to the best of our knowledge for their antifungal activity against the C. krusei strain and C. neoformans. In addition, the results are in agreement with previous reports which reported that AMPs were able to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans and C. krusei [2, 3, 4, 20, 21]. The inhibitory effect of AMPs against C. neoformans was investigated in a murine model. The results showed that AMPs had a significant antifungal activity against C. krusei but not against C. albicans and C. neoformans. Our results also showed that AMPs had a significant antifungal activity against C. krusei, but not against C. neoformans. AMPs have been shown to be effective against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei, although the mechanism is not clear [2, 3, 4, 20, 21].

In conclusion, this study showed that AMPs may be a potential treatment for invasive fungal infections in tropical countries. However, it has to be noted that AMPs are still a major target for antifungal therapy in tropical countries.
