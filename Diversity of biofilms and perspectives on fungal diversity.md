## Abstract
Melanin is a natural pigment that has antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-microbial activities. A multilayered approach to understanding the function of melanin provides a theoretical foundation for melanin biomanufacturing. The development of new technologies of computer aided in situ inmaplication laser scanning microscopy has enabled the construction of highly accurate and user friendly phenotypic profiles for exploring melanin biomanufacturing. The identification of enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism responsible for melanin biogenesis is thus supported by mass spectrometry and proteomic data. Finally, the identification of enzymes of the cell cycle responsible for melanin production, such as those involved in melanin synthesis, is presented. The use of rapid high quality proteomics data, such as GFP, to identify enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism, such as those involved in melanin synthesis, will help to advance the field of melanin biomanufacturing and lead to future research directions.


## Introduction
Disease resistance in wheat has been documented in at least three different crops, including wheat, olive oil, and wheat pseudoepimastigote (WPG) [1], [2]. WPG is a highly susceptible crop to several diseases in which the pathogen can spread rapidly and cause damage in the health of crops. In addition, the disease resistance of wheat to blue mold, caused by the fungus Phytophthora, has been demonstrated to be related to its ability to produce anthracnose, which is lethal to wheat and other crops [3], [4]. Although the presence of disease resistance in wheat is well known, few studies have analyzed the occurrence and epidemiology of disease resistance in WPG. In addition, there have been only two reports of WPG disease in northern China with high rates of wheat non-resistant genetic disorders [5], [6]. In this study, the occurrence of WPG disease in the wheat growing area in Guangxi Province (Guangxi Province), southern China, and the epidemiology of disease resistance in wheat in northern China were analyzed. In addition, the occurrence of wheat disease in southern China was analyzed using whole wheat (W) replanted from wheat field in an attempt to establish a wheat-pathogenic tree.


## Methods
The biofilm-associated biofilm, and the biofilm-associated biofilm alone, were assessed by the presence or absence of biofilms, and the presence or absence of biofilm-associated biofilms were categorized as “un-occurring biofilms” or “recent biofilms.


## Results
Among them, eight genera were found to be more abundant in the three groups, including yeasts, filamentous fungi, saprotrophs, and endophytes (Table 3. The fungal community was highly enriched in the negative control samples with a median of 0.06 and 0.05% of the total fungal biomass in the community, respectively. However, the positive control sample was dominated by yeasts, filamentous fungi, and saprotrophs (Table 3). The soil microhabitat samples were highly diverse (Table 3). The soil microhabitat samples contained the most diverse fungal community and could be characterized by diverse fungal community structures.

The fungal diversity was enriched in the negative control samples (Table 3). The positive control samples were dominated by fungal species (Table 3), including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota (Table 3). However, the soil microhabitat samples were dominated by Ascomycota (Table 3). Among the soil microhabitat samples, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant species (Table 3). The soil microhabitat samples were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (Table 3). In contrast, the negative control samples contained a high proportion of Ascomycota (Table 3).

The soil microhabitats also contained the most diverse fungal community and could be characterized by diverse fungal community structures. The soil microhabitats were dominated by Ascomycota (Table 3), Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota (Table 3). However, the soil microhabitats were dominated by Glomeromycota and Ascomycota (Table 3). The soil microhabitats were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (Table 3).

Soil microhabitats were dominated by yeasts (Table 3), filamentous fungi, and saprotrophs (Table 3). The soil microhabitats were dominated by yeasts and filamentous fungi (Table 3). The soil microhabitats were dominated by saprotrophs (Table 3).


## Discussion
They are composed of a cell wall composed of hydrophobic materials and celluloses, and surrounded by dense hydrophobic layers of cellulos. This structure is composed of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and lipids (16). They are composed of textured and branched polysaccharides, and are composed of the hemolysin, cellulose, and arabinose (17). Biofilms have various characteristics: they are usually composed of a heterogeneous number of cells and cells of a certain age, or with different types of cell walls (18, 19). Biofilm production and differentiation is a complex process, and the individual differences of biofilm formation and differentiation are closely related to the different types of cell wall and cell wall components present in the biofilm (19). The biofilm size can vary greatly depending on the types of biofilms formed and differentiation. The biofilm size of C. gattii is about 0.5-0.9 × 3-4 µm, which is very close to the maximum diameter of human biofilms (20). In the present study, the biofilm size of C. gattii was about 1.5-1.5 × 3-4 µm, which is relatively close to the maximum diameter of the human biofilm (21). The strain of C. gattii also produces biofilms that are composed of different cell walls (22). The strains of C. albicans and C. neoformans are known to be more resistant to antifungal drugs than other species (23, 24). The strains of C. gattii are known to produce biofilms that are larger than 10 µm (25). The biofilm formation of C. albicans is much more resistant to antifungal drugs than other species (26). In the present study, the strains of C. albicans and C. neoformans were found to be less resistant to antifungal drugs than C. gattii. These strains were also found to produce biofilms that were smaller than 10 µm. These differences in biofilm formation and differentiation might be a reflection of their different nature as biofilms and different cell types.

In the present study, the strains of C. gattii were found to be less sensitive to antifungal drugs than strains of C.
