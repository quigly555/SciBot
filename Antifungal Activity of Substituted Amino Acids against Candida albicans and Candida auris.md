## Abstract
The natural product polyphenols are produced by a large variety of organisms, including plants and animals. These compounds have diverse biological activities that have been increasingly reported due to their economic, ecological, and human health benefits. However, there are a limited number of studies on the polyphenols derived from polyphenols and their potential as antifungal therapeutics. In this study, we isolated and characterized a polyphenol-derived from the root extract of Eucalyptus citriodora, the most important citrus fruit species, and assessed its antifungal activity. The polyphenols were precipitated by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry with a N-heterocyclic sequence, followed by ionization and purification chromatography. We also evaluated their antifungal activity against a panel of dermatophytes, and concluded that they were more effective than the major antifungals in classifying them as promising compounds for the development of new drugs for the treatment of skin and nail infections. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that E. citriodora is a promising source of polyphenols and alternative antifungal candidates that could be used to treat skin diseases, such as eczema, eczema-associated psoriasis, and nail infections.


## Introduction
The genus Pterilopsis contains a wide range of important and often toxic endophytic and necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi. P. vulgaris is the most common endophytic fungus in the genera Fagaceae, Melanommatotrys, and Pseudoplagiostoma. It is also the source of several other endophytic fungi, including P. asteroides, P. anomala, P. destructans, P. eucalyptorum, P. chasteum, P. nigrae, P. tenuissima, P. schizophyum, P. jirovecii, P. parvis, and P. osmundae (Osmundson, 1999). In addition to its significant economic impact, Pterilopsis has been reported to produce significant economic and agricultural mycotoxins (Clarkson, 2005).

Melanommatotrys is a phytopathogenic fungus, found in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in Africa, Asia, and Australia (Clarkson, 2005). The fungus is found in soil, plant, air, and on plant stems, leaves, roots, and seeds (Martin, 1993; Martínez-Vargas, 2009). Melanommatotryps is a hallmark of many pathogenic fungi, including P. destructans, which causes the most important health threat to humans and animals, and is responsible for significant economic losses worldwide (Clarkson, 2005).

The genus Melanommatotryps is characterized by a phyllosphere rich in arbuscular mycorrhiza, and by large, dark, and rarely observed conidia. Conidia are either smooth, septate, or with long, scurlose appendages (Clarkson, 2005).


## Methods
albicans and . auris was carried out by the method described by Mowse et al. [33]. The bacteria and yeast were cultivated in potato dextrose broth at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the conidia were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with sterile PBS, and then diluted with sterile PBS. Then, the diluted bacterial and yeast suspension was adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^5/mL. The suspensions were prepared with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5-1 × 10^7/mL. The diluted bacterial and yeast suspensions were then prepared with sterile PBS, and the results were expressed as mg of dry yeast equivalents (FWE) per gram of dry culture.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activity of Substituted Amino Acids against C. albicans and C. auris
The antimicrobial activity of the substituted amino acids against C. albicans and C. auris was performed according to the method described by Doehle and Hyde [34] with some modifications. The bacteria were cultivated in potato dextrose broth at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the conidia were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with sterile PBS, and then diluted with sterile PBS to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5/mL. The suspensions were prepared with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5-1 × 10^7/mL. The diluted bacterial and yeast suspensions were then prepared with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5-1 × 10^7/mL. The diluted bacterial and yeast suspensions were then prepared with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5-1 × 10^7/mL. Then, the diluted bacterial and yeast suspensions were prepared with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS by centrifugation and then diluted with sterile PBS by centrifugation to reach the concentrations of 1 × 10^5-1 × 10^7/mL.


## Results
albicans and . auris. The MICs for the three tested isolates were respectively: 1.2 µg/ml, 1.2 µg/ml, and 1.4 µg/ml for C. auris, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis, respectively. No inhibitory activity was observed when the concentrations of the three tested compounds were 1.2 µg/ml, 1.2 µg/ml, and 1.4 µg/ml, respectively. All the isolates were sensitive to the three tested compounds, including the ones shown to have anti-Candida activity (Table 2).

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 of the three tested compounds against C. albicans and C. auris were 20 and 50 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds against C. albicans and C. auris were 125 µg/ml, 125 µg/ml, and 125 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds were 125 µg/ml, 125 µg/ml, and 125 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds were 125 µg/ml, 125 µg/ml, and 125 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds against C. albicans and C. auris were 500 µg/ml, 500 µg/ml, and 500 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds against C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis were 500 µg/ml, 500 µg/ml, and 500 µg/ml, respectively.

The MIC_90 values of the three tested compounds against C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis were 500 µg/ml, 500 µg/ml, and 500 µg/ml, respectively.

## Discussion
succinicipatus on the activities of the tested compounds against . albicans and C. auris, the ^1H-N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase from A. succinicipatus was used to investigate the inhibitory activity of the compound. The compounds 1-10 were used as control, and no interactions were observed with the other compounds. The compounds 1 and 10 were combined to form 1,3-ß-D-glucosaminidase and the enzyme was active against C. albicans and C. auris. The results showed that the compounds 1 and 10 were the best candidates for the treatment of fungal infections. The use of this compound as a drug is promising because of its broad spectrum activity against a broad range of fungi, including Candida species, Aspergillus species, and Aspergillus fumigatus.
