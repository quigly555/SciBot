## Abstract
Fungal community structure and diversity in the Drosophila is affected by environmental changes, often in cycles of succession. The sexual cycle in Drosophila is controlled by two cooperatively breeding strains: one a (A) and the other B. In this study, two new species, Ocrassaorden and Leptographium, were isolated from the root of one of the major rice-growing regions of Drosophila, Dar es Sala Province, Mexico. Both strains were found to belong to the Coccidioides genus, which is currently restricted to the Guajica. Ocrassaorden is characterized by its ability to form colonies in host tissues in the absence of external stimuli, while Leptographium is characterized by the ability to invade host organs in a non-pathogenic form. Ocrassaorden was recovered from host tissues after 24 h, whereas O. was recovered from the rice cultivar Penicillium when the host rice was within an appropriate phialidic matrix.


## Introduction
This first layer of the biofilm consists of extracellular matrix, which is formed by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Figure 1) (10. EPS are involved in a wide range of biological processes including adhesion, invasion, adhesion, biofilm formation, motility, adhesion, cell integrity, immune evasion, pathogenesis, and stress response (11,12). EPS are important for the adhesion, colonization, and adhesion of the microbial cells. EPS may be active and/or barrier-active. Biofilms can also be formed by other microbes, such as plant cells, animal cells, and fungi. For instance, certain fungi can be important for biofilm formation, such as Cryptococcus neoformans (13).

In the case of infections caused by bacteria or fungi, there are few exceptions. However, in eukaryotic biofilms there are some common features. The most common form is a swollen, dense and extracellular structure that extends into the cell wall. The wall is composed of mainly proteins and lipids, such as proteins and lipoproteins (14). The proteins are attached to the cell surface by a thick cell wall, which is reinforced with elastic fibers (15). The lipids are attached to the cell wall by a thin layer of cell wall material (16). The yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis (17).

Biofilm formation is usually very difficult to detect and is mainly caused by the loss of the ability of biofilms to form and to remain organized, which leads to the appearance of a black appearance of the cell wall (Figure 2). These black cells are usually small (<1 µm), thick (<0.1 µm), and covered with dark, dark colored pigments. Pigments are formed in the presence of the cells and are composed of proteins and lipids. Besides these lipids, proteins and phospholipids can also be found. Pigments can be classified as non-ionic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic. The hydrophobic lipids, such as cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesterol-like, are present in the cell wall and are synthesized and secreted in a lipid-based form (18).


## Methods
Overnight cultures were diluted to an OD_600nm of .5 and grown overnight at 37°C in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) at 200 g/L. The mycelial phase was collected and inoculated onto YPD agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Subsequently, the mycelial phase was collected and washed three times in sterile PBS. The mycelial pellet was resuspended in sterile PBS, and the suspensions were centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min, and then plated on YPD agar. For the plate assays, the colonies were counted after growth in 20-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid YPD media at 30°C. For the quantification of the survival rate, the isolates were grown to an OD_600nm of 0.5 in RPMI-1640 for 24 h, and the mycelial phase was collected. The mycelial pellet was resuspended in sterile PBS and centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min, and then the mycelial phase was collected. The mycelial phase was suspended in sterile PBS and the suspensions were centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min. The mycelial pellet was washed three times in sterile PBS, and then the mycelial phase was again resuspended in sterile PBS. The colonies were counted after growth in 20-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid YPD media at 30°C.

Assays for growth of Aspergillus species on Rice and Wheat Agar
A series of media were used for the screening of the growth of Aspergillus species on rice and wheat agar. Overnight cultures were diluted to an OD_600nm of 0.1, and grown overnight at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm, and then diluted to an OD_600nm of 0.1. The mycelial phase was collected and washed three times in sterile PBS. The mycelial pellet was resuspended in sterile PBS and centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min, and then the mycelial phase was again resuspended in sterile PBS.


## Results
aureus

Protein-protein interactions were investigated in . neoformans, in the presence of H_2O_2 and either Czapek (see above) or aqueous solutions (see Materials and methods for details). A total of 2919 proteins were identified. Protein-protein interactions were analysed in terms of their biological function using the COG (proteome-associated protein) and IPR (ion-associated protein) models [18] (see Materials and methods and Methods). A total of 339 protein models were investigated in terms of their biological functions. The COG models were compared to the IPR models by using the R-square test [19] using the set of COG model proteins (see Methods). For both the IPR and R-square tests, the experimental design was similar to that of the literature (see Methods).

A total of 608 proteins were identified in the C. neoformans wild type, and 1517 in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1). A total of 653 proteins were identified in the C. neoformans wild type, and 977 in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1). A total of 549 proteins were identified in the C. neoformans wild type, and 384 proteins were identified in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1). A total of 1416 proteins were identified in the C. neoformans wild type, and 228 proteins were identified in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1).

The total number of predicted proteins in the C. neoformans wild type was significantly higher than that in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1). A total of 56.2% of the C. neoformans wild type proteins were predicted in the C. neoformans cxh1 mutant, and 42.8% of the C. neoformans cxh1 mutant proteins were predicted in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant.

The total number of predicted proteins in the C. neoformans cxh1 mutant was significantly higher than that in the <U+0394>cxh1 mutant (Table 1). A total of 56.2% of the C.


## Discussion
In our experiments we found that nearly all of the fungi in the biofilm-forming ability test, including . fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. oryzae, and A. castellanii, have adapted to the biofilm-forming capacity of the yeast species. While the yeast species in the biofilm-forming ability test had the highest number of yeasts (46%), the yeasts in the biofilm-forming ability test were more abundant in A. fumigatus (18%) and A. flavus (15%), suggesting that they may be less adapted to the biofilm-forming capacity of A. fumigatus. However, A. fumigatus and A. flavus also had the highest number of C. albicans (10.8%) and C. glabrata (9.8%), which was consistent with the pattern in other biofilm-forming yeasts [36, 37]. This is consistent with the pattern in other species [39]. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that C. albicans and C. glabrata are less adapted to biofilm formation and therefore may be less adapted to the biofilm-forming capacity of the fungus.

The yeast species in the biofilm-forming ability test had the highest number of Aspergillus spp. (12%) and Penicillium spp. (1.8%). These results are consistent with the pattern in other species.

The other hypothesis is that C. albicans and C. glabrata are less adapted to biofilm formation and therefore may be less adapted to the biofilm-forming capacity of the fungus. The results of this study demonstrate that C. albicans and C. glabrata are less adapted to biofilm formation and therefore may be less adapted to the biofilm-forming capacity of the fungus.

A number of species in the biofilm-forming ability test in this study have been reported previously, which are C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. neoformans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C.
