## Abstract
The immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Pathogen recognition by the host and the microbial cell are the first steps of the immune response to an infectious event. In this study, we compared the occurrence of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis (CA) and the occurrence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) in the oral cavity of healthy adults.

In total, 125 oral tissues from 49 healthy subjects were examined. The incidence of Candida and C. albicans in the oral cavity of subjects with candidiasis was 2.2 and 2.5, respectively. The percentage of C. albicans in the oral cavity of subjects with pneumonia was 0.9 and 0.9, respectively. The incidence of C. albicans in the oral cavity of subjects with saprophytic oral lesions was 0.9 and 0.9, respectively. We found that C. albicans was present in 92.8% of C. albicans isolated isolates and in 64.4% of C. parapsilosis isolates.

Our results suggest that oral mucosal candidiasis is a manifestation of C. albicans infection in humans. The development of disease in C. albicans in the oral cavity of subjects with candidiasis is related to the occurrence of a Streptococcus pneumoniae induced oral lesions.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is a ubiquitous commensal and part of the normal microbiota of human skin, on the skin, mucosa, and mucosa around the mouth, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal tract. It can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. It is one of the most common human fungal pathogens, accounting for approximately 1.7 million cases of invasive fungal infections annually worldwide [1]. It is also an opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised patients, including HIV/AIDS patients and those with chronic lung disease, and it causes systemic infections ranging from superficial mucosal to deep-seated infections that can disseminate to the bloodstream and cause life-threatening disease [2]. The most common systemic fungal infections are candidiasis and candidosis, but C. albicans can also cause infections in other hosts, such as those infected with HIV/AIDS or in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer or who receive liposomal or cytotoxic chemotherapy [3,4]. The mortality associated with these infections is high, even with standard antifungal therapy, and the number of antifungal drug approvals has recently increased dramatically [5,6]. In addition, C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen, and it can cause life-threatening infections in patients who are not treated with the antifungals. In this review, we discuss the recent changes in antifungal drug development, and we offer a perspective on the current treatment options. The analysis of clinical cases is key to identifying the different types of antifungals, as the large majority of these treatments are limited to a single drug or group of drugs, which make treatment difficult.


## Methods

Antibiofilm activity of the anti-CD68 monoclonal antibody is proportional to the extent of the pathogen-associated leishmaniasis pathoge. Antibiofilm activity was defined as the reduction in the surface of the desired fungus in the presence of the pathogen after 30 days of incubation. The anticoagulant activity of the anti-CD68 monoclonal antibody was calculated by the percent reduction in the number of viable cells in a given time interval compared with the time of incubation.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the monoclonal antibody against the most frequent leishmaniasis-associated bacterium is the lowest concentration of the monoclonal antibody that is at least 1 µM of the drug’s MIC. The MIC of the most frequent bacterium in a given time interval was defined as the lowest concentration of the monoclonal antibody that was less than 1 µM in the lowest time interval, and was defined as a MIC value of the most frequent bacterium in that time interval.

The MIC of the most frequent bacterium in a given time interval was defined as the lowest concentration of the monoclonal antibody that was less than 1 µM in the lowest time interval, and was defined as a MIC value of the most frequent bacterium in that time interval.

Antibiofilm activity of the anti-CD69 monoclonal antibody is proportional to the extent of the pathogen-associated leishmaniasis pathogen in the body cavity. Antibiofilm activity was defined as the MIC of the monoclonal antibody against the most frequent leishmaniasis-associated bacterium in a given time interval. The MIC of the most frequent bacterium in a given time interval was defined as the MIC of the most frequent bacterium in that time interval, and was defined as a MIC value of the most frequent bacterium in that time interval.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the anti-CD69 monoclonal antibody against the most frequent leishmaniasis-associated bacterium is the lowest concentration of the monoclonal antibody that is at least 1 µM in the lowest time interval.


## Results
We next tested whether the association of leishmaniasis with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was a general phenomeno. We performed quantitative real-time PCR on CD4+ T lymphocyte cultures from noninfectious and moderately immunocompromised mice. The results showed that chronic lymphocytic leukemia and leishmaniasis co-cultures significantly enhanced leishmaniasis susceptibility in both groups of mice (Fig 3A). In contrast, Leishmania infection induced more severe leishmaniasis phenotypes in noninfectious mice (Fig 3B).

Leishmania infection induces a variety of innate immune responses
We next tested whether the association of leishmania with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was a general phenomenon. We first tested the association of leishmania infection with inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of immunocompromised and moderately immunocompromised mice. We found that Leishmania infection induced significant increases in the numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes from both groups of mice (Fig 4). As in the case of Leishmania infection, chronic lymphocytic leukemia also induced increased numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes from both groups of mice. In contrast, Leishmania infection induced a decrease in the numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes from both groups of mice.

## Discussion
The patient had presented with a fever, headache, seizures, and cognitive deficits. After a course of antibiotic therapy, the patient presented with pulmonary and neurological symptoms. Upon further investigation, the patient was diagnosed as Pneumocystis carinii.

The diagnosis of P. carinii was based on the histological examination of the upper lung. According to the literature, the lung is the site of most infections, including Pneumocystis carinii. In recent years, the number of Pneumocystis cases has been increasing. [3] The serology study performed by Aguirre-Patrón et al. [4] in their patient revealed an immunodeficiency, which is a possible cause of the patient's disease. [5] However, no serology was performed. [6]

In the current case report, the patient was diagnosed as P. carinii based on the histological examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and immunohistochemistry. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is an immunologic fluid that is used to collect granulomas. The patient presented with bronchiolitis which led to a bronchoscopic purulent lesion.

The diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii was based on the histological examination of the bronchial aspirate. The patient was diagnosed as P. carinii based on the histological examination of the bronchial aspirate.
