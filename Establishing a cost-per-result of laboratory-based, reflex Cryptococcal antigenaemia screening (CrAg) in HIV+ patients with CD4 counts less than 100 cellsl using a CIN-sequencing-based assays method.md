## Abstract
The yeast strains Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus are best known for their industrial applications in the biotechnology industry. A literature review identified six new species in Cryptococcus spp.


## Introduction
The genus Coryneum was established by Young (1962) to accommodate 12 species and contains more than 300 species described as extraradical mycocaryngiastic, pyriform, sporocarotiform, and cylindrical, and Coryneum spp. were found on almost every leaf of any plant examined (Lombard et al., 2017; de Hoog et al., 2017; De Bautista et al., 2017). The genus Coryneum is characterised by spore forming, stromatic, and hyphal structures, spore production, and the production of phialides, hyphae, and phialides-containing cells (de Hoog et al., 2017). Currently, an estimated 300 species are known from all over the world, with more than 100 species occurring in the Central United States (CUM) alone (Krüger et al., 2013). The genus Coryneum is characterised by spore forming, hyphal producing spore types, producing sclerotia and producing hyphae in many host genera. In addition to the species with hyphae, Coryneum spp. can be found on diverse other hosts (de Hoog et al., 2017). Species of Coryneum can be isolated from their host plants and produce phialides, hyphae, and spores. Coryneum spp. can be isolated from various plants and produce phialides, hyphae, and spores. Some species of Coryneum can be isolated from their host plants, such as Coryneum angusta and Coryneum lasi, and produce phialides and hyphae in others (de Hoog et al., 2017).

Fungi can cause diseases that can damage both human and animal health, and they can be found in all ecosystems, including plants, animals, soil, and water (Hickey, 2000). They can produce secondary metabolites that have medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and immunosuppressive activities, and have been implicated in immunity and immune modulation (Nemergut et al., 2003). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including the a-1,3-glucan synthase inhibitor caspofungin, have been described as potential novel drug targets against many pathogenic fungi.


## Methods
To avoid an additional cost-addition of additional time to develop CrAg in patients with CD4 count <100 cells/l, CrAg is included as a cost-effective strategy to expand CrAg screening in the College of Health Science. In addition, a cost-effectiveness study of CrAg in CD4+ counting patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/l using a CIN-sequencing-based assay [23] was conducted to determine the impact of increased costs on CrAg screening in HIV+ patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/l using a CIN-sequencing-based assay.

Study design and outcome
This study was performed with data from the Cryptococcal antigen assay-based assay, which is included in the College of Health Sciences “Evaluation of Cost-effectiveness”. This assay analyzes the incremental cost-effectiveness of a panel of clinical treatment options for the treatment of Cryptococcal meningitis and includes as a single endpoint the initial cost and initial efficacy rates (Figure 1). In addition, an analysis of the overall costs and outcomes of the CrAg screening approach was also performed to identify the most cost-effective and cost-effective strategies and strategies for expansion of the CrAg assay.

Participants were identified by matching their ages and gender to those who participated in the Cryptococcal antigen assay-based test. To ensure that CrAg was selected as an endpoint, we excluded participants with a history of hospitalization or other adverse drug reactions that could be explained by CrAg screening. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the College of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (protocol #13/2012) and written informed consent was provided by all participants who signed the informed consent. The initial screening of participants was done within the College of Health Sciences’ recommended framework, with a week-long screening at the completion of the screening.

The initial screening of CrAg-positive patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/l using a CIN-sequencing-based assay was conducted within the College of Health Sciences’ recommended framework, with a week-long screening at the completion of the screening. The initial screening of CrAg-positive patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/l using a CIN-sequencing-based assay was conducted within the College of Health Sciences’ recommended framework, with a week-long screening at the completion of the screening.


## Results
Of the 1,002 patients with CD4 counts less than 100 cells/l, 1,299 (1.1%) were screened with a CT-based CrAg. The sensitivity of the CrAg screening was 85.9%, and the specificity was 91.8%. The CrAg screening result was confirmed by a single patient and was validated by the CrAg screening results. The CrAg screening results showed that the CrAg screening results are sensitive and accurate.

## Discussion
This cost-per-result was estimated based on a study in an HIV-infected hospital with CrAg screening in a referral hospital in Malawi [25. The cost per false-positive CrAg test ranged between US$34 and US$122, with a median value of US$99 per test [26]. This study has some limitations. First, the cost per false-positive CrAg test was reported in the country. Second, CrAg screening could only be performed on patients with a CD4 count of 100 cells/l, but not on patients with a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/l, which is much lower than the cost per false-positive test reported by others [26]. The prevalence of CD4 depletion in our study may be underestimated because the CrAg screening was performed on patients with a CD4 count of 100 cells/l, although this test was not available in this setting. Third, the cost per false-positive test was reported in Malawi only in Malawi. The burden of the false-positive CrAg test was not reported in this setting. The costs associated with the CrAg screening were reported in this study (costs per test of CrAg screening in Malawi of $44.00, estimated cost of CrAg screening in Uganda of $43.00). The cost of the CrAg screening was estimated to be US$47.00, which is substantially higher than the cost of the CrAg screening in Uganda. Fourth, the cost per false-positive CrAg test was reported only in Malawi, which is a resource-limited setting. Thus, the cost per false-positive test in Malawi may be higher than the cost in Malawi, which is a resource-limited setting. Fifth, the cost per test was reported in Malawi only in Malawi. The cost per test in Malawi is estimated to be US$127. The cost per test in Malawi is also estimated to be US$31.20, which is significantly higher than the cost of the CrAg screening in Malawi. The cost per test in Malawi is estimated to be US$2.50, which is significantly higher than the cost of the CrAg screening in Malawi.
