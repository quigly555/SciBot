## Abstract
Infections with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans are common life-threatening infections. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these infections are acquired is important for improving therapeutic strategies to treat these infections. The pathogen Candida glabrata is the cause of human fungal infections, with different antifungal drug classes and drug resistance. We previously reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is essential for antifungal drug resistance and virulence. In this study, we show that the C. glabrata Pga7 mutant has mutations that prevent the integration of the native ß-glucan synthase Pga8 into the nucleus, and that the Pga7-GFP complex is required for PregA activity and cell wall integrity. A cDNA library constructed from the Pga7-GFP cell wall instead showed increased levels of ß-glucan, suggesting that Pga7 is required for ß-glucan synthesis. We found that Pga7 deletion reduced the pathogen’s ability to survive in macrophages, and our data reveal a previously unappreciated role of Pga7 in antifungal drug resistance.


## Introduction
PLHAM was found to be mediated by Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and to be mediated by Leukocyte Mature Silver Laceration Lig (LL-SPECT) which involves the formation of a fine-tuned, polarized tail (Nelson and Proctor, 2006. It has been shown that neutrophil-NETs interactions are not only beneficial in promoting neutrophil recruitment but also modulate the course of inflammation by facilitating migration of neutrophils and cytotoxic T-cell activities. NETs act in concert with the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-15 to induce neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site. The positive regulation of NF-<U+03BA>B recruitment is due to the induction of Th1-type cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-15 (Perry et al., 2013). In contrast, the negative regulation of neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissues by inflammatory cytokines is due to the inhibition of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) which consist of the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and TNF-a molecules. This inhibition is achieved by the formation of a polarized tail and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which are highly polarized and mediate immune effector functions (Chen et al., 2013; May et al., 2014).

In general, NETs are formed and mature within the nuclear envelope (Nelson and Proctor, 2006). In case of Leukocyte Nucleus and Plasminogen Activator, NETs are secreted into the cytoplasm and bind to proteins, resulting in formation of a bridge of membrane and cell wall that separates the nuclear envelope from the nucleus. NETs are activated by the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), which in turn directs the nuclear export into the cytosol where NETs are processed and delivered.


## Methods
For the present study, the FITC-labeled Leukocyte Nucleus was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 µg/mL gentamicin, and .8% sodium azide for 3-5 days at 37°C. The cells were then seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and cultured at 37°C for 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and the concentration of FITC was determined by using a spectrophotometer. For the assay, the FITC-labeled Leukocyte Nucleus was seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) and cultured at 37°C for 18 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. The cells were then washed with PBS and transferred to new 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) containing 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and transferred to a fresh 96-well microtiter plate. The fluorescence was then measured using a spectrophotometer. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells that had died and were alive compared to the control group.

In vitro Leukocyte-cell Interaction in Human Immunodeficient Infants
The in vitro interaction between Leukocyte Nucleus and Leukocyte Activation Factor (LENF) was performed as previously described [23]. The cells were cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and 50 µg/mL gentamicin at 37°C for 2 h. The cells were then seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) and cultured at 37°C for 18 h.


## Results
albicans yeast cells (SC5314. We used confocal microscopy to visualize the extent of neutrophil infiltration and the degree of caveation in infected mice (Fig 5). We used a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 µm combination of neutrophil-activated LPS (leukocytes, Fig 5) and chemoattractants (anti-mouse chemoattractants) to determine the degree of neutrophil recruitment in response to Leukocyte Nucleus (Fig 5). Interestingly, we found that when we used chemoattractants, we were able to induce neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection (Fig 5). In addition, we found that chemoattractants induced the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection (Fig 5). These observations suggest that the chemoattractants induced the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection.

Leukocyte Nucleus Is Necessary for Infection and Survival
To assess the role of neutrophils in infection and survival in the setting of Leukocyte Nucleus infection, we first established a model of Leukocyte Nucleus infection. For this, we chose mice with proven and previously shown disease, including invasive fungal infection with R. delemar, and chronic fungal infection with other opportunistic pathogens (20, 21). We then infected mice with LPS or chemoattractants, and then monitored survival and the ability of the mice to survive in the setting of Leukocyte Nucleus infection. We found that mice infected with LPS or chemoattractants survived for approximately four weeks (Fig 6). We also found that mice infected with LPS survived for approximately four weeks (Fig 6).

To validate the observation in the mouse model, we examined the outcome of the mouse model in the setting of Leukocyte Nucleus infection. We found that mice infected with LPS or chemoattractants survived for approximately four weeks (Fig 7). We also found that mice infected with LPS or chemoattractants survived for approximately four weeks (Fig 7).


## Discussion
Although we do not have data about the relationship between Leukocyte Nucleus and Plasminogen activator protein 1 (PL1-1) in vivo, it seems reasonable to expect that this response may be modulated by both Leukocyte Nucleus and Plasminogen activator in viv. We speculate that the pathways regulating the immune response in Leukocyte Nucleus and Plasminogen activator could be similar in vivo to those in vivo.

The notion that Nucleus-Plasminogen activator regulates immune responses, in contrast to the role of Leukocyte Nucleus in innate immunity, could have implications for the role of other cellular receptors and receptors, such as TLR4, in the regulation of the immune response. The finding that the leukocyte-plasminogen activator response in vivo is likely to be similar to that in vitro suggests that this response may be modulated by cellular receptors in vivo. The finding that there is a reduction in the levels of neutrophil cytokine and chemokine production in the leukocyte-plasminogen activator response to high levels of neutrophil stimulation is consistent with the notion that neutrophils are modulators of the innate immune response to leukocyte-plasminogen activator therapy. The finding that there is a reduction in neutrophil cytokine and chemokine production in the leukocyte-plasminogen activator response to high levels of neutrophil stimulation may suggest that neutrophils are more likely to be modulators of the innate immune response to leukocyte-plasminogen activator therapy. The finding that there is a reduction in the levels of the transcription factor Casp1 and that it is also downregulated in the leukocyte-plasminogen activator response to high levels of neutrophil stimulation indicates that leukocyte-plasminogen activator therapy may be more likely to modulate the immune response in response to leukocyte-plasminogen activator therapy.
