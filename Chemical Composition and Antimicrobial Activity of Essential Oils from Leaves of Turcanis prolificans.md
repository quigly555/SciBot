## Abstract
Trichophyton tonsurans is an important anthropophilic dermatophyte, causing high incidences of superficial dermatophytosis and invasive dermatophytosis in humans, animals, and insects. In the past three decades, the genome sequences of T. tonsurans have been the focus of many studies, including the identification of a key enzyme enzyme gene, asparaginase-re-producing cells (AKCRs). This information revolutionized the understanding of the biology of T. tonsurans and its role in the host-pathogen interaction.

The genome sequences of T. tonsurans were compared to those of other dermatophyte species and their genomes were sequenced. The genomes of T. tonsurans and T. tonsurans with different mating types were also compared. The genes and proteins involved in the two different mating types were identified. The genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites were expressed in different tissues, in different organisms, and in T. tonsurans.


## Introduction
This genus is characterized by short and thick leaves, arranged in small groups, and with short stalk, which are similar in appearance to those of the Cinnamomum sp. and Cinnamomum spp. (Coyne, 1831). The leaves are densely branched with small, dark brown fruits and are densely covered with tulas, which are long, dark brown, and olive-green, resembling those of the Cinnamomum spp. (Coyne, 1831). The fruit is brown, sub-sensuous, and with short stalk, while the fruits are covered in dark brown tulas (Coyne, 1831). The tulas are aseptate, giving rise to a lateral spike, which is the last characteristic of the genus Turcanium. The spikes are long, dark brown, and with short stalk, which are short and long with long ends. The spikes are cylindrical, with long spikes of greenish conidia, and with long spikes of yellowish conidia. The conidia are short and long, and the tips are long and long with long ends (Coyne, 1831). The conidia are globose, with long spines, with long spines, and long spines. The conidiogenous cells are conidiogenous and discrete, and the conidia are small, dark brown, and with long spines. The length of the spines is 12-34 µm, the width of the spines is 20-29 µm, and the width of the spines is 50-100 µm. Conidiophores are generally solitary, and the chains are short, consisting of short chains of cells. The chains are large with a short neck, and the chains are long, dark brown, and with long spines. The conidiogenous cells are usually dimorphic, and the conidiogenous cells are variable, which is the case of the nuclei, which are rarely separated and the nuclei of which are sometimes very closely linked (Coyne, 1831). The dimorphic conidia are borne by conidiophores of the order Capnodiales (Coyne, 1831), which are followed by ascospores, which are borne by the phialides, which are followed by ascospores.


## Methods
 2004) with slight modification. Leaf water was used as control. For the determination of EO content, the samples were divided into two parts, and each was dissolved in 10 mM NaOH and 10 mM HEPES. The EO content was then diluted with water to obtain a concentration of 0.1 mg mL^-1. The EO concentration of the 1% control and the 1% treated samples were 0.5 mg mL^-1. This was followed by the addition of 10 mM NaOH and 10 mM HEPES to reach a final EO concentration of 5 mg mL^-1. The same procedure was followed for the determination of antifungal activity of essential oil of the Arabidopsis plants.

Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils from Leaves of Arabidopsis
The antifungal activity of essential oil of the plant leaves of Arabidopsis was determined using the microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 document. Briefly, the essential oil was diluted in a series of 10 mM NaOH to a concentration of 5 µg mL^-1, and then, 10 µL of this diluted solution was added to the test microdilution strips. The solutions were kept at 4 °C until use. The final concentrations of the essential oil were 1.25%, 2.25%, 5.25%, 10.25%, and 20%, respectively. The microdilution was repeated twice. The resulting concentrations of the essential oil were 1.25%, 2.25%, 5.25%, 10.25%, and 20%, respectively. The results were expressed as the mean ± SEM. The experiment was repeated three times.

The fungicidal activity of essential oils was significantly decreased by 50% at concentrations of .5 and 0.8 µg/mL (Fig 1). The MIC of essential oil was significantly reduced by 100% at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.8 µg/mL (Fig 2). The fungicidal activity of the essential oil from Turcanis prolificans against the pathogen E. dermatitidis was also evaluated. The fungicidal activity of the essential oil from Turcanis prolificans was significantly decreased by 60% at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.8 µg/mL (Fig 3). These results demonstrated that the essential oils from Turcanis prolificans were highly fungicidal and that they were also effective against several bacterial pathogens.
