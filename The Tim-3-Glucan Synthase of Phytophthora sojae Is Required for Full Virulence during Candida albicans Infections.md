## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in organ transplant patients. Here we report the first case of a disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient receiving a laparoscopic right biopsy. A laparoscopic biopsy revealed a subcutaneous abscess in a patient receiving chemotherapy and radiation. The abscess was removed by surgical debridement, which resulted in a full and improved disease course. This is the first report of a case of a disseminated cryptococcosis in a kidney recipient receiving a laparoscopic biopsy. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough examination including surgery, debridement, and surgical debridement in the identification and treatment of invasive fungal infections.


## Introduction
Moreover, the yeast-to-hypha transition of . sojae and P. sojae cells during infection is critical for the full virulence of both species. Phytophthora sojae cells are distinguished from P. sojae cells by a hypha, while P. sojae cells are largely devoid of hyphae. Hence, the production of hyphae by P. sojae and P. sojae cells is essential for their virulence.

The genes coding for proteins involved in the hyphal transition are organized in the Tor-like protein (TPI) family [17], [18]. TPI proteins contain a single cysteine residue (TPI_2C) and a conserved domain. The TPI_2C proteins contain a GPI-anchored domain and a conserved tetratricopeptide motif (T motif) that binds the cysteine residues on the cysteine residues. The cysteine residue is electro-poliolate and contains the conserved motif. After binding to the T-ATPase, the TPI_2C proteins undergo a conformational change and bind to the T-ATPase. The TPI_2C proteins then undergo a conformational change and form a new TPI-binding protein (Tpb1). The TPI-binding protein forms the N-terminal structure of the TPI_2C proteins. Tpb1 binds to the T-ATPase by the conformational change and form the T-ATPase complex (Tcc). The T-ATPase complex interacts with the cysteine residue and forms a new complex. The T-ATPase complex is then transported to the vacuole and processed by the vacuole-associated protein (VAP) complex (Cascass) [19]. The T-ATPase complex is the major determinant of the hyphal growth phenotype of both species. The hyphal growth phenotype is dependent on the protein levels and is highly regulated by the protein levels of the T-ATPase [20], [21].

The ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth is a key virulence factor that can be controlled. Yeast species that do not form true hyphae are highly preferred for virulence. Several species of the Candida genus can form true hyphae, such as C. albicans and C.


## Methods
% KCl (Sigma-Aldrich) in a .5% saline solution and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, 10 µL of the culture supernatant were added to a 10 ml microtube (Enzo Life Sciences). The number of cells in the supernatant was monitored using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm (Shimadzu UV-1800, Shimadzu Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was used as a negative control. The number of Candida species was determined using the Candida cell count method. The Candida cells count was based on counting the number of colonies with at least three Candida species. The Candida cell count of Candida isolates was determined by a cell count reader (SpectraMax i3, Molecular Devices, USA) at a cell density of 2.0 × 10^6/ml. Candida cells were enumerated in blood samples and were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell count was calculated using the CellQuest Software (Bio-Rad, USA).

In order to analyze the virulence of Candida albicans on mice, mice were infected with 1 × 10^6 Candida spp. in a volume of 100 µL of saline containing 0.1% KCl and 0.1% Sytox Blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich) by subcutaneous injection. The animals were kept under a 12 h light-dark cycle in a specific pathogen-free environment. The mice were allowed to acclimate to the cage for 14 d and then were injected with 100 µL of saline (4 × 10^6 Candida spp. in 100 µL of saline). The mice were monitored for weight loss at 7 d after administration of the infection and then the numbers of dead and alive mice were recorded. The number of viable Candida spp. in the mice was determined after 7 d of infection by calculating the percentage of Candida spp. in the control group and the percentage of viable Candida spp. in the infected group. The number of Candida spp. that died or were considered dead was calculated.


## Results
We therefore investigated the potential roles of proteins with a high homology to trans-membrane proteins in . albicans virulence. We first tested the ability of the Candida virulence factors to induce full virulence in Candida albicans (Figure 4). While we could not directly determine whether Candida virulence is induced by Candida virulence factors or by trans-membrane proteins, we could hypothesize that C. albicans does not require trans-membrane proteins to cause disease. We also tested the ability of the Candida virulence factors to induce full virulence in Candida glabrata (Figure 4). Candida glabrata can infect host tissues by engulfing the live cells, which are secreted into the host by a host immune response. We found that Candida glabrata can also induce full virulence by using a high dose of IL-12 (100 µg/ml) or by using a low dose of IL-4 (50 µg/ml) [36], [37]. In contrast, Candida glabrata can only induce full virulence by using the high dose of IL-10 (100 µg/ml) or by using a low dose of IL-4 (50 µg/ml) [37], [38], [39]. Although we cannot rule out that the high dose of IL-12 could be the reason for full virulence, the results suggest that Candida glabrata may require a high dose of IL-12 for full virulence.

Trans-membrane proteins can be up-regulated by environmental cues, such as a strong interaction with the host immune system [40], [41], [42]. We therefore tested the ability of the Candida virulence factors to induce full virulence in the presence of environmental cues. We found that C. albicans was highly susceptible to the effects of IL-12 or IL-4, and that the virulence factor was up-regulated in the presence of IL-12 or IL-4. Interestingly, in contrast to C. albicans, C. glabrata did not show the phenotype of a virulent Candida strain (Figure 5). We therefore speculate that the Candida virulence factors may be up-regulated by environmental cues.


## Discussion
During the first 2 days of contact with the host, the fungus must first establish its appressori. In this phase, the fungus needs to use the cell wall for adhesion to the host tissue. In the presence of bacteria, the fungus must also have a special niche for the cell wall, to facilitate penetration of the host. The cell wall is composed of polysaccharides, which are the primary building blocks for cell wall biosynthesis [26], and therefore they are important in protecting the fungus from bacterial attack [27]. Therefore, the mechanisms that enable the fungus to make fungal cell wall components are crucial for its survival and pathogenicity [28].

The effect of phytophthora to the fungal cell wall is mainly mediated by phytohormone-induced transcription factors, such as TFs, which are key transcription factors for the transcription of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and stress tolerance [29]. In Phytophthora sojae, three TFs, such as UTR4, FKBP1 and UTR5, are important for the synthesis of U-mannose, a component of the cell wall [30]. UTR1, UTR2, UTR3, and UTR4 are involved in cell wall biosynthesis and stress tolerance [31,32]. The combination of UTR4 and TFs are required for full virulence of Phytophthora sojae and the pathogen in this case.

The ability of P. sojae to grow in media containing glycerol (C-6: 1: 1) and oleic (C-4: 0: 1) has been reported [33]. These glycerol compounds can be used as nutrients for the fungus. In the presence of glycerol, P. sojae can grow in a culture containing glucose, glycerol, and oleic acid. It also takes advantage of the fact that oleic acid is a key constituent of the cell wall of P. sojae. The addition of glycerol to the culture medium can be used as carbon sources for the growth of the fungus [34].

In addition to the glycerol, the oleic acid, can be used to the growth of P. sojae.
