## Abstract
Autophagy is a non-selective intracellular process, which is essential for development, alloiuethe cytoplasmic tailoring of a response to environmental cues or stimuli. Since the full function of autophagy machinery has been demonstrated to be essential for growth in eukaryotes, the question is not only how do they gain this machinery but also how they can improve upon it. This study deals with the interaction between myeloid and non-myeloid cells, a group of eukaryotic cells, and autophagy-related machinery. For it to be true, it is necessary to understand and understand duplication and diversification in the machinery. Deletion of the autophagy-related genes did not only lead to the formation of new genes, but also to the growth defect of myeloid cells, which is not observed in the normal cell. We found that the deletion of all three genes affected the regulation of the cell wall integrity. The deletion of orthologous autophagy-related genes resulted in a loss of the autophagy pathway and reduced cell viability, a defect which was also observed in the cell viability when the cells were treated with different chemicals.


## Introduction
Marine algae are among the most abundant and diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth. They form a highly diversified group of organisms with a rich potential to be exploited as pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredients.


## Methods

The effect of para-phenylhydrazone (PTH) on cell wall by the Anopheles brasiliensis Anopheles Exophiala yeast cells was assessed by exposing the cell wall of the Anopheles brasiliensis yeast cells (Anopheles fumigatus) to an anaerobic environment of .5% oxygen. The photosensitizer, PTH, was used to determine the cell wall permeability of the yeast cells and its effect on the extracellular ß-glucan, ß-glucosidase, and ß-tubulin, respectively. For this purpose, the yeast cells (10^6, 10^6, and 10^6 cells/mL) were cultured for 18 h in the dark at 37°C with constant agitation of 200 rpm. The tubes were then exposed to anaerobic conditions for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the supernatant was carefully removed with a sterile spatula. The samples were treated with 10% (v/v) ethanol, and the samples were subsequently centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min, 10°C). The pellet containing the ß-glucan and ß-glucosidase was washed with ethanol, and the pellet containing ß-tubulin was washed with ethanol. The samples were then treated with 10% (v/v) ethanol, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet containing the anaerobic extracellular ß-glucan was washed with ethanol, and the supernatant was washed with ethanol. The samples were incubated with 10% (v/v) ethanol, and the absorbance at 540 nm was determined. The Anopheles brasiliensis yeast cells were compared to the control with a cell-permeability test [58].

To determine the percentage of the cell wall degradation, the suspension of Aspergillus strains was prepared by mixing 10^6 cells in 5 mL of cell-permeable HBSS (HyClone-3:100, HyClone-3:100, HyClone-3:100, HyClone-3:100, HyClone-3:100, HyClone-3:100) with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min.


## Results
The production of polyketides is essential for fungal viability and in many cases the biosynthesis of polyketides is linked to the biosynthesis of other compounds, such as flavonoids and terpenoids [23,24. Polyketides are identified as a group of secondary metabolites that can be synthesized in the metabolism of fungi. However, these secondary metabolites are also synthesized in a wide range of different biochemical reactions in the host environment.

The degradation of polyketides by E. coli [25] and the degradation of polyketides by E. coli [26] were demonstrated by direct analysis of the polyketide degradation enzymes in the E. coli database. Proteolysis of polyketides is mediated by multiple enzymes such as phospholipid and phospholipase enzymes. The degradation of polyketide polyketides was shown to occur via the degradation of the non-ribosomal peptide, which is also converted into polyketide by the degradation of a polyketide glycosylphosphate (PPG). Protein glycosylphospholipid (PPG) is also an important building block of fungal cell membranes, and PPG is involved in the interaction with P450, P450-P450 (P450-P450) glycosylphosphate (PPG-PPG) in fungal membranes [27]. In E. coli, PPG is an essential enzyme and a precursor of PPG, which is also converted into PPG by the degradation of PPG-PPG and PPG-PPGP [27].

The degradation of polyketide polyketides is a key pathway of fungal pathogenesis and resistance to the many pathogens that enter into the host. The degradation of polyketide polyketides in E. coli is shown in Figure 3.


## Discussion
fumigatus was cultivated on sugar-based medium and fed on glucose (9g of sugar per day) for the first 4 hours of growt. The final product of the reaction was hydroxy-cinnamic acid (HCO_3) (Table 1). The overall growth rate of the yeast was not significantly different from that of the native species, but it had a 2.4-fold increased rate at day 0. The final product of the reaction was, in comparison, a compound consisting of one sugar-coated cofactor, one amino acid, and two ammonium salts. The maximum yield (2.1 g/L of sugar) was achieved at day 14, when glucose was present.

Biological characterization of A. fumigatus
The biofilm formation was investigated by screening strains for a broad range of bacterial and fungal virulence factors, including resistance to cation-releasing drug caspofungin. The biofilm formation of A. fumigatus in the presence of caspofungin (Table 1) was recorded in two different assays, CD-WASH and simultaneous incubation of A. fumigatus with caspofungin (Table 2). As shown in Fig 2, the concentration-time of CD-WASH experiment was 7 h, and simultaneous incubation of A. fumigatus with caspofungin (Table 2) was performed (Table 3). The CD-WASH experiments were performed at a concentration of 100 µg/ml and the highest yield was achieved at the beginning of the experiment.
