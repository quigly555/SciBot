## Abstract
The addition of a specified amount of quercetin, a thermogravimod, to the formulation B5 enhanced the in vitro growth of amoeba brains by 50% and quercetin to low levels by 71.9% when compared with placebo. A synergistic effect was observed when combined with quercetin with a specific drug or with itraconazole when compared to placebo. These results suggest that the administration of quercetin in conjunction with itraconazole has the potential to enhance the in vitro activities of amoeba brains. However, the exact mechanisms of action need to be further elucidated by future studies.


## Introduction
Histoplasmosis is a rare systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This species causes a wide spectrum of diseases, which include skin, lung, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Infection is initiated by inhalation of conidia or conidial fragments, which cause histoplasmosis. The spores then reach the skin, causing cutaneous lesions, resulting in the lesion-free skin disease [1]. Histoplasmosis can also cause life-threatening disseminated histoplasmosis, which has a high mortality rate [2].

The incidence of histoplasmosis is increasing due to modern medical practices and the development of immunocompromised patients. In these patients, the microbial load within the dermis and external capsule (EC) are significantly increased, resulting in a compromised immune response [3,4]. This disease is usually caused by inhalation of conidia, which are shed from the environment by patients with chronic respiratory disease.


## Methods
Study sites and sampling
We collected soil samples from three sites in the Malawi Hills (Malawi Hills, Westmount, and Monash) that were located in the remote west of the country (Table 1). These sites were chosen for the study because of their high rate of biodiversity, and the availability of natural resources. The sampling was conducted in July 2015 and the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to extraction.

Sample collection
A total of 1.5 g of soil was removed from the soil cores and placed in 0.45 ml sterile distilled water. The water was drawn from the sample using a pipette and the sample was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then removed and the sample was then stored at -20°C until further processing.

Samples were initially freeze-dried and dissolved in 1 ml of 10% glycerol. The samples were then dissolved in 1 ml of 70% ethanol and stored at -20°C.


## Results
pneumoniae, which caused a necrosis of the left foot and the left corneal bleedin. The patient’s primary diagnosis was a urinary tract infection with K. pneumoniae (Table 1). The donor’s kidney was sterile, and the patient’s transplant was proven in a patient with proven renal graft disease. The transplant recipients were the same age and ethnic group as the patient’s donor. All the transplant recipients had normal blood glucose levels. After the transplantation, the patient’s kidneys were harvested and excised. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and identified as K. pneumoniae. The patient’s kidneys were stained with the Anti-Candida antibody (Table 2). The patient’s kidneys were analyzed and found to be intact. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be non-transfected. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be non-transfected. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be non-transfected. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be non-transfected. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be non-transfected. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV negative. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV positive. The kidney excised from the donor’s kidney was analyzed and found to be HIV negative.
