## Abstract
The origin of life remains a central question at the center of our planet, and the question remains as to what it might have been. Numerous studies have addressed the nature of microbes in various environments, including agriculture, urbanization, water resources, and medicine. However, the origin of life outside agriculture or medicine is less understood, and less is known about the relationships between these different groups. In this study, we analyzed the diversity of the bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic communities associated with the wheat stems and roots of Turcuta tritici (Turcuta oryza) collected from the Qinghai and East China. Turcuta samples were collected from all three World Heritage Zones 3 and 4 and subjected to 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Results showed that the bacterial community was dominated by the genus Firmicutes (26.4%), followed by Proteobacteria (8.3%) and Chloroflexi (3.4%). Among eukaryotes, only Chloroflexi was found. The fungi and the helminthic and micromorphological groups were found only in the Turcuta samples, while the bacterial community was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. These results provide evidence for the existence of microbial communities that were not found in cultivated soil and suggest that cultivated soil does not provide sufficient conditions to make possible the functional and biocontrol functions of microbial communities that were present in cultivated soil, which may explain the variation in radiological responses to different treatments and outcome of disease.


## Introduction
carotene. The strain was then further incubated in W. carotenei broth, diluted in ethanol agar, with 1.5% hydroalcoholic (H_2O) acetonitrile, and incubated at 30 °C, for 10 min, followed by 10 min of incubation at 22 °C and 10 min at 30 °C, for 10 min at 30 °C. The culturable yeast Stilbenus stilbenus was grown on the air-labile E.


## Methods
The strain was isolated from an adult (adult oryzae) tree and named after the treekeeper (.H.) P.C. Wiedemann. It was maintained in sterile conditions and kept at 4°C.

Agar agar
Agar agar (AAG) was prepared from a type of A. fumigatus strain grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) for 2 days at 28°C. The strain was subcultured on AAG plates to obtain pure cultures. The mycelia of the culture were collected, washed, and frozen. The mycelia were suspended in sterile water to release the mycelia. The mycelia suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was collected. The biomass was concentrated by ultrafiltration in a cellulose membrane (Qiagen). The concentrated mycelia were used for RNA extraction.

Chitinase assay
Chitinase (CAY12) is a basic enzyme of the basidiomycete fungi. It is active in the production of FAMEs and catalase. The assays were carried out with the different CAY12 media (HBSS, pH 7.0) containing 3 mM L-DOPA and 0.1 mM H_2O_2 and incubated for 2 days at 37°C. Chitinase activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm and the absorbance of the CAY12 medium was measured at the same wavelength (450 nm for FAMEs and 500 nm for catalases) using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop; Shimadzu).

SDS-PAGE and Western blot
The purified chitinase was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (SDS-PAGE, Bio-Rad). The spots were excised using the Tissue-Tek method and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBS, pH 7.4, 150 mM Tris-Cl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% SDS) at room temperature for 30 min.


## Results
This is in contrast with the state of fresh leaf of Methanopyrus fenneliana, which is a common leaf of Methanopyrus rottenselm, which was found to be attached to the leaves of Methanopyrus rottingselm, which was found to be a disease on rottensel. This result could be due to the intrinsic nature of Methanopyrus rottingselm, as decaying leaves of decaying leaves have a high level of decay.

The present study provides a new perspective on the evolution of the metabolism of Methanopyrus, highlighting the growth and the formation of the fungus during a medicinal garden. Methanopyrus (Berk.) Q. Chen & L. Cai, comb. nov. - MycoBank MB815942; Fig 4

## Discussion

We found that isolate Stilbenus eldamoeba was capable of forming a biofilm in vitro with high biomass, but exhibited no effect on cellulase activit. We found that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 harbored the highest biomass for cellulase and had the highest cellulase activity of all isolates tested (Fig 4B). It is possible that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could use enzymes for degradation of cellobiose and cellulose. Our results support the hypothesis that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could utilize cellulose for biofilm formation.

We found that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could use enzymes for degradation of plant cellobiose and cellulose. Our results support the hypothesis that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could utilize cellulose for biofilm formation. Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could use the antibiotic Eclofenac to form a biofilm in vitro. We observed that Eclofenac could inhibit biofilm formation of Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 (Fig 5). These results strongly suggest that Stilbenus eldamoeba strain PYG39 could use cellulose to form a biofilm in vitro.

We also found that strain PYG39 had the highest biomass, but the cellulase activity of this isolate was only 0.31% of that of the previously characterized strain S. cerevisiae (data not shown). The ability of strain PYG39 to form biofilm was not independent of the presence of Eclofenac, and only weak production of cellulase was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of Eclofenac (Fig 3A). Eclofenac is a metabolite that is produced in many biofilms and can be converted into glucose-6-phosphate and l-ornithine by bacteria and fungi [47]. This result indicates that Eclofenac may be required for biofilm formation.

The highest cellulase activity of strain PYG39 was found in the presence of Eclofenac and that was higher than that of the strain S. cerevisiae (Fig 2).
