## Abstract
The yeast strains Cryptococcus laurentii JCM 12755 and Cryptococcus albidus JCM 12756 were grown in a plate culture on a plate reader under optimized conditions at 4 °C. The growth parameters were determined using the CellMapper program. The maximum cell mass (CBM) and cell number of C. laurentii JCM 12755 and C. albidus JCM 12756 in plate culture media were 1.4 and 1.5 × 102, respectively. The colonies were inoculated in a plate culture and were found to be susceptible to liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB), posaconazole, and itraconazole. In particular, the colonies exhibited significantly increased colony dry cell numbers with low levels of resistance to all three antifungal classes. Colony morphology was affected in different growth phases of C. laurentii. In the polarized growth tests, the colonies were observed to grow at 37 °C for 30 min and at 2 °C for 5 min. Furthermore, the results were corroborated by light measurements. In the scanning electron microscopy analyses, the colonies were clearly seen to arise with irregularly shaped colonies.


## Introduction
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening infection caused by a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and is the most common invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients (Fisher et al., 2005; Sassetti et al., 2006; Liti et al., 2009). The most common antifungal agents used in the treatment of IA include azoles, which target ergosterol biosynthesis and contribute to fungal virulence (Nelson and Goldman, 2005; Lee et al., 2009). A. fumigatus is a saprophytic mold that can cause severe allergic reactions, and a variety of enzymes are involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis (Liti et al., 2009).


## Methods
In addition to identifying non-targeting bacteria and fungi, the assay detects the presence of yeasts and mol. In addition to a recent study [36], the extraction of P. brasiliensis yeasts was also shown to detect yeasts and filamentous fungi [37].

The specificity of the assay is in accordance with our previous work which showed that yeasts produced by the yeast and filamentous fungi are closely related [38], [39]. In fact, a recent study [40], showing that the detection of fungi is similar to the detection of bacteria, showed that the detection of yeast cells from the cytotoxic conditions is similar to the detection of bacteria [41]. The assay detects the presence of non-targeting bacteria. The specificity is in accordance with our previous work which showed that the detection of bacteria is identical to the detection of fungi [40].

The efficiency of the assay is in accordance with our previous work [36]. In a previous study, the assay was applied to a whole blood sample from a healthy subject, and the results revealed that the patient was at a higher risk for the infection of the liver. Therefore, this procedure was also applied to a whole blood sample, and the results revealed that the results of this procedure were similar to the results of a conventional blood assay [42]. Furthermore, the results revealed that the efficiency of the assay was in accordance with our previous study [39]. In fact, this assay was also applied to a whole blood sample.

2.4. Statistical Analyses
The results of the experiment were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The results were analyzed by using SPSS software version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data was analyzed with SPSS software version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

2.5. Nucleic Acid Extraction and DNA Isolation
Nucleic acid extraction was performed as previously described [39]. However, the amplification and purification of the universal ITS1 and ITS4 primers was required. The quantity and quality of the extracted DNA was analyzed by using NanoDrop® spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel for 1 h at 20 V.


## Results
The chemistries of plant cell wall degrading enzymes are consistent with their putative function in plant-microorganism interactions [4. We have previously shown that the growth of S. sclerotiorum is controlled by a key enzyme, pectinases, while the growth of S. sclerotiorum is not affected by a pectinase inhibitor [4]. The active pectinases, pectate hydrolases, and pectin hydrolysis enzymes are present in the genome of S. sclerotiorum, while the pectate hydrolases are absent in S. sclerotiorum. The observed differences in the growth and activity of S. sclerotiorum strains are consistent with the previous reports that identified pectinases as the most abundant and efficient cell wall degrading enzymes in S. sclerotiorum [4].

Genome-wide comparison of pectinase and pectate hydrolase activities
In order to characterize the cellular pectinase activity profile, we employed a combination of standard pectate hydrolase and pectinase activity assays. The observed differences in pectate hydrolase and pectate hydrolase activities in S. sclerotiorum strains were significant, being the highest in strains <U+0394>psA and <U+0394>psC, and the lowest in strains <U+0394>psD and <U+0394>psD/psD. All strains were evaluated for their ability to degrade pectin, which is a well-known pectate hydrolase inhibitor [4]. The S. sclerotiorum strain <U+0394>psD/psD (P<0.001) exhibited the highest pectate hydrolase activity, with a reduction of 1.8-fold relative to the corresponding control strain, whereas <U+0394>psD/psD exhibited a reduction of 2.4-fold relative to the corresponding control strain. In contrast, the P<0.001 control strain was not able to degrade pectin at all (Table 1). These data suggest that pectinase and pectate hydrolase activities are significantly different between S. sclerotiorum and S. sclerotiorum strains.


## Discussion

The production of biocontrol compounds using ascorbic acid as a precursor, a chemical precursor, and a fungal-producing fungus as a carbon source are not only desirable, but also promising in future bioprocesses for biofuel productio. For instance, a potential biocontrol agent, ABT, was developed as a carbon source for biodiesel production from a pectin-based lignin-based lignin-based biofuel-based biomass. These biofuel-based biomass produced from pectin-based lignin-based biomass were also used in the following fermentation processes: biofuel production from pectin-based lignin-based biofuel, biofuel production from pectin-based lignin-based biofuel, and biofuel production from pectin-based lignin-based biofuel. The biofuel production from pectin-based lignin-based biofuel was also conducted on the basis of the biocontrol activity of the A. aculeatus strain ATCC 18-1021, a genetic strain of A. oryzae, and the F. graminearum strain ATCC 1601, which are all characterized by high biomass yields. The biocontrol activity of this strain was attributed to the production of biofungicides, such as a-pinene, tetracycline, and anhydromethoxysergide. The biocontrol activity was also attributed to the production of antifungal compounds such as a-pinene, a-terpineol, and a-nagatae.

In this work, the production of biofungicides, such as pectin-based lignin-based biofuel, was tested in combination with various concentrations of the compounds produced in the process of fermentation. The effect of the combined compounds on the production of biocontrol compounds was evaluated in the following fermentation processes: pectin-based lignin-based biofuel, pectin-based biofuel, and pectin-based biofuel produced from pectin-based biofuel. The results are shown in Figure 3.

The production of biocontrol compounds by the combination of the biocontrol and the biocontrol agents was investigated.
