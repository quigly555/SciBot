## Abstract
Lactoferrin (Lf) is a plant hormone with immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, and other adverse effects. Several studies have reported that its absorption into tissues is inhibited or prevented by different drugs, and different concentrations of Lf were administered during the course of experimental arthritis. We previously reported that Lf was detected in the serum of animals treated with Amphotericin B (AB) and flucytosine (5FC), and the concentrations of Lf in the blood were also examined. The serum concentrations of Lf were also measured in whole animals. The present results showed that the serum concentrations of Lf were significantly increased in the AB group, and the concentrations of Lf in the 5FC group were decreased. We also measured the effect of Lf on the kidneys of wild-type and complemented strains of A. fumigatus. The results showed that the serum levels of Lf were increased in the AB group, but the concentrations of Lf were decreased in the 5FC group. These results indicate that the serum concentrations of Lf are detectable in the AB group and we suggest that the administration of Lf may alter the immunosuppressive effects of AB and/or 5FC.


## Introduction
Bacteria are a ubiquitous and ancient component of the natural microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract of all humans. With the advent of intensive antibiotic treatment, the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has increased by over a billion times and the global health burden has increased by more than a million cases each year, resulting in an ever-increasing number of deaths from a variety of causes [1]. In recent years, several studies have described a distinct human microbial community characterized by diverse populations of bacteria with antimicrobial activity [2]. The number of bacteria colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract is a highly variable and dynamic phenomenon, and depending on the stage of the gastrointestinal tract, the microbial community can range from simple community-dwelling bacteria (bacteria from the Firmicutes) to complex and diverse bacterial community with various clinical and pathological characteristics [3].


## Methods
Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min, and then were then observed using a Leica DMR microscope with a Gatan Eclipse T100 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany. The BSA was dissolved in ethanol and directly used for the preparation of the BSA-based biosensor-based fungal cell wall-based extract. The BSA was diluted to 0.2% (w/v) with distilled water and then spread on YM agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 2000×g for 5 min and the pellets were washed three times with distilled water. The pellets were suspended in PBS and the OD_535 of each sample was measured using a spectrophotometer (Biotek, Tokyo, Japan) at a wavelength of 570 nm. The experiment was repeated three times. The results were expressed as the percentage of fungal cells that were stained with the original medium, and were considered to be significant when P < 0.05.

In order to evaluate the effects of the reagents on the growth of the fungus on the planktonic cells, we coated the cells with 1.0 µM of Aspergillus fumigatus (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), 1.0 µM of Fusarium oxysporum (Biotek, Tokyo, Japan), 1.0 µM of S. cerevisiae (Biotek, Tokyo, Japan), and 1.0 µM of Aspergillus clavatus (Biotek, Tokyo, Japan). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000×g for 5 min and washed three times with distilled water. The cells were suspended in PBS and the OD_535 of each sample was measured using a spectrophotometer (Biotek, Tokyo, Japan). The experiment was repeated three times. The results were expressed as the percentage of fungal cells that were stained with the original medium, and were considered to be significant when P < 0.05.

## Results
As shown in Fig 3, the inhibition was largely dependent on the combination of peptide concentrations and the bioactivity of the peptide was shown by a synergistic effect of peptides 5, 6 and 7 (Fig 3. The combination of peptide 7 did not have any synergistic effect on the inhibitory effect. However, peptide 8, 10, 12 and 13 did have an inhibitory effect, with an inhibition of 15 and 16%, respectively. However, peptide 11, 12 and 13 had an inhibitory effect, with an inhibition of 6 and 8%, respectively.

Bioactive Peptides Deterrieuse and Invertebrate Activity
The effect of the peptides on the inhibitory activity of bioactive peptides was also evaluated using a bioassay. As shown in Fig 4, the bioactivity of peptides 12 and 13 was significantly inhibited by peptide 8, 12 and 13, with a concentration of 10 and 15%, respectively. Similarly, the bioactivity of peptide 12 and 13 was significantly inhibited by peptide 8, 12 and 13, with a concentration of 10 and 15%, respectively. However, the peptide 13 was not active against the bioactivity of peptides 12 and 13.

Bioactive Peptides Deterrieuse and Invertebrate Activity
The inhibitory effect of the peptides on the activity of peptides was also evaluated using a bioassay. As shown in Fig 5, the bioactivity of peptides 12 and 13 was significantly inhibited by peptide 12 and 13, with a concentration of 10 and 15%, respectively, and the peptide 13 was inactive against the activity of peptides 12 and 13, with a concentration of 10 and 15%, respectively. However, the peptide 13 was active against the activity of peptides 12 and 13, with a concentration of 10 and 15%, respectively.

In vitro Peptide Effects on the Biotic and Physiological Functions of Peptides
To evaluate the effects of the peptides on the bioprocessing activity of the peptides, the activity of peptides and the concentrations of peptides were evaluated in the two-day period. The activity of peptides 12 and 13 was evaluated on a concentration-dependent and a concentration-dependent manner.


## Discussion
The synthesis and degradation of bioactive peptides is usually carried out in the enzyme-encoding enzyme of the TCA cycle, but the activity can also be associated with the proteolytic and endocytic pathways, as shown in Table .

The enzyme-encoding enzyme of the TCA cycle is the TCA cycle-associated enzyme-encoding gene (TCCL). In the TCA cycle, several TCAases are activated by the TCA cycle, such as the TCA cycle-associated enzyme-encoding gene (TACL). The TACL is a gene that encodes a phosphatidylinositol-like protein (PI3K) that is a vital component of the TCA cycle [63]. In addition to this, TACL also has the capability to produce an acid-tolerant toxin [64]. The TACL of the TCA cycle is also a factor involved in the detoxification of toxic compounds, such as superoxide anion and H_2O_2, which is used to generate hydrogen peroxide [65].

As shown in Table 2, the TCA cycle-associated enzyme-encoding gene (TCCL) was up-regulated at all times compared to the gene in the TCA cycle, which was also down-regulated at the beginning of the process. This indicates that the TCA cycle enzyme is involved in the detoxification of toxic compounds and is important in the TCA cycle, as it is necessary for the detoxification of toxic compounds.
