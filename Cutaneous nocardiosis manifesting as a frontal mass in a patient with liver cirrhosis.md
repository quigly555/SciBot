## Abstract
Candida glabrata is a fungal pathogen that is considered the leading killer fungus in humans. The development of a vaccine against this fungus is a priority. The gene product, C, was purified from a culture isolate of the pathogen by using immunodominant activity on the human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a gene. The purified enzyme was used to develop a fluconazole-based vaccine. Fluconazole was administered intravenously for 10 days and daily for 10 months. The enzyme was subjected to biophysical studies to determine its in vitro activity and was confirmed by periodic tetrazolium-diffusion analysis. The results indicated that fluconazole had a non-toxic effect on the purified enzyme. Immunocompromised mice were inoculated with a strain of C. glabrata and immunodominant activity of the enzyme was observed. The enzyme was purified and shown to have a non-toxic activity by a non-toxicity assay.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection in immune-compromised hosts, which affects predominantly immunosuppressed patients. A number of important pathogens, including C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. bacillisporus, can cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals, especially those with immune impairment, such as cancer patients, transplant recipients, and HIV-positive patients.[ 1] In the immunocompromised host, it can be challenging to distinguish C. neoformans from other pathogenic fungi. This is particularly true for C. gattii, a less well-known cause of cryptococcosis. In this review, we will highlight the importance of three major molecular types of molecular identification: ITS, LSU, and uRA.


## Methods
., FMRD) is likely due to the presence of a lesion on the skin of the lesions. We have also examined patients with pulmonary infiltrates in which the mucosal surface of the lesions is not visible and have found that the infiltrates on the surface of the lesions are frequent. In this study, we have also observed a large number of patients who have fimbriated in our study. The fimbriated patients had similar backgrounds and showed similar clinical characteristics. In this study, the fimbriated patients had similar clinical characteristics and showed similar clinical characteristics. The fimbriated patients presented similar to the fimbriated patients. In this study, we have also observed patients with pulmonary infiltrates in which the mucosal surface of the lesions is not visible and have found that the mucosal surface of the lesions is frequent.

The fimbriated patients presented similar to the fimbriated patients. In this study, we have also observed patients with lung infiltrates in which the mucosal surface of the lesions is not visible and have found that the mucosal surface of the lesions is frequent. In this study, we have also observed patients with pulmonary infiltrates in which the mucosal surface of the lesions is not visible.

These findings were further evaluated by the study co-ordinator Dr. Amin Yousim Oreshkirani. For this purpose, we have included the patients from our study, and we have also included the patients from the prospective study conducted in our hospital. We have also included the patients from our hospital and our review of the hospital records. We have also included the patients from the prospective study conducted in our hospital. We have also included the patients from our hospital.

In this study, we have also included the patients from our hospital, and we have also included the patients from our hospital. In our study, we have also included the patients from our hospital and review of the hospital records. We have also included the patients from our hospital and review of the hospital records.

Since the study has been a retrospective study, the results will be compared with those of the prospective study. For that reason, we have compared the outcomes of the patients and the prospective study participants. The patients in this study were the same age as the patients in the prospective study. The patients were the same gender as the patients in the prospective study.


## Results
Our data suggest that Nocardia does not cause hepatomegal. In contrast, the biliary lymphadenopathy of an adult patient with heart failure presents with a central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia and diffuse cingulate vasculopathy in a patient with acute renal failure (Figure 3). Thus, Nocardia causes some degree of neurosyphilis, but not other neurological lesions.

Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by neutropenia and histopathology in a patient with aseptic ulceration and autoimmune diseases, but does not cause signs of leukaemia, a characteristic of autoimmune Nocardia (Figure 3). We identified Nocardia-specific markers in a patient with severe renal failure with a corticosteroid-induced nephropathy and found no immunodominant lesions in the renal pelvis, liver and kidney (Figure 3).

Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by neutropenia and histopathology in a patient with severe renal failure with a corticosteroid-induced nephropathy and autoimmune disease (Figure 3). We found no evidence of cryptococcal infection in the renal spleen, but a CXCL-2 lesion was found in a patient with aseptic ulceration and autoimmune disease. We found no evidence of leukaemia in the renal pelvis or liver, but a CXCL-2 lesion was found in a patient with severe renal failure with the corticosteroid-induced nephropathy and autoimmune disease.

## Discussion

The etiology of the disease is unclea. Pulmonary nocardiosis is associated with a low CD4 count. It is usually a pulmonary infection, although it can be an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. The disease may be associated with infection with the lymph node.

Diagnosis of nocardiosis is challenging because patients have high susceptibility to the disease and have a high level of immunodeficiency. If nocardiosis is diagnosed, the patient should have a history of a previous immunosuppressive disorder. In HIV-infected patients, the symptoms of the disease may include severe systemic lymphadenopathy, low CD4 counts, and signs of advanced AIDS.

The diagnosis of nocardiosis is challenging because the patient has a history of previous immunosuppressive disease. The patient has a history of renal disease. The patient has a history of traumatic brain injury. The patient has an extensive history of cirrhosis.

The patient should have a history of liver cirrhosis. The patient has an extensive history of diabetes. The patient has a history of immunosuppression. The patient has a history of visceral diarrhea. The patient has a history of cirrhosis. The patient has an extensive history of solid organ transplantation. The patient has a history of renal disease. The patient has a history of organ transplantation. The patient has a history of neutropenia. The patient has a history of extrapulmonary lymphadenitis. The patient has a history of tuberculosis. The patient has a history of heart failure. The patient has a history of stroke. The patient has a history of diabetes. The patient has a history of liver disease. The patient has a history of neutropenia. The patient has a history of diabetes. The patient has a history of lung cancer. The patient has a history of liver disease. The patient has a history of renal disease. The patient has a history of tuberculosis. The patient has a history of renal failure. The patient has a history of liver disease.

Diagnosis of nocardiosis requires a high degree of clinical understanding and is based on history of a previous immunosuppressive disease and diagnosis of the organism. The patient should have a history of immunosuppression and a history of previous immunosuppressive disease. The patient should have a history of a previous immunosuppressive disease. The patient should have a history of a previous immunosuppression.
