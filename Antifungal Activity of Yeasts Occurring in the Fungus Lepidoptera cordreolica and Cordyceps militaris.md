## Abstract
To evaluate the in vitro antifungal activities of the EUCAST protocol and the EF1a and EF1d polysaccharides, as well as the mechanism of action of their antifungal products against Candida albicans in vitro.

Antifungal activity of EUCAST was tested in planktonic cells in the model yeast C. albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the CLSI broth microdilution protocol. In vitro growth inhibitory activity of the antifungal agents was tested by in vivo assays in the same model yeast in the presence or absence of acetic acid, itraconazole, and acl-2 polyketide and by in vivo tests in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis in the presence of intranasal and acetic acid-treated C. albicans in the absence of Candida albicans. In addition, in vivo growth inhibition was tested in a mouse model of peritoneal candidiasis in the presence of EF1-<U+03B3> stimulation.

The in vitro results suggested that EUCAST did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans in the absence of other factors, like acetic acid or itraconazole. In addition, in vivo growth inhibition of C. albicans in the presence of EF1-<U+03B3> was more efficient than that of Candida- and itraconazole-treated yeast in the presence of acetic acid in all tested conditions. In addition, the antifungal susceptibility of the EUCAST protocol to the azole drug fluconazole was higher than that of the azole treatment.

The in vitro results suggested that EUCAST did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans in the absence of other factors, like acetic acid or itraconazole. In addition, the antifungal susceptibility of EUCAST protocol to fluconazole was higher than that of the azole treatment.

The in vitro results suggested that EUCAST did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans in the absence of other factors, like theyl-ß-d-glucuronopyrimidine or itraconazole. In addition, the antifungal susceptibility of EUCAST protocol to fluconazole was higher than that of the azole treatment.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease of the skin, mucous membrane, and nail. It can affect approximately 5%-7% of people living with HIV/AIDS [1]. It can be caused by several species, including Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii, and C. neoformans var. grubii. It can also be caused by C. gattii, C. neoformans var. neoformans, and C. gattii. The most common clinical manifestation is cutaneous lesions on the skin, nails, and hair. The most common lesions are simple or ocular, and it is mainly caused by inhalation of spores. In addition, other species can be involved in the disease, such as C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis [2]. The most common clinical manifestation is cutaneous lesions on the skin, nails, and hair.


## Methods
The yeast cells were suspended in DMSO at 10^5cells/m. The drug susceptibility was determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 document [33]. The yeast cell suspension was adjusted to the desired concentration and then added to the drug-free RPMI medium, containing 2% glucose, 100 mM MOPS, 1.5% peptone, and 1% yeast extract. The fungal inoculum was prepared by growing the fungal cells in the RPMI medium at 37°C for 24 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g for 15 min. The supernatant was used for the assays. The assay was performed in triplicate.

2.3. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Yeast-Forming Plugs
The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the yeast-forming-plugs [34]. Yeast-forming-plugs (1 mL) were inoculated into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The inoculated wells were then removed and the plates were washed three times with sterile distilled water. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the yeast-forming-plugs was determined using the MFC-MIC technique [35], [36].

2.4. Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of Yeasts-Forming Plugs
The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the yeast-forming-plugs was determined according to the method of Yee et al. [37], [38]. Briefly, the plates were incubated at 37°C and the number of CFU/mL was determined. The assay was performed in duplicate.

2.5. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Yeast-Forming Plugs
The MIC of yeast-forming-plugs was determined according to the method of Zhang et al. [39]. The 96-well microtiter plate was prepared with 100 µL of RPMI medium and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 4000×g for 15 min.


## Results
During the study, we found that yeasts that are present in both blood and plant material were able to grow in the blood of different animals and plant. Interestingly, in the plant tissues, yeasts that were not able to grow in the plant tissue could be found in the blood and plant tissues. However, when yeasts were cultured from the blood of six animals, six of them were found to have had similar growth profiles to those of those of the wild species, which were the most active.

When yeasts were cultured from the blood of animals, the growth profiles of the yeasts were more similar to those of the wild species than to the other yeasts. In fact, the growth profiles of the wild species were more similar to those of the yeasts of the yeasts from the other species. Yeast strains isolated from blood of the six animals were able to grow in the blood of the five animals, but not of the wild species. The growth profiles of the wild species were similar to those of the yeasts isolated from the blood of the five animals. The yeasts isolated from the blood of animals were able to grow in the blood of five animals, but not in the blood of the wild species. This was not the case for the yeasts isolated from the blood of the wild species, which showed the ability to grow in the blood of four animals. In fact, the yeasts isolated from the blood of four animals were able to grow in the blood of three animals. However, in the case of the yeasts isolated from the blood of the wild species, the growth profile of the wild species was not as similar to that of the other yeasts. The results of the broth microdilution assay demonstrated that the yeasts isolated from blood of the six animals were able to grow in the blood of five animals, but not of the wild species.

Induced Pulmonary Formation of Yeast in vivo

Yeasts are potential pathogens and the ability to induce pulmonary formation of yeasts in vivo is crucial for the effective disease control. To check if yeast cells were able to induce pulmonary formation of yeast in vivo, a yeast culture was performed in the bronchial wash. Yeast cells were isolated and plated on YM plate.


## Discussion
The maximal effect of fungi inoculated into the cordwood samples was observed in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which only a maximum of 12 fungi were produce. The lowest fungal diversity was observed in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced. However, the highest diversity was observed in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 16 fungi were produced. In this study, the greatest fungal diversity was found in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced. In contrast, the highest fungal diversity was found in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced.

The maximum fungal diversity observed in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced, was higher than that in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced. These results suggest that fungi of the Cordyceps militaris strain and Cordyceps militaris strain could be assimilated by the fungi from the other species of the Cordyceps genera. However, the higher the fungi assimilated by the fungi in the cordwood samples, the higher the concentration of fungi in the fungi in the cordwood samples, as the fungi in the cordwood samples could be assimilated by the fungi from the other species of the Cordyceps genera. It was suggested that fungi assimilate fungal metabolites in a similar way to yeasts assimilating yeast metabolites, and their use could be similar to the use of yeast in the fermentation of yeasts.

The maximum fungal diversity in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced, was higher than that in the fungi obtained from the Cordyceps militaris strain, in which the maximum of 18 fungi were produced. The higher the fungi assimilated by the fungi in the cordwood samples, the higher the concentration of fungi in the fungi in the cordwood samples, as the fungi in the cordwood samples could be assimilated by the fungi from the other species of the Cordyceps genera.
