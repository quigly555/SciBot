## Abstract
Pectinolytic enzymes are the key step in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates and the first step in the synthesis of a range of diverse and mostly insoluble secondary metabolites. In the present study, the sugar and glucose residues in the a-pinene hydroxylase from Mycosphaerella fijiensis, M. lichenicola strain 269-492, and the second sugar in the ß-alanine hydroxylase from M. lichenicolor strain 10562 were characterized. The two newly isolated ß-amylases from mycosphaerella fijiensis showed characteristic properties: high temperature stability, low temperature, and anionic hydrolysis. The a-pinene hydroxylase from M. lichenicola strain 269-492 was successfully modified by glucose and a-amylase from M. lichenicola strain 10562, and the a-amylase from M. lichenicola strain 10562 was partially inhibited by lactose and glucose, respectively. As the presence of two inhibitory sugars in the purified a-pinene hydroxylase from M. lichenicola strain 269-492 makes the presence of the enzyme of M. lichenicola very important.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous fungal pathogen that causes disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals [1]. Most cases of cryptococcosis occur in AIDS patients, with about 10% of AIDS-related deaths [2,3]. Invasive fungal disease, the most common clinical form, is responsible for ~2,000,000 deaths annually in patients with HIV/AIDS [4,5]. In the absence of effective treatment, the response to cryptococcosis often remains patchy [6].

Infections in the central nervous system (CNS) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among AIDS patients with cryptococcosis [7]. C. neoformans, although rarely seen in isolation, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes infections in immunocompromised patients [7]. C. neoformans is typically contained within the pulmonary alveoli of the host, but can disseminate from the lung and reach the brain, where it can cause a severe meningoencephalitis [7,8].

C. neoformans is capable of forming multiple types of biofilms, which are able to evade host defenses and invade the host. These cells can become self-produced and self-machined into the environment [9,10]. In addition to these types of biofilms, there are numerous types of other microorganisms that can form such structures. The most common type of infections in AIDS patients is cryptococcosis, and the most common agents are Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis [11].

In this study, we present a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with HIV/AIDS. The patient had a positive serum cryptococcal antigen test (CrAg) for Histoplasma capsulatum, and the patient was observed for the first time in the laboratory examination. However, the patient was positive for Histoplasma capsulatum by latex agglutination (LA) assay. The patient was not hospitalized for treatment, and the patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis with a positive CrAg LA test.


## Methods
[21. The samples were homogenised and serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and plated on a solid agar plate to determine the number of CFU per gram of dry matter.

The MIC values of kaempferol were determined by the broth microdilution method as previously described with slight modifications [22] using broth microdilution plates and the colorimetric profiles were obtained by spectrophotometry after 24 hours incubation at 35°C. The assay was performed with the lowest concentration of kaempferol that showed no color change on the agar surface and a MIC value of the product was defined as the lowest concentration of the product that resulted in 50% reduction of visible turbidity. The MIC of kaempferol and its metabolic inhibitors were determined by the method described by Mosmann et al. [22].

The activity of the katA and the katB enzymes on the inhibition of katA and the inhibition of katB were assayed according to the method described by Ghoseh et al. [23]. Briefly, the mycelial growth inhibition (MIC) and the activity of the katA and the katB enzymes were assayed according to the method described byMosmann et al. [23]. The samples were homogenised and serially diluted in PBS and plated on a solid agar plate to determine the number of CFU per gram of dry matter.

Statistical analysis
The results of MIC and activities of the katA and the katB enzymes were compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. The results of K-Fluor analysis were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test. The results of SDS-PAGE and Western blot were compared using Student’s t-test. The results of immunoblotting were compared using the Immunoblotting Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and the results of Bio-Rad iTRAQ system (Bio-Rad, USA). The results of quantitative analysis of the amount of bacterial and fungal DNA and the amount of total DNA were compared using a Student’s t-test.


## Results
The antifungal activity of kaempferol and its metabolic inhibitors against . albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis is shown in Table 2. The MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol were 1.25 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml for C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, respectively. In the case of C. albicans, the MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol were 1.25 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml for C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, respectively. The MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol against C. albicans were 0.5 µg/ml and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively. In contrast, the MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol against C. tropicalis were 0.5 µg/ml and 0.25 µg/ml, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol against C. albicans were 1.25 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml, respectively.

3.2. Antifungal Activity of Kaempferol and Its Metabolic Inhibitor against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis
The antifungal activity of kaempferol and its metabolic inhibitor against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis was investigated by measuring the MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol and its metabolic inhibitor against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. The MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol were 1.25 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml, respectively. In the case of C. parapsilosis, the MIC_90 values of the MIC_90s of kaempferol were 0.5 µg/ml and 0.
