## Abstract
The oleaginous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been a source of protein sources for biodiesel production. The aim of this study was to investigate the protein composition and metabolic activity of the gene encoding protein homolog (orf) of the kre2-flourish oxidase (KOx) complex in S. cerevisiae. The deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme whose function is due to kre2-flourish oxidase in the yeast, led to an alteration in the kre2-flourish and reduced the value of the enzyme. The deletion of homologous gene (orf) of S. cerevisiae rhodopsin (cropseed) in the fungus also led to a decrease in the amount of the flours and tricarboxylic acid (Cr) reductase genes of the sclerotia. These genes are known to be related to the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway and might function to degrade the cell wall. The deletion of homologous gene (orf) of S. cerevisiae rhodopsin in the fungus also led to a decrease in the amount of the acyl-CoA reductase genes of the sclerotia. These genes are known to be related to the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway and might function to degrade the cell wall.


## Introduction

Despite the importance of mitogen-activated protein kinases in the host defense against . albicans, their regulatory controls over the infection of the mammalian host are largely unknown. There are several known regulatory pathways through which mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate the transcriptional control of genes for stress response, oxidative stress, and metabolism [11]. In C. albicans, both the GATA factor (GATA) H-type transcription factor Adr and the voltage-dependent kinase Dck1 control genes for stress responses and metabolic status. The GATA factor was initially identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is involved in the regulation of many stress responses and stress responses [12,13]. The Dck1 and Adr proteins are ATP-dependent phosphodiesterases that function in the phosphodiester bond biosynthesis pathway, while the Dck1 and Adr proteins act as phosphodiester switch proteins involved in the transition from yeast to hyphal growth and to conidiation [14]. While Dck1 and Adr are involved in the regulation of stress response genes, the role of the Dck1-Adr protein in the regulation of virulence and responses to antifungal drugs has been well characterized in C. albicans. Dck1 and Adr are activated by C. albicans hyperosmotic cells [15,16]. In contrast, Dck1 is activated by filamentous fungi, such as the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus [17,18].

C. albicans has two known mitogen-activated protein kinases, PKC1 and PKC2, and the most prevalent PKC is the important histidine kinase in this organism [19,20]. PKC2 is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit [21]. PKC1 has two catalytic and one regulatory subunits, and it is the only subunit that exhibits a conserved C-terminal localization [22]. In C. albicans, the PKC1 subunit controls the response to oxidative stress, to osmotic stress, and to temperature stress, and to osmotic stress and osmotic protein osmolarity [23,24]. PKC1 has a high affinity for hydrogen peroxide, which is crucial for the control of hyphal growth and virulence [25].


## Methods
albicans colonization was investigate. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Instituto Tecnida-Universidad Nacional de Bolognesiacos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90030, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37째C. After 24 h, the cultures were harvested, washed twice with sterile H_2O, and resuspended to a final concentration of 10^6 cells/mL in sterile PBS. The cells were plated on SDA and incubated at 37째C for 48 h. The colony forming units (CFU) were counted and the percentage of colony forming units (cfu) was calculated. The experiment was repeated three times with three replicates. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

In vivo Inhibition of In Vitro Interaction by Ca^2+
To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of Ca^2+ treatments, a murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis was employed. The C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90030, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were cultured on SDA at 37째C. C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90030, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 90028, and C. albicans ATCC 90028 were cultured on SDA at 37째C.

## Results
albicans virulence response in . albicans and C. albicans-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) [7]. In this study, we employed the LAMP-1 (LAMP-1-dependent) reporter gene, which has a strong promoter and homology to the C. albicans LAMP-1 reporter gene.

We first investigated the gene expression of LAMP-1 during C. albicans infection using a quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. LAMP-1 is a known virulence factor in the mouse model of systemic candidiasis, and its expression was monitored over time using a mouse anti-CD11 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a mouse anti-CD11 monoclonal antibody (mAb-D62). Compared with the control, the lysates of the lysates of the infected BMD were reduced in infected mice (Fig 4A). The lysates of infected BMD contained a greater number of genes in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Table 2), amino acid biosynthesis (Table 2), and lipid metabolism (Table 2). The differences in gene expression between the infected LAMP-1 reporter and control samples were significant (p < 0.05) (Fig 4B). The expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and lipid synthesis was also significantly down-regulated in the infected LAMP-1 reporter sample, with the majority of these genes being related to carbohydrate metabolism. Interestingly, a significantly higher percentage of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated in the infected LAMP-1 reporter sample (Table 2). The genes encoding carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism were significantly up-regulated in the infected LAMP-1 reporter sample, with the majority being involved in amino acid biosynthesis.

We next investigated the roles of differentially expressed genes in the LAMP-1 reporter sample. The LAMP-1 reporter revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (Table 2). A significant enrichment of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis was also observed in the LAMP-1 reporter sample (Table 2). The genes encoding carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism were significantly up-regulated in the LAMP-1 reporter sample (Table 2).


## Discussion
In addition, a direct relationship between C-myristoylation and mitochondrial electron transport has been reported for a fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, but not for Aspergillus species [40. In addition, C-myristoylation of the transcription factor IgY, a key regulator of the regulation of mitochondrial respiration, is also critical for pathogenicity of Histoplasma capsulatum [41]. Together, these findings highlight the importance of C-myristoylation for host-pathogen interactions.

The C-myristoylation of IGS1, the transcription factor responsible for IGS1-mediated gene expression regulation, was shown to be associated with fungal virulence in C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [42,43]. Similarly, the C-myristoylation of the transcription factor IgY, a key regulator of mitochondrial respiration, was linked with fungal virulence in C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [43]. In addition, the C-myristoylation of IGS1 was associated with fungal virulence in C. glabrata [42]. This result was consistent with the finding that C-myristoylation of IGS1 in C. albicans and C. glabrata could significantly impact the virulence of the fungi. In contrast, the C-myristoylation of IGS1 in C. parapsilosis was not associated with fungal virulence.

The C-myristoylation of IGS1 was associated with fungal virulence in C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [43]. In addition, the C-myristoylation of IGS1 was associated with fungal virulence in C. glabrata [42]. The C-myristoylation of IGS1 was associated with fungal virulence in C. parapsilosis [42]. C-myristoylation of IGS1 was associated with fungal virulence in C. albicans [43].
