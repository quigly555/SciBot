## Abstract
The molecular and biological mechanisms of eukaryotic pathogens vary greatly among different organisms, including fungi. This is the first in a-zoological pathogens that has comprehensively studied their evolutionary relationships with their hosts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different virulence factors and to identify the genes associated with pathogenicity in the three fungal classes that taxonomically divided the World Archaea of the Opisthokonts from Comparataly Pliceidly Flies, the representatives of the Ascomycota and Dothideomycetes.


## Introduction

The major oleaginous yeast species are the oleaginous yeasts Lipomyces starkeyensis and Lipomyces starkeyii, which are oleaginous and rarely pathogenic to humans and animal. Both species belong to the oleaginous yeast super group [16]. The former is a basidiomycetous yeast and the latter oleaginous species Lipomyces starkeyensis and Lipomyces starkeyii, which are oleaginous and rarely pathogenic to humans and animals. Both species are isolated from a wide range of substrata including decaying wood, soil, and decaying plants [16]. The ability to survive under extreme environmental conditions is a common feature of oleaginous yeast, and many species are important components of natural ecosystems such as soil and decaying plants [17]. In addition to these substrata, the oleaginous yeast species are known to have the ability to synthesize lipids in low quantities. The production of lipids is a key component of the lipid metabolism in oleaginous organisms [18], which allows them to obtain energy from lipid production and to accumulate lipids.

A number of studies have linked the ability of oleaginous yeasts to produce lipids with their ability to grow at physiological temperature, which allows the yeast to grow in different environments and at different times periods [19]. In contrast, the ability of oleaginous yeast to produce lipids is unknown. In addition to lipid production, the oleaginous yeast also possess biofilm formation [20] and the ability to produce large quantities of lipids in vitro [21]. The ability of oleaginous yeasts to produce lipids has been reported in most oleaginous yeast species [22], but no studies have examined the biofilm formation ability of oleaginous yeasts.

The ability of oleaginous yeasts to produce lipids has been reported in most oleaginous yeasts [23], but no studies have examined the biofilm formation ability of oleaginous yeasts.

The ability of oleaginous yeasts to produce lipids has been reported in most oleaginous yeasts [24], but no studies have examined the ability of oleaginous yeasts to produce lipids in vitro.


## Methods
The exposed cells were observed to be completely different in condition of the cell.

4.3. Antimicrobial Activity Assay
The microdilution method used for the antimicrobial activity assay was also used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each oil. Three replicates of each of the two oil classes were used. Oils with MIC > 0.5 and MIC > 0.2 were used as positive control. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each oil was defined as the lowest concentration of each oil with no visible growth of the microorganism after incubation at 37째C. The MIC of the oils was defined as the lowest concentration of each oil that inhibited 50% of the growth of the microorganism after incubation at 37째C.

4.4. Antimicrobial Activity Test
The inhibitory effect of Oleaginous Yeast Lipid (YL) or its derivative derivatives was evaluated in the antibacterial activity of the lipid extracts of each of the three tested oils. The standard reference medium of the two fatty acid lipids (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used for the standardization of the test, while the cellophane membranes were used for the standardization of the test. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each lipid was defined as the lowest concentration of the oil that prevented 50% of the growth of the microorganism after incubation at 37째C.

4.5. Antimicrobial Activity Assay
The antifungal activity of the lipid extracts of the three tested oils was assayed against a wide range of fungi, including ascomycetes, dermatophytes, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. The test was performed according to the CLSI (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) guidelines [19]. Oils with MIC > 0.2 and > 0.5% were used as positive control. The MICs of the oils were defined as the lowest concentration of each lipid that resulted in 50% reduction in the growth of the microorganism after incubation at 37째C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of each lipid that prevented 50% of the growth of the microorganism.


## Results
Comparative analysis of gene expression between the two F. oxysporum isolates
In order to perform a comparative analysis of the transcriptome profiles of the two F. oxysporum isolates, we performed real-time RT-PCR using the P. marneffei genome database, which contains a total of 1545 genes. The total number of gene expression between the two isolates was 0.716 (Fig 1A). To identify genes that are differentially expressed between the two F. oxysporum isolates, we employed a combination of real-time RT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis using the same F. oxysporum isolates, which were previously shown to be more highly expressed in the <U+0394>FpB strain (3). RNA sequencing confirmed the transcriptome data and the qRT-PCR data obtained from the two isolates (Fig 1B). In addition, we included a transcriptomic analysis of the two F. oxysporum isolates, which were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, to obtain a more complete view of the transcriptome data.

## Discussion
Alternaria alternata are present as a single yeast but the gene expression of SREBP is induced by all three oleaginous yeasts (data not shown.

A similar dual-cellular morphology was observed in another oleaginous yeast, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, where the double-stranded RNA polymerase II protein is essential for siderophore biosynthesis in this yeast. The yeast was also found to have a higher expression of the lipid-based siderophore biosynthesis-related genes RGS1, SRF1, and FRX1 in the oleaginous yeast, R. solanacearum. These results suggest that the dual-cellular morphology of Rhodotorula cells was the result of a dual-cellular-peripheral genome duplication. The gene-deletion of SRF1 resulted in an increase in the number of genes involved in lipid-based biosynthesis in this yeast (Figure 3A). The increase in the number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores was also observed in the oleaginous yeast A. terrestris (Figure 3A). These results suggest that the oleaginous yeast was able to utilize the different lipid-based siderophores.

The oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia fowleri was shown to produce the bile salts of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus and produce siderophores that could be utilized by oleaginous yeasts. Additionally, the oleaginous yeasts E. cuniculi and C. sake were shown to synthesize siderophores (Bader et al. 2001). In contrast to yeast, oleaginous yeasts possess a single gene encoding a lipase that is also required for the biosynthesis of siderophores. The lipid-based siderophore biosynthesis-related genes RGS1, SRF1, and FRX1 were also up-regulated in the oleaginous yeast S. cerevisiae (Figure 3B). The oleaginous yeast S. cerevisiae has a gene cluster for siderophore biosynthesis that encodes for siderophores, which are considered to be the major siderophore-related genes (Yoshimoto et al. 2002).
