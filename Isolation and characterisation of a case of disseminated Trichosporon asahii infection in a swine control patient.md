## Abstract
In the last decades, natural products have emerged as a potential source of biologically active enzymes.


## Introduction
Protein secretion by eukaryotic cells is an essential process in which secretory vesicles are transported across cell membranes, bound to specific proteins, and then delivered to the cell surface. The protein-rich environment of the cytoplasmic organelles of eukaryotic cells was first described by Krakow in 1963 [1].


## Methods
The swab culture was then diluted and plated on fresh dextrose agar medium in sterile petri dishes and incubated at 37°C for 48 . The colonies were counted and the isolates were selected based on morphological and physiological characteristics. The isolates were preserved at the culture collection of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo and are deposited in the Herbarium Universidade Federal de São Paulo (HUSP), Herbaria No. 2247.

Fungal strains and growth conditions
The aero-inoculum and aero-deficient strains of Trichosporon were grown in 2 ml of malt extract-dextrose (ME) broth at 28°C for 18-24 h. The mycelium was harvested by filtration, washed with distilled water and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES. The cell suspension was inoculated on solid ME broth at 37°C. The inoculated cultures were incubated at 37°C and a humidified atmosphere was maintained for 48 h.

To observe the growth of Trichosporon strains in the presence of oxygen, 1 ml of 2% P-iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) was added to the aqueous culture and the mycelium was harvested by filtration. The mycelium was then lyophilized and stored at -20°C for future studies.

The growth of Trichosporon strains was assessed on solid ME broth at 28°C. The mycelium was extracted by filtration and washed with distilled water. The cell suspension was inoculated on solid ME broth at 28°C for 18-24 h. The mycelium was harvested by filtration, washed with distilled water and resuspended in 1 ml of water. The mycelium was then lyophilized and stored at -20°C for future studies.

Isolation of aprotinin A (Apt) and aprotinin B from Trichosporon
Aprotin A (Apt) and aprotinin B (Apt) were isolated from Trichosporon according to the method of Bovh et al. (2016).


## Results
Analysis of the culture-based identification showed that the isolate was . neoformans. This isolate was clinically characterised by its inability to produce aflatoxin (Figure 2).

Analysis of the clinical isolate for the identification of fungal infection
We examined the growth of the isolated fungal isolate in the presence of various concentrations of various concentrations of antifungal agents (Figure 3). The growth of the isolate was similar to that of the control. In the presence of 5 mM of azole, the growth of the isolate was very similar to that of the control. Similarly, the growth of the isolate was similar to that of the control.

Analysis of the clinical isolate for the identification of fungal infection
The isolation of the isolate was performed using the broth microdilution method. The strain was positive for its ability to produce fungal growth in the presence of antifungal agents. The isolate was found to be C. neoformans.

## Discussion
This case highlights the importance of early identification of Cryptococcus sp. in a patient with a chronic immunodeficiency, as demonstrated in our patient. This case also highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, particularly for patients with cystic fibrosis [19].

The patient in our case presented with two different symptoms and responded to antifungal treatment for several weeks, but suffered from mild hepatosplenomegaly and mild sepsis. The liver enzyme is not responding to antifungal treatment and the liver dysfunction is extremely severe. The patient in this case was also treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B for 14 days. Unfortunately, the patient had severe sepsis, which is uncommon and does not correlate well with the liver disease. The patient in this case also responded well to treatment with amphotericin B for 14 days, and liver dysfunction was no more. This patient also had multiple systemic autoimmune reactions, including liver cirrhosis and liver failure, which were not alleviated by antifungal therapy.

A large number of case reports have described cases of invasive Trichosporon asahii infection in humans [20, 21]. In the current case report, the patient presented with a mild reaction to antifungal therapy, but the patient’s liver was normal. However, the patient had two additional cases, one of which was a true cystic fibrosis case [22].

Treatment for cryptococcosis usually consists of fluconazole and amphotericin B, followed by intravenous liposomal amphotericin B for 2-3 weeks [23]. However, the treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans is usually broad-spectrum therapy [24]. The treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans in the current case is amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day) followed by fluconazole for 2-3 weeks [22]. The patient in our case received amphotericin B for 8 weeks, but the liver was not normal. The patient in our case received fluconazole for 6 weeks, and the liver was normal again. The treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans usually consists of fluconazole followed by intravenous liposomal amphotericin B for 2-3 weeks [23]. However, the patient in our case was treated by oral fluconazole for 4 weeks.
