## Abstract

Between 2000 and 2014, we conducted a retrospective cohort study on anti-interferon-gamma-modulated peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells (T-cells) in HIV-infected patients at two referral hospitals in Malaw. We evaluated risk factors and life events for non-suppression of T-cell immunity by transfusion of CD4+ T-cells to non-suppression patients and we included in the analysis persons with CD4+ T-cells <100 cells/µm (N=2,354). In 184 persons, non-suppression of T-cell immunity was associated with HIV-infection, and they were older (n=52) than 1999 (n=65) and were white (n=108) males. We interviewed 186 persons, and they were predominantly older (79.8%) than men (82.7%) and the median CD4+ cell count was 40 cells/µm (SD 11.3). The incidence of non-suppression of T-cell immunity (9.1%) was higher than the incidence of resistance (4.4%) (9.5%) among persons with CD4+ T-cells <100 cells/µm (n=20).

The prevalence of non-suppression of T-cell immunity was high in this study. The increase in CD4+ T-cell numbers was associated with higher risks of non-suppression of T-cell immunity.

Oppression in ART prevented persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from achieving full CD4+ T-cell counts, and persons with CD4+ T-cell counts of <200 cells/µm (CD4+ T-cell count) had a significantly higher risk of death than persons without CD4+ T-cell count =100 cells/µm.

Oppression prevented persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome from achieving full CD4+ T-cell counts, and persons with CD4+ T-cell counts of <200 cells/µm (CD4+ T-cell count) had a significantly higher risk of death than persons without CD4+ T-cell count =100 cells/µm.


## Introduction
Fungi are ubiquitous and can be found in virtually all environments, including soil, air, water, and even on trees. The transition from environmental respiration to the production of spores is a major process involved in the dispersal of fungi from environmental water and aerosolized particles, and their formation in soil, soil, and air [1]. The respiratory and circulatory systems utilize hundreds of different cellular processes to produce airborne microorganisms, including airborne spores, mycelia, mycelium form, spores, mycelium nuclei, and spores. These cellular processes are highly controlled in response to environmental conditions, which are often influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, nutrients, and pH [2,3,4]. In addition to the plant, fungal spores are also associated with plant diseases. In Brazil, several important plant-associated fungi, including Magnaporthe oryzae, Fusarium graminearum, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, are known to cause serious economic and health problems, as well as human and animal diseases [5]. Despite the fact that the taxonomic status of the Fusarium graminearum and Colletotrichum spp. is very low, they are responsible for the most severe economic and health problems in the Brazilian agricultural ecosystems, including the loss of fruit quality, long-term persistence, and mycotoxin production [6]. Fusarium graminearum is a widely distributed, widely distributed, and ubiquitous pathogen, and can cause severe and severe diseases on a wide range of plant hosts [7,8]. The high economic burden and serious health risks of these fungal diseases is due to their low disease severity, which is a consequence of their massive accumulation in the environment. In addition to their environmental persistence, the high incidence of fungal diseases in Brazil and the lack of effective control measures make this disease an economic problem that has become a public health problem.

There are several plant-borne microorganisms that can cause diseases in plants. These are called pathogenic fungi, such as Penicillium oryzae, or as uncultured saprophytes, such as Fusarium graminearum and Cylindrocarpon ochracea.


## Methods
We collected these risk factors and combined them in multivariate multivariate analysis with the univariate multivariate analyses of a population cohort to provide the categorical risk factor and the continuous risk factor for deat. We used the analyses of continuous variables with multiple imputation methods to predict risk factors and the multivariate analyses of continuous variables with multiple imputation methods to predict continuous variables. We used the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to compare categorical risk factors between two groups of patients. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare continuous variables with categorical risk factors with a multiple imputation method. We performed a multivariate analysis of continuous variables with multivariate multivariate analyses of continuous variables with multivariate multivariate analyses of continuous variables with multivariate analyses of continuous variables. We identified four key factors: hematological malignancies (MSM, pneumonia, cancer, heart disease, diabetes), malignancies at the discretion of the medical team (i.e. liver cirrhosis, kidney cirrhosis, cancer, etc.), malignancies at the discretion of the general public (i.e. people with medical conditions, AIDS, etc.), and malignancies at the discretion of the National Statistics Institute (i.e. people with lung, heart, liver, kidney, liver biopsy, etc.). We used the multivariate analysis of continuous variables with multivariate analyses of continuous variables with multivariate analyses of continuous variables.

## Results
Culture characteristics
The wild type strain was cultured in the presence of 10 µL of a 1.5 M NaCl solution, followed by the addition of 5 µL of 5 mM H_2O_2 to the culture broth to obtain the strain. After 5 days at room temperature, the broth was filtered and the residual H_2O_2 was added to the culture broth.


## Discussion
Nevertheless, the exact epidemiological basis of the reported incidence in our study is not clea. Possible reasons for the low incidence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance in the study population include a high number of patients with T. gondii infections, a high number of patients with T. gondii immunodeficiency and patients with T. gondii infections. A study from India reported a rate of 2.3 per 100,000 deaths [31]. We were unable to perform a statistical analysis for the differences in the prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance between the study population and those from other studies.

Interestingly, we found that the majority of patients (76.3%) had a low CD4 count and the use of antiretroviral therapy (Tavirubalysts and CD4+ lymphocyte-derived mononuclear cells) was associated with high prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance. The existence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance was also reported in patients with a highly elevated CD4 count and infection with T. gondii [32]. These infections are the main causes of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and also in patients with impaired immune function and AIDS [33].

We observed a lower prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance in patients with T. gondii infections compared to patients with T. gondii infections. However, we found that the prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance was lower in patients with T. gondii infections. This is in contrast to patients with T. gondii infections, who had higher prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance. The prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance in patients with T. gondii infections was lower than those with T. gondii infections, but this is not significant.

The prevalence of anti-interferon-gamma resistance was significantly higher in patients with T. gondii infections than in patients with T. gondii infections. The authors have suggested that the increase in anti-interferon-gamma resistance in patients with T. gondii infection may be due to the increased prevalence of T. gondii infections in these patients. It is possible that the increase in anti-interferon-gamma resistance in patients with T.
