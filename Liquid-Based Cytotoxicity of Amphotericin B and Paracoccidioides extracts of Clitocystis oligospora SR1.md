## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans and animals worldwide. Developing new therapies for this deadly infection is a difficult balance because the immune response is plastic and the optimal treatment is dependent on the nature and frequency of different immune responses and the particular molecular targets. In this study, we developed a novel real-time time (RNA)-seq approach to explore the cellular response of C. gattii to different inhibitors of the cytokines and the different antigens. More than half of the 252 proteins expressed in C. gattii A strain grown under different environmental conditions were up-regulated and down-regulated. The expression levels of several important regulatory proteins were also different among the different fractions. In particular, the levels of genes involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis, translation, and protein fate were investigated. Moreover, the up-regulated proteins were mainly involved in the synthesis of other important molecules such as polypeptides and secondary metabolites. The down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in the synthesis of amino acids. Finally, we found out that different fractions of the different fractions of the transcriptional regulator of C. gattii were highly enriched in the cells of the parasites. These results suggested that the different fractions of the regulator of C. gattii might play important roles in the survival and pathogenesis of the fungus.


## Introduction
All organisms are faced with constant selection of their DNA from their natural environment. Natural selection of DNA in plants is one of the most significant examples of natural selection. It is considered to be the most successful strategy in plant and animal evolution, due to its profound effects on both the host plant and the pathogen [1,2,3,4]. Plant pathogens are selected by a variety of mechanisms, including habitat changes, genetic variations, plant metabolic pathways and environmental stress [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Plants respond to environmental stress by changing the expression of genes [13,14,15,16], as well as the production of DNA and RNA, by an array of secreted proteins and other cellular components, including enzymes of the RNA polymerase [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. This class of enzymes is comprised of several different functionalities, which are highly conserved in eukaryotes, including enzymes of RNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA helicases and DNA cross-linking proteins [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. Previous studies on plant-fungal interactions have focused mainly on plant-fungal interactions. For example, using DNA-binding proteins and cytosolic protein-binding proteins, Yang et al. [50] investigated the interaction of fungi of the order Chaetothyriales with certain fungi. In that study, fungal interactions were compared with those of plant-fungal ones. The authors found that the interaction between fungi of the order Chaetothyriales and representatives of the asexual genus Fusarium was similar, although a major difference was that F. graminearum was associated with the parasitic form of the disease, F. graminearum sensu lato, while F. culmorum was associated with the sexual stage of the disease. In the study by Yang et al. [50], the asexual genera that were initially identified in the F. culmorum/F. graminearum study were included alluding to the invasion of the F.


## Methods

(ii) Comparison of the dose-effect relationship between the two extracts of Clitocystis oligospora SR. The MIC of the two extracts of Clitocystis oligospora SR1 was determined by the IC_50 (MIC of the extract) and the MIC of the extract of Paracoccidioides oligospora SR1 was determined by the IC_50 (MIC of the extract) in comparison with the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis. The MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis was determined using the IC_50 (MIC of the extract) and the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis was determined using the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis. The MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis was determined using the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of Penicillium moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P. moniliformis in comparison with the MIC of the extract of P.


## Results
Cell viability was assessed after 5, 24, 48, and 72 h of the treatment with Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Amphotericin E, and the intracellular viability of the cell was assessed after 72 h treatmen. We found that Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Amphotericin E caused cell death within the cell (Figure 4A), but not the phagocytes (Figure 4B). Paracoccidioides induced a dose-dependent death in the phagocytes. Amphotericin B caused death in the phagocytes. Interestingly, Paracoccidioides induced a dose-dependent death in the phagocytes. The results are in agreement with the results obtained with the intracellular viability assay (Figure 4B). The results indicate that Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides induced cell death, and death was not associated with the intracellular viability assay.

3.5. Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides-Induced Death Resulted in Systemic Cytotoxicity
We next investigated whether the intracellular viability of the cell was affected by the treatment with Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, or Paracoccidioides-Induced Death. The intracellular viability of the cell was assessed using the intracellular-vacuole assay. The results demonstrated that Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides induced death in the intracellular-vacuole assay, but not in the intracellular-vacuole assay. Therefore, Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides-induced death resulted in systemic toxicity.

3.6. Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides-Induced Death Resulted in Increased Systemic Cytotoxicity
We investigated the effects of Amphotericin B, Paracoccidioides, and Paracoccidioides-induced death on the cellular viability of three mammalian cell lines.


## Discussion
In this study, we have identified and characterized a new species of Cryptococcus in the subphylum Ascomycota and it is phylogenetically close to the highly venomous Cryptococcus rubescens. This species was originally described by Grunekov et al. (2011) from the Cryptococcus species complex in Spain and has been reported as the new species in the subphylum Ascomycota. This new species forms a well-supported clade with C. parapsilosis in our phylogenetic analyses.
