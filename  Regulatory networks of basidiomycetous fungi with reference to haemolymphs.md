## Abstract
Invertebrate transfer of genes in genomes has provided a significant advance in our understanding of genome organization and evolution. The transfer of genes from invertebrate sources to new hosts has been proposed as a step forward in the understanding of host-pathogen relationships. Despite this advancement, there is a need to move our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the origin of the multicellular lifestyle to a third genomes. To this end, we recently undertook a proteome-wide comparison of the genomes of three vertebrate transfer populations (i.e.


## Introduction
Iron is a key component of almost all living organisms and is essential for biological processes, such as cell growth, development, and the formation of bioactive molecules [1,2]. On the other hand, ferric iron (Fe^2+) and ferrous iron (Fe^3+) are essential for biochemical reactions such as amino acid biosynthesis, respiration, and DNA synthesis, such as in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [3]. Therefore, iron is generally considered as an electron-stable element with low molecular weight and high surface area, and therefore, it can interact with a wide range of biological molecules including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids [4].

Iron is a highly reactive and oxidized metal and its ability to react with different biological molecules is highly regulated [5]. On the other hand, ferric iron (Fe^3+) and ferric iron (Fe^2+) are relatively insoluble ferric iron (Fe^3+) and Fe^2+ [6]. Furthermore, ferric iron is not accessible to microbes and thus, the human pathogen C. neoformans uses ferric iron as a host to invade and establish infection [7,8]. In the C. neoformans genome, the major transporter (CNA) is the high affinity iron permease (HIF)-205, which is induced upon iron starvation and regulates the expression of iron-responsive genes [9,10]. The HIF-205 functions as a transporter for iron-regulated genes and thus, the C. neoformans HIF-205 plays an important role in iron uptake and utilization [11,12]. This adaptability of iron availability is regulated by the Hog1/Ssc2 protein complex, which is a heterotetramer composed of four subunits, Hog1, Hog2, Skc1, and Skc2 [13,14]. Hog1 is highly expressed upon iron deprivation and plays a critical role in the iron-sensing and utilization of this protein complex.


## Methods

Participants received either 10% thymotrypsin (Sigma) or .5% penicillin G.

Patients were divided into four groups (n = 3): (i) respiratory (n = 3), (ii) bronchiectasis (n = 3), (iii) liver cirrhosis (n = 3), (iv) chronic pulmonary disease (n = 3), and (v) CNS infection (n = 3).

To study the influence of organ burden on the overall clinical outcome, the studied groups were given all-cause mortality (21) and out-patient mortality (13). After admission, the heart rate was recorded and the relative respiratory rate (RMR) was calculated by dividing the number of breaths required to cause an RMR of 0.95 in 1 min by the total number of breaths required to cause an RMR of 1.30 min.

Ethics statement
This study was approved by the University of Aberdeen Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and was conducted according to the UK Home Office Project Licence PPL/70/890. All animals were handled in accordance with the principles of good animal practice as outlined in the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental Procedures and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals for the Use of Animals.

Data collection
Data were collected from patients who had undergone the n = 6 bronchoscopies. The bronchoscopies were performed using a sterile moist cotton swab with cotton swab tip and sputum removed. The bronchial wall was excised and the mucous was collected by plating a small amount of the mucous on sterile cotton swabs. The mucous was then collected in sterile tubes, air dried, and stored at -80Â°C.

The human oral cavity was sampled using a modified version of the method described by Bozzola et al. [20] and with some modifications. The oral cavity was cannulated with a sterile cotton swab. A freshly prepared 0.5 ml of sterile distilled water was then placed on the lower part of the swab. The mouth of the specimen was removed, and the swab was placed on a sterile cotton swab, and then the sample was placed on a sterile cotton swab.


## Results
The fungal lipids are derived from fatty acids (mostly triglycerides) and the mannose (a sterol) is synthesized in the formation of lipids [23. The lipids are initially derived from the fatty acid synthase [24], which is then converted to mannose, a key constituent of the fermentation medium.

The regulatory networks for lipids production were elucidated using a panel of ABC-lipid transporters [25,26]. ABC-ABC transporters are the first of many regulators that regulate fungal lipids production [27,28]. The ABC-ABC transporters contain two putative ABC-C transporters, ABC-D and ABC-F [25,26]. ABC-ABC transporters are found in all five fungal species tested (Table 2).

Transporters with regulatory networks
ABC-ABC transporters have been shown to be essential for fungal lipids production [29]. The ABC-ABC transporters are well-characterized regulators of ABC-lipid synthesis in yeast, with some exceptions. The ABC-ABC transporters have been shown to play a role in the regulation of ABC-binding and ABC-uptake transporters in a number of fungi [29,30]. In the present study, ABC-ABC transporters were found in all three basidiomycetous fungi tested, except for the lipase and ABC-ABC transporters in S. cerevisiae. The ABC-ABC transporters are found in the following species: C. neoformans, S. cerevisiae, F. graminearum, C. albicans, and M. grisea (Table 2). The ABC-ABC transporters have not been previously reported to play a role in ABC-ABC transporters in other filamentous ascomycetes.

ABC-ABC transporters are important in regulating the ABC-lipid-dependent C. neoformans-fungal filamentous ascomycete pathogenicity [31]. The ABC-ABC transporters in C. neoformans and S. cerevisiae were found in the following species: C. neoformans, F. graminearum, F. graminearum, and M. grisea. ABC-ABC transporters are found in S. cerevisiae, S.


## Discussion
The outcome of the transformation experiment also included an attempt to find and characterize other fungal familie. In addition to the widely used ITS and LSU-based SSU rDNA, our phylogenetic analysis also identified the genomes of many common fungi and many other fungal families, including ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts, the type species of Aspergillus, and other classes of fungi, such as fungi of the ascomycete and basidiomycete genera.

In this study we also attempted to develop a phylogenetic tree based on the six ITS, LSU, 6.8S, RPB2, and TEF1 regions. However, we were unable to find a significant number of species in the phylogenetic tree because the majority of ITS, LSU, 6.8S, RPB2, and TEF1 regions were missing. In our study, we focused on the ITS region, which is also common among some common fungi. To get a clear representation of the ITS region, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the seven common fungal species (Figure 1). The tree showed that the most commonly used ITS and LSU genes, except for LSU, were present in the ITS region of most common fungi. These gene clusters are phylogenetically related to the members of the genus Aspergillus.

To gain further insights into the phylogenetic relationships of the common fungal species, we searched the five common fungal species (Table 2) with different ITS and LSU loci, including the putative three putative clades in this study. The ITS region of the six common fungal species (Table 2) was missing in the ITS region of most common fungi, including the ascomycete and basidiomycete genera and the type species of Aspergillus. Therefore, we used the ITS region of the six common fungal species (Table 2) for our tree of the common fungal species. Based on the tree, the two clades (C. cinerea and S. brasiliensis) clustered together with the ITS regions of the six common fungal species (Table 2) (Figure 1), which indicated that this clade could represent the ancestral species of Aspergillus.
