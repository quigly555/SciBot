## Abstract
Microbial oils are widely produced by symbiotic fungi. These biofactories contain lipids, such as polyacrylate and alkyl glycerol, essential oils that are widely used in food and cosmetic industries. Flavonoids, syntheses of vegetable glycosides, chlorogenic acids, fatty acids and fatty derivatives, as well as fatty kerides, have been the focus of research since the 1990s. They are now considered safe as they offer greater bioactivity than synthetic oils. The aim of this review is to collect the latest information about bioactivity and to propose future strategies to improve the use of these biofactories.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease in HIV/AIDS, and is the most common form of immunosuppression in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where most HIV/AIDS patients are co-infected with respiratory illness [1]. Cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, encephalitis, and acute pulmonary fibrosis (AFL) are the most common causes of pulmonary infection in HIV/AIDS [2]. In these conditions, central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a common finding and can be a missed opportunity to diagnose a local disease.


## Methods
WM276 were selected as phyllosticta and s. WM276. The phyllosticta and sp.


## Results
4 = NBRC 32634; Phyllosticta oxysporum CBS 24.86 = NBRC 32634; Phyllosticta s. str. CBS 244.95 = NBRC 32634).

Additional data: ElsinoÃ« sp. nov. (CBS 245.86) was identified as being an additional species of Phyllosticta in the phylogenetic analyses (Fig 1) but no further collections were available for the new genus. The new genus Phyllosticta is described as a new species, Phyllosticta solani. The type species of Phyllosticta, Phyllosticta s. str. was described as a species of Phyllosticta (holotype CBS H-19839, culture ex-type CBS 118479 = NBRC 32639).

Material examined: Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, on Eucalyptus crenarchaeum, May 1871, P.W. Crous, culture CBS 224.73 = IB 2837.

Notes: The strain CBS 224.73 was originally identified as Phyllosticta acericola (Pers.) Sacc., but it was not available in culture. The original description of the host from which it was isolated is identical to that of the type species of Phyllosticta, Phyllosticta acericola (Pers.) Sacc.


## Discussion
In this study we investigated the ability of the C. laurentii isolates to grow and colonize on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees, using the chemical composition of the leaves. The results from our experiment showed that the isolates showed significant diversity and phenotypic differences between the two tree species. The results showed that the isolates of C. laurentii were more tolerant to E. coli than E. coli. The isolate of C.
