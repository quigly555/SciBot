## Abstract
This study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the ethyl acetate extract (EA) and the ethyl phosphate extract (EPL) extracts against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection.

The EA extract was prepared by maceration in methanol and partitioned into eight fractions (1-8 µg/mL for each extract). The extracts were then subjected to determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC/MBC) using the microdilution method. The extract prepared from the prepared fractions was subjected to antimicrobial tests using the broth microdilution method. The MIC and MBC/MBC values of the extract were determined by the method described in a previous (vol. 2, no. 4) and compared with those reported for the EPL extract (vol. 1, no. 6).

The results showed that the EA extract and the EPL extracts exhibited antimicrobial activities against the studied M. tuberculosis isolates. The EA extract prepared from the studied fractions was able to inhibit M. tuberculosis with a MIC of 2.5-6.0 mg/mL. The comparison of the MIC values of the extracts and the EPL extracts with the MIC values showed that the EPL extract was able to reduce the growth of M. tuberculosis in treated samples by more than 10-fold when compared with the other studied extracts.

The results of this study showed that the EA extract and the EPL extracts were able to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis by more than two-fold when compared with the other studied M. tuberculosis extracts. The comparison of the results of the present study with the results from a previous study in which the MBC/MBC values were reported for the extracts were also helpful in determining the correct combination of selected extracts and the EPL results. It is necessary to carry out an in-depth study to confirm the results of this study.


## Introduction
Melanins are extracellular polymers produced by microorganisms of the order Microascales. Essentiality has been recognized as a significant factor in the survival of microorganisms from natural disasters and in the stress that they face from pathogens. In fact, essentiality is one of the most widely recognized traits of a microorganism. Thus, it is not a surprise that the main defense against pathogens is a high capacity of a protective pigment, a melanin.


## Methods
vinifera) and from other trees in Vitis vinifer. Five of the species were studied in this study and five of the species were excluded due to the presence of intact trees. No fungal species were available in the outgroup species. Fungal isolates were maintained at -80°C in the mycology laboratory of the CBS-KNAW Herbarium, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Isolation of RNA and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from an actively growing hypha from an individual tree in Vitis vinifera and from a whole tree in Vitis vinifera. Reverse transcription was performed using the RiboPure Yeast Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. cDNA was synthesised using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. First strand cDNA was synthesised using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). For cDNA synthesis, 1 µl of each oligonucleotide (10 µM each) and 0.1 µM of each dNTP were used in the first-strand reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at 42°C for 10 min. After the reaction, 0.2 µl of the cDNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) and the product was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). All oligonucleotides were labelled with random hexamer primers and the reverse transcription reaction was performed with the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). For cDNA synthesis, cDNA was synthesised using the Quant-iT RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. First strand cDNA was synthesised with the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Reverse transcription was performed with the Quant-iT RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) and the product was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 1 ml of fresh fungal culture in 1.


## Results
In vitro antifungal activity
The antifungal activity of the tested compounds against M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans was assessed against the three clinical strains of M. tuberculosis (Table 1). Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be more potent against M. tuberculosis than C. neoformans. Compounds 3 and 4 were the most potent against C. neoformans. Compounds 5, 6, and 7 were more potent against C. neoformans than C. albicans.

Plant pathogenicity
The antifungal activity of the tested compounds was evaluated in the following conditions: exposure to inactivated P. aeruginosa or H_2O_2, inactivation of C. albicans or inhibition of F. graminearum growth (Figure 1). No significant differences were observed in the relative killing by both fungi at the dose of 2 mg/kg (Table 2).

## Discussion
These communities, and the abundance of bacterial communities, are in line with the dynamics of bacterial community structure in wood decaying fungi [18.

All of the woody hosts identified in this study are commonly collected in the region of the traditional Vitis vinifera diet. However, the number of microbial communities associated with the three woody hosts varied significantly between each of the three woody hosts (Fig 4A). The abundance of OTU phylotypes was highest in the Vitis vinifera environment, whereas this phylotype was lowest in the Garlic-related foods (Fig 4B). This suggests that the microbiome of the two woody hosts may be distinct and that the microbiota of these three woody hosts is distinct. The genus Saccharomyces is known for its ability to colonize and replicate within host tissue [14], and the microbiology of these species is currently being investigated.

The most abundant phylotypes identified in the three woody hosts were ITS and 28S rDNA. The phylotypes of the genera Russulales, Hypocreales and Proteobacteria were similar to each other, with the only exception of Tremellomycetes, which was absent in the other two woody hosts (Fig 4B). Russulales are able to form autophagic branched mycelium and form diatoms, and their mycelium is characterized by the presence of a type I mycelium [16]. Proteobacteria are phylogenetically well-studied colonizers of woody tissues [19], and their abundance in the three woody hosts is consistent with the observed diversity in the woody communities of the three woody hosts.

The abundance of bacterial OTUs was highest in the three woody hosts, and the proportion of bacterial OTUs was highest in the Vitis vinifera environment. It is possible that the presence of the microbiome in this environment may be associated with the abundance of gut bacteria in the woody hosts. The presence of gut bacteria may provide a means for the establishment of host-pathogen interactions and has been demonstrated to be associated with the gut bacteria of woody hosts [18].
