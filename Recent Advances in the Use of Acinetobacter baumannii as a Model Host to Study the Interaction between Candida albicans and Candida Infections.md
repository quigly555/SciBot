## Abstract
Background: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) infection has a high morbidity and mortality. A new treatment approach for cryptococcosis involves the use of antifungals, but the efficacy of these treatments has not been well-studied. A new approach is needed to improve treatment outcomes in patients at risk of developing CM.


## Introduction

Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen that infects the majority of healthy individual. It is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and causes most of the infections. The ability to cause infections by C. albicans is dependent on its ability to survive in the environment and to survive and adapt to adverse conditions. This makes C. albicans a suitable model host to study the interaction between C. albicans and other microorganisms. The versatility of the C. albicans cell wall allows the cells to invade a wide range of environmental niches and to perform diverse and complex functions, including adhesion, biofilm formation, biofilm growth, invasion, and virulence.

One of the fundamental mechanisms of host-parasite interactions is the recognition of a self-produced extracellular matrix, the biofilm. The extracellular matrix provides a protective barrier against microbial invasion and protects the cells from invasion by other microbes. In this regard, the extracellular matrix is composed of a diverse array of proteins including glycoproteins, adhesins, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [20], [21]. Many studies have shown that the recognition of the biofilm is mainly by the adhesins and macrophages, which include the innate immune system (NIC) and the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) class of immune cells [22-26]. In this regard, AMPs have been extensively studied in the literature and are characterized by their activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites [27-31]. They are collectively referred to as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are divided into two broad classes, which are presented in Table 1. The first class is comprised of cysteine, threonine, leucine, and histidine molecules [32], while the second class, which is comprised of peptide moieties, is present in the second class.

The extracellular matrix is composed of polymeric material, such as polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, peptides, and DNA. It is composed of glycosaminoglycans, glycopeptides, glycopeptides, dendrimers, and glycopeptides.


## Methods
. albicans (strain ATCC^® MYA-75) was used as the model host in this study. All Candida strains were maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) slants at 37 °C for 7 days.

Antifungal Agents
Antifungal drugs used in this study were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Isolation and Isolation of Fungal Cells
For the isolation of fungal cells, RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used, and the media was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min.

For the isolation of filamentous fungi, C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75 was used. The media was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min.

For the isolation of mycelial cell wall, C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75 was used. The media was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min.

For the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans (strain ATCC^® MYA-75), C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75, and C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75, were used. The media was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min.

For the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans (strain ATCC^® MYA-75), C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75, and C. albicans ATCC^® MYA-75, were used.


## Results
(Table 1. A second agent, S. cerevisiae, also exhibited strong activity against Candida spp., but with lower MICs. The activities of Acinetobacter baumannii and C. albicans against these two Candida species are comparable to the MIC values obtained for S. cerevisiae against all Candida spp. used for our study (Table 1).

In vitro susceptibility testing of C. albicans to these agents
Our data suggest that both the antifungal susceptibility of C. albicans and the low susceptibility of C. albicans to the selected agents are likely to be related to the presence of these two yeasts in the biofilm. To test this hypothesis, the ability of C. albicans to colonize the biofilm was evaluated. No significant difference was observed in the MIC values of C. albicans against all Candida species tested (Table 2). No statistically significant differences were found in the MIC values of C. albicans against Candida albicans against all Candida species tested (Table 2). However, MIC values were slightly higher for C. albicans against all Candida species tested (Table 2).

In vivo susceptibility testing of C. albicans against S. cerevisiae
In a clinical setting, the impact of S. cerevisiae on the growth of C. albicans in vitro is an exciting topic. However, we have observed that the fungal growth in the presence of S. cerevisiae is inhibited, and the organism loses its ability to establish and grow in the presence of S. cerevisiae. The inhibition of the fungal growth by S. cerevisiae is well established [15]. The inhibitory effect of C. albicans on C. albicans in vitro is not well described, but the activity of the antifungal agent against C. albicans has been reported [17, 18]. To examine the inhibitory effect of the antifungal agent, we first tested the antifungal activity of the commercial product (bactofuranil) against C. albicans. As shown in Figure 1, it was remarkably effective against C. albicans.


## Discussion
The use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a model for studying the interaction between biofilms and biofilm-associated bacteria and the characterization of the interaction site with biofilm-associated bacterial strains has been demonstrated in previous studie. In this study, we provide the first demonstration of the use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel candidate for developing a biofilm-degrading drug. Our data suggest that Acinetobacter baumannii can be used as a potential target for the development of drug development against biofilms.

A previous study showed that Acinetobacter baumannii can be used as a biofilm-degrading drug [29]. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to develop a biofilm-degrading drug using Acinetobacter baumannii as a target. We had previously reported that Acinetobacter baumannii can be used as a biofilm-degrading drug [30]. Our data also showed that Acinetobacter baumannii can be used as a model for studying the interaction between biofilms and biofilms. The identification of the possible new targets in Acinetobacter baumannii will allow us to identify new targets for developing novel biofilm-degrading drugs.

The use of a novel strategy to develop biofilms has been reported in previous studies [31]. In this study, we showed that the use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel target can improve the potential for developing biofilm-degrading drugs. The use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel drug will improve the potential for developing biofilm-degrading drugs, as demonstrated in previous studies [31].

Our data suggest that the use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel drug is a good strategy to develop a novel biofilm-degrading drug. The use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel drug will improve the potential for developing biofilm-degrading drugs. The use of Acinetobacter baumannii as a novel drug will increase the growth rate of C. albicans and C. neoformans, and the enzyme activity of C. neoformans.
