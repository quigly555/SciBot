## Abstract
The phylloplane yeast Phlebia radiata causes blue spot disease on citrus fruit. In order to survive in citrus, P. radiata produces a unique environment where it must survive inside the fruit tissues, which is extremely restricted by its low pH. This minireview discusses the impacts of the pH-responsive metabolism of P. radiata on the fungal pathogenicity and on pathogenicity toward humans.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a life-threatening infection of the central nervous system, causing 15% of AIDS-related deaths in the developing world [1]. Cryptococcal meningitis is generally self-limiting, with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 40%, depending on the patient population and environmental exposure [2]. However, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is associated with other immunocompromised populations, such as individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and solid organ transplant recipients [3]. The risk factors for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis are HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, and trauma, as well as immune-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis and tuberculosis viruses [4, 5]. The most common immunocompromised state is those with severe underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, to a lesser extent, those with haematological diseases, such as haematologic malignancies [4, 6]. In this article, we highlight some of the unique differences in host responses to cryptococcal infection that contribute to the different clinical outcomes.


## Methods
In brief, 1 × 10^6 fresh conidia (for the inoculum preparation) were added to the appropriate wells of 96-well plates and the plate was then incubated at 37°C for 24 . The cell concentrations were determined by measuring the OD_405 and the experiment was repeated three times.

To test the lipid accumulation of Phlebia triticina on Litchi a_3-4, 10^6 fresh conidia were added to 100 µl of RPMI 1640 medium (Maltag, Shanghai, China) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were then collected, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and adjusted to a density of 1 × 10^8 colony forming units (CFU/ml) per ml. The experiment was repeated three times.

Quantitative Analysis of Lipid Content of Phlebia triticina
The RNA of Phlebia triticina was extracted using TRIzol^® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined using the Qubit^® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA integrity of the RNA samples was evaluated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

## Results
The wild type, however, did not show any changes in the total lipid content when the mutant was grown on minimal media containing 50% glycerol, 20% glycerol, 10% glycerol, 30% glycerol or 60% glycerol (Table 1. The mutant showed an increase of the total lipid content when grown on glycerol at the concentration of 10% glycerol.

The lipid accumulation of Phlebia triticina on litchi (lower Resh Forest) on litchi must be compared with that of wild type on the lipid content. The lipid content of the mutant was significantly decreased (Table 1). In order to assess the lipid accumulation of Phlebia triticina on litchi (lower Resh Forest) on litchi, the wild type and the mutant strain were grown on 50% glycerol, 20% glycerol, 30% glycerol, 60% glycerol or 60% glycerol and then the mutants were grown on glycerol or glycerol at the concentration of 10% glycerol or 20% glycerol (Table 1). The wild type was able to accumulate more than 80% of the total lipid content on the medium. The mutant showed a decrease of almost 30% on the total lipid content when grown on glycerol at the concentration of 10% glycerol.

The expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3,4-dihydro-SOD, C-type lectin and C-type lectin in the mutant
The expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3,4-dihydro-SOD, C-type lectin and C-type lectin were analyzed in the mutant strain after growth on glycerol or glycerol at the concentration of 10% glycerol or 20% glycerol. The results showed that the mutant showed a decrease of almost 30% on the total lipid content on the medium (Table 1). The expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3,4-dihydro-SOD, C-type lectin and C-type lectin was significantly increased (Table 1).


## Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare fungal communities between two regions of the UK and to evaluate the impact of the two main commercial sources of B. cenocepacia on fungal communities.

Our results are in agreement with previous reports [1] that show that the fungal communities of the two commercial B. cenocepacia spruce forests are similar (Figure 1 and 2), while the fungal communities in the same spruce spruce samples were more diverse (Figure 1 and 2). The variation in fungal communities within spruce spruce samples could be explained by the different geographic locations, as spruce forests in the UK are wider and the spruce spruce is commonly found on different sides of the river, which could favor the spruce trees as sources of B. cenocepacia and B. cenocepacia, which are more abundant on the south side of the river. In contrast to the UK, where B.
