## Abstract
The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis and sepsis in ENTH-infected patients was significantly higher than in healthy control. Cryptococcus neoformans was the predominant causative agent in RUM/MR samples. RUM/MR levels of C. neoformans were significantly higher in ENTH-infected patients. Furthermore, the presence of serum C. neoformans was associated with a reduced risk of cryptococcal meningitis and sepsis. In conclusion, environmental factors and viral load may play a role in cryptococcal meningitis and sepsis in ENTH-infected patients.

Cryptococcus neoformans is the commonest cause of cryptococcosis worldwide. Despite the need to acquire anti-cryptococcal drugs, the number of patients with proven cryptococcosis has not been consistently determined. We conducted this study to determine the prevalence of cryptococcosis in the greater ENTH area.

We used PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to search for studies including participants from ENTH and risk factors for cryptococcosis.

Two reviewers independently pooled the data.

Two reviewers independently analyzed the data.

Ninety-four participants met study criteria; 33 (65.4%) had prior cryptococcosis experience. Participants with proven meningitis were more likely to have serum C. neoformans than controls (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, p = 0.026, slope 1.4; OR 95%CI 1.4-2.0, p = 0.049). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for cryptococcal meningitis were having serum C. neoformans (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.9-18.3, p = 0.038, slope 1.4; OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.5-12.6, p = 0.023, OR 95% CI 1.3-4.9, p = 0.005, respectively). Participants with sepsis were more likely to have cryptococcal meningitis (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.6, p = 0.028, slope 1.5; OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-8.5, p = 0.005, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-9.


## Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a common manifestation of the disease and can lead to an exaggerated immune response that is associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (1). The condition is most commonly manifested in patients with HIV infection receiving high-dose corticosteroids or receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for organ transplantation (2-4).

In a study of immunologically uninfected patients with HIV infection, the initial presentation was indistinguishable from that of the uninfected. The clinical manifestations were indistinguishable from those of the uninfected (5). The rate of IRIS was significantly higher in the group receiving corticosteroid therapy (P < 0.001) and the treatment was associated with poor prognosis (4). The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been associated with the IRIS phase II study (6).

There are two major clinical manifestations of IRIS. In the first, the inflammatory marrow is mobilized and can differentiate into the thymus and/or lymph nodes, which lead to the occurrence of a Th2 response (7). The Th2 response is characterized by the production of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines by the Th1 cell type, and IL-6 and IL-13 cytokines by the Th2 cell type, which contribute with the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In the second, the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome occurs as a Th1-mediated immune response to fungal infection (8).

Despite its name, IRIS is not a new phenomenon. Various reports have described the occurrence of IRIS after solid organ transplantation (9, 10). Although the incidence of IRIS is relatively low, it is associated with the hyperinflammatory cytokine response (11-13) and has been associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The main features of IRIS are an impaired interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) production, increased levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, and IFN-<U+03B3> (13).

The immunological mechanisms that regulate the immune response to fungi are not well understood.


## Methods
This retrospective study was carried out in the Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients were enrolled from January 2008 to December 2009. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine approved the ethical review process in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the University of São Paulo College Guide for Medical Research (ICCMR) and the University of São Paulo Code of Ethics in Clinical Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo approved the ethical review process in accordance with the ICCMR and the University of São Paulo Code of Ethics in Clinical Medicine. All patients gave written informed consent and all clinical samples were collected in accordance with national guidelines for animal experimentation.

Methods
Patients with CD4 count < 100 cells/µL were identified using a standardized scoring system. The incidence of infection was estimated based on the number of cryptococcal organisms (n = 6/group) per 100 cells of a whole blood sample. Patients with a positive CSF India ink stain or India ink stain-positive CSF (n = 4/group) and a positive culture of C. neoformans were classified as “C. neoformans-positive”. All of the negative CSF cultures were also included in this study.

The number of cryptococcal organisms (n = 6/group) in CSF samples was divided into five groups: “C. neoformans-positive”, “C. neoformans-negative”, “C. neoformans-positive”, “C. neoformans-negative”, and “C. neoformans-positive”. To avoid any possible bias due to low numbers of CSF samples, all patients’ CSF samples with a positive CSF culture, positive CSF culture, or negative CSF culture were considered as “negative”. In addition, the number of C.


## Results
Identification of a possible Alzheimer's disease-associated transcript
To identify possible Alzheimer's disease-associated transcript, whole-genome sequencing was carried out on 2,000 randomly selected human embryonic fibroblasts (HEFF) by using a bimodal priming strategy. The first round of sequencing was carried out with a total of 6,660,822 bp of sequence.


## Discussion
Additionally, the differences in patient population of ENTH-infected patients between RUM/MR and ENTH-infected patients could not be identified due to the high mortality in ENTH-infected patient. These data indicate that ENTH patients are more likely to have cryptococcosis, which is a common finding in ENTH-infected patients.

Among the identified fungal pathogens in ENTH-infected patients, Cryptococcus gattii, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Histoplasma capsulatum were the most frequently isolated fungal pathogens in ENTH-infected patients. Cryptococcus gattii is frequently isolated from patients with hematologic malignancies [7], [8], [10], [11], [12]. Histoplasma capsulatum is also a common fungal pathogen in ENTH patients [7], [12], [13]. The prevalence of Histoplasma capsulatum in ENTH-infected patients was 34% [14]. The prevalence of Histoplasma capsulatum in ENTH-infected patients was 44% [7], [12]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal pathogen in ENTH patients [7], [12], [15], [16]. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from a patient in a patient with cryptococcosis, and Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from a patient with pulmonary cryptococcosis [17]. In our study, Cryptococcus gattii was the most frequent fungal species isolated from ENTH patients. The prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans in ENTH patients was 32.9% [18]. The prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii in ENTH patients was 17.2% [19], but the prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii in ENTH patients was 10.6%. The prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans in ENTH patients was 12.3%, but the prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii in ENTH patients was 12.7%. The prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii in ENTH patients was 16.2%, but the prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii in ENTH patients was 9.7%. The prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans in ENTH patients was 19.3%, but the prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans in ENTH patients was 10.9%.
