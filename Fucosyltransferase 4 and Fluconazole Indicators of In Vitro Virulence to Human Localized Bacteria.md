## Abstract
Over the past few decades, fungal infections have become more and more of a public health concern. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is now the second leading cause of fungal infections in humans. Aspergillus fumigatus is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen. As a result, there is an increasing demand for improved diagnostic methods and a growing number of fungal species are resistant to current antifungal drugs. Aspergillus fumigatus can cause severe invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.


## Introduction

On No. 20, 2017, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) released a report that recognized that viral bacilli are recognized as the first line of defense against bacterial infections. Among the pathogens, bacilli are the most common etiological agents of bacterial diarrhea and other common intestinal disorders, and are responsible for over half a million deaths each year worldwide (WHO, 2017). In addition to the increasing number of health care facilities and widespread use of antibiotics, the amount of infections caused by bacilli is increasing. Currently, the highest number of bacteria that cause diarrhea worldwide is the fourth most common cause of disease in the United States (WHO, 2017). The problem is also increasing due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacilli (Rouxel and Hall, 2016). The fact that bacilli are capable of producing many virulence factors makes them more adaptable to changing conditions of infection, and therefore more successful as carriers of cargo. In this regard, antibacterial agents can be used against bacterial pathogens, and their effectiveness as carriers is also being tested in an attempt to understand the complex interactions of these microorganisms with their hosts.

Currently, most of the antibacterial agents used in the treatment of bacterial diarrhea are antibacterial agents and therefore have limitations. There is no standard regimen for the treatment of diarrhea, and it is clear that some drugs such as rifampicin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can have negative effects against bacilli. Thus, some studies reported that some antimicrobial agents such as rifampicin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are more effective against the pathogenic bacteria than those against the nonpathogenic bacteria (Ahmed et al., 2011). The antimicrobial activity of some drugs is due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membrane systems. However, some antibiotics, such as the group of carbapenems and cephalosporins, can have a higher activity than the antimicrobial agents. These drugs have several drawbacks, such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity, and the mechanism of action is not well understood. Furthermore, some agents have strong immunosuppressive effects, such as the ability to interfere with immune responses, and some have a narrow spectrum of activity. These disadvantages make them more suitable for developing new antimicrobial agents with more precise targets and a broad spectrum.


## Methods
Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was remove. The pellet was washed in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 15 min to remove non-adherent bacteria. The pellet was re-suspended in sterile 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml of sterile water and the fluconazole resistance was determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 412 nm using a spectrophotometer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The specificity of the assay was confirmed using the assays of B. dermatitidis and E. coli strains. Briefly, we first screened the bacteria with B. dermatitidis and E. coli using the antibiotic-sensitive panel of B. dermatitidis and E. coli strains BdSFS4 and BdSFS4, which are non-fluorescent and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents. Next, we tested the bacteria with E. coli and the resistance to fluconazole. Next, we tested the bacteria with E. coli and the resistance to fluconazole. The specificity of the assay was confirmed using the assays of Mucorales and Coccidioides. The specificity of the assay was confirmed using the assays of Mucorales and Coccidioides.

## Results
The authors also found that the genes involved in the production of cell wall degrading enzymes, such as Cu-glucan synthase (Cu-SOD) and ÃŸ-glucan synthase (GST), were upregulated in the plant infection (Supplementary Material online.

Cell wall degrading enzymes are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. During plant infection, extracellular extracellular enzymes are necessary for maintaining a healthy immune response. The plant-pathogenic fungus, F. oxysporum, produces extracellular secretory proteins that are secreted by the host (Hewlett et al. 2007). Extracellular secreted proteins are thought to be secreted in the fungal cell to activate immune responses during plant infection (Otten et al. 2002). The plant pathogenic fungus grows on a variety of plant surfaces and also to enhance plant tolerance (Wong et al. 2005). The extracellular secreted proteins that were upregulated in plant infection were not secreted by F. oxysporum. Instead, they were secreted in the infected plant tissue (Supplementary Material online).

As fungal secreted proteins play a key role in fungal pathogenicity, we compared the extracellular secreted proteins between plant and fungal infection models (Fig 5). The secreted proteins were not only up-regulated during plant infection but also up-regulated in plant infection (Fig 5). These results suggest that plant infection with F. oxysporum might be a fungal pathogen that promotes host immune cell responses during plant infection.

We then compared the extracellular secreted proteins of plant and fungal infection models. F. oxysporum secreted extracellular proteins were significantly enriched in the plant infection model (Fig 5). The extracellular secreted proteins were significantly enriched in the plant infection model (Fig 5).

A total of 40 extracellular proteins were up-regulated in plant infection (Fig 5).


## Discussion
In addition to Aspergillus, Cryptococcus is also a ubiquitous fungal pathogen which causes diseases in human. Thus, it is possible that the presence of this fungal pathogen in humans could explain the increased prevalence of C. albicans in the skin of humans. In fact, in a recent study of a patient with C. neoformans var. grubii infection in Korea, the fungal infection was observed in all the samples tested. [2] Additionally, a recent study conducted in Brazil reported a relative abundance of C. albicans and C. tropicalis in the skin of healthy individuals. [4]

In contrast to our findings, C. parapsilosis was the most common fungal pathogen isolated from the skin of healthy individuals. [2] This species is often isolated from water, soil, pigeon droppings, and other surfaces. [4] In addition to C. parapsilosis, several other fungal pathogens were also isolated from the skin of healthy individuals. [2], [5] As reported in this study, C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species from the skin of healthy individuals. [2] In addition, C. tropicalis was isolated from the skin of healthy individuals. [2] In this study, C. parapsilosis was the most common pathogen isolated from the skin of healthy individuals. In addition, C. parapsilosis was also the most frequently isolated pathogen from the skin of healthy individuals.

Our results demonstrate that the skin of healthy individuals is a suitable environment for fungal infection. Moreover, fungal infections caused by C. parapsilosis are rarely reported in the literature, [2] as reported in this study. Although the pathogenicity of C. parapsilosis has not been reported previously, the presence of C. albicans in the skin of healthy individuals is an interesting observation. This fungus is known to produce antimicrobial peptides and to produce hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the surface of host cells. [2], [4] Therefore, the increased prevalence of C. parapsilosis in the skin of healthy individuals could be due to the virulence of this fungus.
