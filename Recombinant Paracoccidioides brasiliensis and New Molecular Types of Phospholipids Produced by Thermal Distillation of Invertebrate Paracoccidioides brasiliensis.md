## Abstract
The presence of recombining strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Sporothrix schenckii is a known risk factor for sporotrichosis, a fungal infection of wheat and rye due to the decay of the sporotrichoma plant cell wall. We found that S. cerevisiae H99, which is a rare form of wheat sporotrichosis, is a less frequent cause of wheat death than S. schenckii. We also found that isolates from S. cerevisiae, S. schenckii, and S. mexicana produced a more severe form of sporotrichosis than did the S. schenckii-knock-out strains. We conclude that wheat sporotrichosis is caused by S. cerevisiae H99, whereas S. schenckii is more common than S. mexicana. We hypothesize that the presence of S. cerevisiae H99 might explain its pathogenicity; a single strain of S. cerevisiae could trigger several different forms of sporotrichosis.

## Introduction
The genus Paracoccidioides includes the members of the thermodimorphic and dimorphic fungi. Members of the Paracoccidioides genus have been known to produce a variety of thermally dimorphic basidiomata that grow on dead branches of the tree of temperance and grow as saprophytic on dead trees and on dead plants (O’Donnell and McDonald, 2000). The saprophytic growth of Paracoccidioides is a result of the morphological changes that occur in the host plant, including the formation of pseudoparaphyses, which are mostly recalcitrant to conventional chemical fungicides, and diploid, which are capable of proliferating in the host plant in the absence of chemical fungicides (O’Donnell and McDonald, 2000). The dimorphic, thermally dimorphic fungi are morphologically similar to the thermodimorphic fungi of the subgenus T. reesea, except for the growth on dead stems and on dead leaves (McDonald, 1972; O’Donnell and McDonald, 2000). This difference in the morphological characteristics was demonstrated by melanization in T. reesea and T. reesea, which were found to be associated with the morphological transition, followed by dimorphism. Melanization in T. reesea and T. reesea was also shown to be related to the pathogenicity of the fungus (O’Donnell and McDonald, 2000). In contrast, melanin in T. reesea and T. reesea has not been found to be associated with the dimorphism of the fungus.

The genus Paracoccidioides comprises a wide range of pathogenic fungi that cause severe disease in humans and animals. These include the paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) complex, which is prevalent in South America and is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P.


## Methods
AGLN00000000) to identify the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis phospholipids, which are normally the most abundant phospholipids in rice-leafworm die. Using the data obtained from the molecular-based approach, the presence of the following phospholipid-producing, phospholipid-binding proteins were characterized.

Phospholipid Production Using the Transformation of Rice Leafworm
For the first time, the pholipid-binding protein (PPM1) was purified from rice leaf sheaths using a purification step as described previously [29] using the pJAF8 plasmid and an appropriate vector sequence (Fungi-Blunt Plus Protein Fungus, Invitrogen). The purified pPM1 was subjected to purification and elution with Protein A (Invitrogen) and the remaining PPM1 was subjected to sequence analysis to obtain the pPM2. The purified pPM2 was also subjected to further analysis to obtain the PPM2.

Phospholipid Production Using the Transformation of Rice Leafworm
PPM2 was purified from rice leaf sheaths using a purification step as described previously [29]. The purified pPM2 was subjected to purification and elution with Protein A (Invitrogen) and the remaining pPM2 was subjected to sequence analysis to obtain the pPM3. The purified pPM3 was also subjected to further analysis to obtain the pPM3.

## Results
brasiliensis, and the PE medium was used to produce purified PE with the aim of obtaining the highest yiel. The PE medium was then supplemented with the PE medium at a concentration of 10 µg/ml to release the soluble peptide-peptide mixture. The soluble peptide mixture was then tested for its ability to produce PE and it was found that it did not show any significant activity with the PE medium in the time course.

## Discussion
In addition, we were able to obtain a comparison of the genome sequences of all other fungal and Basidiomycota specie. The two largest genera of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, were closely related to each other in this study, and both are able to form true yeast-like structures on Paracoccidioides brasiliensis grown in liquid medium. Although the fungus is a member of the order Chytridiomycetes, its sequence is different from that of Candida albicans. Additionally, the yeast-like structures of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis were observed on artificial plates, which may explain the greater number of filamentous fungi formed on artificial media.

The genus Candida is one of the largest families of yeast-like fungi and is found in soil and on plant substrates [28], [29], [30]. Although the yeast-like structures are present in many ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi, most of the Candida species have been isolated from soil and woody plant substrates [31], [32]. The yeast-like structures of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis were also observed on C. albicans grown in liquid medium, indicating that this species may be a saprophytic fungus. Therefore, our results are in agreement with previous findings [17], [18].

In addition to the yeast-like structures, the fungus was also observed to be able to form true yeast-like structures on Paracoccidioides brasiliensis grown in liquid medium. The fungus was detected on C. albicans grown in liquid medium, indicating that this species may be a saprophytic fungus. Previous studies of the fungus Penicillium marneffei have shown that the fungus can form true yeast-like structures [33]. The fungus was also detected on C. neoformans grown in liquid medium, indicating that this species is a saprophytic fungus.
