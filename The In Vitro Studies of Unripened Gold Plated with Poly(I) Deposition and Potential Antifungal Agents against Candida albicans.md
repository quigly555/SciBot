## Abstract
The soil microbiota is composed of microbial communities composed of bacteria, fungi, and archaea. Current information on the microbial communities associated with plant roots does not provide a clear picture of the soil, and thus, the functional roles of these communities have been investigated. In order to better understand the functional roles of the soil microbiota, we performed a systematic analysis to identify the microbial communities present in the roots of plant-roots in two Dutch soybean fields sampled from different cultivars. A total of 42,864 putative bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, which corresponded OTUs from bacteria to fungi. The composition of the soil microbiota was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and we identified 285 putative OTUs that were associated with fungi. In addition, we also identified putative fungal OTUs that were associated with plant root tips. These results establish that the soil microbiota is a complex organism and includes bacterial and fungal communities associated with the root tips of different Dutch soybean plants, suggesting that both bacterial and fungal communities are deeply integrated with respect to the roots of different Dutch soybean fields.

In order to better understand the functional roles of the soil microbiota, we analyzed the microbial communities present in the roots of different plant-roots in two Dutch soybean fields sampled from different cultivars. This analysis revealed several putative bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units that were associated with the roots of different Dutch soybean fields. These groups of OTUs are of interest to plant root symbionts and for the fungal community management of the roots of different Dutch soybean fields.


## Introduction
The genus Trichoderma contains a wide range of saprophytic and pathogenic species, some of which are responsible for a wide range of human and animal fungal infections [1]. The genus Trichoderma is a genus of fungi and comprises numerous dermatophytes, acanthosis, keratitis, mycosphaerella, phaeohyphomycetes and other closely related species, such as Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma atreosa, Trichoderma boulardi, Trichoderma parasitica, Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma complicata, Trichoderma viride and Trichoderma spp. [2]. These fungi have been isolated from the skin, mucous membranes and nails of patients with infections caused by Trichoderma species [3].

Current knowledge regarding the ecology and prevalence of Trichoderma species is based on morphological and phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, but this information is lacking in the literature. In addition, the diversity of Trichoderma species in different taxonomic groups is still poorly understood, especially regarding their ecology and pathogenicity, and consequently, there is an urgent need to study the diversity of these fungi in the literature.

The genus Trichoderma includes acanthosis, keratitis, mycosphaerella, phaeohyphomycetes, dimorphic and other fungi, which are cosmopolitan and found in different habitats [4].


## Methods
fumigatus strain (. fumigatus strain H99) was inoculated with 10^8 CFU/mL of strain H99. Ten microliters of conidial suspension was added to each well of 96-well plates containing sterile cellophane. The plates were incubated for 3 days. The MIC of the compounds was determined by measuring the growth of A. fumigatus in the presence of compound.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
The susceptibility of the tested compounds to the antifungal drugs was determined using the broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A3 [29]. Briefly, the test was performed in a 96-well plate. Compound concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 64 µg/mL were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of the tested organism. The test was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The lowest concentration that resulted in no growth of the test organism compared to the control was considered the “no drug” value. All wells containing the tested compounds were treated as two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The plates were then incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration with no growth of the tested organism compared to the control was considered the “no drug control” value. The experiment was repeated at least three times.

Molecular typing and identification
The yeast isolates of C. albicans (S-5 and S-2) and C. dubliniensis (C-3 and C-4) were identified by using the fungal strains SC5314 and SC5315 as the reference strains. The strains were maintained on YPD agar (2% peptone, 2% yeast extract, and 2% glucose) at room temperature. The fungi were transferred to C-medium or YPD medium and grown for 3-4 days at 37 °C. The fungal colonies were transferred to fresh C-medium or YPD medium and stored at -80 °C. The RNA was extracted from the fungal colonies by using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm.


## Results
However, the use of poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents has been reported to be problematic in the present study as a result of the high cost of the crude extract and the high time required for the preparation of poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents, which could have a negative effect on the efficacy of the antimicrobial compound.

In order to increase the efficacy of the poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents, the dose-response curves for the tested compounds were compared with those for the in vitro studies. As shown in Figure 1, the dose-response curve for poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents was similar for the in vitro study, with no significant differences between the two groups. The observed dose-response curve is similar to that reported by Vosukovskii et al. [6] for the in vitro study. For the in vivo study, the results showed a similar result, where the dose-response curves for poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents were similar for the in vitro study. This result suggested that the antifungal compounds in the present study were effective against Candida species in the in vivo study.

In vitro Studies of Antifungal Biotin Compounds against Candida albicans
The antifungal compounds in the present study could potentially improve the efficacy of poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents against Candida albicans. The results obtained from in vitro studies showed that the antifungal compounds in the present study are effective in vitro against Candida albicans. Therefore, the in vitro study is a useful tool for studying the efficacy of poly(I) deposition and potential antifungal agents.

The in vitro studies of antifungal compounds against Candida albicans were also reported in the literature. As the results obtained in the present study suggested that the antifungal compounds in the present study could be effective in vitro against Candida albicans.


## Discussion
However, the treatment of the fungus with bicarbonate of the M-CH_3-CH_3 bond was not effective, as fungal growth was inhibited in all treatments with the addition of miconazole, imipenem and chloramphenicol (Supplementary Table S3. This result was in accordance with previous findings [14], [35]. In addition, the pH of the copper-depleted medium increased in the presence of the antifungal drug miconazole. This result was also in accordance with the previous findings that the pH of the copper-depleted medium was found to be the most stable form (8.9-7.8) [15], [36], [37], which is in accordance with the previous findings that the pH of the medium was found to be the most stable form (7.2-7.4) [11], [12], [12], [37]. The results of the in vitro experiments indicated that the addition of miconazole, imipenem, and chloramphenicol reduced the fungal growth in the presence of copper-depleted medium.

The results of the in vitro experiments indicated that the addition of bicarbonate of the M-CH_3-CH_3 bond was effective against the fungal growth. However, the treatment with miconazole and chloramphenicol did not significantly reduce the fungal growth in the presence of copper-depleted medium (Table 3). This result was in accordance with the previous findings that the addition of bicarbonate of the M-CH_3-CH_3 bond was more effective against Candida albicans in the presence of copper-depleted medium [10].
