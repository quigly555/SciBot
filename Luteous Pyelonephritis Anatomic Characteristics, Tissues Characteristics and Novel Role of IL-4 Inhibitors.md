## Abstract
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are major virulence factors of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and may contribute to the development of IA patients with subacute onset. The interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-8 secretions have been well characterized in Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the role of IL-8 in the development of IA is not clear. In this study, we examined the effect of IL-8 on the T helper 2 (Th2) subsets during the development of IA in BALB/c mice.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased over the past decade, partly due to the advent of new immunosuppressive agents and the increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs act by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, thereby inhibiting the phagolysosome and causing cell death through the accumulation of toxic proteins in the phagolysosome. These toxic proteins are collectively referred to as fungal cell wall components. The composition of the cell wall of fungi is poorly understood, and the molecular mechanism of the structure of the cell wall has not been clearly established. In this review, we describe the chemical structure of the cell wall of Aspergillus and Candida, as well as the impact of the fungal wall on the physiology of the fungal cell. The cell wall is composed of three layers, each of which interacts with an array of proteins and mediates their signal transduction. The outer layer is the outer membrane and the inner layer is the inner membrane.

The KMDG is a non-profit, non-profit research group composed of clinical specialists from the medical and scientific departments of the University of South Carolina (UMSC) and the University of South Carolina Medical Center. This group was created in 2004 to support the TB strategy in South Carolina and provides expert assistance to local and national TB prevention and intervention teams. The KMDG has also been recognized by the South Carolina State University Inter-Ethics Review Board (SIRB) as a national resource for the management of patients with HIV/AIDS.

3.1. Human Tumor Tissue Culture
Human Tumor Tissue Culture (HTS) is a method-based method for the preparation of human tissue. Briefly, 2.5 ml of HTS is transferred to a tube containing 10 ml of sterile distilled water, and the tubes are shaken vigorously for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the samples are cooled to 0°C and were added into 1 ml of sterile water and then 1 ml of HBSS. The tubes were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 48 h. The number of CFU per milliliter of blood was counted. The results were expressed as the percentage of positive blood cultures from the HTS culture.

3.2. Cell Culture
For Tumor Tissue Culture (TPMC), 5 ml of HTS is added into a 50 ml microtube containing 10 ml of culture medium. Then, 1 ml of culture medium is aspirated and 2 ml of culture medium is added into the tubes. The tubes are shaken vigorously for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the culture medium is aspirated and the samples are centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min. The pellets are then washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.


## Results
The function of IL-4 in IL-13 production was investigated using a quantitative cytokine assa. IL-13 production was significantly increased in IL-13-producing mice, as assessed by the production of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 in the brain and spleen (Fig 2). In contrast, IL-13 production was not observed in the brains and spleen of IL-13-producing mice (Fig 2). IL-13 production was not associated with the baseline levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 production. The levels of IL-33 and IL-33F in the brain and spleen of IL-13-producing mice were comparable to those of control mice (Fig 2). IL-33 and IL-33F production was not associated with the baseline levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 production. IL-33F production was significantly decreased in the brains and spleen of IL-13-producing mice compared to controls (Fig 2). The cytokine profile of IL-33F production in the brains of IL-13-producing mice was similar to those of control mice (Fig 2). These results suggest that IL-13 is required for the activation of iNOS and TNF-a and for the production of IL-17.

IL-13 Is Required for the Expression of CD11b and CD86 in the CNS
In order to further investigate the possible role of IL-13 in the CNS, the CNS was used for stimulation by stimulation with IL-13. The CNS was used for the stimulation of the cells by stimulation with TGF-ß-ß peptide and for the production of IL-12p70. As shown in Fig 3, the CNS of IL-13-producing mice induced the cytokine profile and showed a normal CNS barrier. The cytokine profile and TNF-a, IL-33 and IL-33F production were not associated with the baseline levels of TNF-a, IL-33F and IL-33F production. The levels of TNF-a, IL-33 and IL-33F in the brain and spleen of IL-13-producing mice were comparable to those of control mice.


## Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-4 was an important cytokine in Tumor Tissue Development in mic. IL-4 was significantly elevated in the lungs of mice with Tumor Tissue Development; however, it did not correlate with Tumor Tissue Development. In addition, mice with Tumor Tissue Development had a significantly lower TNF-a release. In addition, TNF-a release was increased in lungs of mice with Tumor Tissue Development. These results are consistent with previous studies, which also demonstrated that TNF-a release was a major cytokine in lung tissue and promoted inflammation. It is also possible that TNF-a release is a significant cytokine in Tumor Tissue Development in mice. The TNF-a release is not the only cytokine that contributes to the Tumor Tissue Development. IL-4 is a significant cytokine in Tumor Tissue Development, including the lung tissue, both in vitro and in vivo. IL-4 has a strong inhibitory effect on TNF-a release in lung tissue in vitro and in vivo. In addition, IL-4 plays a key role in Tumor Tissue Development and Tumor Tissue Infection. It is possible that IL-4 release was decreased in the lungs of mice with Tumor Tissue Development. The reason why the IL-4 release is decreased in lungs of mice with Tumor Tissue Development is unclear. It is possible that the decrease in IL-4 release was caused by the exposure of Tumor Tissue Development to antimicrobial agents and the loss of TNF-a production by the Tumor Tissue Development. It is also possible that the increased IL-4 release in lungs of mice with Tumor Tissue Development was due to the presence of antimicrobial agents, as we previously reported in vitro.

The results of IL-4 release in Tumor Tissue Development suggest that IL-4 might play a key role in Tumor Tissue Infection. IL-4 is a crucial cytokine in Tumor Tissue Infection; IL-4 may play an important role in Tumor Tissue Infection.
