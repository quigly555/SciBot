## Abstract
We present a case of an HIV-seropositive individual with cryptococcal meningitis who presented with fever, headache, and diarrhea and was found to have an M2 mole removed after seven months of anti-fungal therapy. We provide evidence that this was a case of self-influenza and emphasize the importance of this case to emphasize the importance of this topic of investigation.


## Introduction
The presence of mononuclear and intracellular bacteria in the human gut is a common finding in hospitals and medical institutions throughout the world [1]. However, despite frequent use of antibiotics, the number of healthy individuals is still colonized by commensal microbes and individuals with severe symptoms die as a consequence of antibiotic-related infections [2]. In addition, the microbial community of the gut is known to be highly resistant to antibiotic treatment and is resistant to other pathogens including viruses and bacteria [3]. At present, the treatment of bacterial infections remains largely ineffective due to the high microbial diversity in the human gut and its resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, there is a need for the development of alternative and more cost-effective antimicrobial agents to combat the spread of bacterial infections.


## Methods
To estimate the relative activity of the two species, we used the . neoformans and V. tuberculosis strain reference strains (FGSC A3_016506 and A3_016506, respectively). For the Cryptococcus species complex, we also performed a comparison of the CFU numbers of the different strains. We used an eightfold dilution series of Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus neoformans in a 96-well plate. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 72 h, and the CFU count was calculated using the delta-delta fluorescence method. We compared the activities of the two species, V. tuberculosis and C. neoformans by comparing the relative activity of the two species using a Mantel-Cox plot.

PCR and quantitative RT-PCR
The total RNA was extracted from fungal mycelium grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and extracted from the mycelium grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 37°C. The RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNase-free) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The primers and probe sets for the qRT-PCR reaction are listed in Table 1.

Construction of Cryptococcus neoformans-GFP fusion proteins and growth conditions
The vector pJET1.1 was used as a template for constructing the C. neoformans-GFP fusion proteins with the following changes. The pET-GFP fusion proteins were amplified using primers pJET1.1-GFP and pET-GFP-GFP. The PCR product was cloned into the pET-GFP vector to generate pET-GFP-GFP. The pET-GFP-GFP-GFP fusion was transformed into protoplasts of C. neoformans and V. tuberculosis strains by incubation at 30°C for 72 h.


## Results
All mice were neutropenic, and cryptococcal infection was monitored at 1 week post-infection with a single dose of 200 µg/kg of macrophage. The antibody titers against Cryptococcus neoformans were quantified, and the numbers of cells were quantified using a flow cytometer. The titers of C. neoformans were 2-fold higher (2.2 × 10^-1, p < 0.001) in the brains of mice infected with myXBP than in those infected with GFP. The C. neoformans titers were 2.2 × 10^-1, p < 0.001, and 2.5 × 10^-1, p < 0.05, respectively, in the brains of mice infected with myXBP compared with those infected with GFP (Fig 1A and 1B). The brain titers of C. neoformans were 1.3 × 10^-1, p < 0.001, and 1.2 × 10^-1, p < 0.05, respectively, in the brains of mice infected with myXBP compared with those infected with GFP (Fig 1C). In contrast, the brain titers of GFP were significantly lower than those of the antibody titers (1.2 × 10^-1, p < 0.05) and 1.9 × 10^-1, p < 0.05 in the brains of mice infected with myXBP compared with those infected with GFP (Fig 1D). These data indicate that the MyXBP-GFP coactivates affect cryptococcal brain development in an immunocompromised manner.

MyXBP acts in a vacuolar-inoculated manner
In an in vivo model of cryptococcal brain infection, cryptococcal cells are able to escape from the host by vacuole fusion, leaving the vacuolar macrophage compartment to infect the host. In order to analyze the impact of myXBP on vacuolar function of cryptococcal cells in the brain, we performed vacuolar membrane permeabilization assays in mouse brains. Our data revealed that MyXBP significantly reduced the vacuole permeabilization of the brain (Fig 2A).


## Discussion
The European Network for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (ENATS) is a semi-quantitative testing system for assessing the safety of antibiotics in a population [23]. In the current study, we found that the highest levels of resistance to bacteremia caused by bacteremia were seen in North-European countries. Bacteremia caused by bacteremia has been reported in Italy, Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands [24], although further research is needed to understand the prevalence and epidemiology of bacteremia in these countries.

In the current study, the prevalence of bacteremia in the European population was higher in Bacteremia meningitis, than in the overall population. While the prevalence of bacteremia in this population was close to that found in other countries, the majority of bacteremia was in sub-Saharan Africa. Bacteremia was detected in 35% of the African patients, and in only 2% of the European patients. This finding is similar to other studies in Africa [25, 26], and may reflect the increasing prevalence of bacteremia in the continent. However, the incidence of bacteremia in African patients is higher than in other populations [26], and it is possible that bacteremia is more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.

The prevalence of bacteremia was highest in the United States, which has the highest prevalence of bacteremia. There were also other differences in the prevalence of bacteremia between regions, such as the prevalence of bacteremia in the United States and the prevalence of bacteremia in Europe. The prevalence of bacteremia in the United States was 3.3%, which was lower than that in other regions.
