## Abstract
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been associated with asthma, allergy, and many cancers. IL-17 is produced primarily by the immune system of mice following starvation from the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-17P. The protective effect of IL-17 on these two immune responses is supported by the fact that IL-1ß and IL-17P are produced mainly in the lungs and spleen of IL-1ß-deficient mice, while IL-17P is produced mainly in the connective tissues of neutrophils and B- cells of dendritic cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in protection against an experimental mycotic infection in BALB/c mice by examining the effect of IL-1ß and IL-17P on the expression of target genes. The induction of the protective immune response to pulmonary tuberculosis in BALB/c mice was suppressed by treatment with either IL-1ß or IL-17P alone. The induction of the Th1-type cytokine Th17 cells was down-regulated in the inflamed lungs and spleen of IL-1ß-deficient mice compared to the inflamed and inflamed-inferiorized BALB/c mice, while the expression of the Th2-type cytokine Th17 cells was up-regulated in the inflamed lungs and spleen of IL-1ß-deficient mice compared to the inflamed and inflamed-inferiorized BALB/c mice. Thus, IL-1ß and IL-17 protect BALB/c mice from pulmonary tuberculosis by inducing protective Th2 cells.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are of increasing concern due to the potential of these opportunistic pathogens to infect various organs of humans and animals [1,2]. However, in recent years, the number of human infections has increased considerably, especially with the increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals. According to the World Health Organization, between 2001 and 2010, approximately 350,000 people have been estimated to have been infected with fungal diseases in the United States alone [3]. Currently, nearly 1.5 million cases are reported each year, with approximately 625,000 deaths and 60,000 deaths due to fungal disease [1]. The incidence of fungal infections is still underestimated, as some species of Candida and Aspergillus are not identified until after a fungal infection is suspected. In addition, Candida spp. is the most common fungal pathogen in patients with bloodstream infections, and these infections can be asymptomatic, subclinical or disseminated [4,5]. C. albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans and is found in the respiratory, urinary, skin, and skin lesions [6]. This species is able to proliferate in the human body, and in this state, it may cause life-threatening disseminated candidiasis [6,7]. The rapid development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a consequence of the constant application of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the lack of effective treatment strategies results in the development of invasive fungal infections [8]. In order to prevent the spread of the infection, the host immune system must recognize and treat fungi as commensals and pathogens. The induction of antibodies is a key phase of the immunization strategy in order to control the infection. Many antifungal agents are active against Candida species, but their activities are restricted by the virulence of the species [9]. The discovery of diclofenac sodium (DES) antifungal agent [10] and cephalosporin (CP) inhibitors [11] has led to the development of antifungal drugs and their use in the treatment of several conditions, including those caused by the pathogenic fungi. Among these agents, CP inhibitors have the most potent antifungal activity against Candida species, and the use of CP inhibitors is preferred over the use of CP inhibitors.

A detailed description of the assay can be found in Additional file .

C. albicans Lactophenol Assay
In this assay, C. albicans Lactophenol (Sigma) was tested using the G. mellonella infection model as the indicator organism [27]. Briefly, a. Lactophenol was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A stock solution of 1 mg/ml was then added to each well of a 96-well plate and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The test organism was selected based on the appearance of yeast growth and the presence of a clear growth margin on the plate. The cell count was performed by using a hemocytometer and the optical density was read at 600 nm.

Infections With C. albicans Lactophenol and C. krusei
Infections were performed as described previously [28]. Briefly, C. albicans Lactophenol, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis Lactophenol strains were inoculated into SDA medium (20% w/v yeast nitrogen base, 2% w/v glucose, pH 4.0) and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The inoculated cells were centrifuged and washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The pellet was then resuspended in sterile PBS and plated on SDA. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, the number of CFU per gram of tissue was counted. The SDA susceptibility assay was performed as previously described [29]. Briefly, the test organisms were inoculated in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), which was supplemented with 0.5% Bacto peptone and 0.2% tryptone. The media was then centrifuged and washed twice with PBS. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in a shaking incubator. The lowest concentration of Bacto that inhibited growth was determined by a colorimetric assay as previously described [28].


## Results
For each strain, the MIC_50 of the recombinant fungus was determined in the absence of IL-1ß and IL-10. For all strains, the MIC_50 values were determined at the level of the MIC_50. Table 1 shows the MIC_50 values for IL-1ß and IL-10.

For the strains with 1 µg/ml IL-1ß, the MIC_50 value was 16.6 µg/ml and 16 µg/ml, respectively. For the strains with 0.5 µg/ml IL-10, the MIC_50 value was 3.7 µg/ml and 3 µg/ml, respectively. For the strains with 1 µg/ml IL-1ß, the MIC_50 value was 4.6 µg/ml and 4 µg/ml, respectively. Table 2 shows the MIC_50 values of the strains with or without IL-1ß.


## Discussion
In contrast, another study from an immunology unit in a tertiary hospital in Sri Lanka found only .2% of fungi causing disease in immunocompromised patients [33]. In our study, we identified 8.4% of fungi causing disease in immunocompetent patients. The proportion of fungi causing disease in immunocompromised patients was consistent with other studies from other parts of the world [34, 35]. However, it was also consistent with other studies from different regions of Sri Lanka [35, 36], where the proportion of fungi causing disease was high in immunocompromised patients (14.4%) and high in immunocompetent patients (17.4%) [33]. The proportion of fungi causing disease in immunocompetent patients in Sri Lanka was similar to that in countries such as Vietnam and Iran [37].

Of the 8.4% of fungi causing disease in immunocompromised patients, 8.6% of the isolates were also pathogenic in immunocompetent patients, which is similar to other studies in other parts of the world [33]. The proportion of isolates causing disease in immunocompromised patients was similar to that in immunocompetent patients, with the exception of P. digitatum (13.4%) [38]. P. digitatum has been shown to cause disease in immunocompetent patients in Sri Lanka [38]. This isolate was found to be pathogenic in a study in South India [39]. This may be due to the fact that P. digitatum is a relatively resistant species, which is considered as a better pathogen for humans. The majority of the isolates from P. digitatum were resistant to all antifungal agents tested [40]. P. digitatum was first identified as a human pathogen in India [40]. We found that the rate of P. digitatum infection in Sri Lanka was similar to that in Sri Lanka without immunosuppression [33]. This indicates that P. digitatum is more susceptible to antifungal therapy in Sri Lanka. P. digitatum has been reported as a rare species in South India and India [40]. A P. digitatum isolate was found to be pathogenic in India [40]. P. digitatum was first described in India in 1999 and was then reported as a rare species in India [40].
