## Abstract
The nephrotrophic and hematopoietic plant-associated fungi are symbiotic and each has advantages that they have few environmental risks, and that they can be trained to respond to small specific stressors. They have also been suggested as potential biotrophic hosts for a wide variety of fungi, with the possibility of their co-opting plant-related stresses. This is, however, scientifically unlikely. The nephrotrophic fungi are mainly associated with bark beetles, and the beetle stress-response mechanisms appear to be very similar to those of the hematopoietic fungi. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that nephrotrophic fungi are capable of co-opting plant-related stresses. We also tested the hypothesis that the expression of plant-stress-response genes was induced in the nephrotrophic fungi. While we found no evidence of direct interaction between nephrotrophic fungi and beetle-stress-response genes, we found evidence of direct interaction between nephrotrophic fungi and a rhizobial stress. In addition, we found evidence for direct interaction between nephrotrophic fungi and a plant-stress-response gene, suggesting that the beetle-stress-response mechanism is a hot topic topic.


## Introduction
With the fast growth of population of immunocompromised patients, the incidence of fungal infections has risen steadily. Currently, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are classified as those caused by fungi or other microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites (1, 2). The classification of these fungi is complicated and many pathogenic organisms can only be recognized by the clinician as causing serious or life-threatening diseases (3). The term “Candida albicans” is used to designate yeast or pseudozoans which cause life-threatening infections in patients (4). This yeast can be divided into two broad categories, microflora and true hyphae, which are responsible for the most significant numbers of invasive candidiasis (5). The term “true hyphae” is used to designate hyphae that can only be recognized by a clinical microbiology laboratory (6).

Candida spp. are the most common species found in blood cultures and are classified as either C. albicans or C. parapsilosis according to various criteria including their ability to grow as hyphae, yeast cells, or biofilms (7, 8). The clinical presentation depends on the species involved.


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) with the E-value cut-off value of 1e-5. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining method and the Kimura-2 method [30].

Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation
Genomic DNA of the Asteraceae family of plants was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed with the following thermal cycling conditions: 4 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, 10 min at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C, and then 1 min at 72 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified PCR products were sequenced by sequencing the 27S rDNA with an ABI Prism 3730XL Genetic Analyzer (GE Healthcare). Sequences were deposited in GenBank (GenBank accession no. KY6515).

Molecular phylogenetic analysis
DNA from the fungal mycelium of P. expansum and P. krusei was sequenced using the same primers as for the DNA extractions and then used for the PCR reactions to obtain the obtained sequences. The sequence data were subjected to BLASTn search using the fungal ITS region and the resulting sequences were subjected to Blast2GO [31] for the analysis of homologous sequences in P. expansum. The sequences obtained were subjected to manual curation and sequence alignments by Clustal X [32]. The sequences were aligned with MAFFT [33] using default parameters. The best-fit substitution model for each of the four species was selected based on the alignments and phylogenetic relationships. The best-fit evolutionary model for P. expansum was selected for the analysis by maximum likelihood (ML) method. All the phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method of the program SSP.


## Results
2004) with a single host genus, Asteromell. The species was recently introduced to the Asteraceae by Ehrhardt et al. (2015) and the new taxon is named Asteromella s. str. in the Asteraceae (Berkley et al. 2004). Asteromella s. str. is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the South Pacific and North American continents (P. Melin et al. 2004), but is more commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions of the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

The Asteraceae have a wide range of physico-chemical properties (Berkley et al. 2004; Lebel et al. 2007; Schubert et al. 2009). The most common physico-chemical properties are associated with nitrogen and phosphorus, and are well-characterised in the literature (Berkley et al. 2004; Schubert et al. 2009). The type material of P. s. s. (P. L.) L. Schubert (Berkley et al. 2004) contains several iron-tolerant species and has been reported to have the ability to assimilate phosphorus (P. L.) and sorbic acid (P. L.) in culture (Berkley et al. 2004).

The present study based on the well-characterised taxa described in the present study and our previous study, showed that P. s. s. had more diverse physico-chemical properties than other families of Asteraceae. The only exception is P. l. (P. L.) L. Schubert (Berkley et al. 2004), which is reported to have only one species of Sordariomyces (Berkley et al. 2004). The presence of P. s. s. was not studied in detail, but the present study was able to provide evidence that P. s. s. was widespread in the Solanaceae. The six families of Asteraceae were clearly separated in the literature, but the presence of the previously reported species of Solanaceae in the present study does not exclude the possibility that the P. s. s. s. s. s. s. was present in the Solanaceae.

The most common physico-chemical properties observed in P. s.


## Discussion

The full distribution of the Asteraceae family is indicated in Table 2, where it is the smallest family with the most well-defined taxonomic distribution and a higher diversity than the families in the orders Asteraceae, Gemmataceae, Thelomataceae, and Diaporthale. The Asteraceae family in general contains almost all the Asteraceae species except the two families Asteraceaea and Asteraceaeb, in which the majority is Asteraceaea and Asteraceaeb. This family is not only rich in polyphyletic Asteraceae, but also a rich family in the Asteraceae family. The Asteraceae family comprises the most well-defined Asteraceae species, and it is enriched in their expression, and in their ability to germinate, as indicated by the significant increase in the number of different Asteraceae species in the present study. The Asteraceae family in general is represented by members of the Asteraceae family, but it also comprises families of Asteraceae that are distributed geographically, e.g., the Asteraceaea, Asteraceaeb, Asteraceaec, Asteraceaed, and Asteraceaee, whose members are most abundant in the Asteraceae family. The Asteraceae family includes Asteraceaea and Asteraceaeb, and the Asteraceae family is enriched in their expression and activity, as indicated by the significant increase in the number of different Asteraceae species in the present study. The Asteraceae family is represented by the Asteraceaea, Asteraceaeb, Asteraceaec, Asteraceaed, and Asteraceaee, whose members are most abundant in the Asteraceae family.
