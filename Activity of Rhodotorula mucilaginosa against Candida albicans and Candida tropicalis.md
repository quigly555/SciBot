## Abstract
It has long been known that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients with malignant lymphoma is a common outcome of aggressive malignancy. However, the involvement of a tumor in a normal immune system in malignant lymphoma has been rarely reported.

We reported an otherwise healthy young man with primary myelofibrosis (PMN) and nonspecific myeloid leukemia treated with cytologic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical methods. He had only a few weeks before admission, when he presented with a sudden onset of chest pain, and fever. He had suffered from malignant lymphadenopathy for the first time two decades ago. Autopsy disclosed a malignant lymph node in his lung and a splenomegaly in the spleens. The lymph node cultures, histopathological findings, and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a leukemia with a splenomegaly.

The diagnosis of PMN was established with autopsy results, which also disclosed the histological findings, with the involvement of a tumor. However, our case presented no clear guidelines for the diagnosis of PMN in a normal immune system. Therefore, we made the diagnosis of PMN based on the clinical and histological findings alone alone and in conjunction with a cytologic, histological, and immunohistochemical test. Although the results of cytology, histopathology, and immunohistochemical were encouraging, the cytology results of PMN in our patient did not support the diagnosis of PMN in a normal immune system.

Although the diagnosis of PMN is relatively new, the diagnosis of PMN in our patient made more sense than the diagnosis of PMN in our patient alone.


## Introduction
Marine organisms are important sources of living with a rich range of potential drugs for biomedical, therapeutic and life-threatening applications [1]. Marine organisms are among the most abundant sources of biologically active molecules with an overall turnover of over two billion marine organisms [2]. The development of marine biomedications has been mainly based on their specific physicochemical properties, e.g., bioavailability, and pharmacological properties [3,4]. Marine organisms are also of great medical interest due to their excellent medical and economic value [5,6]. The use of drugs from the marine environment as bio-presence is increasing [7]. Many drugs are produced from the marine environment, however, few of them have been commercialized [8]. There are no studies to the commercialization of drugs from the marine environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability and uptake of the marine drugs from six pharmaceutical plants: Coriandrum, Coriandrum ex Lavalle, Coriandrum sp., Diptera, and Laboulbenia.


## Methods
Briefly, the test was performed with an inoculum of yeasts of . albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. lusitaniae, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, and C. dubliniensis isolated from powdered cornmeal agar (CMA) (1% w/v). Yeasts were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (0.4% w/v) at 37°C for 7 days, and the color of the agar was measured using a color microplate reader (Multiskan Go! Deltavision, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The test was performed in duplicate in triplicate.

Determination of D-(+)-D-glucopyranosyl-4-methylumbelliferone (GDP)
The assay of D-(+)-D-glucopyranosyl-4-methylumbelliferone (GDP) was performed as described [32]. Briefly, a stock solution (10 mg/ml) of D-(+)-D-glucopyranosyl-4-methylumbelliferone (GDP) was dissolved in 1 ml of 1 M potassium phosphate. A 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution (20 mg/ml in 1 M sodium phosphate) was added to the solution. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 540 nm. The assay was performed in triplicate.

Detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
The assay of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activity of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. lusitaniae, C. albicans, and C. dubliniensis was performed as described [33]. Briefly, 5 µg/ml of C. albicans and C. glabrata were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 2 h and the absorbance of the sample was measured at 490 nm. The assay was performed in triplicate.


## Results
albicans [34. A systemic infection of the patient was found to be the most effective in the treatment of Candida infection in both the oropharynx and the oral cavity (Figure 4A). The bacterial load of the patient was found to be significantly decreased compared with the control group (Table 1). There were no differences in the incidence of candidemia among the tested strains of Candida, but the incidence of candidemia was lower in the oropharynx group (Table 1).

Anti-Candida activity
Candida albicans was also tested against a panel of Candida strains, including C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. kefyr, C. krusei, and C. krusei. The MIC values for Candida were 64 µg/ml for C. albicans, 1 µg/ml for C. glabrata, 2 µg/ml for C. kefyr, and 0.5 µg/ml for C. krusei, with the MIC_50 values ranging from 0.125 µg/ml to 0.5 µg/ml (Table 2). The MIC_50 values for Candida were 0.125 µg/ml for C. glabrata, 0.5 µg/ml for C. krusei, 0.125 µg/ml for C. kefyr, and 0.5 µg/ml for C. krusei.

Anti-Candida activity
The anti-Candida activity of FK506 (2 µg/ml) was found to be weak compared to that of its azole (2 µg/ml) and it is suggested that FK506 inhibits Candida albicans from entering the human oral cavity. The MIC_50 values were found to be 0.125 µg/ml for FK506, 0.5 µg/ml for FKG_00480, and 0.125 µg/ml for FKG_00750. In addition, FK506 inhibited C. albicans from entering the human oral cavity by two-fold (MIC = 0.


## Discussion
However, a deeper investigation is needed to determine whether this protective effect is due to . solani or the host-pathogen interaction.

S. solani is a dermatophyte that has been used in clinical settings for clinical treatment of skin and nail infections. This fungus is a ubiquitous and widespread pathogen in the human skin and in the environment [26]. It is commonly found in the environment, although it can also be found in water, soil, and plants [27]. The human pathogen is also a major pathogen of the skin and nail (skin) and can also cause infections in humans [28]. The human pathogen can be found in the environment, particularly in the environment [29]. S. solani is also found in the soil [30], although it is also found in water [31]. In the present study, the clinical isolates of S. solani were obtained from both culture-positive and culture-negative skin infections. The clinical isolates were cultured on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and were susceptible to NSAIDs, but they were susceptible to fluconazole and itraconazole [32].

It has been reported that S. solani species may cause disease in humans, although this is not confirmed in the present study. S. solani has been shown to be a cause of skin and cutaneous infection in humans [33]. In this study, the pathogenicity of S. solani to C. albicans was evaluated in the murine model of systemic candidiasis. A high number of C. albicans isolates (97.7%) were resistant to all NSAIDs and had good growth in liquid media. These results are in agreement with the findings of other studies [34], [35]. In addition, the strains of C. albicans were resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, which is considered to be the most potent drugs against C. albicans [34], [35].

In this study, C. albicans was found to be an opportunistic pathogen in humans. In the current study, the strains of C. albicans were obtained from patients with C. albicans skin infections. The infection severity of the patients was significantly higher than those of the patients with skin and nail infections.
