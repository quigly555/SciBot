## Abstract
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral load (VL) correlate with CSF white cell count, fiber-optic flow cytometry, and viral load. We examined the relationship between these variables and CSF white cell count, and tested it across multiple logistic regression models to address the possibility that it might be related to CSF white cell count.

We did a single logistic regression model with multiple logistic regression models to account for multiple confounders: CSF white cell count, fiber-optic cytometry, and viral load. Predictors of CSF white cell count, predict white cell tropism, and of CSF viral load were tested across multiple logistic regression models.


## Introduction
 2015; Hu et a., 2015), and recently the immune system of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Chao et al., 2015; Bozzi et al., 2016). However, the main mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity, such as virulence, remain unknown.

Microorganisms are among the first cells to encounter the host immune system. The cell is equipped with a sophisticated array of innate and adaptive immune system components including immune receptors and immune effector molecules that are able to recognize and direct the fungus. For example, the antiphagocytic and effector molecules T-bet and the mucin C-mannan, are able to trigger a cascade of immune responses against the fungus (Brantley et al., 2001; Stelkens et al., 2006). In the host, T-bet, a phorbol 12 a-amino acid proteolytic protein, is a key effector molecule responsible for the formation of the cell membrane and cellular barriers that restrict the invading pathogen from the host immune system. Mannan is a diverse group of carbohydrate-based proteins that are found in the cell wall, including mannan, pigments and other polymers. In yeasts, mannan is a major factor for pathogenicity and virulence, and in Cryptococcus neoformans the mannan layer is also involved in the host response (Chao et al., 2015; Bozzi et al., 2016). In a recent study, the antigenic composition of mannan particles was analyzed using in vitro and in vivo studies, including the antigenic composition of chitosan, an N-acetylgalactosamine protein and mannans, the importance of glycoproteins on the process of antigen presentation, and the response of mice to mannan challenge. The results revealed that the response of mice to challenge with Cryptococcus neoformans with mannan is associated with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mannoprotein (Manch, serotype D, n=3) and the mannan surface protein (Manch, serotype A, n=2). Manch is a key component of the antiphagocytic process and results in an antibody response to the capsule (O’Brien et al., 1994). Manch can recognize both N- and O-mannans, which are able to be exposed to each other.


## Methods
The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes, washed with sterile phosphate buffer, and resuspended in sterile PB. The fungal mycelia were gently washed twice with PBS and cell density adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml. The cell suspension was transferred into 24-well plates (Nunc, Switzerland) containing 10 ml of RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS. The number of CFU was determined by plating onto a microtitre plate with 20 µg/ml of purified Streptomyces variotii. The plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO_2 for 24 hours. Then, the fungal mycelia were washed twice with sterile PBS and the cells were then resuspended in PBS. The number of CFU was determined by plating onto a microtitre plate with 20 µg/ml of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO_2 for 48 hours. Then, the fungal mycelia were washed twice with sterile PBS and cell density adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml. The cell suspension was transferred into 96-well plates (Nunc, Switzerland) containing 5 ml of RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS. The number of CFU was determined by plating on a microtitre plate with 10 µg/ml of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO_2 for 24 hours. Then, the fungal mycelia were washed twice with sterile PBS and the cells were then resuspended in PBS. The number of CFU was determined by plating onto a microtitre plate with 10 µg/ml of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO_2 for 24 hours. The fungal mycelia were washed twice with sterile PBS and the number of CFU was determined by plating onto a microtitre plate with 10 µg/ml of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.


## Results
dendrobatidi. Three major pathways were investigated in the pathogen-host interaction pathway: (i) virulence factors (e.g., virulence factors such as the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism pathways, pathways involved in plant and animal pathogenicity, and the immune system) and (ii) interaction with host cells (e.g., phagocytic phagocytic cells).

We found that the virulence factors were the most dominant pathway in the virulence pathway of B. dendrobatidis.


## Discussion
The fungal cell wall was composed of mannoproteins and polysaccharides (Fig 7B. The cell wall was composed of ß-1,4-linked mannoproteins, including mannoproteins related to P450 glycosylation (Fig 7C), and the glycosylation products of glycosylation-associated proteins (Fig 7D). The cell wall was composed of mannoproteins related to P450 glycosylation (Fig 7D). The cell wall was composed of mannoproteins related to P450 mannose, including the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7E), and the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7F). The cell wall was composed of mannoproteins related to P450 mannose, including the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7G), and the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7I). The cell wall was composed of mannoproteins related to P450 mannose, including the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7J) and the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7K). The cell wall was composed of mannoproteins related to P450 mannose, including the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7L), and the mannoprotein mannose-6-phosphate (P6-phosphoryltransferase) (Fig 7M).
