## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Aspergillus (AI) and other fungal infections among patients with systemic mycoses in the Puducherry University Hospital (PURCH), Himachal Pradesh, during the Indian general and Indian out passenger air travel period.

This study was a retrospective medical record review of Aspergillus patients and to their knowledge none was present in our country.

In India, almost half of all Aspergillus isolates were isolated from patients that were not immunocompromised, such as patients with tuberculosis or patients that were immunocompetent. The majority of Aspergillus infections were seen in immunocompromised patients, of which 58.4% were seen in immunocompetent patients. The majority of Aspergillus species were isolated from Candida spp., Trichosporon spp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and non-albicans species. The prevalence of other Aspergillus species was significantly higher (53.5%) than the previous record in 2010 (23.9%) and 2012 (30.2%).

AI cases were reported from 50/165 patients (29.3%). The prevalence of other Aspergillus species was higher (31.5%) than the previous record (23.5%). The prevalence of different Aspergillus spp. was higher in the study site (25.2%) than in the area studied (19.6%).

In this study, the prevalence of Aspergillus spp. was higher in areas than the area studied (p < 0.


## Introduction
The genus Trichosporon was proposed by Wollenweber (1941), based on T. slimesi (Taraxacum, Piptarthrum, Eucalyptus) that was found in Quercus and in Populus (Wollenweber, 1941). In his revision of this fungus, Wollenweber (1941) included nine species, including T. slimesi, T.


## Methods
For testing of L-cycloserine/L-tyrosine, they were diluted to the final concentration of 50 µM, then 100 µM was adde. The experiments were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Switzerland) and a range of concentrations was used in the experiment. Plates were incubated at 37°C. The samples were prepared as follows: 1 × 10^5 cfu/ml in DMSO was added to each well. A total of 1 × 10^6 cfu/ml in DMSO was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The fungal colonies were counted after incubation and the results were expressed as mean of the mean of the results of three replicates. The statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. The P value was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

4.6. Screening of Glucose-Plus Compound
The gluconazole-resistant C. albicans isolate was selected from the study. The C. albicans strain was routinely cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 35°C for 4 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000×g for 15 min, washed in sterile PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cfu/ml. This preparation was applied to 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner) and the plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. The samples were prepared as follows: 1 × 10^6 cfu/ml in DMSO was added to each well. A total of 1 × 10^6 cfu/ml in DMSO was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The yeasts were counted after incubation and the results were expressed as mean of the mean of three replicates. The statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. The P value was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

## Results
In the case of HIV-infected patients, the efficacy of gluconazole has been tested in the models of disseminated and disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MS) and itraconazole-associated IRIS (IRIS-1) [8,19. Our recent study in which an HIV-positive patient was treated with gluconazole and is now a healthy adult with no signs of HIV infection was the first to demonstrate that gluconazole has fungicidal properties against a clinical isolate of human mycobacteria (MR-14) [25]. Since the IRIS-1 IRIS-1 strain is also a fungal pathogens, the results obtained in our study are consistent with the results obtained in the current studies. The most common is MR-14, which has a resistant phenotype with a small, stable, and stable mycobacterial colony phenotype [26]. MR-14 is also highly resistant to FK506, an inhibitor of proinflammatory genes, as well as azole antifungal agents (piperidin A) [27]. The susceptibility of MR-14 to gluconazole was examined in the model of mycobacterial keratitis. The mycobacterium keratitis model is a chronic keratitis in which the mycobacterium is grown as a tissue culture [28]. Although the mycobacterium is still emerging from the keratitis model, the keratitis model has been successfully applied to other fungal infections [29]. As observed in the keratitis model, the susceptibility of MR-14 to gluconazole was significantly increased in the isotype of strain MR-14, while the susceptibility to FK506 was not. In contrast, the susceptibility of MR-14 to FK506 was decreased in the isotype of strain MR-14, while the susceptibility to PIP was increased in the isotype of strain MR-14. The results of the patient-experiment data are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The results of the patient-experiment data are summarized in Table 3. The results of the test of the patient-experiment data are summarized in Table 4.


## Discussion
The treatment of HIV and other intracellular pathogens is usually initiated with an immunosuppressive regimen, followed by a chronic phase of immunotherapy, with prolonged antiretroviral therapy (ART) [29. In this study, we revealed that the dose-escalation of HIV infection increases the susceptibility of CD4^+ T cell depletion in infected mice and prolongs the antiretroviral therapy for AIDS patients. This finding is consistent with the results of several studies in other species of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [30, 31]. Our results demonstrated that HIV infection enhances the CD4^+ T cell depletion of infected mice, which further accelerates the antiretroviral therapy for AIDS patients. This is in agreement with the results of a previous study in HIV-positive patients, which showed that HIV infection enhances CD4^+ T cell depletion by activating CD4^+ T cell proliferation and promoting the CD4^+ T cell response [32].

In our study, the therapeutic regimen of nelfinavir, which is used to treat HIV infection, had a significant effect on the susceptibility of CD4^+ T cells to HIV infection. This finding is similar to that of previous studies in other species of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [33]. However, the mechanism of this drug-mediated immunity has not been fully elucidated. HIV infection enhances the CD4^+ T cell depletion of infected CD4^+ T cells and enhances the HIV replication in human macrophages [34]. We also showed that HIV infection increases the CD4^+ T cell depletion of infected CD4^+ T cells and promotes the CD4^+ T cell response.

In our study, we discovered that the treatment of AIDS patients with HIV infection significantly increases the susceptibility of CD4^+ T cells to HIV infection. These results are similar to the results of a study in HIV-positive patients, where HIV infection increased the CD4^+ T cell depletion of infected macrophages, which further enhances the HIV replication in macrophages [35]. The drug-induced immunosuppression (PIs) is a significant factor in the induction of HIV replication and infection [36].
