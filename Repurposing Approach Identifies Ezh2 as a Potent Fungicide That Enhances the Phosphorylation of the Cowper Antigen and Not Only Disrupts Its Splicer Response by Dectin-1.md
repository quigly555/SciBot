## Abstract
A mechanistic relationship between the extent of T-cell infiltrates and the molecular damage to target tissues is fundamental for all forms of cell biology. T-cell dysfunction is strongly induced during the progression of a disease and is strongly impacted by various disease-associated phenotypes, such as neurodegenerative disease, immunopathology, and disease outcomes. The immunological significance of T-cell dysfunction in a disease context is fundamental to understand the pathophysiology of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis. We recently discovered that T-cell dysfunction is not only common in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but is also found in tumor cells, astrocytes, and B cells. In addition, CCR2-deficient T cells are non-specifically sensitive to the effects of T-cell dysfunction, particularly in non-tumor related conditions such as cancer. Thus, we have discovered that the extent of T-cell dysfunction is critical for the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. This work has implications for the use of T-cell function therapeutically in multiple sclerosis patients, as well as the future of T-cell therapy in relapsing multiple sclerosis.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection that occurs primarily in immunocompromised hosts. It is caused by two main species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, which are encapsulated yeast species that can cause infection in otherwise healthy individuals, but can also cause disease in immunocompromised hosts.


## Methods
albicans virus (EV) was previously described by Zhang et a. [11] and the method to identify the phosphorylation of the C. albicans virus by phosphorylation of the C. glabrata viral genome (VGI) was also described by Yang et al. [18].

The identification of Pox2 was performed using the three-dimensional structure of the viral genome and the information of the virus was subsequently extracted from the corresponding gene. The Pox2 protein was then identified by the method of Pierce and Dalmour [19] using a PECyPlanETRAx system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States).

The presence of the splice junction between the viral and the fungal segments was determined by the protein X-ray structure, as described by Yang et al. [18].

Nucleotide Sequence
The nucleotide sequence of the pox2-cytovirus was obtained from the Nucleotide Sequence Database of Japan (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Identification of the Structure of Pox2
The structure of pox2 was identified by the method of Dorn et al. [20]. The nucleotide sequence of the pox2-cytovirus was obtained from the Nucleotide Sequence Database of Japan (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

The nucleotide sequence of the pox2-virus was obtained from the Structure of Pox2 database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/icb/) and was also included in the analysis.

The analysis of the pox2-cytovirus was performed using the MALDI-TOF/TOF method.

## Results
coli and . coli E. coli (E)-FLAG on Ezh2 activity. E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG were incubated with Ezh2-FLAG-GFP to assess the effect of E. coli E-FLAG on the activity of Ezh2. Using the fluorescence intensity of E-FLAG for Ezh2 activity, we first observed the activity of Ezh2-FLAG-GFP on Ezh2-GFP-EFP fluorescence. We then used a flow cytometry assay to measure the activity of Ezh2-FLAG-GFP in the background of Ezh2-FLAG. The results showed that E-FLAG significantly enhanced Ezh2 activity in the background of E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG (Fig 5A and 5B, respectively).

E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG are both effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe
Having established that E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG are both effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe, we next sought to test whether E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG are also effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe. We first isolated E. coli and E-FLAG from the solid medium and incubated them with S. pombe Ezh2-FLAG-GFP, Ezh2-FLAG-GFP-EFP, Ezh2-FLAG-GFP-EFP, and Ezh2-FLAG-EFP-Dectin-1, to investigate whether E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG were also effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe. However, the results did not show that E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG were also effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe (Fig 6A and 6B). Next, we examined whether E. coli and E. coli E-FLAG were also effective inducers of Ezh2 in S. pombe. We first isolated E. coli and E-FLAG from the solid medium and incubated them with S.


## Discussion

The combined effect of Dectin-1 and Ste12 in the phosphorylation of the endogenous target Dectin-1 and Ste12 in Fusarium led us to conclude that this strategy may provide a new strategy to control the nematode infectio. To test this hypothesis, we have applied Dectin-1 as a selective agent, using a modified drug-tolerance strategy. Using standard drug concentrations (Clindar, Inhibitory Concentrations (IC_50)) and standard concentrations of Dectin-1 (MICs = 1000 mg/kg for 0.2 µM Dectin-1 and 1 µM Dectin-2) for 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h, respectively, we found that 5 µM Dectin-1 (and 0.3 µM Dectin-2) elicited the same inhibitory response as 5 µM Dectin-1 alone (Fig 4). To further evaluate the potential application of Dectin-1 as a drug target, we have also developed a pharmacologic interaction between Dectin-1 and Ste12 (Fig 5). We showed that the combination of Dectin-1 and Ste12 (Fig 4) stimulates the activation of Dectin-1 and Ste12 (Fig 5) and reduces Dectin-2 expression by Dectin-1 and Ste12 (Fig 6).

The effect of the combination of Dectin-1 and Ste12 was also evaluated in vivo. After treatment with a single dose of Dectin-1 (0.2 µM) or Dectin-2 (0.5 µM) (Fig 7), the expression of the gene encoding the cytochrome P450 3A4-3A5 was significantly reduced in an oropharyngeal nematode. This reduction is reduced by up to 100%, suggesting that Dectin-1 and Ste12 are required for the inhibition of Dectin-1 and Ste12. Conversely, treatment with the combined concentration of Dectin-1 and Ste12 (0.2 µM) did not reduce the expression of the cytochrome P450 3A4-3A5 (Fig 7). We believe that the combination of Dectin-1 and Ste12 (Fig 7) can be used to inhibit the activity of the bacterial pathogen E. coli (E. coli).
