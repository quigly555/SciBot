## Abstract
Background: Essential oils (EOs) are widely used as a healthy alternative to combat food allergies. EOs are mainly produced by the degradation of oils extracted from different plants, bacteria and other microorganisms, and also by the degradation of carbohydrates and amino acids. EOs are also produced by microorganisms with different evolutionary histories and different sources. They are generally found in large quantities in many commercial oils and they are produced by different species. The chemical structure of EO is similar to those of other plant oils, and they are generally reported as antimicrobial and antioxidant. However, some EOs contain toxic intermediates and some contain leads, additives, and compounds that affect the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. In some cases, these intermediates may interfere with the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. The aim of this study was to synthesize EO with a broad focus on the effect on the development of food allergies and other food related diseases.

Method: Oils were extracted from various plants, animals, and microorganisms and then analyzed by chemical analysis to identify the active intermediates. The compounds were characterized by mass spectrometry and other techniques. The best isolated intermediates with antifungal activity were also recognised as potential allergens. The chemical structure of EO was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The most active intermediates with the best activity were also recognised as potential pathogens. The best compounds with antifungal activity were also recognised as potential allergens. The chemical structure of EO was similar to those of other plant oils, but some of the intermediates may be toxic.

Conclusion: Essential oils can be synthesised using less harmful processes, and the chemical structure of EO can be developed using various microorganisms and plants that have been genetically modified to perform a specific activity. This approach may be applied to produce EOs with a specific activity, and to develop them into food and pharmaceuticals that are nutraceuticals or natural products.

I would also like to take the opportunity to apologize for the delay in acceptance, I had a bit of a seizure while discussing the work with my team.


## Methods
brasiliensis strain LY90 using a random DNA isolation protocol (Table 1. We first isolated 10-kb fragments from the pBluescript SK DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using the primers 5'-TTTCTGCTTTCCGAGCAGTCTACCTCTT-3' and 3'-TTCTCAGCTGGCCCTTCGCCGCTG-3', and we used these fragments as template to amplify the P. brasiliensis gene encoding the glyoxylate synthase from genomic DNA using the primers 5'-TCTCCAGCAGTGAGCTTCTCTCAGCTC-3' and 3'-TTCCACAGCTCCTGCCCTCCTT-3' for the amplification of the glyoxylate synthase, respectively. After electrophoretic transfer on a 1% agarose gel at 4°C, we separated the PCR products into four fractions. We then transferred the resulting fractions into a 1.5 ml micro-tube and we purified them using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purified PCR fragments were then concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter column (GE Healthcare, UK) (5 min at 200 x g, 10 min at 100 x g, and 10 min at 300 x g). The concentration of each fraction was determined using the Qubit 2.0 dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA).

In order to assess the transmembrane regions between the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of P. brasiliensis proteins, we constructed a PCR product of the ITS region and a pRS426-F-R plasmid vector, which was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR product was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and we cloned the PCR product into pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, USA). PCR products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the results were verified using agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the plasmid was compared with the sequences obtained from the P. brasiliensis genome (Supplementary Figure S1).


## Results
and Pseudomonas s., are also considered as highly virulent pathogens [9]. However, they are not directly associated with plant pathogens, although their distribution is strongly related to plant pathogenicity. Thus, a new group of high virulent species could be emerging from the various genera (Table 1). The pathogenicity of the Mycobacterium sp. strain is not related to the plant genus, but to the Mycobacterium strains.

To determine if the pathogenicity of the Mycobacterium sp. strain is related to the species belonging to the Mycobacterium spp., we compared its virulence and pathogenicity phenotypes to other species of the mycobacteria (Table 1). We found that the Mycobacterium sp. strain is less virulent than other species in a panel of assays, including a panel of assays with a murine model of infection, and a panel of assays with a murine model of infection, and it is not known if the virulence of the Mycobacterium strain is related to the M. tuberculosis strain. We found that, in the first assay, the Mycobacterium sp. strain was less virulent than other species in a panel of assays with a murine model of infection, and it was not known if the virulence of the Mycobacterium strain is related to the M. tuberculosis strain.

The other two Mycobacterium strains, P. aeruginosa and the Mycobacterium spp., were more virulent than the M. tuberculosis strain (Table 1). Both the M. tuberculosis and M. parapsilosis isolates were less virulent than other species in a panel of assays with a murine model of infection.

We found that the pathogenicity phenotypes of the two mycobacteria were closely related to the other M. tuberculosis isolates. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa was not related to the M. tuberculosis strain, and it was not known if the virulence of the M. parapsilosis isolate is related to the M. tuberculosis strain. In a panel of assays with a murine model of infection, P.


## Discussion
was used to identify paracoccidioidomycetes that are part of a wide array of pathogenic classe. Several studies have been performed to find the paracoccidioidomycetes, such as the species E. cuniculi, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and C. neoformans. In addition, some other fungi were identified. All these fungi include a wide range of taxonomic classes, and are present in the soil, but their presence has not been confirmed [39]. In our study, we found that there is a high prevalence of Paracoccidioides spp. in soil and air. This is probably due to the soil fungal communities, which are dominated by fungi from the class Eurotiomycetes, as well as by the soil-borne fungi, such as Lodderomyces spp., Candida spp., and Saccharomyces spp. [39].

Genome sequence analysis revealed that the majority of paracoccidioidomycetes were significantly enriched in the air and soil fungal communities, with a predominance in the soil. This is probably due to the fact that the fungal community is considered to be the main source of airborne fungal infection. This observation is supported by the analysis of the genome of the plant pathogen T. indicae, which showed an abundance of fungi similar to that of soil fungi [40].

In our study, the Paracoccidioides spp. were found in soil and air, which is in agreement with previous studies [39]. In addition, the ability to grow on the top of trees and trees are considered to be beneficial for the pathogenic fungus P. jirovecii, which was shown to survive and colonize the soil [41].

The addition of citric acid to the water in the soil provides beneficial conditions for the plant pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides spp.

The addition of citric acid to the water in the soil allows the plant to maintain its normal growth condition, which is necessary for the protection of the plant against the adverse effects of the water-borne fungi.

In this study, we found that the ability to grow on the top of trees and trees were significantly enriched in the air and soil.
