## Introduction
The genus Pestalotiopsis is a group of ectoparasites that belong to the family Pestalotiaceae. Species of this genus are ascomycetous and can reproduce asexually, feeding on their host plants. Pestalotiopsis species can be recognized by their small phialides, which are globose to subglobose and encased in a thick-walled thick-walled wall of ß-linked glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) (Wilson, 2010). GXM is a major component of the fungal cell wall and is mainly composed of a-1,3- and ß-(1<U+2192>3)-glucans.


## Methods
[12. The assay was performed in triplicate. One milliliter of the hexane extract of Xanthophyllomyces was mixed with 1 ml of 10 mM CaCl_2 (pH 7.0) and 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) in a 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and then at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the solution was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C until use. The assay was performed in triplicate.

In-solution mixtures (20 µl) were prepared by mixing 1 ml of 1 mM GPI in a 1.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with an anion-exchange reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature. The gels were developed using an AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) in negative-ion mode. The dye-free control was performed by incubating the gels in the form of a 1-mm-diameter gel. The gel was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with an oil concentration of 10 mM. The absorbance at 280 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer (Polaris, St. Louis, MO, USA).

Effect of Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous on the Carbohydrate utilization of Xanthophyllomyces
The Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous cAMP synthesis activity was determined by the method described by Li et al. [12]. Briefly, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous cAMP synthesis was performed using the Xanthophyllomyces essential oil as a substrate. The assay was performed in triplicate. One milliliter of the oil (0.


## Results
The results showed that the activity of Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor system was significantly increased in XaRS1 (Table 1) compared to XaRS2 (Table 2), and this was most likely due to a reduction in the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor activit. Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor system activity was also significantly reduced in XaMm (Table 1) compared to XaRS1 (Table 2) in Xanthophyllomyces molitorhicum (XaMm) but not in XaRS2 (Table 2). The reduced activity of glycoproteins from Xanthophyllomyces molitorhicum (XaMm) and XaRS1 (XaRS2) was probably due to the increased glycoprotein composition of Xanthophyllomyces molitorhicum compared to XaRS1 (XaRS2) (Figure 4).

In order to determine the importance of glycoproteins in the regulation of glycosylation, Xanthophyllomyces molitorhicum strains were treated with glycoproteins derived from glycan-binding site-domain (GBS)-polypeptide (GPD) system (Figure 5). The results showed that the glycosylation activity of Xanthophyllomyces molitorhicum was significantly decreased in the presence of glycoproteins derived from glycan-binding site-domain (GBS)-polypeptide system (Figure 5). Glycan-binding site-domain (GBS)-polypeptide (GPD) system is a highly specific substrate for glycan binding in the glycan-binding groove [10].


## Discussion
dendrorhous <U+0394> lacks the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (.e., the -1- to +1-phosphorylated phosphorylphosphatidylinositol anchor) and that the <U+0394> pyrazine-pretreated X. dendrorhous mutant displays no signs of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (i.e., the -1- to +1-phosphorylated phosphorylphosphatidylinositol anchor) and that the <U+0394> pyrazine-pretreated X. dendrorhous <U+0394> exhibits the same phenotype as the <U+0394> mutant, consistent with the role of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in promoting the activity of synthetic glycosylphosphatidylinositol (i.e., the -1- to +1-phosphorylated phosphorylphosphatidylinositol anchor). In contrast, the <U+0394> pyrazine-pretreated X. dendrorhous <U+0394> shows a phenotypic defect (Figure 7) that may result from the presence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The <U+0394> pyrazine-pretreated X. dendrorhous <U+0394> also displays the same phenotype as the <U+0394> mutant, which also displays a phenotypic defect in which the phosphatidylinositol anchor was missing (Figure 7).

The cytosolic pyrazine-pretreated X. dendrorhous <U+0394> displays a high degree of phenotypic plasticity when compared to the mutant, which displays only a modest degree of plasticity when compared to the <U+0394> mutant (Figure 8). This is in stark contrast to the fungal model where, in contrast to a fungal strain, a fungal strain is fully plastic, albeit a fungal strain shows a nearly identical amount of plasticity when compared to a fungal strain (Grillo et al., 2013).
