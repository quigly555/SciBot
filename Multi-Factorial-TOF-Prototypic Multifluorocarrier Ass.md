## Abstract

From April 2016 to March 2017, all patients with fungal keratitis were included in this stud. Data was collected on average incidence of fungal keratitis (NS) and outcome by clinical outcome and on average incidence of fungal keratitis in patients with fungal keratitis and other immunocompromised patients. Data was collected on average incidence of fungal keratitis and mortality for the months of April and May was used.

In total, 5,198 patients were included in the study. Out of 5,198 patients, more than half died before the onset of fungal keratitis. The mortality rate was highest among patients with fungal keratitis (63.8%), followed by other fungal infections (25.3%) and skin disorders (12.9%). Thirty-eight percent of patients with fungal keratitis had = one episode of fungal keratitis occurring within one year. Patients with fungal keratitis had a higher risk for death (odds ratio: 5.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-27.7). Patients with fungal keratitis had higher odds of mortality (4.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.6-8.4, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, fungal keratitis was the commonest cause of fungal keratitis.

The data show that patients with fungal keratitis are prone to have increased morbidity and mortality. They have a higher mortality rate, and they tend to have a protracted course of disease, especially if drug-resistant pathogens are encountered. Diagnosis of fungal keratitis can be challenging because it is not easily accessible, and the course of disease can be as life-threatening as fungal keratitis. Therefore, fungal keratitis is a public health problem in Rwanda. The data presented in this paper clearly shows the need for new strategies to combat fungal infections in Rwanda. The data also show that rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent the recurrence of fungal infections in Rwanda.

This study reports on the epidemiology of the fungus Sporothrix spp. among patients with fungal keratitis in the National Reference Center for Microbiology and Pathology (NRCLP-PM-Z1) in Rwanda.


## Introduction
The genus Conidiobolus Crous was established by Crous et al. (2014), with C.cubilioides as the type species. The genus Conidiobolus has been reported from all over the world, with C.cubilioides particularly prevalent in the Mediterranean, North and South Africa, Africa, and United States (Crous et al. 2013, 2014), C.nubilioides being endemic in Europe (Crous et al. 2014) and Asia (Crous et al. 2014).

The genus Conidiobolus was found in tropical Africa, especially in the tropics (Crous et al. 2012), and it is well known as an important plant in many African countries (Crous et al. 2014).


## Methods
All data were analysed using SPSS (version 1.0). The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS Statistics for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

4.6. Isolation and Isolation of Bacteria
After the fungal suspensions were obtained, the suspensions were adjusted to a concentration of 0.1 OD_600, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h in a shaking incubator. Then the bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing the bacterial suspension was collected and concentrated by centrifugation. The concentrated supernatant was dissolved by a 1 ml methanol-water mixture and then it was dialyzed against sterile distilled water (3.5 ml), and the concentrated solution was concentrated by a SpeedVac (Beckman Coulter, USA) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The filtered supernatant was used for the antimicrobial activity assay and the bioactivity was confirmed using the checkerboard microdilution method according to the method of Collander and Strimmer [22]. The results were expressed as µg/ml. The concentrations used for antimicrobial activity were those reported in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for filamentous fungi [23].

4.7. Antifungal Activity Testing
The antibacterial activities of the compounds were determined according to the method of Mäzárkova and Zuckerkäuser [24] using sterile H_2O and RPMI 1640 broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) as the medium. Bacterial suspension (1.0 × 10^5 CFU/ml) was added into each well of the microtitre plates and the bacterial growth was assessed at 37°C for 24 h. The susceptibility of the bacteria to the compounds was assessed using the broth dilution method described by Söder and Föder [25]. The bacterial suspensions (100 µl) were plated on nutrient-rich solid media (MMN) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The MICs were determined using the broth dilution method described by Tofino et al. [26] and the results were expressed as µg/ml.


## Results
The FCAT assay is commonly used in the treatment of fungal infections to assess whether the phagosomal morphology has an effect on the infection outcome [19-21. The MFCAT assay was developed by the International Society of Microbiology (Socio-fungi Genomics Initiative) as a commercial multicenter study to investigate the impact of monovalent and multi-factorial antifungal drugs on the ability of C. albicans to colonize host tissues. The assay is based on the principle that the interaction of a single molecule with another molecule leads to a multifunctional interaction that is important for the pathogenicity of the pathogen to its hosts.

The MFCAT assay was validated by a semi-quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the FCAT dye in the presence of C. albicans. This experiment was first conducted on a medium containing a specific compound that inhibits the activity of the major facilitator superfamily of multidrug antiporters, including Fc<U+03B3>RI, Fc<U+03B3>CRI, Fc<U+03B3>RI, and Fc<U+03B3>RII. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity of the FCAT dye was significantly increased in the presence of the compound (Figure 2B). However, the FCAT dye did not fluoresce in the presence of other antimicrobials, including the monovalent antifungal antifungal drugs Fc<U+03B3>RI, Fc<U+03B3>CRI, and Fc<U+03B3>RII. Therefore, the sensitivity of the FCAT assay is in line with the importance of the interaction of multiple molecules with the host. The results were further confirmed by the MFCAT assay, which demonstrated that the fungicidal activity of the MFCAT dye was significantly inhibited by the monovalent antifungal antifungal drugs Fc<U+03B3>RI and Fc<U+03B3>CRI.

We then examined the effect of Fc<U+03B3>RI on the ability of C. albicans to colonize the human liver and kidney.


## Discussion
In this study, we have presented a novel method for the analysis of plasma membrane lipid composition and protein content, in a common and natural population of C. albicans. This approach has been applied to species-select and confirmable whole genome sequence data, in which the available data are not sufficient to detect the presence of specific subpopulations of fungal species, as well as species-specific variations in the relative composition of plasma membrane lipid components. By investigating the use of this method for identifying and characterizing the plasma membrane composition, we have found that this method can be used to identify and characterize species-specific variations in the plasma membrane of C. albicans and other basidiomycetes.

The PLC-based method was developed to be an efficient method for the identification and characterization of C. albicans-specific C-flux proteins in order to confirm the presence of specific subpopulations of C. albicans. The results of this method are in agreement with the data presented by O’Connell et al. (2012) and the results presented here. PLC-based approaches have been previously used in the isolation of Candida species from blood, urine, and fecal samples. The isolates obtained from blood and fecal samples were characterized by fluorescence microscopy and micro-resolution spectroscopy. The PLC-based method also yielded higher yields than the PLC-based methods, with a PLC-based method yielding a higher yield, and using a PLC-based method with a PLC-based approach yielding a higher yield, when compared to the PLC-based methods. The PLC-based approach also yielded the highest yield of C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. The PLC-based method yielded the highest yield, followed by the PLC-based method, which yielded a lower yield, and with the PLC-based method. The difference in the yield between the two approaches was observed in the fatty acid profile of the samples. In the presence of C. albicans, the fatty acid profile of the samples was dominated by saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas the fatty acid profile of the samples was dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids. The C.
