## Abstract
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare disorder characterized by the destruction of the brain microvascular endothelia. It is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators including white blood cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells. It is most often reported in the form of a mild fevers accompanied by encephalopathy. We report a case of acute disseminated ADEM in a patient who had suffered from unilateral unilateral white blood cell anemia while receiving steroids for rheumatoid arthritis and without corticosteroid therapy. The patient presented with a week of steroid therapy in an attempt to resolve a febrile illness. After a week, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a sudden onset of dizziness and focal neurological changes. The patient’s condition improved rapidly with ophthalmologic examinations. The patient’s laboratory findings indicated an ADC with increased ADEM due to immunosuppressants and immunotherapy. The patient’s symptoms improved and are summarized in this report.


## Introduction
The transition metal hydroxide is one of the most important metal ions with a wide range of applications in the industry, including catalysts, bioconfiguration, structural, structural, and functional chemistry, cell protection and bioremediation, drug delivery, metal shielding, and drug delivery systems (Majesure et al., 2008; Yagi and Samuels, 2015; Li et al., 2017). The presence of hydroxyl groups on the metal ion affects biological processes such as transport, catalytic activity, bioconversion, and degradation (Bishara and Logie, 2003; Arumu et al., 2007; Padmen et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2016).

The hydroxamate groups of many metals can be recognized by their N- and O-alkyl groups. The metal N-acetylhex-1,4-naphthoquinone groups are considered as important to metal ion-dependent catalysts, such as catalysts in catalytic and degradation reactions, metal transporters, metal stabilizers, metal shielding, metal exchangers, metal-biotype metal binding proteins, and metal transport systems (Chayakulkeeree et al., 2008; Padmen et al., 2015; Arumu et al., 2007; Padmen and Rajaram, 2010).


## Methods
The phagocytosis assays were performed in a Petri dish (8 cm×8 cm) containing 1% Triton X-100 and .1% dextran sulfate, in the presence of 20 µg/mL pepstatin A.

The mice were sacrificed by CO_2 inhalation and the skin was collected. The dorsal area was dissected into two pieces (20 cm×20 cm) and weighed, and the tissue was homogenized in 5 mL sterile PBS. The homogenate was serially diluted, and the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was counted. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Phagocytosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 100 µL of 100 µg/mL pepstatin A in 0.5 mL of PBS. The phagocytosis assay was performed in a Petri dish (8 cm×8 cm) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% dextran sulfate, in the presence of 20 µg/mL pepstatin A.

The mice were sacrificed by CO_2 inhalation and the skin was collected. The tissue was homogenized in 5 mL of PBS and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The pellet was suspended in 1 mL of PBS and stored at -20°C. The cells were lysed with a Precellys lysogen (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the lysate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a Percoll gradient. The lysate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The lysate was removed, and the supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of 1% Triton X-100, and the lysate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 1% Triton X-100, and the supernatant was collected. The lysate was then aspirated and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.


## Results
For instance, phagocytosis is mediated by a number of mechanisms including membrane fluidity, local killing, and intrinsic uptake (see Figure 2. Several human pathogens express a type of extracellular phagocytosis system [28, 29]. In humans, the Drosophila Salmonella Typhimurium phagocytosis system is a high complexity system with numerous functions [30-33]. As phagocytosis is known to be a highly specific and complex process [34, 35], we compared the phagocytosis of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis by S. Typhimurium (Figure 1). Compared to the control, the bacteria were detected in the skin of mice after oral challenge with a novel bacterial pathogen (Figure 1). The detection of the phagocytosis of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was confirmed by intranasal inoculation with S. Typhimurium (Figure 1). In addition, the pathogen was also found in the blood of mice at the end of the study. These data suggest that the bacterial and fungal phagocytosis processes may have been influenced by the fungal host environment.

To test the hypothesis that the phagocytosis of a host pathogen by the bacteria can be interpreted as a molecular function, we tested the ability of S. Typhimurium to engulf a diverse range of microbes including S. Typhimurium in vivo. We first tested the ability of the bacteria to utilize intracellular niche-derived nutrient sources, including D-galactose, sucrose, glucose, sucrose-containing maltose, and fructose as carbon sources. The authors of the study concluded that these carbon sources are ideal substrates for microbial phagocytosis because they have previously been shown to be optimal conditions for phagocytosis of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis in humans [36, 37]. The authors also demonstrated that the observed higher cell numbers of the S. Typhimurium bacteria than the control bacteria was not due to a phagocytosis defect [36].

In order to test whether the observed differences in the numbers of bacteria in the S.


## Discussion
Several studies have shown that the most effective antibiotic treatment is the use of drugs targeting fungal pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant . aureus (CLR), and carbapenem-resistant E. faecium (MRF) [22]. In addition, antifungal therapy is also considered a highly promising strategy to treat fungal infections. Several studies have shown that the antifungal drug is a broad spectrum antibiotic. For example, in vitro susceptibility tests have shown that the human pathogen Candida albicans has the ability to grow on solid agar [23]. In the current study, the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans and S. aureus on solid agar was inhibited by different antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, amphotericin B, and ciprofloxacin. Moreover, a study reported that the antifungal drug azithromycin has a wide spectrum activity against Candida albicans [24]. Our results indicated that the antifungal treatment with azithromycin can be applied in the treatment of fungal infections caused by these fungal species.

Antifungal drugs target fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, which is one of the most common pathogenic fungi causing infection in humans [25]. Recently, Feretzomyces dermatidis, a basidiomycete yeast, was reported to be resistant to most antifungal drugs and fungicides, and to be able to cause life-threatening invasive aspergillosis [26]. In our study, the antifungal treatment with antifungal azithromycin was successful, with the MIC values of azithromycin for C. albicans were 0.07-1.06 mg/mL, which is within the range of other fungi with MIC values of 0.06-1.0 mg/mL [27].
