## Abstract
Wound repair is a fundamental process of the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, repair of the underlying fungal cell wall is essential for virulence. Structure-function relationships of fungal cell walls have important impact on how Aspergillus is killed and how the fungus responds to cell wall perturbations. Here we describe a novel structure-function relationship for a group of Aspergillus cell wall-related proteins, which are specifically conserved from animals to fungi. Mutations in the hyphal core cause of fungal cell wall integrity and promote hyphal growth in vitro. This novel structure-function relationship was also used to design peptides that synergize with virulence factors to design peptides that synergize with plant cell wall perturbing agents to synergize with biotransformation agents to synergize with biotransformation agents to synergize with biotransformation agents to synergize with antifungal drugs to design novel drugs that synergize with antifungal agents to design novel antifungal drugs to synergistic inhibitory compounds that synergize with antifungal agents to design novel synergistic antifungal drugs to synergistic inhibitory treatments to define novel treatment strategies to treat invasive fungal infections that are uniquely organized into a broad spectrum of diverse forms.

When a fungus is cultured in minimal medium to prevent fungal growth, tissue regeneration, and infection with many fungal pathogens, such as A. fumigatus, itr1, the bacterium responsible for the human mycosis Aspergillus fumigatus, is present. Even in the absence of the fungal cell wall, the fungus is highly sensitive to various stressors, including oxidative stress and changes in the cell wall proteome, and to a class of antifungal drugs that are known to act on these cells. These findings suggest that there is a conserved unique structure-function relationship in the fungal cell wall between fungus and its host, indicating that these cells can be used as drug targets for invasive aspergillosis and fungal pathogenicity.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that is found in the environment in a variety of environmental niches. It is capable of evading the host immune system and is therefore an important human fungal pathogen. Infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals and rarely causes disease. However, individuals with intact immune systems are susceptible to disseminated cryptococcosis, which is an AIDS-defining illness.1,2 With the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of disease has declined in the developing countries, where most cases occur.3 However, the global prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis still remains high, and its mortality rate has increased over the past few decades.4,5

The most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis is asymptomatic dissemination of the organism from the lung to the brain, but there are some cases, including acute percutaneous abscess, where cryptococcal disease may occur for the life of the patient.6,7,8 This is a rare event. However, there has been an increase in the number of cases due to immunosuppressed patients, such as AIDS-related diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and cancer.


## Methods
Strains and media
S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, version 2.0) and Saccharomyces Genome Database (CBS, version 3.0) (Table 1) and are listed in Table 1. S. cerevisiae BWP17 (a kind gift from Dr. Hefe Wiens) was used for transgene expression in the study of bovine spleens. All strains were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37°C for 4 days and stored at 4°C. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 2.

Plant growth conditions
S. cerevisiae strain BWP17 (a kind gift from Dr. Hefe Wiens) was cultured on SDA at 37°C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000×g for 5 min) and washed twice in sterile water. S. cerevisiae cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000×g for 5 min), washed twice in sterile water and resuspended in sterile water. S. cerevisiae cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2000×g for 5 min) and washed twice in sterile water. For transgenic BWP17, S. cerevisiae cells were transgeniced into the E. coli strain pBluescript.

## Results
Steenbergen et a., 2011) and the evidence for evolution of the Fungal Fungal Fungal Mating Domain (FmaD) in Dictyostelium discoideum (Alvarez et al., 2012) and a possible origin in the Fungal Fungal Mating Domain (FmaE) in F. graminearum (Manili et al., 2012). However, we have not found evidence of functional domains in the fungal FmaE or FmaD of the Fungal Fungal Mating Domain (FmaD) (Manili et al., 2012). FmaE and FmaE are not closely related but as far as we know they are related to F. graminearum, which is a basal taxon in the Fusarium graminearum complex (Cormac et al., 2016).

The phylogenetic tree supports a close relationship of Fusarium ducensis, F. verticillioides, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. verticillioides, F. verticillum, F. oxysporum, and F. verticillum (Fig 4). The taxon also appears to be more distantly related to F. verticillioides and F. verticillum in the ML and MP analyses (Fig 4). Fumagillinibacter spp. are present in F. verticillioides and F. verticillum but they appear to be less related to F. ducensis and F. oxysporum in the ML and MP analyses (Fig 4).

The Fusarium spp. and F. verticillioides FmaE are closely related to F. graminearum FmD and FmE are closely related to F. graminearum FmE in the ML and MP analyses (Fig 4).

The F. verticillioides FmaE is more distantly related to F. verticillioides FmD and FmE than F. graminearum FmE in the ML and MP analyses.

The F. verticillioides FmaE and FmD are closely related to F. graminearum FmE in the ML and MP analyses but more distantly related to F.


## Discussion
The Fusarium order has been associated with the Mediterranean basin since the Last Glacial Maximum [60. The Fusarium order was suggested to be closely related to the order Fusarium, which was originally named by King George VI (d. 1792). In the present study, it was revealed that the order Fusarium was more closely related to the Fusarium orders than to other orders (Fig 2). The Fusarium order was previously described from the Mediterranean basin and Europe [61].

The Fusarium order is characterized by the presence of melanized conidia, which are composed of hyaline hyphal cells, and it is a member of the order Flavoparmelia, which is a highly diverse family of fungi that includes species such as Bipolarispora, Cylindrocarpon, and Fusarium [62]. However, the order Flavoparmelia is not well-studied in Europe. However, the order Flavoparmelia has been proposed to represent a new order of fungi in the order Flavoparmelia that includes the orders and orders Flavoparmelia, Flavoparmelia, and Fusarium [63]. The order Flavoparmelia has been the focus of several studies, which have focused on the order Flavoparmelia and related genera. However, the order Flavoparmelia was not well-studied in the European research groups. In this study, the order Flavoparmelia was found to be highly phylogenetically related to the order Flavoparmelia.

In addition, we found that the order Flavoparmelia was more closely related to the order Fusarium. The order Flavoparmelia is phylogenetically related to the order Fusarium. We observed that the order Fusarium was more closely related to the Fusarium order than to other orders. The order Flavoparmelia was also found to be a high phylogenetic species phylogenetically related to the order Fusarium.

The order Flavoparmelia was previously described from the Mediterranean basin and was a member of the order Flavoparmelia. However, the order Flavoparmelia was not well-studied in the European research groups.
