## Abstract
A 44-year-old woman with diabetes, leukocytosis, and Kaposi’s sarcoma presented to our facility with a four-week history of headache, fever, irritability, and neck stiffness. She had begun smoking medical marijuana 3 months earlier. Her symptoms and history were unchanged for 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an abnormal expansion of the posterior fossa and a dilated inferior white matter. Histopathology showed a granulomatous inflammation, and splenomegaly was present in the cortical, parietal, and small subcortical structures. A polymerase chain reaction of the tumor-bearing lung tissue demonstrated extensive and immature fragments of a fungal exosome. The lung tissue was identified as M. tuberculosis by the presence of an AlB-rich exosome. M. tuberculosis was isolated from blood and tissue cultures and identified as T. marneffei by the presence of an AlB-rich exosome. The lung exosome was identified as T. marneffei by culture. The spleen cells in the spleen were identified as T. marneffei. The results of this investigation indicated that the lung exosome contained fungal components, such as M. tuberculosis, and this could be due to the exosome-exosomes interaction.


## Introduction
The infection process of the respiratory tract of a healthy host, after inhaling infectious particles, is a complex and dynamic process that is not easily controlled by conventional respiratory therapeutic methods. In contrast to the free-living animal, bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can be exposed to a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 25 °C to 27 °C. The use of antibiotics and other immune surveillance devices has increased the usage of antibiotics for the treatment of infections (Pulford and McClelland, 2003; Turissini et al., 2008; Turissini et al., 2009). The ability of the bacteria to survive and grow at different temperatures, being able to survive in the air, in the soil, in water, on surfaces, etc., is a great advantage when working with Gram-negative bacteria. However, the ability to grow at such low temperatures, is a risk to patients. The ability to grow at such low temperatures, is a risk to patients.

## Methods
The experimental design was as follows: (1) low-frequency filamentation; (2) low-frequency or high-frequency fluorescence; and (3) high-frequency and low-frequency fluorescenc.

Immunization of mice
Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10^6 yeast cells (5×10^5). Infected macrophages were allowed to attach to glass cover slips in 24-well plates. At predetermined time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 h), 5×10^5 yeast cells from uninfected macrophages were removed, and the wells were washed with PBS, and then inoculated with 2×10^6 cells of YPD. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The numbers of viable yeast cells were counted, and the number of non-adherent yeast cells was defined as a no-growth endpoint. For non-adherent yeast cells, we counted the number of viable yeast cells without adherent yeast cells. The number of adherent yeast cells was determined, and the number of non-adherent yeast cells was defined as a positive outcome endpoint. For control macrophages, we counted only non-adherent yeast cells.

Real-time quantitative PCR
The C. neoformans VNI and VNI_A6p strains were used as positive controls in this study. The relative expression level of VNI_A6p was calculated using the 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method [50]. The absolute value of the C. neoformans VNI_A6p mutant was calculated as the ratio between the wild-type and the complemented strains. The expression levels of VNI_A6p in the wild-type strain were compared to that of the complemented strain by the qRT-PCR method. The P-values were calculated using the 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method [51]. The relative expression levels of the genes in each group were compared to their wild-type values. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method [52].


## Results

In order to investigate the effects of putative secreted peptides on the development of IRIS, mice were intranasally inoculated with a single dose of the p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) peptide and were then treated with various doses of the pNPP-dextra. The frequency of IL-10 producing microglia was quantified by the ratio of the number of IFN-<U+03B3> producing microglia in each animal (Fig 2A). The frequency of IL-10 producing microglia in the pNPP-dextran-treated mice was much lower than that in the control group (Fig 2B). In order to evaluate the effect of putative secreted peptides on the development of IRIS, we also examined the effect of a single dose of pNPP peptide on the development of IL-10 producing microglia. The incidence of IL-10 producing microglia was significantly higher in the pNPP-dextran-treated mice compared to the control group (Fig 2C). Moreover, IL-10 producing microglia produced by the pNPP-dextran-treated mice also showed significantly higher frequencies of IL-10 producing microglia in the pNPP-dextran-treated mice compared to the control group (Fig 2D). These data suggest that P-nitrophenyl phosphate is a protective factor for the development of IRIS, but a single dose of pNPP peptide could not significantly interfere with IL-10 production.

In order to investigate whether P-nitrophenyl phosphate was a protective factor for the development of IRIS, the inhibitory effect of P-nitrophenyl phosphate on the development of IL-10 producing microglia was also investigated. The incidence of IL-10 producing microglia in the pNPP-dextran-treated mice was significantly higher than that in the control group (Fig 2E). However, the incidence of IL-10 producing microglia in the pNPP-dextran-treated mice was much lower than that in the control group (Fig 2E).


## Discussion
However, in the current study, we found that lymphocyte type did not correlate with the severity of allergic rhiniti. It was speculated that the severe allergic rhinitis was likely due to the hyper-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets that can be activated in the early stages of allergic rhinitis [36].

In addition to B-cell genes, some fungal genes, including M. smegmatis, A. fumigatus, and S. commune, also have the potential to be involved in innate immune responses in mice [37, 38]. In our study, the ability of M. smegmatis to produce antibodies against antigen and to produce IL-1 and IL-2 was significantly lower than that of A. fumigatus. In this study, the expression of various fungal genes was found to be down-regulated in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This was confirmed by the finding that IL-1 and IL-2 were up-regulated in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and that IL-2 was up-regulated in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The down-regulation of the fungal genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also reported by Schirawski et al. [39].

Although the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis was related to fungal infections, this was not the case for A. fumigatus. In this study, A. fumigatus and the other A. fumigatus were also found to produce different types of IL-1 and IL-2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. This was confirmed by the finding that IL-1 and IL-2 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets was significantly lower in mice with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to mice without CD8+ T cells.
