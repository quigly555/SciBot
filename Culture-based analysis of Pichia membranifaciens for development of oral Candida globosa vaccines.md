## Abstract
A new species of Trachyces (Corrinopsis) that is morphologically different from Trachyces minuta/Corrinopsis gypseus, described from Europe and North America, is described and illustrated here. The new species is characterised by its hygrophanous basidiomata with long, spongy beaded conidia and long, keratodongue-like conidia. The hygrophanous conidiomata of the new species are associated with a single hymenium and the conidia are encased in a thick, robust, septate conidia. In situ comparisons of conidia and beaded conidia in the basidiomes of Trachyces and Trachyces reveal that both species have similar morphological characters, although Trachyces is distinguished by its septate conidia. This morphological difference demonstrates that Trachyces is a distinct species from Trachyces minuta/Corrinopsis, which has two distinctly different clinical names: T. coronans and T. gypseus.


## Introduction
Kap1/2 and Nrk1 have a common ancestral function. They bind to the promoter region of a protein, KAP1/2, and its binding sites are located in the promoters of target genes. They are the only protein in eukaryotic cells that possesses this binding activity, which is required for full virulence. Some strains, such as those from the yeast Candida albicans, do not possess this binding activity. To date, only two known proteins, KAP1/2 and Nrk1, have been identified in C. albicans: the KAP1 protein is expressed in the hyphal form and its promoter is located at the yeast form locus, whereas the KAP1 protein is located in the nucleus. The KAP1/2 protein binds to KAP1/2, and the binding site is located at the promoter of the target genes.

Kap1 and Nrk1 are the two most abundant proteins in the yeast cell, occurring in the cytoplasm and nucleus. They are responsible for cell growth and cell wall integrity, respectively. Some of them, such as Yarrowia lipolytica and Candida tropicalis, can be found in the cell wall, which can be used for growth and growth as well as for cell growth by degrading the cell wall polysaccharides and extracellular matrix proteins.

The mechanisms by which Kap1 and Nrk1 sense and respond to the cell wall are not clearly understood, but Kap1 and Nrk1 seem to be involved in the interaction between the cell wall and the surrounding environment.


## Methods
The isolates were subcultured onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and incubated for four day. The isolates were identified by two independent authors, confirming the identity of the isolates by direct microscopy and by direct microscopic examination. The isolates were subcultured on SDA slants at 37 °C for five days. The isolates were subcultured onto SDA and incubated at 37 °C for three days. The culture was collected and subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37 °C for three days.

The Pichia fumigatus isolates were identified by colony morphology on the SDA slant plates (16). The isolates were subcultured on SDA at 37 °C for four days. The colony morphologies were examined using a light microscope (Eclipse E600, Olympus, Japan) and were confirmed by colony growth on SDA (Althoff et al. 2003) and by colony growth on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37 °C for five days. The colonies were transferred to Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDA) slants for the development of CCV vaccine (CCV) and in vitro antimicrobial agents.

Antimicrobial activities of CCV vaccines
The antimicrobial activities of CCV vaccines were tested against the bacteria B. fumigatus, P. brasiliensis, P. syriaca, P. citrinum and P. lutzii. The assay was carried out according to the method described by Lu et al. (2011). Briefly, the inoculum of each isolate was diluted in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) and spread on SDA plates (10 cm in diameter) at room temperature. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for three days. The lowest concentrations of CCV that inhibited growth of the tested bacteria were 0.1-0.5. The plates were read visually and recorded. The antimicrobial activities of CCV vaccines were also tested against the yeast, C. albicans, and S. cerevisiae.


## Results
b.dtu.dk/services/cimsa-viable-vaccines/). The mHCV^- vector was used to select two P. membranifaciens strains (Table 1). The first strain (strain DAN01) was selected for the screen because it was a clinical isolate of P. membranifaciens, and the second because it was a clinical isolate of P. membranifaciens.

The two P. membranifaciens strains were tested against a range of environmental and clinical isolates of Candida (Table 1). The P. membranifaciens strains were tested for their ability to produce a candida-inducing, mycobacterial-inducing, and CFEM-inducing product. The P. membranifaciens strains were tested for their ability to produce a candida-inducing product in vivo.

The sensitivity of the two P. membranifaciens strains was investigated by using the P. membranifaciens B-acteroides MCC_10143 strain, a previously described strain of P. membranifaciens that was isolated from a patient with a pulmonary infection caused by P. membranifaciens (27).


## Discussion
 2018.

The number of identified species, distribution and phylogenetic relationship of the isolates in both clinical and environmental samples, as well as the molecular identification of fungal isolates, indicated that many species of the same genus are associated with different geographical regions in different countries. Although some species of Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Alternaria are common in the environment, other species are rare, mainly in the wild in bamboo forests, in temperate climates or in tropical climates (Riedl et al., 2014). It has been reported that some of the isolates (Pichia gracilis, Pichia roquefortii, Cladosporium, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cladosporium paraphaegerteri, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladosporium carbonum) are more susceptible to antifungal drugs than others (Kuramae et al., 2009, Prillinger et al., 2014). Moreover, it was reported that the MIC of antifungal drugs against a wide range of fungi is low for different strains of A. fumigatus and for A. parasiticus (Dalcin et al., 2000). It was also observed that the MIC of azoles against Aspergillus species is relatively higher than the ones against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (Nicolás et al., 2012).

The high frequency of other fungal species, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida parapsilosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus flavus, which are responsible for several lethal infections in humans, are not uncommon (Skamnioti et al., 2007). However, the significance of the genus Candida is still not known. It is well known that Candida species are the most important pathogens in tropical and subtropical regions and can cause invasive diseases in humans, especially in children (Liu et al., 2014). The genus Cryptococcus is characterized by their ability to produce multidrug-resistant strains (MDR) (Bertrand et al., 2007). It is a dominant biofilm-associated fungal pathogen and the main biofilm-associated fungus in the human body (Gao et al., 2012).
