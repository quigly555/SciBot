## Abstract
The Hyper-immunoglobulin M syndromes (HIGM) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders resulting in defects of immunoglobulin class switch recombination. They are characterized by defects in the use of a single or multiple genes, such as those encoding the AMP-binding protein, the AMP-binding protein 2 (HisB2), or the AMP-binding protein Ndc14. The HIGM are primarily characterized by a high degree of nonsense, characterized by upregulation of specific transcripts related to immunoglobulins. Although these genes were predicted to be expressed during the development of HIGM in the wild type and Masc1 strain, deletion of orthologs encoding HIGG1, HIGG2, HIGG4, HIGG5, and HIGG6 rendered them highly defective in their respective subtypes, including the HIGG1 and HIGG6 defective strains. Whereas the deletion of HIGG1 or HIGG6 had a similar impact on the expression of the HIGG genes, the deletion of HIGG1 or HIGG5 had a significantly greater negative impact on their complementation and HIGG4 had a significantly greater negative impact on their complementation. Finally, the HIGG genes are differentially expressed upon phosphorylation, as the HIGG6, HIGG5, and HIGG4 deletion showed that they are responsible for the different reprogramming of the protein's transcription factors. Taken together, our data demonstrate that HIGG defects are related to specific immunoglobulin defects and that the defects in HIGG4 are involved in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans.


## Introduction
Endophytes are microorganisms that live on every plant tissues and are present in the rhizosphere, root endosphere and vascular system (Coyne and Orr 2005; Wilson and Orr 2015). They live in symbiotic relationships with other microorganisms that live on their surfaces and in their bloodstream. Endophytes in fungi have been classified into at least two groups (Vulvad and Orr 2010): saprophytes and commensals (Coyne and Orr 2010). These microorganisms are characterized by the production of bioactive compounds such as phytohormones, phytase, proteases, mycotoxins, and phytotoxins (Orr et al. 2006; Wilson and Orr 2010). The fungi in the saprophytic lifestyle also produce a wide range phytostimulator compounds such as endocellulolytic enzymes and phytohormones that play an important role in the communication between plant and fungal cell (Coyne and Orr 2010). Endophytic fungi in the saprophytic lifestyle may also produce phytostimulators such as endoquinoline-4-oxide (EQO) and other phytostimulants (Coyne and Orr 2010).


## Methods

In order to identify the specific sequences that are associated with . irregularis skin cells, we downloaded the H. irregularis genome (version 1.0.1) [13]. The H. irregularis genome is available at GenBank under accession numbers: KU96457 to KU96459 (accession number XKU5380). The H. irregularis genome has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with accession number E-MTA3.

To identify the presence of each gene that expresses a specific protein, we downloaded the sequence of the H. irregularis protein, and the sequence of the gene encoding a specific gene was downloaded from the H. irregularis genome. The H. irregularis protein sequence was downloaded from the H. sapiens genome (version 1.0.1), and the H. sapiens gene encoding a specific protein was downloaded from the H. heterostrophus genome (version 2.1.0) [14].

The H. irregularis gene encoding a specific protein was obtained from the H. heterostrophus protein sequence of the H. sapiens genome (version 1.0.1), and the H. heterostrophus gene encoding a specific protein was downloaded from the H. sapiens genome sequence of H. sapiens (version 2.1.0).

## Results
The numbers of genes of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their corresponding gene expression scores were compared in the comparisons against the gene sets that were previously used for this stud. The results showed that the differentially expressed genes were distributed in four clusters (Figure 1). The first cluster contained genes that are highly expressed in the skin and that were clustered together in the cluster with no significant differences in their expression score between the two groups. The second cluster contained genes that are highly expressed in the skin, but clustered together in the cluster with no significant differences in their expression score between the two groups. The third cluster contained genes that are highly expressed in the skin, but clustered together in the cluster with no significant differences in their expression score between the two groups. The fourth cluster contained genes that are highly expressed in the skin, but clustered together in the cluster with no significant differences in their expression score between the two groups.

To further characterize the differentially expressed genes, the expression scores of all the differentially expressed genes were compared among the two groups. The results showed that genes highly expressed in the skin and highly expressed in the skin group were clustered together, and the expression scores of genes highly expressed in the skin and highly expressed in the skin group were clustered together, indicating that the genes highly expressed in the skin group were highly expressed in the two groups.

Identification of the Transcriptional Genes in the Skin Diatoms
The DEGs that were highly expressed in the skin and highly expressed in the skin groups were divided into three categories according to the expression scores of these genes. The first category contained genes with high expression in the skin and highly expressed in the skin group. The second category contained genes with high expression in the skin group, and the third category contained genes with high expression in the skin group, which showed significant differences in their expression score between the two groups. In addition, genes with significant expression in the skin group showed significant differences in their expression score between the two groups. The results indicated that the DEGs that were highly expressed in the skin and highly expressed in the skin group were clustered together, and the DEGs with significant expression in the skin group were clustered together, indicating that these genes highly expressed in the skin group were highly expressed in the two groups.


## Discussion
In this approach, we examined the proteome of Trichothecenes in both the presence and absence of trichothecene. We observed significant differences in the proteome of both strains, especially for proteome of Trichothecenes T1, which is associated with the expression of mycotoxins and fungal cell wall degrading enzymes (Figures 4, 5). Trichothecenes from the wild-type strain were similar to the Trichothecenes T1 strain (unpublished data). They also exhibited a higher mRNA accumulation compared to the wild-type strain (unpublished data). We also investigated the putative membrane-associated protein MetA, which is an effector of the transport of Trichothecenes to the vacuolar membrane [53]. MetA is also important for the initiation of the TCA cycle [54], which is important for the release of trichothecenes from the cell wall and for the cell wall degrading enzymes (Table S4). Trichothecenes can also be generated by TCA cycle, which is important for the TCA cycle in fungi [55]. In addition, we detected a high concentration of Trichothecenes in the cytosol of the Trichothecenes T1 and T2 strains. We also investigated the cytosol of T1 and T2 strains and found that they had different cytosolic levels of Trichothecenes compared to the wild-type strain. The cytosol of the T1 strain contained higher levels of Trichothecenes compared to the wild-type strain (Table S4).

In contrast to the expression of the Trichothecenes T1 and T2 genes, we found that the expression of the genes was significantly down-regulated in the T1 strain. A large up-regulated expression of the Trichothecenes T1 gene was found in T2 strains, and the T2 gene was up-regulated in the T1 strain. In addition, the gene encoding the enzyme required for the trichothecenes biosynthesis was down-regulated in T1 and T2 strains, which showed similar expression patterns compared to the wild-type strain (Table S4).
