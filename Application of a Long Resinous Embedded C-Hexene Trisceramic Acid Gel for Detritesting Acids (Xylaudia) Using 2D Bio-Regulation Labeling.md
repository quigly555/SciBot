## Abstract
There are no host biomarkers for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis (CM), although the flu antibodies are a promising adjunctive therapy. We report a case of a 76-year-old woman with breast cancer who was treated with the flu antigen (FA) without affecting her bone marrow function, suggesting that FA alone does not provide a valid adjunctive therapy for CM. Furthermore, she developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) upon treatment with the flu antigen (FA)-antigen. Her disease was only exacerbated by the FA-antigen autoantibodies, suggesting that the FA-antigen autoantibodies might have an important impact on the pathogenesis of SLE. Although the molecular mechanisms of FA-antigen autoantibodies in SLE remain unknown, we speculate that they might be involved in the onset of the disease. In addition, the inclusion of an anti-fungal adjuvant along with the use of a flu antigen can lower the risk of CM.

## Introduction
In recent years, the interest in the application of C-Hexene for organic chemistry and biological analysis has increased due to the remarkable efficiency of its degradation proces. This has led to the application of C-Hexene green biocatalyst [9]. The cytotoxic activity of C-Hexene has been reported to be up to 70-fold higher than that of Trichlorium dyes [10].

C-Hexene has been used as an organic dye in organic chemistry for a long time [11] and is currently used as a dye in biological industries as well as a dye in pharmaceutical industries [12]. In recent years, its use has increased due to the use of C-Hexene in bioconversion to produce antibiotics, enzymes and metabolites, as well as to the fact that it is used in biological industries as a dye in many pharmaceuticals [13]. There are several reports about the use of C-Hexene as a dye in the evaluation of antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities [14,15]. Moreover, C-Hexene has been proved to be highly effective in the evaluation of antimicrobial drug efficacy [16,17].

Xylene, an aliphatic group of aromatic compounds, is an aliphatic group of aromatic compounds and is a component of the triterpene glycosides [18,19]. Xylene is used as an aliphatic group of aromatic compounds and is one of the essential aromatic compounds in the carmineo-bacterial and bovine skin microbiome [20]. Xylene is a non-alkylated, heterocyclic molecule and a part of the triterpene glycosides, and is present in the triterpene glycosides. Xylene is a xenobiotic substituted colorless derivative of glucose and is responsible for the acne-related skin condition. Xylene was reported to inhibit growth of acne-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi [21].

In the present study, Xylene was used to stain, stain stain stain test (ST) and bioanalyze the bacterial and fungal bioactivity.


## Methods
Briefly, peptides were prepared by an overnight homogenization step with 6 M urea and 20 mM of 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumaric aci. The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and the pH of the peptides was adjusted to 8. The mixture was used for the reverse phase reversed phase HPLC using a Shimadzu LC-10AD-A (Dalian, China) equipped with an Aminex HPX-8701 column (Phenomenex, Kyoto, Japan) and an E-400 HPLC column (250 mm × 2.6 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The peptide concentrations were calculated using the standard curve method and the LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using the software XDS v. 4.0 (XDS Pro, London, UK) with peptide mass tolerance set to 20 ppm. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for acetonitrile and 10 ppm for H_2O. The chromatogram was performed with the following settings: run time 0.2 min, temperature between 150 and 250 °C, and injection volume of 200 µL.

Data analysis was performed using the software Artemis v. 1.4.3 (Wang et al., 2016). The peptides were identified with respect to their carbohydrate content, protein mass tolerance, and their ion content. The peptides were kept in constant refractive index (RI) at their most intense atomic units (AU) of 25. The peptide ion concentration in the sample was determined with the standard method. The ions were identified using the online database of nonredundant sequence data of Proteome Discoverer (http://www.physics.org/proteome/proteomediscoverer) in the Protein Data Bank. The data were processed with the online programs iNtut (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the analysis was performed using the online program MassLynx (http://www.masslinux.org/) in the Protein Data Bank.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The phylogenetic tree of the proteins from this study was generated using the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA v. 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2013).


## Results
The surfactant preparations were labeled with fluorochrome (2D) (Figure 3) as well as with the PDB-fluorescent fluorochrom. The fluorochrome labels were supplemented with 2-2.5 µM of acetylated surfactant (pH 7.5) to inhibit Acid-specific lysine (Xylaudia) formation. The lysine labeling was then performed using an efficient inducible c-Hexene lipo-oxidase (CPX) (3.0). The inhibition was accomplished by the addition of a 3.0 mM p-nitrophenyl ester (pNON) to the surfactant preparation. The addition of a 3.0 mM p-nitrophenyl ester (pNON) to the surfactant preparation caused the release of the acridine moiety at a concentration of 1.8 µg/ml (Figure 3).

Acid-Directed Dyes with FK506 were used for the identification of the surfactant preparation. The fluorochrome labeled with fluorochrome (2D) was supplemented with 2-2.5 µM of pNON to neutralize Acid-specific lysine (Xylaudia) formation, and the fluorochrome labeling was performed using an efficient inducible c-Hexene lipo-oxidase (CPX). The reaction was performed using a 96-well plate for the co-crystallization of acylated and acidified surfactant. The acridine moiety was then added at a concentration of 1.8 µg/ml to neutralize Acid-specific lysine (Xylaudia) formation. The neutralization was accomplished by adding 2.5 µg/ml of pNON to the surfactant preparation.

Results of Antifungal Activity of Dyes with pNON and 2D Labeling
The antifungal activity of the surfactant preparation with 2D labelling of Acid-specific lysine was investigated using the in vitro antifungal assay.


## Discussion
We found that the COOH-dominant Acids could be distinguished by using a synthetic three-dimensional structure (Fig 2A. Using a sequence of ~10 amino acids, a length of 3.5 Å was identified for the COOH-dominant Acids.

The acyltransferase enzyme acetyltransferase is involved in the degradation of acyl chains of acetyl alcohols in the cell wall, cell wall chitin and other cell wall components (Hou et al., 2017). In addition to the acetyl transferase (AT2) enzyme, AcB1 was also identified as a potential COOH-dominant Acid in the present study. The enzyme is a heme-reducing enzyme that converts acetylated H_2O_2 to acetyl-methyl-ß-D-glucoside (Mg^2+) by the COOH-dominant Acid. The Mg^2+ can be converted to acetyl-methyl-ß-D-glucoside (Mg^2+) by the AcB1 enzyme in acetyl-ketoacetate (AGTA) conversion (Hou et al., 2013). The three-dimensional structure of the AcB1 enzyme was observed to be different in the three Acids. The specific activity of AcB1 was found to be 39.6 U/mg in the presence of 2, 2-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetra-ß-D-glucopyranoside (Mg^2+/H_2O_2) in the presence of ethanol (Fig 2A). The activity was decreased by 1.8 U/mg (Fig 2B). The Mg^2+-AT1 and Mg^2+-AT2 activities of the Mg^2+-AT1 enzyme were found to be 20.2 and 22.0 U/mg, respectively (Fig 2C). The Mg^2+-AT2 activity of the Mg^2+-AT1 enzyme was found to be 5.8 U/mg (Fig 2D).
