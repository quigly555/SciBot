## Abstract
Nosocomial invasive infections (IIS) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of different brands and/or routes of administration of flucytosine (FLX), posaconazole (POS), and apigenin (APN), as well as other drugs, to the human neutrophil and haemagglutin-neutin profile in order to determine the safety and efficacy of combinations with antiretroviral therapy. For this, the primary endpoints were the clinical and demographic data of patients with invasive infections. Combination of the two drugs was statistically significant in 83% of cases and significantly increased the overall prevalence of invasive candidiasis (P = .02). For APN, the combination of POS and FLX was more effective than the single drug, APN in 95% of cases and a statistically significant increase in the overall prevalence of candidiasis (P = .02).


## Introduction
Eukaryotic organisms are evolutionarily distant from one another, and thus can be regarded as distinct “groups” that evolved independently.


## Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown on PDA and incubated at 30°C in a shaker incubator.

DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was isolated from fungal mycelium grown in PDA at 30°C for 24 h. The DNA sample was then extracted by using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA).


## Results
These compounds were added into the lungs of mice at the 1-day time point in the rabbits (Table 1) and mice were then challenged with 10 µL of the selected azoles in the same manner as described in the section abov. Lung sections were performed to assess the degree of fungal infection (Figure 1). The lungs of the mice infected with 10 µL of the azoles in the following days were harvested and the fungal burdens were compared with the control fungal burden in the lungs of mice. As shown in Figure 1, the lungs of mice infected with 10 µL of the selected drug had a higher fungal burden than those of mice infected with PBS or PBS alone. These results suggest that the PBS or PBS alone had a better effect than the PBS alone. To further evaluate the effect of the selected azoles on the lungs, lung sections were performed at day 2 and 2 post challenge. The lungs of mice infected with 10 µL of the selected azoles showed a significantly reduced fungal burden than those of mice infected with PBS or PBS alone at day 2 (Figure 2). These results indicate that the azole compounds were able to promote the growth of the Vascular Carcinoma of mice.

Vascular Carcinoma of Mice Infected with Pneumonia Drugs or Mice with Fungal Infection
To evaluate the effect of the selected azoles on the lungs of mice with pneumonemia infection, bronchoscopic imaging was performed to evaluate the pulmonary fungal burden by DAPI. The bronchoscopic sections were performed after 24 h of infection. The results showed that the lungs of mice infected with Pneumonia-2.5 or Pneumonia-3.5 showed significantly higher fungal burdens than those of mice infected with PBS or PBS alone at the 1-day time point. These results suggest that the selected azoles were able to promote the growth of the lung infection.

Effect of Azole Drugs on the Microscopic Development of the Lungs
The effects of the selected azole drugs on the lungs of mice were evaluated by microscopic imaging. The lungs were harvested and the fungal burdens were compared with the control fungal burdens in the lungs of mice infected with Pneumonia-2.5 or Pneumonia-3.5.


## Discussion
However, after 3 days of VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phagocytosis, these two cell types became highly expressed and expressed at very high levels at the VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phas. Figure 2A,B shows that these two cells were present in the blood at the time of VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phagocytosis (3 days). It is worth noting that the expression of VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 and VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 at the VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phase was only slightly higher than that at the time of VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phagocytosis (4 days). It is important to note that these two cell types were only slightly activated during the early stages of the phagocytosis process. This suggests that VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 and VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 might be more activated during the early stages of phagocytosis by phagocytosis by VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 and VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 cells.

Furthermore, this study found that VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 was significantly more activated by macrophages compared to the VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phase, which might be due to the increased release of VCLM-DCF1 from VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 cells. This might also be due to the increased production of VCLM-DCF1 during VCLM-DCF1-DCF1 phagocytosis. Previous studies also showed that VCLM-DCF1 is highly expressed in human lymphocytes during early stages of T-cell response [15]. We also observed that VCLM-DCF1 is highly expressed in human NK cells at the early stages of T-cell response [16].
