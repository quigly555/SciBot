## Abstract
Trichosporon asahii is the major pathogen that causes invasive trichosporonosis, a common lethal condition. The wide-spectrum clinical spectrum and low susceptibility to azoles and other antifungal drugs make T. asahii an attractive therapeutic target for future drug design. The current literature indicates that T. asahii exhibits a broad spectrum of toxicity, drug resistance, bioavailability, and resistance mechanisms. This review summarizes the mechanisms of toxicity, resistance, and bioavailability of T. asahii and offers perspectives to the future role of T. asahii therapy in topical drug design.


## Introduction
 2018. Although the mechanism of macrophage killing is not well understood, the in vitro killing assay using macrophages from C. albicans has been reported to be comparable to macrophage killing mediated by monocytes (Kim et al., 2018). Thus, the in vivo mechanism of macrophage killing may be more complex than macrophage killing.

Macrophages are important players in inflammation. Macrophages are involved in a number of important processes including the resolution of inflammation, the control of inflammation, and the activation of apoptotic cells (Perlin, 2016). Macrophage activation is a key process in cancer, as the activation of macrophages is associated with their pro-inflammatory activity. Macrophage activation is dependent on the type of macrophage, type of endothelial barrier, and macrophage population density. Macrophage activation has been implicated in the treatment of patients with cancer and other immuno-modulatory diseases, such as T2DM (Zhang et al., 2017). Macrophage activation has been associated with disease outcome, as patients with T2DM had higher blood levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Kim et al., 2018). The in vitro macrophage-directed killing assay using macrophage-derived extracts of C. albicans has shown that the macrophage-derived macrophage extracts caused the death of C. albicans in mice with a macrophage-associated systemic lupus erythematosus (Joffe et al., 2015).

Macrophage depletion is a common in vitro macrophage-targeting procedure used in clinical trials for the treatment of fungal infections (Kim et al., 2018). In this study, we tested the in vitro activity of the macrophage-directed killing assay using C. albicans from natural populations, and its in vitro activity was compared with those of standard macrophage-targeting assays. We observed that macrophage depletion is ineffective in the killing of C. albicans, but it is effective in reducing the frequency of relapse. However, macrophage depletion can cause macrophage death, which can be reversed by macrophage-derived apoptosis assays. The in vivo killing assay was performed using macrophage-derived macrophage extracts of C. albicans.


## Methods
The number of CFU per milliliter (ml/well) of BALB/c mice was determined from tissue culture supernatants and cell culture supernatants, respectivel. The cytotoxicity of T6-loaded macrophages in the presence of C. albicans was evaluated by the following assay (see Table 1): Cell density in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS was measured at the end of incubation, as previously described [17].

Infection of C. albicans cells with EVs
For the in vitro study, Candida albicans cells were cultured overnight in YPD at 30 °C with shaking at 180 rpm and then incubated with or without EVs at 37 °C for 24 h, and the number of CFU per milliliter of C. albicans cells was determined. The cytotoxicity of Candida albicans cells in the presence of C. albicans was evaluated by the following assay (see Table 1): Cell density in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS was measured at the end of incubation, as previously described [17].

C. albicans cell culture and inoculum preparation
C. albicans cells were cultured overnight in YPD at 30 °C with shaking at 180 rpm and then incubated with or without EVs at 37 °C for 24 h, and the number of CFU per milliliter of C. albicans cells was determined. The cytotoxicity of C. albicans cells in the presence of C. albicans was evaluated by the following assay (see Table 1): Cell density in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS was measured at the end of incubation, as previously described [17].

## Results
neoformans are comple. It has been shown that T6-loaded macrophages can be used as a model for antifungal drug development, and we were able to identify compounds that target T6-loaded macrophages. However, a novel inhibitor, azithromycin, showed poor antifungal activity against T6-loaded macrophages, which suggests that it may be an inhibitor of the T6-helical structure of the chitin synthase enzyme, a key enzyme in the synthesis of T6-loaded macrophages. The lack of activity of azithromycin is consistent with the failure to demonstrate antifungal activity in the mouse model.

Recently, we have shown that the inhibitory activity of azithromycin against C. neoformans was accompanied by an increase in the number of viable cells during infection of the mouse lung (Hokadze et al., 2018). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of the azithromycin against C. neoformans was further investigated. Following infection with the fungus, the number of viable C. neoformans cells was increased by 20% in the presence of azithromycin. The inhibitory effect of azithromycin on the number of viable C. neoformans cells was also measured after the fungal infection with the Candida cells. The inhibitory activity of azithromycin against C. neoformans was greatly increased after infection with C. neoformans. The number of viable C. neoformans cells was increased by 20% in the presence of azithromycin, while the inhibitory activity of azithromycin was only enhanced after infection with the Candida cells (Fig 2A). The findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of azithromycin may be due to the accumulation of the active drug molecules.

Antifungal activity of azithromycin against C. neoformans
The antifungal activity of azithromycin against C. neoformans was also determined. The MIC values of the azithromycin against C. neoformans were found to be 0.008 µg/ml and 0.01 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC of azithromycin against C. neoformans was 0.03 µg/ml, whereas the MIC of fluconazole against C. neoformans was 0.016 µg/ml.


## Discussion
by classical and T6-loaded macrophages respectivel.

To further explore the mechanism of macrophage toxicity, we used the whole-cells or in vitro-immunized macrophages in this study. In particular, T6-loaded macrophages were incubated in the presence of 5 µM EO for 4 hours and then transferred to LPS-MEC-stimulated macrophages in vitro.

Both macrophages (LPS-MEC-LPS-MEC-LPS-MEC-LPS) displayed significant differences in their cellular components, such as cell wall components, macromolecules, cytokines, and metabolites, indicating that the cell wall structure is a major determinant of their toxicity to the human macrophages (Fig 6).
