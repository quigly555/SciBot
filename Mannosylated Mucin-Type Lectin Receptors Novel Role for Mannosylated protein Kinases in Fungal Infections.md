## Abstract
Fungal infections are emerging as a major cause of mortality in patients with AIDS and solid organ failure, which undermines the value of early antifungal therapy and should be heavily discouraged in these patients. This study aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms of action of ten well-characterized antifungal drugs against C. gattii in vitro and in vivo.

Ten well-characterized antifungal drugs were tested against eight different strains of C. gattii. Proteomic assays were performed to identify the proteins most affected by the drugs, and the differences in protein abundance among strains were analyzed.

All tested drugs showed significant antifungal activity, with MICs ranging from 0.03 to 0.44 µg/ml. The majority of protein targets were not conserved between strains, and most proteins were conserved between parent and hybrids. Most protein targets showed a C-terminal H-aladmonial formation, a transient C-terminal swelling, a HOG elongation, a protein fold up of 1.4 fold, and a T-terminal HOG elongation. Immunocytochemical staining showed significantly different distributions of the isoforms in the groups tested, with the exception of the C-terminal HOG isoforms. In vitro, the proteomic profile did not change significantly from the groups tested, with the exception of a T-terminal HOG isoform.

The results from this study highlight the potential of each of the tested antifungal drugs against C. gattii, which is the first report to document this pathogen in a mammalian host.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased in the last years, being more common in immunocompromised patients (e.g., patients with diabetes, neutropenia, cancer, and organ transplant patients) [1-3]. While Candida albicans remains the most common fungal pathogen, it is becoming more common in the immunocompromised, including patients undergoing chemotherapy and other organ transplantations and patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [4-7]. In addition, it is also increasingly recognized in patients suffering from chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, who experience high mortality rates [8-11].


## Methods
Briefly, 5 µL of a stock solution of Mannosylated protein kinase (PkA) and Mucin-Type lectin (Mucin-Type lectin) were added to a 10 mL of a cell culture tube containing 50 µL of cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH .0, 50 mM MgCl_2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mL of 10% SDS and the precipitate was suspended in 1 mL of a 0.1% SDS. The precipitate was transferred to a 96-well plate and the optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The reaction mixture was diluted to the desired volume and the OD_600 was measured.

Cellulase (CP) activity
The pH stability of the obtained purified protein was assessed using a calibration curve consisting of 0.1 M potassium phosphate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPH) and 0.1 M NaCl. The assay was carried out in a 96-well plate. The pH stability of the purified protein was monitored by the absorbance at 600 nm (OD_600) after 3 h of incubation at 25°C. The assay was performed in a 96-well plate with a reference blank (0.1 M KPH). The assay was performed in a 96-well plate with a pH control (0.1 M KPH). The absorbance at 600 nm (OD_600) was measured every 3 min using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Quantification of GPI-anchored proteins
The GPI-anchored proteins were analyzed by the immunoblot method. Briefly, 5 µL of a cell culture containing 10^6 cells were mixed with 0.3 µL of a cell suspension of the indicated protein.


## Results
We examined the . viscum genome sequence using the Bowtie server to identify homologs of the M. oryzae MMMV-2 gene that encode the catalytic domain for MßM, which has been shown to encode a highly conserved MMMV-2-like protein kinase (MßM) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [35]. We identified the MMMV-2-like protein kinase, MMMV-2-C (MMMV-2-C) that is necessary for MßM function in B. dermatitidis [36] and C. albicans [37, 38]. We identified the MMMV-2-C protein as a putative P. aeruginosa MßM homolog (PAAQA_1_1215). PAAQA_1_1215 is a heat-shock-like protein that is required for B. dermatitidis virulence in B6 and B. dendrobatidis [39]. We found that P. aeruginosa MMMV-2-C and MMMV-2-C share a similar protein kinase domain with the PAAQA_1_1215-like protein kinase (Figure 4). This domain appears to be present in P. aeruginosa MMMV-2-C (Figure 4).

Mammalian MMMV-2-C is Required for Stress Response and Neutrophil Signaling
MMMV-2-C is a distinct candidate for stress signaling because it is required for the regulation of several stress-responsive genes. MMMV-2-C is known to be involved in stress response, amino acid metabolism, and stress tolerance [40]. We examined whether MMMV-2-C regulates stress response, amino acid metabolism, and stress tolerance in M. oryzae. The response to a variety of stresses is regulated by many stress factors including the cell wall stress response and cellular stress response [41]. We found that MMMV-2-C is required for the stress response and amino acid metabolism in M. oryzae (Figure 5). We also found that MMMV-2-C is required for stress tolerance in M.


## Discussion
These biofilms were constructed using serum derived from healthy subject. In addition, we showed that biofilm formation is also dependent on the Mucinoma brucei and Mucinoma brucei biofilms. Furthermore, we identified the genes involved in Mucinoma brucei-biofilm formation, and we demonstrated that these genes are involved in the virulence of these two species. Mucinoma brucei is a baculovirus that causes the meningitis of the lungs, lymph nodes, and brain. The Baculovirus is a neurotropic virus that causes meningitis of the nervous system, which is caused by B. dermatitidis. It also causes bacteremia of the central nervous system. The Baculovirus penetrates through the skin and into the blood, causing meningitis of the spinal cord and brain. The Baculovirus is then transmitted to humans via the bloodstream through inhalation. Mucinoma cruzi is a baculovirus that causes meningitis of the lungs, meninges, and brain. The Baculovirus is also transmitted through the bloodstream, causing meningitis of the brain. The Baculovirus is then transmitted to the lung via the bloodstream.

We also analyzed the gene expression profiles of the Mucinoma brucei biofilm and the Mucinoma cruzi biofilm and found the genes encoding the Mucinoma brucei protein Kinase and the Mucinoma cruzi protease are involved in biofilm formation. Mucinoma brucei has a complex biofilm consisting of extracellular matrix, extracellular matrix, cell wall, and extracellular matrix proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). In the biofilm, a unique set of proteins is present that is induced by Mucinoma brucei, and the Mucinoma brucei biofilm is highly adherent to the phagocytic cells. However, the biofilm is also highly adherent to the phagocytic cells. This result is consistent with previous results from previous studies (Kazak et al., 2003; Leonardi et al., 2008; Hill and Jackson, 2009).
