## Abstract
Candida albicans is an opportunistic yeast that causes candidiasis, a leading cause of fungal meningitis. The antifungal efficacy of fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole is discussed. The antifungal efficacy of fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole against C. albicans was tested against four strains of C. albicans. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using two different fluconazole doses.


## Introduction
In the United States, Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of meningitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of cancer, and accounts for approximately 10% of all AIDS-associated deaths in the United States [2,3. The incidence of cryptococcosis varies by geographic region, and varies by year in Africa [4,5] and in the United States, Cryptococcus gattii is responsible for cryptococcal meningitis in otherwise healthy individuals in the Americas [6]. In the United States, Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of meningitis, and it is estimated that approximately 1 million cases of meningitis occur each year, resulting in 181,100 deaths [7].

The main antifungal agents used to treat cryptococcosis are amphotericin B (AmB), flucytosine (5FC), and the azoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) [8]. However, amphotericin B binds with flucytosine, which causes amphotericin B to be removed from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FIC) staining [9,10]. This leads to inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, thereby interfering with fungal pathogenesis [11]. This leads to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased susceptibility to infection by the host immune system [12].

Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal, which has a range of indications such as anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, anti-ulcerogenic, and anti-cancer properties [13]. However, the effect of amphotericin B has been limited by its wide spectrum of activity, low toxicity, and broad spectrum of activity against fungal species [14]. Amphotericin B is an inactive polyene, which is active against yeasts, filamentous fungi, and other organisms [15].


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/fasTA/). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.294-102 (Katoh and Standley 2014, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) and manually edited in Jalview v1.7 (http://www.jalview.org/) (Vilgalys and Hester 1990; Voglmayr et al. 2016).

Clustering and gene annotation
The FASTA file of NCBI was downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The FASTA file of NCBI was imported into Jalview v1.7 (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) to perform multi-locus gene annotation. The complete set of FASTA files and their corresponding annotation are available at the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI (SRA) database under accession number SRP01128.

All predicted protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.294-102 (Katoh and Standley 2014, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) and manually edited in Jalview v1.7 (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) to perform multi-locus gene annotation.

Phylogenetic analysis
The gene families in FASTA files were also predicted. The genes were aligned using MAFFT v7.294-102 (Katoh and Standley 2014, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) and manually edited in Jalview v1.7 (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) to perform multi-locus gene annotation.

The full-length gene family was then analyzed by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods. The best-fit substitution model was selected by the MEGA5 program (Tamura et al. 2013; Tamura et al. 2013).


## Results
neoformans H99 and H99
To identify the major promoter regions of . neoformans H99 and H99, we generated the H99-tagged version of the C. neoformans H99/H99 fusion strain as described in the Materials and Methods section. We then used the H99-tagged version of C. neoformans H99/H99 fusion strain to perform a population genetic analysis. A strain with the H99-H99/H99 fusion strain (CNAG_04085) was generated by PCR amplification with primers specific for H99-specific promoters and PCR amplification with primers specific for H99-specific regions (Table 1).

For the analysis of the C. neoformans H99 H99 promoter region, a total of 11,854,623 bp of the C. neoformans H99 promoter region were successfully amplified (Table 1). The data were then used to perform the population genetic analysis using the DESeq2 analysis tool. An analysis of the H99 H99 promoter region revealed that a total of 1,836,639 bp of the C. neoformans H99 promoter region was successfully amplified. The data were then used to perform the population genetic analysis using the DESeq2 analysis tool. The results showed that the H99 H99 promoter region was enriched in genes encoding protein-protein interactions (pfam00275) and transcription factors (pfam01800) (Table 2). The results of the DESeq2 analysis tool showed that the H99 H99 promoter region was enriched in genes encoding transcription factors and transcription factors. The results of the H99 H99 promoter region were also confirmed by Northern blotting (data not shown).

The H99 H99 promoter region is highly conserved among pathogenic and pathogenic yeast
To determine the conservation of the H99 H99 H99 promoter region among yeast species, we constructed an H99-H99-H99 fusion strain. The H99-H99-H99 strain was generated by PCR amplification with primers specific for H99-specific promoters and PCR amplification with primers specific for H99-specific regions (Table 1). The H99 H99-H99/H99 strain was then used in a population genetic analysis of the H99 H99 H99/H99 population by DESeq2 analysis tool.


## Discussion
In addition to the sequence-based genotyping, the six isolates were also designed to be genetically diverse, .e., to be able to adapt to different ecological niches and environmental conditions. The unique isolates in this study, including the highly fertile leafy pathogen, the highly fertile leafy pathogen, and the fertile leafy pathogen, were also used to develop the sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the seven species and three phylogenetic clusters of the two fungi.

The ITS region was the predominant group in the whole fungus group of Fusarium species, and the ITS2 and LSU regions were the predominant groups in the two fungi. ITS2 and LSU are the main markers for pathogenic fungi, and are highly conserved in different fungal species, but are not always present in closely related species, which makes them difficult to identify with other species-based species identification methods. In addition, the ITS regions are also the main markers for fungi, and may not be the most appropriate marker for fungal pathogens. In this study, we aimed to develop a high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, high-throughput, and high-throughput fungal isolates from South Korea. To this end, we used the seven fungal isolates in this study, and we also compared the six species and three phylogenetic clusters of the two fungi. Although these isolates were designed to be genotypically diverse, they were also designed to be highly resistant to various environmental conditions and to be able to adapt to different ecological niches and environmental conditions. For example, we used five isolates to genotype two non-fungal protists (C. merolae and C. subsp. albidus) and four isolates to genotype C. albidus.
