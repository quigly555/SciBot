## Abstract
Fungi are known to utilize some of the most ancient protein-degrading enzymes and elaborate mechanisms of protein degradation to maintain a tight protein balance. However, the protein family of the mycotoxin-producing fungi has remained largely unexplored in the last decade. In this study, we identified and characterized a new class of Fungal Enzymes, the (2<U+2192>)-ß-proteinases. These enzymes are similar to the classically and alternatively activated Fungal Enzymes of interest, the (6<U+2192>)-ß-amylase, the (6<U+2192>)-anAcylase, the (6<U+2192>)-ß-amylopyranose mutase, and the (6<U+2192>)-ß-glucosaminidase.


## Introduction
Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common fungal disease that is often associated with an inadequate immune system, especially in immunocompromised patients. It is commonly found in those with severely impaired immune systems and is commonly caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) [1]. Patients with OC are commonly ill with recurrent infections in the form of recurrent infections (RIs). In spite of their high prevalence, the management of this disease remains challenging, and the outcome is often fatal if untreated. However, few studies exist concerning the antifungal activity of topical antifungal agents, and the antifungal mechanism of action of topical corticosteroids remains unclear.

Candida albicans is a gram-negative, ubiquitous, and ubiquitous yeast, that can colonize the skin and mucous membranes and cause various superficial infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, septicemia, and otitis media. The ability to switch between different morphologies has been observed in the yeast to the non-yeast form. This switch is associated with a wide range of physiological and pathological effects, such as increased production of hydrolytic enzymes, hypoglycemia, and tissue damage [2]. In addition, the yeast can form biofilms on medical devices, which can facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the antifungal activity of topical corticosteroids and their ocular formulations against C. albicans. Oral corticosteroids and topical antifungal agents were used as the main antifungal agents, respectively, against C. albicans. We also evaluated the use of ophthalmic formulations for the treatment of patients with recurrent infections and urinary tract infections.


## Methods
Sample collection and isolation of filamentous fungi
In order to evaluate the potential influence of soil microorganism on the activity of the microbial growth system, we have collected and isolated an average of 100 fungal mycelial plugs of different subcultures in the field of one of the five major plant-fungal symbiotic zones in the region of Elve (Thailand) in the southern Thailand. The fungi were isolated from the moist soil surface of the active zones of the four zones of Elve, namely The First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh zones of the Elve forest in the southern Thailand.


## Results
 n. 1809, in Fr. Fr. & Savulescu, Mycologia (Paris): 197, 1876).

Strain: B. cinerea (Fr.Fr.) Deighton, Mycologia (Paris): 197, 1876.

Materials examined: France, Mais, near Lesterna, on dead branch of Quercus sp. (Pseudopestalotiopsis), unknown collector, Dec. 1876, culture CBS 249.76. - Germany, Bavaria, Bavendorf, on bark of Quercus sp., 29 Jan. 1998, G. Schubert (holotype of P. cinerea, designated in Braun (1998) as MBT376541, culture ex-holotype CBS 248.97 = PD 82/924).

Notes: Pestalotiopsis cinerea (clade 16; Fig 3) is a well-known species from Europe. It was reported from the eastern Germany on Quercus sp. as a species of the Castanea, Quercus clade (a clade that is identical to P. cinerea) (Bruker et al. 1997). Pestalotiopsis cinerea is morphologically very similar to P. rufipogonensis (clade 15; Fig 3), which was isolated from Quercus sp. (Fig 2). The conidia are somewhat smaller than the sterile sterile sterile sterile sterile varieties, but they are not distinguishable from P. rufipogonensis.

Pestalotiopsis rufipogonensis Braun, C.P.M. Brünn & R.G. Shivas, sp. nov. MycoBank MB823763. Fig 14.

Etymology: Name derived from the rufipogonensis host.

Sexual morph: Pseudostromata not observed. Mycelium consisting of septate, branched, brown, smooth, 2-3 µm wide hyphae. Conidiophores in the upper cells of the conidiophores emerging from the upper cells of the upper cell, or in the conidiophores emerging from the inner cells of the conidiophores, solitary, erect, straight to slightly curved, unbranched, 5-10(-13) × 2-3(-3.


## Discussion

In the early stages of rum fermentation, the first of many steps in the fermentation process are catalyzed by the glycolysis pathwa. The glycolysis pathway consists of four enzymes: chitin synthase (Cys16-cys20) and an acid phosphatase (Cys21-cys23) which are involved in the glycolysis from l-propyl-3-methylglutarate to the aconitase (Cys24-cys27) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Cys28-cys31) which is involved in the glycolysis from l-propyl-3-methylglutarate to the aconitase (Cys28-cys31) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Cys29-cys3) which is involved in the glycolysis from l-propyl-3-methylglutarate to the aconitase (Cys29-cys3) (Fig 3). The glycolysis pathway is also catalyzed by the glycolysis and the first step in the glycolysis is pyruvic acid dehydrogenase (Cys20-cys20) which is involved in the glycolysis from l-propyl-3-methylglutarate to the aconitase (Cys24-cys27) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Cys27-cys28) which is involved in the glycolysis from l-propyl-3-methylglutarate to the aconitase (Cys28-cys31) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Cys29-cys3) (Fig 3). The production of this sugar is essential to the production of several alcoholic alcohols including beer (0.2 g/L) and wine (0.2 g/L) (Fig 4).

In the early stages of fermentation, the ability of the fermentation process to degrade sugar was determined by the ability of the fermentation process to prepare and secrete maltose and its derivative, maltose-4-methylglutarate (MGG-4-methylglutarate) from maltose-2-mono-3-ethylene (MGG-2-methylglutarate) in yeast culture in the presence of glucose.
