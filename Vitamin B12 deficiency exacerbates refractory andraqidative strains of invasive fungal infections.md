## Abstract
The genetic diversity of Candida was analyzed using 454 hybridization assays between strains of Candida albicans (CA11) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AF293), a species with a high level of genetic diversity, based on 160 public genomes of CA11 and AF293. The genetic diversity of C. albicans was characterized by 16S and 18S rRNA genes, while the genetic variation among CA11 and AF293 was greater than that of both Candida species. Analyses of the genetic variation between the strains showed that each strain of C. albicans has a unique mating type locus, and among strains of AF293, the MAT locus had the greatest genetic variation. The genetic variation among Candida strains was higher than that among strains of Candida glabrata and Candida lusitaniae, although the latter was highly polymorphic. Among the haploid strains, the MAT, CDR, and WY loci had an insignificant and positive correlation with mating type, while the H, G, and V loci had a strong negative correlation with mating type. The genetic variation among Candida strains was higher than that among Candida glabrata, but this was not statistically significant. Only the MAT, CDR, and WY loci had strong positive correlation with mating type. The genetic variation among Candida strains was significantly higher than that among Candida glabrata, but this was not statistically significant. In addition, the MAT, CDR, and WY loci had an insignificant correlation with virulence factor profiles. The genetic variation among Candida strains was significantly higher than that among Candida glabrata, and this was not statistically significant. This is the first study to analyse the genetic variation of Candida species and to show that mating type and genetic variation are independent in the virulence potential of C. albicans.


## Introduction
Eukaryotic cells have a unique cell surface and a unique architecture that allows for nutrient uptake and transport. This is a major advantage when compared to bacterial cells, since it allows the cells to more easily adapt to nutrient availability. Fungi have a unique cell wall, with the main components being chitin, glucans and tautomeric glycoconjugates. Chitin is synthesized by the cell wall enzyme glucosamine-binding proteins, which are known to interact with other proteins such as proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis, cellular energy transduction, and cell wall integrity (1). Chitin can be synthesized by many fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Ustilago maydis (2-4). The chitin is synthesized in the cell wall by the proteolytic enzymes chitin-binding proteins and chitinase-like proteins (C-litts) (5). The fungal cell wall is composed of multiple layers, including a rigid chitin layer, a core core chitin layer, and a chitosan layer. These cell wall components may be shed or degraded by fungal pathogens, and the chitosan can be degraded by bacteria or fungi to yield their own chitosan (6).


## Methods
There are currently no specific evidence of pre-infection of animals, and the prevalence of . sclerotiorum is increasing, as reported in our previous study [14]. For this reason, we designed and designed a pilot study to compare the antifungal resistance of S. sclerotiorum susceptible animals and non-susceptible animals in order to assess the effects of S. sclerotiorum on the survival of infected animals [10]. Animals were euthanized by CO_2 injection and the lung tissues were removed, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml sterile PBS by a sparging reflex using a sterile scalpel. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C and the pellets were washed twice with sterile PBS. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 µl of PBS and 1 µl of 2 mg/ml TET was added to each tube. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the supernatant was used for RNA extraction.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
RNA was extracted from S. sclerotiorum tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA concentration was measured using an automated microsclerotometer (SDS^TM; Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 0.5 µg RNA/µl, and RNA purity was evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The cDNA was synthesized using the iScript Reverse Transcription System (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed using an iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The qPCR results were normalized to the transcript levels of the tested gene in the mock-treated control. The two primers for S.


## Results
oryzae [12. Thus, the inability of the soluble protein to promote protection against IRIS is the most likely reason for the lack of protection in the absence of the soluble protein.

Additionally, since the high immunogenicity of the soluble protein as a protective factor in the absence of any other immunogenicity factor, we assessed the role of the soluble protein in the anti-fungal activity of TAP-treated cells. Inhibition of TAP-induced protection was shown to enhance the anti-fungal activity of TAP-treated TAP-treated cells (Figure 3B). Thus, the soluble protein is likely the main agent of protection against IRIS, and the soluble protein is the main mediator of the anti-fungal activity.

The soluble protein is required for TAP-induced immunity against M. organismus infections
To further understand the role of soluble protein in the protection against IRIS, we next analyzed the role of soluble protein in the induction of anti-fungal immunity in response to pulmonary fungal infection. For this, we exposed the pulmonary fungal cells to the TAP-treated TAP-treated cells, and the frequency of anti-fungal immunity was determined in the absence and presence of the soluble protein. In the presence of the soluble protein, the frequency of anti-fungal immunity was significantly higher in the absence of the soluble protein (Figure 4A). In contrast, the frequency of anti-fungal immunity was higher in the presence of the soluble protein in the presence of the soluble protein (Figure 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that the soluble protein is likely the major mediator of the anti-fungal immunity against pulmonary fungal infections.

Infection of A549 cells with the soluble protein induces anti-fungal immunity
In order to analyze the role of soluble protein in the induction of anti-fungal immunity in the presence of pulmonary fungal infection, we analyzed the frequency of anti-fungal immunity in the presence of the soluble protein. The frequency of anti-fungal immunity in the absence of soluble protein was significantly higher than in the presence of the soluble protein (Figure 5A). In contrast, the frequency of anti-fungal immunity in the presence of soluble protein was significantly higher in the presence of the soluble protein (Figure 5A).


## Discussion
In this study, we have focused on the components of the signaling cascade that have evolved during fungal infection.
