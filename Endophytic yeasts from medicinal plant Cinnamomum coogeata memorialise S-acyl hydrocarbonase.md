## Abstract
In the last decade, the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has become a global health issue, and the development of new antifungal agents is needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been a significant source of new leads in the search for new therapeutic agents against drug-resistant fungal pathogens.


## Introduction

Application of ethanol in vivo and in vitro was carried out at pH .2 and at 5 °C. After incubation for 15 min, the yeasts were grown at 20 °C using a Leica DMM-H18 medium (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Yeast growth was monitored using the time-of-flight broth dilution assay. The yeast growth was monitored using the serial dilution of colony-forming units (CFU) and the growth rates were compared in the presence of ethanol and ethanol alone (in this case). Growth was monitored by using the broth-pretreatment assay. The yeast growth was monitored by using the test plate using the broth-pretreatment (AF) medium. The growth was monitored by incubating the plates for 15 min at 25 °C for 10 min. Growth was monitored using the broth-pretreatment for 10 min. The test plate was removed and the plates were incubated overnight at 25 °C until growth was monitored. Growth was monitored by incubating the plates for 10 min at 25 °C for 10 min. The plate was removed and the plates were incubated overnight at 25 °C for 10 min. Growth was monitored by incubating the plates for 10 min at 25 °C for 10 min. The plate was removed and the plates incubated overnight at 25 °C for 10 min. Growth was monitored using the test plate incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. The plates were incubated overnight at 25 °C until growth was monitored. Growth was monitored using the test plate incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. Growth was monitored using the test plate incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. The test plate was removed and the plates incubated overnight at 25 °C until growth was monitored. The test plate was moved to a cooling cell and the plates incubated overnight at 25 °C were moved to the heat-off site. Growth was monitored using the test plate incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. The plate was moved to the heat-off site. The test plate was moved to the heat-off site and incubated for 15 min at high temperature. The results were analyzed by using qPCR, denoted as TAT (topographic area on TxDxE). Growth was monitored using the TxDxD method.


## Methods
. Geisler-Meyer et al., 2013) and the fungi were cultured at 37 °C in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) broth (2 % D-glucose, 1 % yeast extract, 2 % bactopeptone) with shaking at 180 rpm. The cells were harvested with a SpeedVac (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) and lysed with sterile water, the cell lysates were centrifuged (15 000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were used for the analysis of cell wall degradation, nuclear lysate was collected by centrifugation (15 000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were used for the analysis of non-cell wall degradation, lipid fraction was collected by centrifugation (15 000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the lipid fraction was used for the analysis of proteolytic activity.

TLC analysis
The lipid fraction obtained from the extracts of the yeasts was treated with TE, and the samples were separated in a 10 % SDS-PAGE (50 °C) using the Bio-Rad Coot Gel Extraction reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The bands were observed under UV light and the gel bands were purified with an EZ-Gel 3D Coomassie blue R-250 purification kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The mass spectrometry data were obtained by TLC with a solution of 1 % ethyl acetate in water, and the solvent was ethyl acetate (1:1 v:v:v). The data were searched against the database of the NIST 12.0 (NIST, 2002). The isolated compounds were identified based on the comparison of their retention times to the database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, NIST, 2002).

The lipid fractions were identified based on their spectral characteristics, and their retention time to the database was calculated using the Bio-Rad Coot Coomassie R-250 spectrometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).


## Results

S-acyl hydrocarbonases are important for the hydrolysis of polyketides and their synthesis is also important for the degradation of essential fatty acid. This was shown recently for Cinnamomum commune [34], which showed that the monoterpenoid 1-epoxy-d-xylopyranoside, in particular, has a high conversion rate to the second-tier monoterpenoid, pyranoside, which in turn is converted to p-hydroxy-d-xylopyranoside, which in turn is converted to terpenoid [35]. This was used to show that the polyketide synthase activity of the co-cultured co-culture is consistent with the conclusion that polyketide synthases are important for the hydrolysis of polyketides.

C. neoformans polyketide synthase activity is essential for the degradation of essential fatty acids
C. neoformans polyketide synthases are generated by two distinct enzymatic reactions, one involving the pyrimidine pathway and the other involving the pyrimidine pathway, as shown in Table 2. The pyrimidine pathway is responsible for the synthesis of polyketides, the pyrimidine precursors such as pyrimidine nucleotide phosphate (PNPP) and pyrimidine ammonia.


## Discussion
In addition to these chemotypes, yeasts belonging to different phyla and taxonomic groups have also been detected, and most of the yeasts with the most abundant monoterpenes in coogeata are assigned to yeasts belonging to the Oomycota phylotyp.

Microscopic examination of the coogeata revealed the presence of several filamentous yeasts with different patterns of size and shape. Smaller and narrower cells were observed in comparison to larger ones. Also the cells of the oomycetes were smaller and narrower in comparison to those of the yeasts belonging to the Saccharomycetaceae and the three Sordariales phylotypes. The maximum number of cells in the oomycetes was observed for the yeasts belonging to the Cladosporium, Saccharomycetales and the yeasts belonging to the Sordariales and Tremellomycetales phylotypes, which were all found in the coogeata.

The maximum number of cells was observed for the oomycetes of the yeasts belonging to the Pichia, Saccharomycetales and the yeasts belonging to the Cladosporium, Saccharomycetales, the C. militaris, and C. bombicola phylotypes, which were all found in the coogeata. These yeasts have been isolated from the coogeata, and the same species was isolated from coogeata coogeata and coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata. These yeasts are generally considered to be saprophytes, with a wide range of lifestyles and extreme tolerance to many environmental stresses. They have also been reported as a potential pathogen of citrus [26]. These yeasts are found in coogeata and are frequently found in the coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata coogeata. The yeasts belonging to the genera C. militaris, C.
