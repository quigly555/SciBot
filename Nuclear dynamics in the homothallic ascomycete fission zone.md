## Abstract
Patients with organ transplant kidney disease are at high risk of infection and toxicity from infections caused by members of the immunosuppressive class, including opportunistic pathogens such as the yeast-like species Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The immunosuppressive and opportunistic infections are becoming commonplace in these patients. The main driver for these complications is immune activation, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. The immunosuppressive and opportunistic mechanisms are poorly understood. We have investigated the effect of a C. albicans strain isolated from a kidney transplant recipient on a mouse model of infection. The strain changed from a commensal yeast to an infection-related neurotropic human infection strain with a specific antigen, and we show that the switch from the neurotropic strain to the infection-related strain is dose-dependent. The addition of exogenous cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) suppressed the growth of the fungus in the infected kidney. The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after the kidney transplantation was a result of a defect in the expression of the antifungal glycolipid antigens by the kidneys of mice infected with the pathogen. The addition of antifungal drugs could alter the immunosuppressive and opportunistic activities of this fungus. This report is the first to demonstrate that a C. albicans strain of a mouse model of infection has distinct immune responses and a specific antigen, and it reveals how the immune response is directed to different cell populations.


## Introduction
The zygomycete fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two mating type loci, MAT1 and MAT2, which encode homologues for the genes encoding the alternative mating type (AT) gene. The MAT1/MAT2 genes are expressed at high levels in the cell nucleus and in the yeast cell wall, while the MAT2 gene encodes a protein that is required for sporulation [7].

The MAT genes are essential for growth in the mycelial phase. In asexual development, MAT1 and MAT2 cells form basidia [8], [9] and sporulation occurs only in the cell wall. Upon reaching the end of the cell, basidiospores grow on the surface and form hyphae [10], [11]. The switch to the yeast cell wall architecture has been linked to the spore production and sporulation process [12], [13]. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the cell wall architecture and sporulation during the yeast-mycelial switch.

The first analyses of the mycelial phase in S. pombe have been performed using fluorescent marker markers for the two basidiospores [14], [15], [16]. These studies indicated that in some basidiospores the MAT locus encodes the genes encoding the MAT genes, while in others, only the MAT locus was present [14], [15]. However, the function of the MAT locus in regulating the yeast-mycelial switch has not been clearly established.

In this study, we generated the MAT locus in the ascomycetous fission yeast, S. pombe. S. pombe has two mating type alleles, MATa and MATa. In the MAT1 allele, the MAT1 gene encodes the genes for the alternative mating type (A/B/C) and alternative nucleotide sequences (A/B/D, and B/D, etc.), while the MAT2 gene encodes the genes for the alternative nucleotide sequences (A/B/C, A/B/D, and B/D). This gene, known as MAT2-1, encodes two genes, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, which are unique to MAT1-1.


## Methods
.

Western blot analysis
The collected yeast cells (10^6) were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20, and the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a Typhoon NanoVue SepaMini membrane (GE Healthcare) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (clone H_3BO_3; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a dilution of 1:400 in TBST buffer, and then Alexa 647 anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (clone ab81; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a dilution of 1:200 in TBST buffer. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 10 min at room temperature, then developed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera and a Zeiss LSM Zen software (version 2.0). The images were processed with Image J 1.51 software (Schneider et al., 2012).

Protein immunoblot analysis
The purified recombinant (wt) and total protein fractions of A. nidulans were fractioned using the Bio-Rad Protein Identification System and the protein immunoblotting tool (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, United States) and quantified using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Mason and Etherton, 1989). The GST-A. nidulans monoclonal antibody was used as the immunoblotting standard, and the protein bands were detected with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The GST-A. nidulans antibody was obtained from the Protein Development Service of the University of Maryland (Frederick, MD, United States) and was diluted to 1:1000 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the antibody for 2 h at room temperature.


## Results
However, in the ascomycete fungal genome, the number of fungal nuclear division units (PDUs) was relatively high (Figure 4A. Thus, the nuclear division unit number in the ascomycete ascomycete fungal genome was much lower than in the basidiomycete ascomycete fungal genome. Thus, the fungal nuclear division units in the basidiomycete ascomycete fungal genome were much lower than in the ascomycete fungal genome.

To further investigate the relationship between fungal nuclear division units and fungal nuclear functions, we analyzed the relationship between the nuclear functions of the fungal and fungal nuclear envelope. The fungal nuclear envelope (NMD) consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a hygromycin-conjugated membrane, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4B). The nuclear envelope consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule. The NUP consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule. The NUP consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule. The NUP consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule. The NUP consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule. The NUP consists of a polysaccharide capsule, a C-terminal histidine signal peptide, a putative nuclear envelope (NUP) and a polysaccharide capsule.


## Discussion
These results provide new insights into the nature of nuclear dynamics in this basidiomycet.

The basidiomycete Ustilago maydis has a nuclear transcriptional machinery that is specifically activated by cell wall stress
In addition to the cell wall-related mechanisms, our data demonstrate that transcriptional responses to cell wall stressors in Ustilago maydis are primarily mediated by cell wall-dependent pathways. Our results also suggest that the cell wall stressors are influenced by the cell cycle. The basidiomycete Ustilago has a cell wall-regulated response to cell wall-protective signals, such as cell wall-insensitive proteins, and also a cell wall-dependent response to cell wall-degrading enzymes, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes (e.g., ß-glucan synthase and ß-1,3 glucanase) [44]. In Ustilago, we identified cell wall-protective genes in the cell wall-degrading enzymes and cell wall-degrading enzymes genes, which could reflect their roles in the cell wall remodeling pathway. The cell wall-protective gene-deficient mutant did not show any changes in virulence in C. neoformans, and the cell wall-protective gene-deficient mutant did not show any changes in pathogenicity in the murine inhalation model [15].

Here, we showed that the cell wall-protective gene-deficient mutant did not have any impact on virulence in C. neoformans. This result indicates that the cell wall-protective genes, not the cell wall-degrading enzymes, are the major cell wall-protective pathways in Ustilago maydis. We found that cell wall-protective genes in Ustilago have a role in protecting the fungus against cell wall stress. This result suggests that the cell wall-protective genes are involved in protecting the fungus against cell wall stress.
