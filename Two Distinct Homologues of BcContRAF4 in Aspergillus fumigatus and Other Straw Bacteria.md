## Abstract
Anti-DTH2-induced gastric cancer (AD) is the most common benign tumor in Adjunct Episodes (AED) of patients with idiopathic CD4+ T-cell deficiency (IDLD) (Table 1). Though idiopathic IDLD usually presents with idiopathic symptoms and/or a chemotherapy regimen, anti-CD4+ T-cell autoantibodies are the major variable in IDLD patients, and although AD patients are much more aggressive than their IDLD counterparts, anti-CD4+ T-cells are usually found in the tumors (Table 2). A tumor is Born to Treat This Disease (BFTD) in IDLD patients, but rather than treat the tumor, they are often used as a last line of treatment (Table 3). The anti-CD4 autoantibodies that we described earlier are essentially harmless, although their cytotoxicity is very low. In fact, most anti-CD4 autoantibodies we examined are anti-Plasmodium virulence factors. In AD patients, the only difference between them is in the development of diarrhea and in the formation of bilirubin drool associated with the formation of splenodome. In contrast, the anti-CD4 autoantibodies listed in Table 4 are anti-Plasmodium virulence factors. In addition, the anti-CD4 autoantibodies listed in Table 5 are anti-Plasmodium virulence factors.


## Introduction
 2012; Fernandez et a., 2015; Sui et al., 2017). However, the knowledge of the function of the BcContRAF4, its role in the host-parasite interaction, and its relationship with the fungal BcSOD1/BcSOD2, a bac-binding protein, remain unknown.

The BcContRAF4 is a GPI-anchored protein consisting of a 2-3-ß-glucan core and a serine-rich loop, and was shown to be necessary for binding of microorganisms and other intracellular organelles (Huang et al., 2010; Molnár et al., 2011; Zang et al., 2014). The BcContRAF4 is a heterodimer of two different molecular weights, T_a and T_ß, and has been implicated in many processes that affect the balance of nutrient acquisition and metabolism, including cell death (Molnár et al., 2011; Bálint et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2010; Sui et al., 2017), signaling (Zhang et al., 2014; Fernandez et al., 2015), and immune defense (Yang et al., 2017). Previous studies have demonstrated that BcContRAF4 is essential for its function and that it regulates BcSCORP1, BcSCORP2, and BcSCORP3 functions (Sui et al., 2017). In addition, the BcContRAF4 is also essential for its function and for its effector functions (Zhang et al., 2014). However, the role of BcSCORP1 and BcSCORP2 in the host-parasite interaction, and the role of BcSCORP1 and BcSCORP2 in the response to BcSCORP1 and BcSCORP2, respectively, are unknown.

The BcSCORP1 and BcSCORP2 are part of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a heterogeneous group of bacteria and fungi that primarily affect immunocompromised patients.


## Methods
. Further, phylogenetic trees were inferred with MEGA 7.0 [30] and tree species were then classified with a single classification. For the phylogenetic analyses, we used the best-fit model of evolution, the COG model, and the Bayesian classifier (BDBY, version 2.1.0; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2001). The tree species were represented by four subclades and the trees were represented as the median of all runs. All runs were averaged to generate the final dataset. For the BccontRAF4 homologues in Aspergillus niger, we used the best-fit model of evolution, the COG model, and the Bayesian classifier. All runs were run with two different models: the COG model and the Bayesian classifier. The run with the Bayesian classifier was run with the COG model in the form of the tree species and the Bayesian classifier in the form of the tree species. The runs were averaged to generate the final dataset. All runs were run with two different models. The best-fit model of evolution was the COG model.

## Results
In both Aspergillus species, the sequence of BcContRAF4 is highly conserved and homologous to the . fumigatus nucleotide exchange factor-2 (a-tubulin) sequence. In addition, the BLAST and KEGG pathway homologues of the A. fumigatus nucleotide exchange factor-2 (a-tubulin) have been identified in all three B. cinerea genomes. Interestingly, these homologues are also present in other members of the family Aspergillus, including the two other major basidiomycete fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus fumigatus and Aspergillus parasiticus) and the two other major basidiomycete bacteria (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus cephalosporidium). The BLAST and KEGG pathway homologues of the A. fumigatus nucleotide exchange factor-2 (a-tubulin) are located in the same 5' UTR region of BcContRAF4. The sequence of BcContRAF4 in A. fumigatus and other Straw bacteria is also highly conserved (Fig 1B and 2). In addition, the sequence of BcContRAF4 in Aspergillus parasiticus is located in the same 5' UTR region of BcContRAF4 (Fig 1B). The sequence of BcContRAF4 in A. fumigatus and other Straw bacteria is also highly conserved (Fig 1B and 2). These results suggest that the gene set of BcContRAF4 is conserved in all three B. cinerea genomes.

The BcContRAF4 Gene Set Is Highly Divergent and Is Highly Intact in Fungal Communities
To further characterize the BcContRAF4 gene set in Aspergillus, the bccnA gene was cloned from the promoter region of the promoter sequence of A. fumigatus bccnA (BcCnA) and transformed into the Aspergillus transformant F1.


## Discussion
fumigatus (Fig 4) (23. In this study, we show that the intracellular BcFc5-like homologous to the Rbf1-like BcFc5 is required for the maintenance of intracellular BcFc5 expression. Interestingly, the C. albicans DNA-binding domain of the BcFc5 homolog is also essential for the BcBcFc5-like BcBcFc5-like gene expression (Fig 4). However, we could not find any intracellular BcBcFc5-like gene under the restriction conditions, suggesting that the BcBcFc5-like gene is still necessary to maintain the intracellular BcFc5-like gene expression. Therefore, we tested the possibility that the BcBcFc5-like gene may be activated via BcCysFc3-like transcription factors or alternatively spliced by BcCysFc1-like transcription factor (PLCF3) (23). However, we could not find any BcCysFc3-like transcription factor in the control strain, suggesting that the function of BcCysFc3-like transcription factor is still conserved in other species. In addition, we found no evidence for BcCysFc3-like transcription factor in the genome of A. fumigatus, suggesting that the function of BcCysFc3-like transcription factor is still conserved in other species (23). However, we could not find any BcCysFc3-like transcription factor in the genome of A. fumigatus. Therefore, we performed an analysis of the BcBcFc5-like gene expression using the RNA-seq results from the a-A. fumigatus strain to determine whether the BcBcFc5-like gene was expressed in both the a and the b-A. fumigatus strains.
