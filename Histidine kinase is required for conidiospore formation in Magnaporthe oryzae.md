## Abstract
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil-borne fungi that reside in soils of all major plant and human plant species in all order of their known genus, Amanita. AMF are well-known as potent sources of antifungal drugs and herbicides. However, these fungi also form communities with other microorganisms, including soil microbes and the gut microbiota of swine and piglets, which have important ecological roles, including the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis. In this study, we examined the microbiome and diversity of 21 Fusarium isolates collected from eleven distinct sites throughout the northern New Zealand and one of each site from another four islands in the region, and we found that the microbiota was distinct and distinct from that of the soil-borne members of the same phyla. In contrast, the soil-borne fungi showed high diversity and richness, with at least one distinct fungal community. The fungal community of the soil-borne fungi differed from that of the soil-borne members of the same phyla, but there were notable shifts in the composition of the soil bacterial communities that were distinct from that of the soil-borne members of the same phyla.


## Introduction
The genus of Monilinia was first proposed by Hawksworth (1933) based on heroepidemiology, with a high degree of morphological diversity and seven accepted species (Hawksworth, 1936, Kwon-Chung, 1937, Crous et al., 1952, Crous, 1963, 1964, 1964, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1970, 1977, 1979, de Hoog et al., 1989, Dias et al., 1993, Crous et al., 1995, 1997, van Oosterhout et al., 1995, Spang-Zhang et al., 1998, Crous & Groenewald, 2001, 2002, 2006a, b, b, Chen et al., 2006, Hansen et al., 2007). It is now recognised that the genus Monilinia is polyphyletic and is morphologically diverse, as a result of phylogenetic species-specificity. Species in Monilinia are cosmopolitan, frequently occurring in disparate habitats, and commonly cause disease in both humans and animals (reviewed in Quaedvlieg et al. 2006, Crous et al., 2009, Crous & Groenewald, 2011). For example, Monilinia pirina was found to cause significant morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients in Africa (Zulu-Congolissia) and Southeast Asia (Nair et al., 2017).


## Methods
Inhibitor kinase activity is the most important parameter controlling conidia formation in this fungu. Inhibitor kinase is required for conidiospore formation in Magnaporthe oryzae.

S2 kinase assay
S2 kinase assay is based on the method of Beamer et al. [22] with slight modifications. The enzyme is required to produce the desired product from cysteine. A stock solution of S2 kinase was prepared in citrate buffer (pH 6.8) and added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 10 µl of the indicated substrate. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 10 min and then at 25°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of 5% formic acid and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader. The activity of the kinase was calculated as the amount of the enzyme required to produce the desired product from S2 kinase. The assay is performed in triplicate.

## Results
In contrast, In the presence of 2 µM FK506, we observed conidia that did not form conidiophores and that grew in the absence of FK506 (Fig 1B. This phenotype was also observed in a <U+0394>hph^- mutant of Magnaporthe oryzae (Fig 1B) [42]. The <U+0394>hph^- mutant exhibited similar phenotypes in growth, conidiation, and conidiophore formation as the <U+0394>hph^- and the <U+0394>hph^-/<U+0394>hph^-/<U+0394>hph^- strains (Fig 1B).


## Discussion
It has been reported that conidiospores are not produced by Magnaporthe oryzae but by Magnaporthe oryzae and related fungal species [32. The differences in conidiospore production and development between Magnaporthe oryzae and other fungi and filamentous fungi are discussed below.

Conidia are produced by Magnaporthe oryzae
The conidiophore is produced by Magnaporthe oryzae. It is a large cylindrical conidiophore with a septate upper body. The conidiogenous cells are dark brown, smooth, and mucoid with pale brown hyphae, and they have cystidioles and hyphal tips. The conidia are borne as filaments. In the basidiospore-forming phase, the conidia are non-vertebral and contain an entire wall composed of thickened and darkened chitin. Conidia germinate from the hyphae, but their conidiogenous cells do not germinate, and a conidiogenous locus is formed between the conidiogenous cells, and the conidiogenous locus is thickened. The shape of the conidiogenous cells is elliptical and unbranched, and the shape of the conidiogenous cells is elliptical and unbranched, and the thickness of the conidiogenous cells is about 50 µm. The hyphal tips are circular, tapering toward the apex, with the apex at the base. The hyphal cells are long, thin-walled, 2.5-4 µm wide, and have a simple septa. The conidiogenous cells are divided in four subsites. One subdomain is composed of a thinner layer of chitin and thickened with gray to yellowish black hairs, and the other two subdomains are composed of an inner layer of chitin and a thickened inner layer of chitin. The size of the conidia is about 10-13 µm. The conidiogenous cells are variable in shape, shape, and size. The size of the conidia is also variable. Conidia are fusiform, with long conidiophores, and have multilateral, short- and short-growing subdomains. Conidia are bivalve, with an overall length of about 10-15 µm, and have a hemispherical shape.
