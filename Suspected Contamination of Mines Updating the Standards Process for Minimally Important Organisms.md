## Introduction
In 2017, the International Society for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (ISE) also ratified the IUCN Convention on Biological Diversity, which “Strengthens the Convention on Biological Diversity”, which includes provisions for the establishment of biotechnological zones within the highly endangered coastal natural environment (Dew and Bromley, 2016. In 2018, the IUCN revised the criteria for inclusion of marine environments as “the primary habitat for marine organisms”, which was revised and incorporated into the Rio Grande Valley Marine Ecosystem Plan of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2017). However, these changes were not implemented before the start of the new year, so that in 2018 the study of the environmental impact of mines is still missing and the 2018 study of the impact of mines on biodiversity is still missing. In contrast, the 2017 study of the impact of mines on biodiversity in the Duchy of Dothideomycetes was started and completed, and resulted in the establishment of two marine protected areas in the Duchy of Suez and Suez Plateau. These two protected areas include the coastal zone of the Duchy of Suez and the coastal zone of the Suez Plateau, the Mediterranean basin. However, these two protected areas are not compared with the Zambrano protected areas (Zambrano protected area) and, as a consequence, there is still a lack of biodiversity in this protected area. The next two protected areas in the Zambrano region will be described in detail.

The biodiversity of the Zambrano protected areas was determined by the biodiversity of soil and rock samples collected from the coastal zone of Zambrano. The Zambrano protected areas are characterized by the presence of microorganisms that are able to live in the soil for long periods of time, such as microalgae and oomycetes, while the Zambrano protected areas are characterized by the presence of microorganisms that are able to grow and change over time in the soil.


## Methods
7-10. The mining safety issues reported by the IMS were obtained from data obtained from all of the countries surveyed (Table 1). We used the following gold standard: International Standards Institute (ISO) 7231 (gold standard), as well as the United States Geological Society for the Basidiomycota (USGS) standard. The IMS analysis was performed using the gold standard (gold standard) in the same way as the gold standard for other fungi. The use of different gold standards resulted in an increase in the number of valid results from 100 to 150 per country. However, the gold standard in China is not the gold standard in the United States and the gold standard in Japan is not the gold standard in Japan. We also measured the number of valid gold standard results in each country by the number of valid gold standard results in the corresponding country. The IMS analysis was performed with the gold standard in the same way as the gold standard in the United States.

Statistical Analysis
In order to evaluate the significance of the IMS, we performed multivariate analyses with multiple-agent control, multivariate analysis of variance, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The multivariate analysis was conducted using the GANSS software, version 4.0 (Caporaso et al., 2011) (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/stats/galleries/msa2/en/GANSS.html). For multivariate analysis, the following variables were analyzed: (i) time (t), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) country (i.e., total country); (iii) age (t), (vi), (vii), (vii), (vii), (vii), (vii), and (vii). The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the data between the three time points. The statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. The probability of occurrence of the observed compound was defined as the probability of occurrence for the observed compound and the probability of occurrence for the compound were the same. The probability of occurrence of the compound with a negative probability of occurrence was considered as the probability of occurrence.


## Results
The OS and FAME standards for petroleum-based chemicals have been revised, and a new protocol for OS and FAME standards for chemical substances used in the mines is proposed [28, 29. In addition, OS and FAME standards for the production of synthetic chemical compounds have been revised, and new OS and FAME standards for the production of hydrocarbons are proposed [30]. Finally, the OS and FAME standards for the production of saponins and flavonoids have been revised and an updated protocol for the production of hydrocarbons has been proposed [31].

The FAME standard for all plant materials used in the mines is the same as that for all the other metals used in the mines, except for the ETC for all the metals used in the mines [32]. The standard for the production of saponin was the same as that for all the other metals used in the mines, except for the ETC for all the metals used in the mines. The OS and FAME standards for all the plant materials used in the mines are the same as the standard for the production of saponin.

The OS and FAME standards for the production of organic chemicals and organic fertilizers are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines. The OS and FAME standards for the production of organic chemicals and organic fertilizers are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines. The OS and FAME standards for the production of sulfur compounds are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines. The OS and FAME standards for the production of sulfur compounds are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines.

The OS and FAME standards for all the plant materials used in the mines are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines. The OS and FAME standards for all the plant materials used in the mines are the same as those for the other metals used in the mines.

## Discussion
We present the first case of a patient with a cryptococcosis-like meningeal enhancement of the right arm of the right thigh and thigh joint, which was also seen in another patient with bilateral cryptococcosis, who was also receiving a daily dose of fluconazole. This case is part of the immunologic spectrum of cryptococcosis, and the patient has been treated with fluconazole for more than 7 years.

The most common presentation of cryptococcosis is cutaneous lesions with non-specific skin lesions. However, in patients with cryptococcosis, there are multiple presentations, including myositis, which is similar to the case in our patient, and the diagnosis is made by identification of cryptococcosis via skin biopsy. These patients are often mistaken for C. gattii, which is not true, because of the presence of Cryptococcus species in the environment. However, the patient had no history of exposure to bird droppings. The patient had a history of travel to other locations where Cryptococcus can be found. This patient had a history of travel to the United States.

The diagnosis of cryptococcosis requires culture and skin biopsy. However, in the case described here, the patient had only a history of exposure to bird droppings, and the lesions were not invasive.
