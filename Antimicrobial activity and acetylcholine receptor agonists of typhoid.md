## Abstract
HIV infection is becoming an increasingly common and increasing health problem in the developing world. HIV-1 infection is defined as HIV-1 RNA >1,000 copies/mL, a serum viral load >50/1000 copies/mL, and a viral-catalytic population of =1000 copies/mL. Patients with advanced HIV disease have been shown to rapidly develop immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). This immune reconstitution syndrome, in addition to being an AIDS defining event, can trigger excessive shedding of latent virus (CD virus) and potentially reactivation of latent virus (RLV) and subsequent reactivation of latent virus (RLV). The virus can also reactivate latent virus (RLV) in the brain. HIV-1 RNA is usually detectable in serum and in the spinal fluid of uninfected patients, while RLV has been rarely detected in urine. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with advanced HIV infection who developed an excessive rash and a rash-induced hemiparesis that rapidly resolved after antiretroviral therapy (ART). Her rash-induced rash-induced rash-licensositis and neurologic deficits rapidly improved after hematopoietic recovery and she had no relapses of latent virus or RLV. IRIS is a well-recognized complication of AIDS in developing countries. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is needed to avoid late emergence of RTV and of latent virus in brain and spinal fluid.

•HIV-infected patients with HIV-1 RNA >1,000 copies/mL, a viral load >50/1000 copies/mL, and a serum viral load >50/1000 copies/mL have IRIS: •Her rash-induced rash-licensositis and neurologic deficits rapidly improved after hematopoietic and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were under diagnosed disease.


## Introduction
Onychomycosis is a skin disease caused by dermatophytes, which can be caused by different species of dermatophytes, namely, dematiaceous molds, phaeohyphomycoses (dermatophytic dermatophytic mycoses), and keratitis (dermatophytic keratitis), which are caused by keratinolytic fungi (1). Dermatophytoses are a group of diseases caused by ocular mycoses, caused by different ocular pathogens: Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans (2, 3). The spectrum of these infections varies according to the dermatophytic species, the species of the genus, and the geographic area, and is not restricted to the Middle East and North Africa (4, 5). However, ocular dermatophytoses are common in temperate regions, especially in Turkey.

According to the 2011 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of dermatophytoses, the estimated prevalence of onychomycosis is 2.8% (6), which is higher than in the rest of the world (7). D. aureus is the most common fungus causing onychomycosis (8). The genus D. aureus is composed of numerous species, which cause onychomycosis in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Immunocompetent individuals are protected against the infection by the host innate immune system. In immunocompromised patients, the infection is usually cleared, and onychomycosis may be refractory to antifungal therapy, thus leaving the patient with onychomycosis. However, patients with chronic mucocutaneous onychomycosis are at risk of developing chronic mucocutaneous infections (9).


## Methods

The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibioti. In addition, the concentrations of the most active compounds and the most potent antibiotic compounds were also tested (S2 Table). The MICs of the tested agents were measured using the Microdilution Plate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) and the same dilutions of each antibiotic were tested at the same concentrations. The lowest concentration of the tested agent that caused complete inhibition of growth was considered as MIC_50 (100%). The lowest concentration of the tested compound that was synergistic was considered synergistic.

The MIC_50 values of the tested compounds were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The Student’s t-test was applied to compare differences in MICs between the tested classes.

Antifungal activity of a-cymbosylanthranol (CPC)
A-cymbosylanthranol (X3-CPC, V/V, 100 mg/ml) was prepared from 0.1-1 mg/ml. The stock solution of X-corroquimethine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The stock solution of R-propidiumobenzaldehyde (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

## Results
It is also possible that the stress imposed on yeast cells by the stress imposed on the yeast cells by the specific stress caused by the absence of the . aeruginosa yeasts would exert significant antifungal activity on those yeasts. In this respect, it is also possible that the stress imposed by the presence of the yeast cells of P. aeruginosa could exert significant antifungal activity. For instance, it has been reported that the addition of inhibitors such as amikacin, metronidazole, and piperacillin, which have antifungal activity, could increase the susceptibility of the fungus to a fungistatic agent [25,26]. In this sense, it was possible that the inhibition of the P. aeruginosa spp. by the inhibitors might be a result of the stress imposed by the P. aeruginosa yeasts on the yeast cells of P. aeruginosa. The antifungal activity of P. aeruginosa has been suggested to be due to the presence of pectin. This suggests that pectin is a target of the antifungal activity of P. aeruginosa.

Effect of P. aeruginosa-Saccharomyces cerevisiae Interactions on Fungal Cell Membrane Potential
The antifungal activity of P. aeruginosa yeasts against the fungal cell membrane has been reported previously [7], and in this sense, it is possible that the inhibition of P. aeruginosa yeasts by the stress imposed by the P. aeruginosa yeasts could cause the yeast cells to lose their ability to produce multinucleated giant cells. For this purpose, it was possible that the yeast cell membrane potential could be affected by the presence of the yeast cells of P. aeruginosa. To this end, the interaction between P. aeruginosa yeasts and yeast cells was investigated. In this sense, the antifungal activity of P. aeruginosa yeasts against the fungal cell membrane potential was also tested. In this sense, it was possible that the inhibition of P.

Amphotericin B is a potent agent that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Cryptococcus neoformans infections. The patient in this study developed a high dose AmB and he developed a severe inflammatory reaction. This patient presented with a severe inflammatory reaction which required extensive surgical intervention.
