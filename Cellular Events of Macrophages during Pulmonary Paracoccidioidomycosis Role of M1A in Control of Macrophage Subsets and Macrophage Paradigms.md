## Abstract
Current therapies for fungal infections, particularly Candida infections, are experiencing continued resistance and are likely to face increasing resistance-especially in the developing world. In Kenya, patients with advanced fungal infections are often referred to medical wards for induction therapy with Candida antagonists. We conducted a retrospective study to compare the clinical and laboratory features of patients admitted to medical wards with suspected fungal infection at the time of admission. We included patients who had undergone definitive antifungal therapy and were not previously treated. Patients were predominantly men, with a median age of 71 years (range, 20-79) and 68% were HIV-positive. All antifungal drugs were over-the-counter (OTC) and included flucytosine, azoles, and echinocandins. Baseline laboratory data were similar (IQR, 23-61). The most common treatment response was amphotericin B. Fifty-two patients (43.8%) had a failure-associated response. Other responders were represented equally well (27/50, 95.1%) and were less likely to fail- due to failure or comorbidity. The overall survival was 69.3% (44/44) after amphotericin B was started. This study highlights the need for early recognition of fungal resistance and early initiation of antifungal therapy for Candida infections in patients with advanced fungal infections. Early awareness of this emerging problem and early recognition of the offending fungal organism is crucial to successful treatment and, in a minority, as it may lead to inappropriate prophylaxis.


## Introduction
Ruminants are obligately adapted animals that live within the rhizosphere, which consists of the exopolymeric substance of the plant vascular network and its associated microorganisms. The rhizosphere is a highly developed habitat that is protected by a complex network of microbes, which are able to shape the site and the associated conditions, thus influencing the metabolic processes in rhizosphere soil. The rhizosphere and associated microorganisms have been extensively studied in several species of grasses, including Arabidopsis thaliana, and in several other grasses, such as soybean (Agrocyon stolonifera), rapeseed (Solanum lycopersicum), soybean (Glycine max), and sweet sorbitol (Bosantostilbene, Betula pendula). In grasses, the rhizosphere and associated microorganisms are mainly composed of bacteria, including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and other Firmicutes, and fungi, including the obligate intracellular bacterium Burkholderia, which are also capable of releasing secreted extracellular metabolites [1]. Burkholderia cepacia is a very common species and a significant and important plant pathogen in some countries of the world, including China, and can cause considerable economic losses. There are over a million different Burkholderia species and some species can infect humans, while others are more common in the environment, such as Burkholderia tropicalis and Burkholderia militaris, are responsible for diseases that can cause serious economic losses in Africa and Asia [2].

Burkholderia tropicalis and Burkholderia tropicalis are two important pathogen of maize [3] and can cause significant yield losses, as well as major losses in the domestic animals, such as cattle [4].


## Methods
To investigate the role of M1A in control of macrophage subclasses, the M1A-F-C complex was modeled on the M1A complex in viv. M1A-F-C complexes were modeled on the M1A-F-C complex in vitro. The percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages was calculated as the ratio of the percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages to the percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages. The percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages to the percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages was calculated as the ratio of the percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages to the percentage of M1A-C in control of macrophages.

## Results
avium infection, we next sought to identify putative M1A-mediated signaling pathways in macrophages during pulmonary infectio. To do this, we established a murine model of pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary infection. While the murine macrophage response to pulmonary infection was similar to that of M1A-infected mice, we found that M1A-infected mice had significantly fewer M1A-induced macrophages in their lungs compared to their WT controls (Fig 2E and F). In addition, we found that M1A-induced macrophages in M1A-infected M1A-infected mice had significantly fewer M1A-induced macrophage populations (Fig 2E and F). These data suggest that M1A-mediated signaling promotes the M1A-induced macrophage subset of macrophages during pulmonary infection.

M1A-mediated signaling enhances macrophage activation and induces T cell and inflammatory responses in macrophages
Since we found that M1A-induced M1A-induced macrophages are associated with increased levels of TCR, we next examined the contribution of M1A-mediated signaling to the TCR signaling in macrophages. We utilized a murine model of pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary infection and challenged mice with a variety of virulent, as well as non-virulent, fungal pathogens. We first tested the impact of M1A-mediated signaling on M1A-induced cytokine production in M1A-infected M1A-infected and WT M1A-infected mice. While M1A-infected and WT mice had similar levels of TCR in the lungs (Fig 2E), we found that M1A-induced TCR-dependent macrophage responses were much higher in the lungs of M1A-infected mice than in the WT controls (Fig 2E). These results suggest that M1A-mediated signaling promotes the M1A-induced macrophage subset of macrophages during pulmonary infection.

To further investigate whether M1A-induced cytokine production is associated with M1A-induced cytokine production, we generated M1A-transgenic C57BL/6 mice. M1A-infected and WT mice were sacrificed 5 d after infection, and M1A-infected and WT mice were sacrificed 2 d after infection.


## Discussion
IL-17 is produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells [25] and was a prominent cytokine in our stud. IL-17 and IL-23 are produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells and are expressed at high levels in macrophages [25]. IL-17 was found to be required for protection against fungal infection in a murine model [26]. This finding is in agreement with a previous report that demonstrated that the increased IL-17 production in the lungs of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis was associated with a reduced phagocytosis [27].

IL-17 was produced by macrophages in the lungs of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, as well as neutrophils, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells. IL-17 was also found to be critical for protection against pulmonary fungal infection [28]. IL-17 was found to be produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and dendritic cells. IL-17 was detected at higher levels in the lungs of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis compared to those with pulmonary tuberculosis [29]. In the present study, IL-17 and IL-23 were detected at the same levels in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis compared to patients with tuberculosis. The cytokine was also found to be elevated in the lungs of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis compared to those with tuberculosis [30].

IL-17 produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, IL-23 produced by monocytes and dendritic cells, and IL-17 produced by macrophages and dendritic cells were all significantly increased at the site of infection. IL-23 was also detected in the lungs of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis compared to those with pulmonary tuberculosis. The cytokine was also found to be increased in the lungs of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis compared to those with pulmonary tuberculosis [31]. IL-23 was present in the lungs of patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and was increased in the lungs of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
