## Abstract
Due to the complexity of the microbial ecology of the plant roots, this study has greatly increased the number of potential targets for plant protection. Some of the best-performing cellulose bioconfigurations have been obtained by short and short dibasic long-chain dibasides (LCD) with or without adsorption to the plant. However, these bioconfigurations have been found to have a number of disadvantages, including a lack of polydisulfide alternative carbon sources (e.g., phosphates and sulfates), a potential risk to the plant of the fungus from which the dibasic-long-chain-dibaside has been produced, and limited efficacy by the endo-inulinase inhibitor acetazolamide. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and synthesize a stable mutant library in order to explore the biocontrol potential of L. leucovorinum.

LCD-delivered cellulose-dibasic dibasic trioses of L. leucovorinum were isolated by electrophoresis and screened by the CLSI medium supplemented with 96-well microtiter plates. The gene expression of L. leucovorinum was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and the proteomic profiles were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results were expressed in eking probability, and the best-performing L. leucovorinum mutant was selected for further analysis.

This approach led to the identification of a stable and highly reproducible mutant library with a number of unexpected characteristics, including high stability, low gene density, low recombination rates, and an extended vesicular track, which might be useful for biocontrol of plant-endemic fungi. The multiplexed approach, which was well suited for growth under liquid nitrogen conditions, achieved the highest degree of stability and appeared to be a viable mutant library with high reproducible stability.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis primarily in immunocompromised hosts, particularly those with HIV/AIDS [1], [2]. Despite the fact that C.


## Methods
cerevisiae CFM 109 strai. A test of the possibility of a single-ceramide interaction was performed in the same way as the most potent ceramide analogue. The test was performed in a similar way as the control, but using ceramide as a standard. We followed the procedure set up by the S. cerevisiae CFM 109-3 cell line. The cells were cultured in medium containing ceramide (C. albicans) or in medium without ceramide (C. glabrata) and incubated at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with HBSS, and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/ml in the medium. The incubation time was 1 hour. After a further 5-hour incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with HBSS, and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/ml in the medium. The cells were stored at -80°C for further use.

Analysis of Biomass Concentrations
The concentration of ceramide in the suspensions of the cell line CFM 109-3 was determined with an HP-5ms spectrophotometer (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) at a wavelength of 540 nm using a refractometer (Shanghai-Shanghai Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). For the determination of the concentrations of ceramide, the following were added: 0.01% (v/v) ceramide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.01% (w/v) N-ethyl-L-cysteine (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), 0.05% (w/v) N-ethyl-N-l-cysteine (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), 0.1% (w/v) N-ethyl-N-l-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1% (w/v) N-ethyl-L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.


## Results
 2015. In order to elucidate the biosynthesis of ceramide, the two major component(s) of both ceramide and CPP were determined by the SC5314 genome project. The aim was to understand the possible biosynthetic pathways for both ceramide and CPP and whether the two different mechanisms might have contributed to the biosynthesis of the two major components of the two components of the biosynthetic pathway.

For each biosynthetic pathway, the proteins were analyzed by GC-MS and the specific spectra were generated for the three major components of each biosynthetic pathway using the BiRad MSX software (http://www.biolograd.org/). The results showed that for the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP, the main pathway was found to be the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP with a peak at m/z 350 (Figure 2). This may be due to the requirement of ceramide in the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP and the biosynthetic pathways for the production of both ceramide and CPP. However, for the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP, the main pathway was found to be the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP, and a peak at m/z 350 was observed in the spectra of the three major components of the biosynthetic pathway (Figure 2). This may be due to the requirement of ceramide and CPP in the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP.

To further elucidate the pathway involved in the biosynthesis of CPP, the two main components of the pathway were analyzed by GC-MS and the specific spectra were generated for the three major components of the biosynthetic pathway using the BiRad MSX software (http://www.biolograd.org/). The results showed that for the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP, the main pathway was found to be the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP. The peaks at m/z 350, m/z 400 and m/z 450 were found for the biosynthetic pathway of both ceramide and CPP. This may be due to the requirement of ceramide and CPP in the biosynthesis of both ceramide and CPP.


## Discussion
fumigatus biofilm in a dose-dependent manne. Inhibition of A. fumigatus growth by P6 increased the production of cellulase and hemicellulase, which has been previously reported in A. fumigatus in vivo [44]. Moreover, P6 significantly enhanced the expression of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm. The cellulase gene was a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cellulose, which is one of the major cellular components in the fungal cell wall. The hemicellulase gene was also a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cellulose, which is one of the major cell wall components in the fungal cell wall. Our results revealed that the production of cellulase and hemicellulase was significantly increased in the treated A. fumigatus cells at R6.

The protease activity of the P6 enzyme was previously reported to be higher than that of the R1-P3 enzyme in the treatment of A. fumigatus biofilm [45]. In this study, we confirmed the increase in the protease activity of the P6 enzyme in the treatment of A. fumigatus biofilm. We also showed that the addition of R6 to the treatment medium increased the expression of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm. In addition, the addition of R6 to the treatment medium increased the hemicellulase and cellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm. This increased expression of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes was also confirmed in A. fumigatus biofilm treated with P6. In addition, the addition of R6 to the treatment medium decreased the production of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm. In our previous study, it was reported that the addition of R6 to the treatment medium significantly increased the expression of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm [46]. This increased expression of the cellulase and hemicellulase genes in A. fumigatus biofilm was also confirmed in A.
