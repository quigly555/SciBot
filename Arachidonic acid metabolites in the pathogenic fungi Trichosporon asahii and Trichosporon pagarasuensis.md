## Abstract
The unique properties of the cell wall make it a fascinating to explore the structure of fungal cell walls and their interaction with the fungal host. However, in order to determine the complexity of the cell walls and how they contribute to pathogen infection, it is necessary to identify and characterize the composition of their polysaccharides. These molecules are believed to play a key role in microbial pathogenesis, as their polysaccharides have been shown to have antimicrobial and antiviral activities, suggesting that they may play a role in immune modulation of host immunity. Here, we describe cell wall extracts and bilayers from fungi (Candida parapsilosis, C. gattii, Trichosporon asahii and Trichosporon dendrobatidis) and animals with candidemia. We find that, the majority of the plant extracts are chitinaceous oligosaccharides, with a relatively low percentage of mannose. Composition of these oligosaccharides is a mirror image of the composition of the fungal cell wall. The oligosaccharides appear to have a rather wide range of structural features, ranging from simple to complex, such as polysaccharides containing endoplasmic-like structures. We show that the contents of the cell walls of all four fungal species differ significantly depending on the taxa and taxa. The most common oligosaccharide is from the Asanigenzyma, the most common genus is represented by Trichosporon, and the fungus is most commonly found in planta, while the common fungus is most commonly found in animalia. These oligosaccharides appear to have a very broad range of substrate properties ranging from simple to complex, and are potentially affected by a number of environmental factors and immune modulatory molecules. The content of the cell wall polysaccharides in C. parapsilosis, C. gattii and Trichosporon asahii is similar to the content of the fungal cell walls in animalia, and oligosaccharides appear to be more stable oligomeric molecules with a longer evolutionary history. It is suggested that oligosaccharides may play a role in modulation of host-fungus interactions, and in some cases in virulence modulation.


## Introduction
.) are widely used as antifungal agents for the treatment of fungal infections [27].

The major fungal pathogen of the genus Trichosporon, Trichosporon aureus, is an ascomycete that is responsible for more than 50% of human diseases including skin, respiratory, and cutaneous infections [28]. T. aureus causes disease in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients [29]. Although T. aureus is a common opportunistic pathogen, it can also cause infections in both immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients [30]. In order to invade the host, T. aureus has evolved several strategies to evade the host immune system. These include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase, proteases, lipases, and ureases, as well as the production of extracellular siderophores, which are able to bind to a variety of proteins, including mannoproteins [31]. In addition to these intracellular secreted molecules, the pathogen also secrete siderophores which include pyocyanin, a pigment of the basidiomycete yeast Cryptococcus neoformans [32]. Among these siderophores are laccase, the pigment melanin, and urease, which are secreted by T. aureus. These enzymes degrade the polysaccharides of the fungal cell wall and the compounds can be used to produce siderophores that can be further extracted and utilized as biofuels [33]. T. aureus is also able to produce hydrolases, chitinases and chitooligomers, which can hydrolyze the lipids in the fungal cell wall. These compounds can also modify the fungal metabolism by producing cell wall remodelling enzymes that degrade these polysaccharides. For instance, chitinase and urease were shown to degrade chitin and affect virulence of T. aureus [34]. Finally, chitinases and urease have been demonstrated to be important in the induction of the yeast-to-hyphae transition, which is a response to the stress that arises from the interaction of the pathogen with its host, the pathogen being the yeast.


## Methods

DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from fungal mycelium and spores using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used to amplify part of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit rDNA operon spanning the 3’ end of the 18S nrDNA, the first internal transcribed spacer region, the second ITS region and the first 900 bases at the 5.8S nrDNA. The PCR was performed with a total reaction volume of 25 µl containing 1 × PCR buffer (Qiagen), 1 × Exonuclease-RNase-RNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1.5 mM MgCl_2, 0.4 mM dNTP, 0.2 µM of each primer (50 µM), 0.4 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (version 2.0, Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 0.5 µM of each dNTP (2.5 U/µl), 2.5 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (version 2.0, Takara), 0.2 U of Exonuclease-RNase-RNase (version 2.0, Takara), 0.2 U of Exonuclease-SpA (version 2.0, Takara), 0.2 U of Exonuclease-SpB (version 2.0, Takara), 0.2 U of Exonuclease-SpC (version 2.0, Takara) and 2.5 U of Exonuclease-SpD (version 2.0, Takara). PCR conditions and the DNA samples used in this study are listed in Table 2. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified PCR products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the same primers used in the amplification of the ITS region and the internal transcribed spacer region. The sequences were assembled and edited using the Sequencher 4.


## Results
. Screening of Alternative Compounds
A total of 29 isolates (15 strains, 7 clinical, 4 environmental) were obtained from the food, garden or medical waste of four major cities in Thailand (Table 1). The commonest isolates were used for in vitro susceptibility testing. The MICs for each drug were listed in Table 1.

2.2. Antifungal Activity
The MICs for all tested drugs were determined to be very low, ranging from 0.25 to 0.25 µg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the three isolates was 0.25 µg/ml. The MIC_50 values for the four drugs are listed in Table 2.

2.3. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the three tested drugs was evaluated against four clinical strains of Candida, C. albicans and C. neoformans, and four environmental isolates of Candida spp. and C. dubliniensis.


## Discussion
The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is challenging, and is frequently difficult to diagnose, particularly in a limited number of patients. Cryptococcal meningitis is rare in immunocompetent individuals and is usually diagnosed with a presumptive diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Only a few cases have been reported in immunocompetent individuals. However, it is also important to consider the possibility of fungal infection in immunocompetent hosts. Cryptococcus gattii is the most common species in the United States, and is an emerging organism. This organism is found in very low frequency in the lungs, but can be detected in immunocompetent individuals, with the rate of detection in patients with HIV and those with chronic liver disease and diabetes mellitus [3]. It has been reported that cryptococcal meningitis is more frequent in immunocompetent hosts than in those with HIV [4,5]. Cryptococcus neoformans is also a very rare species and often occurs in immunocompetent hosts. It is an opportunistic fungal infection that presents in HIV patients with AIDS, and the mortality rate of patients with HIV is 80-90% [6].
