## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. It is a neglected disease that is endemic to large areas of land that are poorly explored, due to the lack of many lead-based biomarkers and the large number of immunocompetent patients that they are serviced. To date, the most recently published biomarker of PCM is the Leishmania protein MS, which does not contain a Leishmania homolog but instead contains two unique MS proteins: one a protein of type EF-1a, which is a protein found in filaments and is critical for pathogenesis, and another known as F-actin filaments. The presence of these two unique proteins makes MS a promising drug target because it helps the drug target to some extent with F-forms. Also the presence of these unique proteins makes them excellent drug targets, making them candidates for the discovery of new anti-Leishmania drugs. Immunocytochemical analysis of the Leishmania F-forms in culture filaments of P. brasiliensis over time reveals a mixture of macrophage-like growth and a high degree of promastinity for these proteins. To investigate the genetic basis of promastinity in Leishmania, we used next-generation sequencing to identify the mutations in the paracoccidioidomycetes genome. Surprisingly, the F-forms are promastinating (as predicted by the large, promastain Leishmania subgenus) suggesting that promastinization is a rare characteristic among Leishmania.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen, which is commonly found in the respiratory tract of healthy individuals (1-3). It is also found in the deep respiratory tract and in the gastrointestinal tract of animals as well as humans. Although C. albicans is able to survive and proliferate inside the human host for many generations, it can be easily disseminated to other parts of the body and cause life-threatening diseases such as systemic infections (4-6). Currently, the most common clinical presentation of invasive candidiasis is asymptomatic colonization and/or biofilm formation (7, 8). However, C. albicans can invade the host through different routes, such as the respiratory tract and the bloodstream (9, 10).

In the respiratory tract, C. albicans frequently causes severe infections, including invasive infections such as nasopharyngeal candidiasis (11), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary disease (12). In the respiratory tract, C. albicans can also cause disseminated candidiasis (13). For instance, C. albicans can invade the respiratory tract after inhalation of spores (14). C. albicans biofilm formation can be modulated by a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, and biofilm formation by Candida yeast cells (15-17). C. albicans can form biofilms on medical devices such as catheters, catheters for skin and nail, and catheters for mucosal barriers (18, 19). In addition, C. albicans can form biofilms on medical devices (20). In the bloodstream, C. albicans can form biofilms on implants such as catheters (21). Furthermore, C. albicans can form biofilm on bioethanol-based disposable catheters (22). In the lungs, C. albicans biofilm formation can be enhanced by alveolar macrophages (23, 24).

The severity of the clinical manifestations of candidiasis depends on many factors, such as the site of infection, infection, host immune status, and drug therapy.


## Methods
Mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker X1 Mass Spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) and with a Bruker Optima 100 B-Orbit mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany. All ions were detected with Bruker Ultimate 3000 mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany).

2.7. MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS Analysis of Receptor-Inducible OIs of Tricyclazole and Caspofungin
The MALDI-TOF-MS method was employed for the identification of Tricyclazole and Caspofungin compounds. The sample was dissolved in methanol and diluted to the required concentration. The test solution (4 µl) was then applied to the sample by using a SpeedVac MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Malvern, UK) and the following conditions: carbamidomethylation at 35°C for 30 min, followed by a 40-90°C gradient was applied. The sample was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas for 24 h and then stained with a solution of red dichloromethane (RCA) for 30 min. Then, the sample was transferred to a plate of 2 ml of 1% formic acid. The absorbance at 492 nm was recorded. The colour of the reaction mixture was expressed as the percentage (%) change from the blank control.

2.8. MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS Analysis of Caspofungin Compounds
The MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis was performed using a MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS type instrument equipped with a CTO 3000/TOF-MS (Malvern, UK). The sample was dissolved in methanol and diluted to the required concentration. The sample was applied to the sample by using a SpeedVac MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS (Malvern, UK) and the following conditions: carbamidomethylation at 35°C for 30 min, followed by a 40-90°C gradient was applied.


## Results
After 12 days, a decrease in the numbers of macrophages was observed in the lungs of the mice and there was a reduction in the numbers of macrophages in the lung (Figure 2B. This difference was further demonstrated by the analysis of the numbers of viable CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells in the lungs at 4 and 24 hpi. No significant differences were observed between the groups of mice infected with A. fumigatus. On the other hand, a significant reduction in the numbers of viable CD4^+ T cells was observed in the lungs of the mice infected with A. fumigatus at 48 hpi (Figure 2C).

C57BL/6 macrophages were the most efficient macrophages in the lung of the mice infected with A. fumigatus (Figure 2D). These data showed that C57BL/6 macrophages were the most efficient in terms of killing A. fumigatus. In contrast, C57BL/6 macrophages were the least efficient in terms of killing A. fumigatus. To evaluate the effect of C57BL/6 macrophages on the immune response in the lungs of the mice, BALB/c mice were co-cultured with C57BL/6 macrophages and the lungs were examined. No significant differences were observed in the numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages in the lungs of the C57BL/6 mice (Figure 2E).

Although the C57BL/6 mice presented a similar initial number of viable A. fumigatus, the mice presented a different immune response. As shown in Figure 2F, the mice infected with C57BL/6 macrophages had a similar fungal burden to those infected with A. fumigatus. Furthermore, the numbers of viable neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the lungs were similar between the groups of mice infected with C57BL/6 macrophages and the lungs (Figure 2G).


## Discussion
In the present study, the MPT-positive cells of the MPT-negative group showed increased numbers of CD4^+ T cell. Furthermore, MPT-negative cells showed increased CD4^+ T cells, which was accompanied by increased numbers of CD4^+ T cells. Interestingly, MPT-positive cells of the MPT-negative group were predominantly CD4^+ T cells.

MPT-negative cells of the MPT-positive group were characterized by a higher number of CD4^+ T cells and the highest number of CD4^+ T cells compared to the MPT-positive cells. This increased number of CD4^+ T cells, which was accompanied by increased numbers of CD4^+ T cells, is a characteristic of a pro-inflammatory process. In the present study, the MPT-positive cells of the MPT-negative group showed higher numbers of CD4^+ T cells, which was accompanied by higher numbers of CD4^+ T cells. The MPT-negative cells of the MPT-positive group were characterized by the presence of CD4^+ T cells, which was accompanied by higher numbers of CD4^+ T cells. This increased CD4^+ T cell number was in agreement with a previous study in which CD4^+ T cells were associated with a pro-inflammatory response (29). The CD4^+ T cell numbers in MPT-positive cells were also significantly increased compared to that of MPT-negative cells. In addition, the CD4^+ T cell numbers in MPT-negative cells were increased. These results were consistent with a previous study that reported CD4^+ T cell numbers as higher in MPT-negative cells (30).

The MPT-positive cells of the MPT-negative group were characterized by the presence of a higher number of CD4^+ T cells and the presence of CD4^+ T cells, which was accompanied by higher numbers of CD4^+ T cells. This increased CD4^+ T cell number was in agreement with a previous study that reported CD4^+ T cell numbers as higher in MPT-negative cells (29).
