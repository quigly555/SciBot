## Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, clinical presentations, and outcome of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among patients admitted to the vascular sinus two weeks after the start of radiography in a tertiary care hospital in China.

Demographics, risk factors, and outcomes of candidemia were collected and analyzed.

A total of 183 candidemia patients were enrolled and 64 IFIs (36.3%) were reported with a 4.5-fold and 32 % risk of developing IFIs. Candidemia incidence was significantly higher in women (6.2 cases; 109; [95% CI: 3.9-11.1]) and patients with a history of frequent mycoses (27; 94; [95% CI: 15.0-39.7]). An estimated 784 (100%) candidemia patients were admitted to the vascular sinus; 81% of patients had healed nodular lesions. Recurrence of IFIs within a week after admission was significantly higher in women (23; 101; [95% CI: 2.9-37.8]). Thirty two percent IFIs occurred in HIV-infected patients and were classified as candidemia (four; 86; 25%; [95% CI: 2.1-11.2]) and non-fungal (seven; 62; 71%; 25%; [95% CI: 2.1-20.9]). A history of severe immunosuppression, prolonged hospitalization, and end-stage renal disease was significantly more prevalent in HIV-infected patients than HIV-uninfected patients (P = .02).

Conclusions.


## Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is an abundant and basic gas, and it has been widely used in industry to measure the production of fuels and chemicals. NO can be generated from various sources, such as sewage, coal, oil, and gas. The production of NO has been increasing because of the need to reduce the production of CO_2 and thus to reduce the global CO_2 emission. However, the NO source is expensive, and a growing number of countries are considering the use of alternative sources for the energy of the future. In the past, it has been assumed that NO and COOH could be generated from biomass through a process called bioenergy. However, the use of biomass was limited and more attention has been given to alternative sources.

Biofuel has been an important source of energy for the past 30 years. As of today, nearly all domestic and industrial wastes are used for biofuel production. In the last 20 years, it has become a big economic development because of the large amount of cheap raw materials that can be used for the production of biofuel from biomass. The world biomass production has been estimated to be approximately 2.8 billion metric tons (www.cbc.org). The amount of renewable biomass is approximately 60% of the total biomass production. According to the World Data Center on biomass and energy in 2015, the amount of renewable biomass was 76.3 billion metric tons. Among these renewable biomass resources, biofuel has received much attention because it can be used in a variety of sectors, such as biofuel production, bioremediation, food, feed, transport, and domestic dishwashers. The biofuel production in China is estimated to be approximately 25 billion tons. The main feedstock used in biofuel production is sugarcane, and these crops are highly sensitive to nitrogenous and other high nitrogen content (Li et al., 2015). Nitrogen content in sugarcane and other sugarcane products is about 15% and 5%, respectively. The nitrogen content in biofuel is 10-15% and 20-25% and is similar to that in petroleum and agricultural products (Gang et al., 2015).

2.3. Antifungal Agents
A suspension of C. glabrata cells at a concentration of 10^5 cells/ml was prepared by adding 5 mg/ml of Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with pH adjusted to 7.0. The cell suspension was incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h. Then, 5 ml of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the assay was carried out for the growth of C. glabrata cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, RPMI-1640 was added and the assay was conducted for the growth of C. glabrata cells.

2.4. Antifungal Agents
The antimicrobial activity of the isolated compounds was assessed by the presence of inhibition zones of the antimicrobial activity of the tested compounds according to the method of Oezetano et al. [30]. The zone of inhibition was defined as the diameter of the inhibition zone around a spot of C. glabrata cells at a concentration of 10^5 cells/ml.

2.5. Antifungal Drugs
The antimicrobial activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated using the method of Shapiro-Wilk and Etherington [31] and the inhibition zone of the tested compounds was defined as the diameter of the inhibition zone around a spot of C. glabrata cells at a concentration of 10^5 cells/ml.

2.6. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each compound was determined according to the method of Avanti and Domschka [32] and the compounds were diluted in RPMI-1640 and then further diluted in RPMI-1640 to 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7, 10^8, 10^9 and 10^10 units/ml.


## Results
These data are consistent with our previous findings that N-mystatin-resistant . lugens cells were inversely correlated with the fungal burden in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of BALB/c mice, and that N. lugens N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata were more sensitive to nitric oxide (NO) than C. albicans. The average values of the blood urea nitrogen (bUN) were significantly higher for N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata compared with the control (Figure 1). The number of urea nitrogen units (iNU) in BALB/c mice was significantly higher for N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata than C. albicans (Table 2). These data are consistent with our previous results that N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata cells were inversely correlated with the blood urea nitrogen (bUN) of BALB/c mice, and that N. lugens N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata were more resistant to nitric oxide (NO) than C. albicans.

N-mystatin-resistant N. lugens C. glabrata were more sensitive to iron-limiting agents than C. albicans

The iron-limiting agents tested in the BALB/c mice were cetazol, isoniazid, and echinocandin, but not nikkomycin. These agents have been shown to be toxic to mammalian cells and cause toxicity of host cells, but there is no specific toxicity to mammalian cells. The impact of the agent on N. lugens N-mystatin-resistant C. glabrata cells was evaluated by measuring the iron-limiting agents tested in the BALB/c mice. The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. The iron-limiting agents tested in the BALB/c mice were cetazol, isoniazid, and echinocandin, but not nikkomycin. The iron-limiting agents tested in the BALB/c mice were cetazol, isoniazid, and echinocandin, but not nikkomycin.

## Discussion
However, in contrast to the case in humans, . albicans is the most common Candida species, but also C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata. The occurrence of C. tropicalis in humans is very rare (29, 30). Therefore, to determine the possible mechanism of action of myristatase in human, we used the enzyme system of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Histoplasma capsulatum is a highly virulent species, causing infections in humans, horses, dogs, cats, and dogs (31). It is also used as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of other diseases, including malaria and AIDS (32). In our previous study, we reported that Histoplasma capsulatum inhibits the production of myristate, which is a natural product of the myristate pathway in yeast (33). To our knowledge, this is the first report for human use. Our present study provides the first evidence for the active activity of histoplasma capsulatum on human cells, and also showed that the enzyme could be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of other diseases, such as tuberculosis (34).

The enzyme is able to metabolize histamine, a diacylglycerol-3-phosphate (DAG) found in the extracellular space of yeast (35). DAG is an essential component of the myristate pathway of myristate and a second-step in the myristate-cytolysis pathway of myristate (36). In this study, we found that Histoplasma capsulatum is able to metabolize DAG, which is a typical myristate precursor. We found that the enzyme could also be used as a drug target for the treatment of other diseases, including cancer (37).

Mannose dehydrogenase (MDA) is a major enzyme in the myristate pathway of myristate (38). The enzyme is a major enzyme in the myristate pathway of myristate (39) and was previously reported to be involved in the myristate-cytolysis pathway (40). In our study, we found that the enzyme could also be used as a drug target for the treatment of other diseases, including cancer (31, 32).
