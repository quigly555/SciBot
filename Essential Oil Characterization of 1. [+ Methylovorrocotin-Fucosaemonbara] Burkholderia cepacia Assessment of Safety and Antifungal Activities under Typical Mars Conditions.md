## Abstract
Although many species of the fungal kingdom have evolved to survive in nature, several are capable of this resilience and persistence, especially in the form of adaptation and/or adaptation to the different environments and ecological niches that support it. In this sense, adaptations of this order of extremophilic symbionts are of interest to understand how these adaptations shape the traits and traits that, in this order, define their ecological roles and potentiality. This is also a basis for the description of new lineages and new adaptations with new life strategies, as these traits are now well-represented in all of the extremophilic symbionts studied to date. In this sense, the filamentous fungi studied to date are exceptional examples of symbiotic associations that are directly responsible for shaping their environments, their biodiversity, and their key traits.


## Introduction
Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common causative agent of pneumococcal meningitis, and it is highly prevalent in high-income countries, especially in Africa and Southeast Asia. [1], [2] The pneumococcal species are classified into four major serotypes: serotype A (Pb01-12), serotype D (Pb12-3) and mixed serotype A (Pb03-Pb03-Pb03-), and the second subtype is designated as Pb021-Pb06-. The Pb serotype A and Pb serotype D have been isolated from the nasopharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts of more than 400 countries, respectively. The Pb serotype A isolates are predominantly found in Europe, while the Pb serotype D isolates are predominantly found in North America and Asia. [3] In the last two decades, the prevalence of Pb serotype D is about 1.7% in the United States and Europe, and is higher in Africa and Southeast Asia. [3] The Pb serotype D isolates are most commonly isolated in Europe, while the Pb serotype D isolates are most commonly isolated in North America. [3] Pb serotype A isolates are found in association with other respiratory tract infections, such as asthma or bronchitis, and Pb serotype D isolates are most commonly isolated in Asia. [3], [4] In the last two decades, a wide spectrum of respiratory tract infections caused by Pb serotype A and Pb serotype D have been reported.

## Results
The feasibility of the development of an antimicrobial activity of . [+ Methylovorrocotin-Fucosaemonbara] Burkholderia cepacia with established microbial strains is a good indication to develop new antimicrobial compounds. In our study, there was no significant difference in the MIC_50 values of 1. [+ Methylovorrocotin-Fucosaemonbara] Burkholderia cepacia against E. coli (Table 3).

3. [+ Methylovorrocotin-Fucosaemonbara] Burkholderia cepacia: Antifungal Activity Against E. coli
From our results, E. coli is the most important cause of food spoilage. It is responsible for the spoilage of spoilage food in food products and is a major contributor to food spoilage in food products, such as food additives and cosmetics. E. coli is a potential food spoilage because it is responsible for the spoilage of food in food products and food-borne food products [46]. E. coli can cause food safety problems and food poisoning, especially foodmoneas [47]. E. coli can cause food safety problems in humans and animals [48]. E. coli is not known to cause food toxicity [49]. In this study, E. coli is a major cause of food safety problems in humans and animals, such as food poisoning, food contamination, food processing, food additives, food hygiene products, food washing machines, and food packaged food. The toxic effects of E. coli on food and food products are caused by the high concentrations of the bacterium, antibiotic, and fungicide used to treat food disorders, especially food poisoning, food contamination, food washing machines, and food packaging. In this study, the MIC_50 values of E. coli were 7.25 µg/ml for E. coli, 6.25 µg/ml for E. coli, and 1.25 µg/ml for E. coli.

According to the data presented in Table 3, the MIC_50 values of 1. [+ Methylovorrocotin-Fucosaemonbara] Burkholderia cepacia against E. coli were 6.25 µg/ml, 6.


## Discussion
monophora) is illustrated in Fig . The inoculum is inoculated into the stationary phase of the growth stage, and a significant amount of Fusarium yeast is formed. The results of the checkerboard-based assay are presented in Table 1.

Fusarium graminearum has been reported to produce a large number of aerial mycelia, which are often concomitantly produced in the course of the production of aerial mycelia and produce a large number of spores. In addition, several species of Fusarium produce aerial mycelia with a similar expression pattern to that of Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we determined the number of spores of Fusarium graminearum in culture medium using the chemical treatments (Table 1). The number of spores was comparable to that of the aforementioned species of Fusarium and the results are in accordance with the results of the earlier work [23]. The number of spores of Fusarium graminearum in culture medium was approximately 10-15 µm, with no significant difference of the number of spores of Fusarium graminearum in culture medium between the other three species of Fusarium. In contrast, the number of spores of Fusarium graminearum was approximately 10-15 µm, with no significant difference of the number of spores of Fusarium graminearum in culture medium between the other three species of Fusarium. This result suggests that the chemical treatments of the medium have a significant effect on the number of spores of Fusarium.

Effect of the inoculum size on the production of Fusarium
The production of Fusarium spore number was determined by the use of chemical treatments with a number of inoculum sizes of 4-8 µm. The result shows that the production of Fusarium spore number in the culture medium is approximately 100-250 µm. This is comparable to the results of the previous work [22]. In the present study, the production of Fusarium spore number was approximately 300 µm, with no significant difference in the number of spores of Fusarium.
