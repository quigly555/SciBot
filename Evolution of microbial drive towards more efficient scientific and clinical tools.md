## Abstract
The International Space Station (ISS) is an extremely important site for spaceflight activities and scientific research activities. The ISS is the International Space Station (ISS)â€™s closest neighbour and has a close relation with the ISS. It hosts a wide range of life science and research facilities, including the International Space Station (ISS). There are currently about 4500 astronauts on board the ISS and about 32000 tons of cargo are loaded into space. Most crew members are working in low Earth Orbit (LEO), which makes them suitable for human habitation.

Sequence analysis of the nRFAP genes
To further investigate the sequence and gene structure of the nRFAP genes, we performed a gene prediction and prediction using the Blast2GO database (accession numbers, PDB accession number: 1066956). The nRFAP genes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe were predicted to have the same three introns (i.e., R, G and I) and the fourth (i.e., U) and fifth (i.e., V) of the N-terminal and the C-terminal ends, respectively. As the gene ontology (GO) term of the nRFAP genes is not yet known, we predicted the gene structure using the amino acid sequences of the six nRFAP genes using the N-terminal N-terminal end (Supplementary Figure S1).


## Discussion
In this study we have demonstrated that the transcription of TNF-a and IL-17A is significantly upregulated in MDA-MBEC cells. The elevated cytokine response is not due to a direct stimulation of TNF-a or IL-17A but rather due to the high levels of both cytokines in the MDA-MBECs.
