## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection of the central nervous system, which commonly occurs in immunocompromised patients. Here, we describe a rare case of disseminated cryptococcosis with intracranial diffuse interstitial nephritis in a patient with a hematologic disorder who was treated with combination therapy of amphotericin and flucytosine. He had a past medical history that included diabetes, hypertension, and diabetes-related immune dysfunction. He was a 35-year-old male with a history of well-controlled HIV and diabetes. He was diagnosed with cryptococcosis in a positive serum Cryptococcus antigen test and positive serum C. neoformans antigen.


## Introduction
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is a vital indicator of cerebral dysfunction. CSF pressure is a key determinant of fungal neurologic complications and is critical for the proper function of the central nervous system. CSF pressure has been shown to be associated with several pathologies, including: anemia, stroke, and aplastic aphasia. Elevated CSF pressure can be induced by malabsorption, trauma, and medical interventions. Cortical calcifications are a common clinical manifestation of neurofibromascoma. Our aim was to determine the clinical and radiographic features of CSF calcifications with the aim of determining the most commonly encountered profile of CSF pressure.


## Methods
 2017. From this, we classified isolates into four major groups based on their ability to grow on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and two to four colonies per one colony of each strain.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
The MICs of the tested drugs were determined by broth microdilution method using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 method, which is based on CLSI M27-A3 guideline and the MICs were interpreted as intermediate (IC50 value = MIC_50 value > MIC_90 value) with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC_90) of 50% in 96-well plates. For the susceptibility testing, the drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to the required concentration in RPMI-1640 medium. The final concentrations of the tested drugs were adjusted according to the CLSI M27-A3 guideline. In the test of MBC (monotherapy), 2 mg/mL of MBC was added to the drug and the plate was incubated at 35°C for 24 h.

In this assay, a test of MBC (monotherapy), 1.0 µg/mL of MBC was added to the drug and the plate was incubated at 35°C for 24 h. The final concentrations of the tested drugs were adjusted according to the CLSI M27-A3 guideline. In the test of MBC (monotherapy), a test of sub-MICs of the tested drugs was performed in RPMI-1640 medium. All the tests were performed in duplicate. The final concentrations of the tested drugs were adjusted according to the CLSI M27-A3 guideline. The test of MBC (monotherapy), 0.125 mg/mL of MBC was performed in RPMI-1640 medium.


## Results
Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we generated sequence-based fungal genotypes from the majority of fungal species examined and identified the fungal species with highest confidence by using a panel of >50 fungal genotype. In total, 17 Cryptococcus neoformans genotypes were found among all species analyzed (Table 1). A total of 11 fungal genotypes were identified in the cryptococcal strain C. neoformans URA5 (Table 1), and 12 Cryptococcus neoformans genotypes were identified in the clinical strain C. gattii URA1 (Table 1).

As a general criterion, the four most commonly identified Cryptococcus neoformans isolates were Cryptococcus gattii URA1, C. neoformans var. grubii URA1, and Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans (Table 1). All four Cryptococcus neoformans isolates were found in the clinical strain C. neoformans URA1, and the two clinical strains C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. gattii URA1 were identified in the clinical strain C. neoformans var. neoformans. The two clinical strains of C. neoformans var. neoformans were found in the clinical strain of C. gattii URA1, and the two clinical strains of C. neoformans var. neoformans were found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans var. grubii (Table 1). The two clinical strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans URA1, and the clinical strain of C. neoformans var. neoformans was found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans var. grubii (Table 1).

For the three isolates of C. neoformans URA1, only one isolate was found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans var. neoformans, but all three clinical strains were found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans var. grubii. The two clinical strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were found in the clinical strain of C. neoformans URA1, and the clinical strain of C. neoformans var.


## Discussion
As previously noted, C. neoformans is a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen. However, the infection of humans is associated with a higher incidence of candidemia and cryptococcosis. Given the small numbers of cases reported in this study, it is likely that the lack of timely diagnosis of candidemia and cryptococcosis in the Indian setting may be underestimated. A large number of studies have attempted to identify the causative agents of candidemia in patients living in other countries [1], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. While our study revealed that C. neoformans was the predominant agent of candidemia in patients living in other countries, the cause was not identified in nearly 20% of the cases. This could be due to the fact that C. neoformans is a slow growing fungus that is transmitted by inhalation [13], [14], [16] and that the host environment for C. neoformans infection is relatively cold and moist. However, the optimal incubation temperature is unknown [13], [14], [16], [17], [18]. In the present study, C. neoformans was not identified in patients living in any of the other countries, with only an isolate isolated from a patient from India, possibly as a result of travel. This could be due to the fact that C. neoformans species is known to be able to grow in several environmental niches.
