## Abstract
The following fictional case is intended as a learning tool within the Pathology Competencies for Medical Education (PCME), a set of national standards for teaching pathology. The case presented is the result of a medical course in which the subject is effectively presented in a 3-day real-world setting and the subject matter is presented in a real life setting. The objective of this research project was to integrate the historical context of the medical education in Malaysia with the current state of the art in pathology in the region using an integrated approach involving the use of a variety of data including clinical and imaging data in combination with an exploration of the available available pathology literature and visual information content. The pathology course was designed to be a one-day event, taking place in Malaysia and Europe in 2018. Pathology Competencies for Medical Education students will learn about pathology, infection pathology, protease and cell pathology, as well as infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases, as well as their impact on the student’s general education and pathology coursework. The course will also be supplemented by a discussion in the general educational and pathology subjects section of the English-language publication, The Lancet, highlighting the importance of pathology in the context of specific medical education.


## Introduction
Clinicians should be aware that the use of antibiotics in topical treatment of topical infections could lead to serious complications, which might cause a higher morbidity and mortality, and lead to a higher price. The use of antibiotics in topical topical treatment of topical infections could lead to serious complications, which might cause a higher morbidity and mortality, and lead to a higher price. The use of antibiotics in topical treatment of topical infections can lead to serious complications, which might cause a higher morbidity and mortality, and lead to a higher price.

For the treatment of topical infections, topical antibiotics should be administered at a dose that is not more than 3 cm^-1 (n = 3).

For topical infections caused by bacteria and fungi, a topical antibiotic should be administered at a dose that is less than (n = 3).

For systemic infections caused by fungi, a topical antibiotic should be administered at a dose that is more than (n = 3).

For topical infections caused by yeasts and molds, a topical antibiotic should be administered at a dose that is more than (n = 3).


## Methods
However, it is not required for virulence in the thymol clas. Yeast strains are sensitive to the hygromycin (HPH) resistance. Furthermore, the FITC-labelled fungi are not common in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients [36]. Therefore, the reference strain of Candida albicans (ATCC 90193) was chosen for our analysis.

2.3. Genomic DNA Extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from yeast strains using the NucleoSpin Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of extracted genomic DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.

2.4. PCR Amplification and Sequencing
Fungi were grown in liquid YPD medium at 28°C for 48 h. After the addition of 1 µg ml^-1 of the crude extract, the fungal growth was harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min, washed with distilled water and re-suspended to a final concentration of 10^8 conidia ml^-1 in sterile water. The pellets were kept on ice for 1 h for 1 min and subsequently resuspended in 5 ml of sterile water. The DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR amplification and sequencing were carried out in a DNA-sanger-fusion kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primers used for amplification of the ITS region are listed in Table S1.

2.5. Phylogenetic Analysis
The ITS region was amplified using the ITS1-5.8S-rDNA-ITS2 (ITS) region. The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 57°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and sequenced.


## Results
Phylogenetic analyses of the predicted genome sequence indicated that . kratochvilovae is not unique to the yeast group. The other three species share a unique genetic history with their genomes. R. kratochvilovae has been used in the treatment of cancer (Griffith et al., 2014) and in the development of vaccines (Nakashima et al., 2011; Chabu et al., 2013). Thus, R. kratochvilovae may be a novel pathogen of many years to come.

R. kratochvilovae Is a Highly Expressed Genome in the Mouse Model of Chronic Liver Injury
To examine if R. kratochvilovae is expressed in the mouse kidney, we first examined the expression levels of R. kratochvilovae gene in the mouse kidney. The expression of R. kratochvilovae genes was investigated in the mouse kidney using a BLASTx analysis (Fig 3A). The transcript levels of R. kratochvilovae genes were found to be elevated in both the BALB/c and BALB/d mice. In the BALB/c mice, the R. kratochvilovae transcript level was increased by 1.4-fold (Fig 3B). In the BALB/d mice, the expression levels of R. kratochvilovae genes were detected to be higher in the BALB/d mice, but not in the BALB/s mice. In the BALB/s mice, the R. kratochvilovae transcript level was higher in the BALB/s mice, but not in the BALB/s mice (Fig 3B).

The expression of the R. kratochvilovae genes in the mouse kidney was found to be elevated by 2.7-fold in the BALB/s and by 1.2-fold in the BALB/s mice (Fig 3C). The expression of the R. kratochvilovae genes was found to be higher in the BALB/s mice, but not in the BALB/s mice. In the BALB/s mice, the R. kratochvilovae transcript level was higher in the BALB/s mice, but not in the BALB/s mice (Fig 3C).


## Discussion
The Rhodococcus species complex was first described in the genus Rhodococcus and it was also characterized by the ability to produce a hybrid form (rhodococcus) with a different virulence and sexual reproduction mechanism [60. It has also been reported that the biofilm formation is related to the virulence of Rhodococcus species and Rhodococcus species complex [61,62]. These results suggest that the Rhodococcus complex may have evolved the ability to form biofilms with asexual reproduction as a virulence trait in order to avoid the loss of other virulence factors. However, a previous study reported that Rhodococcus species complex is able to form biofilms with asexual reproduction [63]. Furthermore, the Rhodococcus species complex was also reported to produce a hybrid form [62]. Therefore, it is unclear whether Rhodococcus species complex is the result of a sexual reproduction or a biofilm formation process, as the two forms are distinct. It has been reported that the sexual reproduction of Rhodococcus species complex is a species-specific process [64]. However, it is possible that Rhodococcus species complex produces a hybrid form to escape the sexual reproduction process, while Rhodococcus species complex does not produce a hybrid form in order to avoid the loss of other virulence factors.

The role of TcHCA in biofilm formation was previously reported [65]. However, the biological role of TcHCA was not addressed in this study. In this study, we found that TcHCA regulates the activity of the TCA pathway in biofilm formation and the TCA pathway is involved in the regulation of TcHCA activity. The TcHCA gene product, TcHCA1, is induced in the presence of TcHCA1 promoter and the expression level of TcHCA1 is increased in the presence of TcHCA1 promoter. However, in the presence of TcHCA1 promoter, TcHCA1 was only induced by TcHCA1 promoter, while expression of TcHCA2 was induced by TcHCA1 promoter. This is consistent with the results obtained in our previous study, where TcHCA1 was induced by TcHCA1 promoter and TcHCA2 was induced by TcHCA1 promoter. This suggests that TcHCA1 and TcHCA2 have distinct roles in the regulation of TcHCA activity.
