## Abstract
Phospholipase B-metabolic enzymes play an important role in growth and development of fungi, which are an important component of the fungal cell walls. In this study, we characterized the first member of the phosphate-responsive proteome of the xylose-fermenting fungus Alternaria brassicicola, Pb18. We found that Pb18 is a phospholipase encoded protein. A phospholipase B-metabolic pathway analysis showed that Pb18 is more efficient at growing as a glycosyltransferase (GT) than other enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SOD), peroxidases (POD), and isosy-diacetylases (SOD-A). Mutational analysis showed that Pb18 is under specific regulation and at the level of the cell wall. Although mutants of Pb18 cannot grow as a tyrosine deaminase (TYPA) or as a phospholipidase, all are able to increase the production of ATP required for growth under zinc starvation. Pb18 regulates the expression of several important gene classes, including the largest class being carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) and carbohydrate transporters (CAMP).


## Introduction
Iron is an essential cofactor in biological processes like protein trafficking, redox reactions, cell signaling, and signaling pathways. Iron is a cofactor in enzymes like respiration, metalloprotease, and DNA replication [1,2,3]. Thus, iron is used as a cofactor in biochemical reactions like tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which is carried out by a variety of enzymes like respiration, trehalose biosynthesis, and DNA methylation.


## Methods
Ethics statement
No animals were used in this study. The experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Use Committee of the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo, and in accordance with the Brazilian Federal Law 11,794 establishing procedures for the scientific use of laboratory animals for scientific purposes.


## Results
Treatment with p38/Akt was consistently effective and even in the most critically ill HIV-1-dorne patient [37. In fact, we found that treatment with p38/Akt in HIV-1-dorne patients was much better than in a control group of HIV-1-dorne patients (p = 0.074) (Fig 6). This finding is in keeping with the remarkable improvement in treatment of a fatal HIV-1-dorne patient over the control group, and suggests that p38/Akt has a role in the therapeutic response of HIV-1-dorne patients.

A recent meta-analysis of a HIV-1-dorne patient demonstrated that treatment with p38/Akt was effective, albeit at low doses, and even in the most critically ill HIV-1-dorne patient [38]. Therefore, we were interested in determining the impact of p38/Akt on a fatal HIV-1-dorne patient. While we observed no significant difference in survival between the two groups, a significant reduction in survival was observed in a p38/Akt-treated HIV-1-dorne patient compared with a control group (p = 0.1) (Fig 7). Treatment with p38/Akt was superior to that of the control group (p = 0.03), with a survival score of 85% and 95% at the end of the study period, and to that of the p38/Akt-treated group (89% and 95% at the end of the study period, Fig 7). In addition, we observed a significant reduction in mortality between the two groups (p = 0.04) (Fig 7).

A previous meta-analysis of a HIV-1-dorne patient with hematological malignancy also showed that p38/Akt treatment was superior to the control group [38]. However, the p38/Akt treatment was also superior to that of the control group, with a survival score of 100% and 95% at the end of the study period (p = 0.039) (Fig 8).


## Discussion
Our data showed that p38/Akt was safe for treating HIV-1-dorne patient. On the other hand, P38/Akt toxicity was not a serious issue in HIV-1-dorne patients.

Our data also showed that p38/Akt was more effective in treating HIV-1-dorne patients than in HIV-1-seronegative patients. In HIV-1-seronegative patients, there was no significant difference between the therapeutic regimen (Table 2). In this study, the therapeutic regimen (treatment with p38/Akt) was superior in terms of survival and plasma drug resistance (Table 2). In HIV-1-seronegative patients, there was no difference between the therapeutic regimen (treatment with p38/Akt) and the treatment with p38/Akt in terms of plasma drug resistance (Table 2). In contrast, in HIV-1-seronegative patients, there was no difference between the therapeutic regimen (treatment with p38/Akt) and the treatment with p38/Akt (Table 2). Therefore, these data suggest that p38/Akt is more effective in treating HIV-1-dorne patients than in HIV-1-seronegative patients.

In the present study, p38/Akt was not effective in treating HIV-1-seronegative patients. The patients in the current study had a mean age of 76.04 years. The median duration of illness was 12.09 years. In addition, the patient was treated with p38/Akt (1 mg/kg daily). However, p38/Akt was not effective in the treatment of HIV-1-seronegative patients. In the present study, the patient had a mean age of 65.16 years. The median duration of illness was 10.65 years. In addition, there was no significant difference in the duration of illness between the patients in the current study and the patient in the patients in the current study. Therefore, these data suggest that p38/Akt is not an effective antifungal therapy for HIV-1-seronegative patients.
