## Abstract
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has seen increasing interest in the treatment of patients with aspergillosis with metastatic suppression. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are crucial to prevent further progression and mortality. However, the immunopathogenesis of IPA in neutropenic patients remains poorly understood. We report the case of a 66-year-old woman with metastatic colic Aspergillus (MAC) infection who developed IPA with metastatic suppression after initiating anti-MAC therapy. She had received oral fluconazole therapy for MAC for 1 month. This was followed by maintenance therapy with voriconazole for 1 month. She had improved clinical outcomes, she had a low CD4 cell count, and she had a tolerable high-dose fluconazole therapy. IPA in neutropenic patients is a rare but important complication that needs to be reported to initiate appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy are crucial to prevent further progression and mortality.


## Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are highly conserved and are found in all eukaryotic cells [1]. AMPs play key roles in biology, communication, and even survival in a hostile environment [2]. Besides their role in cellular immunity, AMPs have important biological functions in pathogen control [3]. For example, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus cereus can develop resistance to different antibiotics [4] and can survive in acidic or alkaline environments [5]. The Gram-negative bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can survive in extreme environments and is able to cause resistance to a wide range of antibiotics [6]. AMPs are also found in many bacteria that can cause disease in humans [7]. Some of the most common infectious diseases are respiratory and urinary tract infections [8]. Among them, Gram-negative infections are the most common, leading to over 300,000 deaths annually worldwide [9].

The genus of the bacterium known to cause nosocomial infections is Streptococcus pneumoniae. It belongs to the subfamilies Streptococcus, Actinomacillus, and Actinomacillus. The majority of species are Gram-negative, with approximately 150 described species [10]. The majority of these are associated with nosocomial infections in the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract [11]. However, the most common of these species is associated with infections in the very young age group [12].


## Methods
The efficiency of RT-PCR was calculated as the ratio of the values of relative expression of the qPCR samples relative to those of control sample. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

2.5. Antibodies and Agents
The human ß-actin gene, which has been previously used as a marker of cytokine-related responses, was used as a marker for the assay of macrophage inflammatory response. The ß-actin gene was characterized by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in C. albicans, C. albicans, and C. glabrata cells, as previously described [17]. The qRT-PCR reaction mixture contained the following standard protocol: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. For TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-12, the concentrations were measured in 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) and were normalized to that of normal serum. The resulting relative expression levels were calculated as the ratio of the values of the values of the quantified samples compared with that of the untreated control. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

2.6. Molecular Type Identification
The nucleotide sequences of the mutants were analyzed by PCR using the primer pairs of the MOTHUR program (http://mothur.org/index.php/mothur/) and their specific activity. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the 18S rRNA gene was amplified using primers ITS1 (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). The PCR product was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and then cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega).


## Results
In order to evaluate whether the GM-induced BM-MB-2 cells have any memory against the BM-MB-2 cells, we co-immunoprecipitated BM-MB-2 and BM-MB-2 cell line (Fig 2A. We found that the BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells were not in a highly prevalent form but in a less severe form (Fig 2A). These results suggest that BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells do not have any memory against the BM-MB-2 cells.

BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 Cells Are Bimodal, but not Bimodal, to the End of the Endothelial Cell Wall
In order to investigate whether the BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells were in the presence of the antibody, we made a separate series of experiments using the GM-induced mouse BM-MB-2 cell line, and the antibodies were detected in the BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells. BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells were not in a highly prevalent form (Fig 2B). The results from the two separate experiments suggested that BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells are not in a strongly prevalent form, and that the BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells may have a unique memory against BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells.

BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 Cells Are Bimodal, but Not Bimodal to the Endothelial Cell Wall
The BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells were in a highly prevalent form (Fig 2C). These results suggest that BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells are not in a strongly prevalent form, and that BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells may have a unique memory against BM-MB-2 BM-MB-2 cells.


## Discussion

The results revealed that CD25, CD33, and ECM were expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a primary component of MHC class II cell line and ECM belongs to this cell lin. In contrast to the CD25 and CD33, which are mainly expressed in the MHC class II cell line, CD25 and CD33 are expressed in the MHC class II cell line. Both CD25 and CD33 were expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a component of MHC class II cell line.

The molecular basis of the antibodies and the expression of CD25, CD33, and ECM in the MHC class II cell line and the MHC class II cell line were studied in detail. The molecular basis of the antibodies was determined by the use of the MHC class II cell line and ECM. The results showed that CD25 and CD33 were expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a component of MHC class II cell line. The expression of CD25 and CD33 was expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a component of MHC class II cell line.

The results of the molecular basis of the antibodies were further studied by the use of the MHC class II cell line and the ECM. The results showed that CD25 and CD33 were expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a component of MHC class II cell line.

The results showed that the CD25, CD33, and ECM of the cell line were expressed in the MHC class II cell line, which indicated that CD25 is a component of MHC class II cell line.
