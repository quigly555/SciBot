## Abstract
Concordance analysis, which uses a range of genetic markers to predict sex determination, is known to be laborious and that fluctuations in exposure to antifungal treatments can introduce genetic variation that undermines normal phenotypes. However, few studies have used concomitantly measured genetic variability to predict sex determination.

We used a genome-wide, non-randomized collection of C. albicans mating-type loci from transgenic mice and wild type mice to identify genomic islands containing variable regions of sex determination. The clinicopathological characteristics of the different populations were analyzed.


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections has been increasing worldwide. Over the past two decades, intensive antifungal therapy has led to an enormous increase in the number of immunocompromised patients. This is not only associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, but also results in the development of a number of pathogenic fungal infections, including candidiasis and mucormycosis [1-3]. The rising incidence of fungal infections has led to a continuous need for new antifungal agents. This is especially true for azoles, a class of antifungal agents that include echinocandins, which inhibit the synthesis of the ß-1,3-glucan synthase enzyme of the fungal cell wall [4]. Although these agents are active against many clinically relevant yeasts and molds, they have poor affinity for ß-1,3-glucans, which make them difficult to be effectively used as antifungal agents. Thus, the development of new antifungal agents is urgently needed.

The therapeutic potential of ß-lactams and other ß-lactams is recognized as a result of their excellent bioavailability [5-7]. ß-lactams are relatively low in fat [8] and lipid [9, 10] content, and their antifungal activity can be increased through various mechanisms. ß-lactams are generally prepared as monomeric chemical structures with five major subunits (ß-lactam, ß-lactam, ß-lactam, butyrosinase) or more rarely with four major subunits (ß-lactam, ß-lactam, butyrosinase). ß-lactams are characterized by a high lipophilicity of the ketones, with a low molecular weight (1 to 5 g) and short hydrophilicities (0.35 to 0.66 g/mol).


## Methods
) and Beaufus malicornis (CATG_0077.1), and the best results were obtained with the software MultiComparison v1.7.1 [40].

DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing
Genomic DNA from each isolate was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The ITS region was amplified using the primers ITS1 and ITS4 [41] and the primers LR0R and LR5 [42] with the appropriate barcode. The amplified fragments were purified by PCR using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the purified PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Each DNA fragment was purified by Qiagen PCR purification kit and then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. A barcode for each DNA fragment was added to the sequences and the sequences were assembled using CLUSTAL X [43].


## Results
Mabresi and .D. Levey) were investigated. Compared to the Beauf Volvariella species, the V. volvacea and V. vinacea isolates had a larger number of mononuclear, multinucleate cells (Additional file 10: Figure S3). The V. volvacea and V. vinacea isolates were also observed to be more thermotolerant than the Beauf Volvariella species (Additional file 10: Figure S3).

The V. volvacea and V. vinacea isolates were more sensitive to the fungicide-mimicking agents fungicide-susceptible (FLP-susceptible) and fungicide-resistant (FLP-resistant) (Fig 2). The V. volvacea and V. vinacea isolates were more tolerant to the fungicide-susceptible agents fungicide-susceptible and fungicide-resistant than the Beauf Volvariella species (Fig 2). The V. vinacea isolates were more resistant to the fungicide-susceptible agents fungicide-susceptible and fungicide-resistant than the Beauf Volvariella species (Fig 2). The V. vinacea isolates were more sensitive to the fungicide-resistant agents fungicide-resistant than the Beauf Volvariella species (Fig 2).

In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing
The MICs for AMB and the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by DMSO-dextrose, and MICs for AMB and the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA. The MICs for AMB and the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA, respectively. The MICs for AMB and the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA. The MICs for the AMB and fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA, respectively.

The MICs for the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA, respectively. The MICs for the AMB and the fungicide-susceptible agents were determined by TIC and MICFA, respectively.


## Discussion
cinerea (BCV. Both BVV and B. cinerea have a constitutively high degree of CAX (Figure 2C), which is consistent with previous reports [28], [29], [30]. The BVV CAX is constitutively expressed in B. cinerea, but BVV is constitutively expressed in B. cinerea [28], [29]. B. cinerea, B. eubayanus and B. eubayanus have a very different CAX profile, with an intermediate degree of CAX (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [29], [30]. B. eubayanus has a higher degree of CAX than B. cinerea [29], [30]. The BVV CAX has a constitutively high degree of CAX (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [28], [29]. B. eubayanus has a slightly higher degree of CAX than B. cinerea [29], [30]. The CAX profiles of B. eubayanus and B. eubayanus were higher in the presence of Ca^2+ (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [28], [29]. In addition, the BVV CAX profile was significantly higher in the presence of Ca^2+ (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [29], [30]. However, this is not the case for B. cinerea, where the levels of CAX were significantly lower in the presence of Ca^2+ (Figure 2D).

The higher degree of CAX expression in B. cinerea than in the Beauf-Barr virus suggests that the Beauf virus is constitutively expressed at a higher level than in the Beauf-Barr virus. This result is similar to previous studies that showed that B. cinerea can be infected with a strain of B. cinerea that is constitutively expressed in the presence of Ca^2+ (A. Gonzalez et al.) and that B. cinerea can be infected with a strain of B. cinerea that is constitutively expressed in the presence of Ca^2+ (A. Gonzalez et al.) [29].
