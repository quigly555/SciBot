## Abstract
The genus Neocosmospora (Corynespora, Fungi) is presently treated as the sole source of airborne filamentous fungi, and until recently it was considered to be confined to the tropical region.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by yeasts belonging to the genus Cryptococcus. It is an opportunistic fungal infection mainly affecting patients with compromised immune systems such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the most common opportunistic infections, which results in death in 30% of patients with AIDS [2]. While the virus is responsible for almost 40% of AIDS-related deaths worldwide, the disease is also a major cause of mortality in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [3]. As a result of its widespread distribution, C. neoformans is classified into two varieties, C.

## Results
albicans-infected mice succumb to infection by day 8 after inoculatio. This is the first report of a yeast-macrophage-attracting agent that has been shown to stimulate C. albicans-induced macrophage activation in mice. The critical role of C. albicans in the maintenance of normal cell morphology and viability is expected to be demonstrated by macrophage-associated cell death [29]. C. albicans infected mice are highly sensitive to anti-CD11^+ T-cell treatment [31]. Therefore, we were also interested in examining the degree of cell death from the host during infection. The majority of human neutrophils were killed by day 1 after infection, and the percentage of neutrophils that survived was approximately 30% for all experiments (Figure 2). The viability of the host was also assessed using a cell-killing assay that allows for the evaluation of the viability of cells in the blood. The 100% viability of all neutrophils was lost by day 6 after infection and the survival rate was similar between those infected with C. albicans and control mice (data not shown). However, the viability of the neutrophils was significantly reduced by day 14 after infection, which is indicative of the early neutrophil death (Figure 2).

Microglia Are Involved in Th17 Activation and Pulmonary Survival
The first and most important difference between the two C. albicans-infected mice was the difference in the percentage of blood cells that were killed by day 1 after infection. The neutrophil killing by day 1 after infection was significantly higher than that by day 28 after infection (Figure 3). C. albicans infection was also significantly more successful in the neutrophil group than in the yeast group (Figure 3). The survival rate in the yeast group was approximately 40% compared to the survival rate in the C. albicans group. The fungal burden in the lung and the total cell numbers in the blood were similar in the two groups (Figure 3). The C. albicans-infected mice were more resistant to pulmonary infection than the C. albicans-control group (Figure 3).

Iron overload increased the survival rate in C. albicans-infected mice
Iron overload induced a protective immune response against C.


## Discussion
They are not only the largest population in the population, but also the most integrate. They are involved in a large number of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration. The CD4^+ population is typically the most powerful in the body and it can be the first line of defense for the body's defenses against pathogens. They have been shown to protect cells against various types of infections, including microorganisms and cancer. Moreover, they can protect against infection by both antigen presenting and non-presenting cells.

The CD4^+ population also includes CD8^+ T cells. They are activated by phagocytosis and, hence, are important for the innate immune response. However, their importance is less well understood in humans. The CD8^+ population is an important group for the innate immune response, with an increased number of CD4^+ T cells and a decreased number of CD8^+ T cells in the final stages of infection. The numbers of CD8^+ T cells and CD8^+ T cells depend on the age of the mice and the immune status of the mice. It is also known that the number of CD8^+ T cells and CD8^+ T cells can vary from one mouse strain to another, and also the mice have different numbers of CD4^+ cells and CD8^+ T cells. The CD4^+ T cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response, in particular in the development of adaptive immunity. The CD4^+ T cells that can be activated by phagocytosis are thought to have an important role in protecting the immune system against pathogens. CD4^+ T cells are activated in the majority of individuals, and they are the most potent group in the immune response. CD4^+ T cells are highly induced by phagocytosis, and they are highly induced by the phagocytic activity of pathogens. In this study, we found that CD4^+ T cells are activated by phagocytosis and that their numbers are decreased significantly, indicating that phagocytosis plays an important role in the ability of CD4^+ T cells to protect against pathogen infections.
