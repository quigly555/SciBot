## Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of the ethanolic extract of the root of Embellisia caespitosa against Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum audouin as well as Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

The extract was prepared by maceration in ethyl acetate and then precipitated with the triterpenoids 3-O-a-glucan and 3-O-a-arabinofuranose as the feed components. The concentrations of these compounds were then determined in the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-resolved broth serial microdilution method.

The MIC and MFC were determined using the standard recommended protocols for determination of the antifungal activity of the extract. The results were further confirmed using the broth serial microdilution method.

Results showed that the extract had a MIC of 0.


## Introduction
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is the most common colonizer of the skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of humans [1]. When C. albicans is introduced in healthy individuals, it is expected to become a commensal of the colonizing host skin [2]. This is mainly due to its intrinsic ability to form thick-walled biofilms. These are formed in response to environmental stimuli such as host immune status, adhesins, mucus and extracellular traps, such as keratinocytes and epithelial cells [3]. Biofilms are defined as structural communities of cells that are embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) [4]. EPS have been associated with virulence in C. albicans [5], [6]. Biofilms are a group of cells that are capable of forming long-lived scars on the skin [7], [8].


## Methods

Inoculation of 10-week-old-N<U+0394>sp. in mice
Dose-dependent reduction of hemoglobin in animals was induced in a murine model of disseminated cryptococcosis [34]. For the treatment, the control group (no treatment) was infected with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the wild-type N<U+0394>spp. in PBS. The hemolymph was collected at day 3 after infection and diluted to 10^6 CFU/ml in PBS. This hemolymph was plated on solid potato dextrose agar medium to determine fungal load. The control group (with no treatment) was infected with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the wild-type N<U+0394>spp. in PBS. The hemolymph was collected at day 3 after infection and diluted to 10^6 CFU/ml in PBS.

For the treatment, the control group (without treatment) was infected with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the wild-type N<U+0394>spp. in PBS. The hemolymph was collected at day 3 after infection and diluted to 10^6 CFU/ml in PBS. This hemolymph was plated on solid potato dextrose agar medium to determine fungal load. The control group (with no treatment) was infected with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the wild-type N<U+0394>spp. in PBS. The hemolymph was collected at day 3 after infection and diluted to 10^6 CFU/ml in PBS.

Western blotting
The hemoglobin of infected mice was measured in the hemolymph by the method of Boonmee and Peterson [35]. For this purpose, the hemoglobin in the hemolymph was normalized to the hemoglobin in the control group. The hemoglobin in the control group was subjected to 1-x dilution. The hemolymph was collected at day 3 after infection and diluted to 10^6 CFU/ml in PBS. The hemolymph was also plated on solid potato dextrose agar medium to determine fungal load. The control group (without treatment) was infected with 1 × 10^6 CFU of the wild-type N<U+0394>spp. in PBS.

 2000)

The first complication was the donor cytoskeleton failure of the donor (Pivin et a., 2000) and the inability of the donor to promote intraparasal viremia in the donor (Pivin et al., 2000). The second complication was complication of intraparasal viremia using the donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) and the inability of the donor to induce the intraparasal viremia in the donor (Pivin et al., 2000). The complications of uniparental survival using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) were discussed below.

In the order of complication, the complication of intraparasal viremia using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) required the donor to be in a low-dose dose of chemotherapy for a short period of time (Pivin et al., 2000) before the complication occurred. The complication of intraparasal viremia using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) required the donor to be in a low-dose dose of chemotherapy for a prolonged period of time (Pivin et al., 2000).

For all three complications, the donor cytoskeleton failed to promote intraparasal viremia in the donor (Pivin et al., 2000) prior to the complication. The complication of intraparasal viremia using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) required the donor to be in a low dose of chemotherapy for a period of time before the complication occurred. The complication of intraparasal viremia using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000) required the donor to be in a low dose of chemotherapy for a prolonged period of time (Pivin et al., 2000).

In all three cases of complication of uniparental survival using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al., 2000), the donor cytoskeleton failed to promote intraparasal viremia in the donor (Pivin et al., 2000) prior to the complication. The complication of uniparental survival using the Coryneum donor cytoskeleton (Pivin et al.


## Discussion
In contrast to the lack of the mycobacterial gene ACT1 in either donor or recipient mice, the host cytoskeleton of the recipient mice is dramatically different from that of the recipient mic. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific mycobacterial gene ACT1 is found in a relative lower relative to the pool of human genes. In contrast, in recipient mice, ACT1 is expressed in the cytosol of the recipient mice and the mycobacterial gene ACT1 is expressed in the cytosol of the donor mice and the recipient mice, respectively. This is in contrast to the situation in the recipient mice, where ACT1 is expressed in the cytosol of the donor mice and the recipient mice, respectively. Thus, the cytosol dynamics in the recipient mice and the recipient mice suggest that the cytosol dynamics in recipient mice are also altered in the recipient mice than in the recipient mice.

We also identified the cytosol dynamics in recipient mice for the ABC transporter ABCE1. ABCE1 encodes the 1,6-dihydro-N-acetyl-ß-D-galactosaminidase that is required for the formation of heterochromatin in a human mycobacterium-specific manner [34]. The cytosol dynamics in recipient mice for ABCE1 is similar to the situation in mouse, suggesting that the cytosol dynamics in mouse mice are altered in comparison to that in mouse rats [35].

ABCE1 encodes a mycobacterial gene that is highly expressed in recipient mice. Here, we found that the cytosol dynamics in recipient mice for the ABC transporter ABCE1 were similar to the situation in mouse rats. The mycobacterial gene ABCE1 is highly expressed in recipient mice. The cytosol dynamics in recipient mice for ABCE1 are similar to that in mouse rats. This is in contrast to the situation in mice, where the cytosol dynamics in mice are altered in comparison to that in mouse rats [35].
