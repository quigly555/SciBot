## Abstract
The expansion of genomes from Bacteria and Archaea has dramatically shaped the complexity and diversity of the multicellular eukaryote communities that developed during evolution. The diversity and versatility of eukaryotic genomes has been attributed to the large number of protein-coding genes that have yet to be transcribed and the difficulty in assigning appropriate functional roles to these genes. Whole genome resequencing of diverse lineages in order to generate a pool of functionally diverse eukaryotic genomes is a necessary step to provide a more complete picture of the evolutionary trajectory of eukaryotes.

We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on a diverse sample set of 60 eukaryotic genomes from the three phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Archaea.


## Introduction
The use of fungi for the industrial production of proteins has increased in the past decades. As a result, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing proteins have been found in abundance in fungi. Mutations in the conserved hydrolases, the target of the currently used antibiotics, are often found in fungal species and, therefore, represent the main drivers of drug resistance. The use of fungi for industrial enzymes is a problem, because of their lack of functional enzymes, they can degrade complex materials and contain enzymes that are toxic to the host organisms. The need to find new enzymes is due to the high cost of the enzymes. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of alternative techniques for the synthesis of enzymes. Microscopy is a new technique that allows for the identification of enzymes that have no known function in the presence of an external solvent. The number of available enzymes is limited and requires fewer resources.

Synthetic synthesis has been found to be a powerful approach to the discovery of new enzymes. Although the use of an external solvent has been used to transform enzymes in past decades, it has never been successfully applied for the industrial application. In the past, commercial enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and glycoside hydrolases were synthesized using petroleum ether as the starting material. Nowadays, hydrolytic enzymes are found in all kingdoms of life. Some of them are in use in industrial applications, such as amino acid aminotransferases, glycoside hydrolases, lipase and proteinases. Other enzymes are used for the production of proteins, which have different functions in the presence of an external solvent. Since enzymes can be synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass, they are used as the carbon source for enzymes.


## Methods
fumigatus: a dual-site ELISA with intraperitoneal injection of 10% isoniazide (Sigma-Aldrich) into the thorax of a rabbit erythrocyte cell line erythrocytes (ATCC 25922) in accordance with the protocol established by the Clinical Laboratory of University Hospital, Chiang Mai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chiang Mai, Thailand (CFWUCHM. The ELISA protocol was adapted from the previous report (Hapeng et al., 2015) with modifications. Briefly, 10^4 parasites were seeded in a 96-well plate and added to each well. After a 15-min incubation at 37°C and 5% CO_2, the cells were stimulated with 10 µM of FITC-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with the following antibodies: anti-human IgG (1:2,000 dilution), anti-human CD16/32 (1:1,000 dilution) and anti-human CD11b (1:1,000 dilution). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and then incubated with the following antibodies: anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000 dilution), anti-human CD11c (1:1,000 dilution) and anti-human CD4 (1:1,000 dilution) in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with the following antibodies: anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000 dilution), anti-human IFN-<U+03B3> (1:1,000 dilution) and anti-human CD8 (1:1,000 dilution) in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO_2.


## Results
We used the anti-parasite drug Epinephrine (E) to treat Paracoccidioidomycosis in mic. We used this therapy for various reasons, including: (1) it is not a toxic agent and the E is not as effective as that of the E alone, (2) the E alone is not as effective as the E alone and (3) the E alone can cause more than 2.5-fold mortality (Figure 5). The E alone did not cause any death in the mice. These results suggest that the E alone does not cause mortality in humans, but that the E alone may be beneficial for treatment of Paracoccidioidomycosis.

Microsomal Integrity in Mice Depletion Model
We next investigated the integrity of the Meningoencephalitis-associated microsomal membrane in mice after the microsomal membrane was removed from the brain by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE is a technique used to monitor membrane fluidity in microsomes. The SDS-PAGE technique detects a small amount of the cell membrane protein during microsomal membrane permeabilization [18]. The treatment of the mice with SDS-PAGE technique caused the macrophage to produce more Meningoencephalitis, which in turn triggered the immune response of the immune cells in the brain (Figure 6). We also found that the microsomal membrane was stable in the mice after the SDS-PAGE technique. We further observed that the microsomal membrane was not permeabilized by the SDS-PAGE technique (Figure 6).

Dynamics of the Meningoencephalitis Microsome Following Meningoencephalitis
To understand the dynamics of the Meningoencephalitis microsome following infection with Paracoccidioidomycosis in the murine model, we studied the Meningoencephalitis microsome after the infection with Paracoccidioidomycosis. The Meningoencephalitis microsome after the infection with Paracoccidioidomycosis was maintained in the presence of SDS-PAGE and Etest (data not shown).


## Discussion
The patient presented with a complete recovery of his immunity to . tuberculosis and, as a result, a complete recovery of the infection in the patient.

Meningoencephalitis is an uncommon and subclinical disease in which M. tuberculosis and other pathogens are present. Patients with M. tuberculosis usually present with a chronic disease, such as indolent tuberculosis, tuberculosis, or the autoimmune disease caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus (TBM). Infection of the lungs, abscesses, or other lesions is the most common presentation. In addition, immunodeficiency, such as autoimmune disease or disseminated infection, can also occur in M. tuberculosis patients. Meningoencephalitis is also uncommon in HIV patients. Most patients with HIV have a CD4 count of <100 cells/µL and the median CD4 cell counts are 6-11 (15). In HIV patients, CD4 cell counts are generally in the low to mid-60% range (16, 17). However, in the majority of patients, CD4 cell counts in the low-to-mid-60% range are <200 cells/µL and are usually below 200 cells/µL (17). This may be due to the fact that CD4 cell counts are usually below 50 cells/µL (16).

The diagnosis of Meningoencephalitis can be made by the use of a classical immunological assay, such as monoclonal antibodies or a specific combination of antibodies and immunoglobulins, or by using a specific mucosal antigen, such as the Listeria monocytogenes antigen (ML-EMSA) or the bacterial mucus phagocytosis antigen (Bovis-2D) (18). All patients have a CD4 count of =200 cells/µL, but antigen titers are typically >100 cells/µL (16). Patients with Meningoencephalitis typically present with a rapidly progressive disease course with a high frequency of respiratory distress and an elevated protein level.

The diagnosis of Meningoencephalitis is challenging.
