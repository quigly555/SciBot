## Abstract
The genus Pseudoviridae is presently treated as a member of Dothideomycetes, but current data does not support this. To address this issue, a new genealogy is provided for each of the five species of Pseudoviridae (P. heveanensis, P. heveanatiale, P. hevitianus, P. viminalis, P. waksmanii, P. xylopiati, and P. yamikonda). A new genus, Pseudovirffernata, is proposed to accommodate this genus. Pseudovirffernata contains three species, P. marginalise, P. rutheniae, and P. fishera, and five novel species. Pseudovirffernata is described as new to science from France and is the only known family to have lost its previous known name, P. scirpii. The novel species P. xylopiati is also described from France. The new family Pseudovirffernanaceae is established to accommodate these new species.


## Introduction
Due to its broad antimicrobial spectrum and the ability to penetrate multiple layers of host defense, L. pneumophila has been considered an ideal animal model for studying the pathogenesis of bacterial diseases. In this study, we have examined the antimicrobial activity of L. pneumophila against a range of four major pathogens in a mammalian host. We demonstrate that L. pneumophila is able to successfully infect multiple mammalian hosts, including macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, and to survive and replicate intracellularly inside macrophages, neutrophils, and caspofungin, in a manner similar to that of S. cerevisiae. The infection of macrophages by L. pneumophila is blocked by targeting the MAM2-dependent pathway, which involves the accumulation of ATP-binding protein (ABC) and subsequent activation of the complex. The complex mediates the formation of a complex in which different enzymes (ABCDEA, ABCDEB, and ABCG) catalyze the catabolism of the metabolically active substrate. As a result, cells secrete large amounts of small molecules that can be targeted by L. pneumophila. The selectivity of the ABCDEA, ABCDEB, and ABCG in the ABCDEA complex is highly dynamic, and the complex is able to manipulate the expression of ABC from multiple cell types in a single reaction.


## Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (No.3) of the Federal University of Goiás (Protocol No. 10-2016-06-016, Agro-Ethics.gov.br/Protocol/10/5/16/2016) and was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Mice
Female C57BL/6 (FITC-dextran-/-) and C57BL/6 C6J background mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Federal University of Goiás (UFGC). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Federal University of Goiás (AFGC-FGC). Mice were used in this study on two separate occasions.


## Results
neoformans and . gattii isolates obtained from the three hosts were compared in the laboratory. The results of susceptibility tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

The MIC_90 and MIC_90/MIC_90 of all the isolates were similar, indicating that the C. neoformans isolates are highly susceptible to the antifungal drugs. However, the susceptibility of the C. gattii isolates was higher than the MIC_90 of all the isolates. The MIC_90 values of all the C. gattii isolates were higher than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. gattii isolates were lower than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates were higher than the MIC_90 values of the C. gattii isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. gattii isolates were higher than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. gattii isolates were lower than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. gattii isolates were lower than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates.

The MIC_90 of all the C. gattii isolates was higher than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of all the C. gattii isolates were lower than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates. The MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates were lower than the MIC_90 values of the C. neoformans isolates.

## Discussion
However, the resistance to triazoles in the pathogen also depends on the environmental conditions of the infection, which may differ from that in the case of Cryptococcus neoformans [32. In the present study, it was found that the antifungal resistance of C. neoformans was lower than that of C. gattii (Table 1). As C. neoformans is a cell type with a broad spectrum of resistance to antifungal agents [33, 34], the resistance to triazoles in C. neoformans could be attributed to the decrease in the number of susceptible and resistant C. gattii strains, and the increased resistance of susceptible C. gattii strains compared to resistant C. neoformans strains. The increased resistance of resistant C. neoformans strains compared to resistant C. gattii could be due to the presence of triazoles in the drug classes used in clinical trials, since triazoles are reported to be associated with severe adverse events in patients with cryptococcosis [35, 36].

The resistance of C. neoformans to triazoles was not increased in the present study. The resistance to triazoles was increased in C. gattii strains of C. neoformans (Table 1). The triazole resistance was significantly increased in C. gattii strain CGMCC 4547 (Table 1), since it was increased by 20-25% in the case of CGMCC 4547 (Table 1).

In addition, the concentration of triazoles in the final concentration of triazole was increased by 32% (Table 1). The triazole concentration in the final concentration of triazole was significantly increased by 35% in C. neoformans strains CGMCC 4547 (Table 1), CGMCC 4547 (Table 1) and CGMCC 455 (Table 1) (Table 1).

The resistance to triazoles was significantly increased in C. neoformans strain CGMCC 4547 (Table 1), since the triazole resistance was increased by 25% in the case of CGMCC 4547 (Table 1).

The triazole concentration in the final concentration of triazole was significantly increased by 38% in C.
