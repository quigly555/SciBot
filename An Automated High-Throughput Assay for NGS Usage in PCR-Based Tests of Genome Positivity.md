## Abstract
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a leading cause of death in Cambodian adults. The morbidity and mortality of IFD are increasing in recent years. The available antifungal arsenal is limited in most cases due to the high toxicity of many toxic compounds, and the immense toxicity caused by the numerous drug-resistant fungi. Thus, there is a need for new antifungal agents.


## Introduction
The family Lophiaceae, including all plants and animals, consists of approximately 50 genera and more than 400 species [1]. Approximately 75 to 80% of known species of Lophiaceae are monotypic [2]. Most species are invasive plant pathogens and are able to cause disease in both humans and animals. Currently, no effective control strategy is feasible against the pathogenic species of Lophiaceae. Therefore, new strategies to combat this deadly disease are urgently needed.


## Methods
Phylogenetic Analysis of the Clustal Wencesm Class
The clustal Wencesm class was originally defined by SÃ¸rensen et al.


## Results
The NGS technique is highly effective for the prediction of genomic functions of rice blast fungus and is used widely for genotyping rice blast genes and for the evaluation of genomic functio. The NGS technique was also used for the evaluation of fungal pathogens with which rice is associated. In the present study, the study was conducted in a laboratory environment. The results are presented in Table 3.

The results of the NGS assay are presented in Table 3. The average NGS accuracy of the PCR-based test set was 70.1%. In terms of NGS accuracy, the average accuracy of the test set was 97.1%. The average NGS accuracy of the test set for the other test set was 89.5%. The average NGS accuracy of the test set for the other test set for the rice blast fungus was 90.1%.

3.3. Paired Antifungal Assay of Paired Antifungal Assay for Paired Antifungal Susceptibility Test
Paired antifungal assay of rice blast fungus was used to evaluate the Paired Antifungal Susceptibility Test (PASTA) (Table 4). In the PASTA assay, the PASTA assay was performed using only the eight-locus primers for all the isolates. The results showed that the PASTA assay was not performed with any of the primers with the 16S rRNA gene, as indicated by the negative control. This is in contrast, the PASTA assay was performed using only primers with the 16S rRNA gene. The results of the PASTA assay are presented in Table 5. The results showed that the PASTA assay was not performed with the primers with the 16S rRNA gene, as indicated by the negative control. This is in contrast, the PASTA assay was performed using only primers with the 16S rRNA gene.

3.4. Detection of Paired Antifungal Susceptibility Test
The PASTA assay was performed using the eight-locus primers for all the isolates. The results showed that the PASTA assay was not performed with any of the primers with the 16S rRNA gene, as indicated by the negative control.


## Discussion
The experiments were performed in vitro with microarray experiment. NGS was used as the initial step in the analysis, as well as for further experiments, including PCR-based assays. The results were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the results were further analyzed by using flow cytometry and real-time PCR. In the present study, a flow cytometry-based system was used to analyze the gene expression in the NGS-treated strain, and the results were also analyzed by flow cytometry and real-time PCR.

In the present study, the results were compared with those reported by other authors. Wei et al. (2015) reported that, in the presence of a minimal medium, the NGS expression levels of some genes were increased in a yeast compared to that of the control strain. Saldi et al. (2015) reported that, in a mixed medium, the highest number of genes with high expression in the NGS-treated strain was found in a medium supplemented with glucose and in the presence of ethanol, but the expression levels of these genes were decreased in the presence of glucose, but the gene expression levels were increased in the presence of ethanol. In the present study, the same groups also found that the most active gene expression in the NGS-treated strain was hmg1, which was expressed at a high level in the presence of glucose. The results revealed that the NGS-treated strain showed a significant increase in the expression of hmg1, which was expressed at a high level in the presence of glucose. The expression levels of hmg1 were also increased in the presence of ethanol. The results showed that the gene expression levels of hmg1 were increased in the presence of ethanol, and the expression of hmg1 was increased in the presence of glucose, and the gene expression levels were increased in the presence of ethanol. This result indicates that the enzyme in the NGS-treated strain, hmg1, is involved in the production of the enzymes in the synthesis of the three key enzymes in the enzyme pathway, including the heme biosynthesis, the anion biosynthesis, and the nitric oxide metabolism.

In contrast, the gene expression level of the gene hmg1 was decreased in the presence of ethanol.
