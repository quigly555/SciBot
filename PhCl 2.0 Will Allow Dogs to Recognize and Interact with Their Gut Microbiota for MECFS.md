## Abstract
Glycans interact with a wide range of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and more than 30 different fungal species and the same microbiota may provide for additional host-pathogen interactions in some cases. This study investigated fungal-bacterial interactions associated with the oral cavity.

A total of 541 oral samples collected from 59 dogs were studied and 366 (76.1%) fungal isolates were identified. These included 488 (96.4%) fungal strains belonging to 2 phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) and other fungi species, including 45 species belonging to other phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Ascomycota). An analytical sensitivity analysis of fungal isolates was performed and most of the fungal isolates showed high enzymatic activity. Among the 366 yeasts, Cryptococcus sp.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that is primarily associated with HIV/AIDS patients [1,2]. C. neoformans typically manifests in pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and skin manifestations [3-7]. The most common clinical manifestations of cryptococcal infection are as a result of HIV infection, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute meningoencephalitis, mycetoma, cryptococcal pneumonia, cryptococcemia, and meningoencephalitis [1,2,8,9]. Cryptoccemia is the most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis in HIV/AIDS patients, and is an AIDS-defining illness [1,2].

In this article, we describe a patient with C. neoformans meningoencephalitis who was successfully treated with amphotericin B (AMB) and itraconazole (ITC) combined with fluconazole for the treatment of this rare presentation.


## Methods
The dogs were housed in a specific pathogen-free roo. Dogs that exhibited signs of fungal infection were humanely euthanized. The FIC index (FIC) is a quantitative measure of morbidity and mortality [33], [34]. For each dog, 3 doses of the M. tuberculosis complex were administered consecutively. After the first dose, the dog was euthanized and the remaining animals were humanely euthanized. The second dose of the M. tuberculosis complex was administered to the third dose of the complex, while the first one was given to the first dog. The results of each dog were recorded at the end of the experiment. The FIC index is calculated as follows:

Mice that were killed at the end of the experiment were excluded from the study. The IACUC established that the percentage of mortality due to ME/CFS was calculated from the number of animals that were alive after the end of the experiment and the number of animals that were alive after the end of the experiment. For the disease control group, the animals that were humanely euthanized and euthanized at the end of the experiment were included. For the mice that were euthanized at the end of the experiment, the animals that were humanely euthanized at the end of the experiment and euthanized at the end of the experiment were included. The results of the present study were recorded at the end of the experiment.

## Results
albicans and . albicans cultures on sheep intestinal microorganisms and the identification of the gut microbiota was used to investigate whether there is any overlap in the co-culture method. The co-culture technique was used to examine whether the co-culture can be used to introduce a new host to C. albicans and C. albicans on the sheep intestinal microorganisms. The co-culture method was used to examine the co-culture method’s performance in introducing a new host to C. albicans and C. albicans on the sheep intestinal microorganisms and the identification of the gut microbiota. Co-culture method was used to examine the co-culture method’s performance in introducing a new host to C. albicans and C. albicans on the sheep intestinal microorganisms and the identification of the gut microbiota.

2.2. Isolation of Microbiota from the Microbial Community of the Human Gut
The isolated microbes were collected from the human gut and were used for the isolation of different microorganisms from the human gut. The first step of the study was the isolation of different microorganisms from the human gut by using a commercially available antibiotic, ethyl acetate (EAA), as well as by using commercial Gram-negative antibiotic, chloramphenicol (PCM) for the isolation of different microorganisms. The number of isolated microbes was investigated in the microbial community using an ELISA kit. The number of isolated microbes was compared to the average number of isolated microbes.


## Discussion
We performed a large scale study in the dog house and performed a few experiments to further understand the properties of ME/CFS metabolism in dogs and cat. For this purpose, we first performed a general analysis of the presence of ME/CFS in the dog house. We hypothesized that the presence of ME/CFS would increase the microbiome of the dog and cat house. We then compared the presence of ME/CFS to the average gene expression levels in the dog and cat house. The results showed that ME/CFS increases the abundance of some genes in the dog and cat house. Therefore, we believe that this observation is important in the future study to evaluate the feasibility of ME/CFS in canine and cat host-microbe interactions.

Our study also showed that ME/CFS increases the abundance of some genes in the dog and cat house. This was also confirmed by quantitative real time PCR and mass spectrometry, which revealed that the total number of ME/CFS gene were increased by ME/CFS in the dog house. These results suggest that the high abundance of ME/CFS in the dog house was due to the high abundance of ME/CFS. This result is in agreement with a study in which Me/CFS was found to increase the abundance of MALDI-TOF MS in the human gut. In addition, a previous study reported that the abundance of ME/CFS was increased by ME/CFS in mice during inflammation [38]. Therefore, this finding is in agreement with our current results in which the abundance of ME/CFS in the dog house was significantly increased by ME/CFS in canine and cat.

The results of the current study showed that ME/CFS is an active substrate for the biogenesis of microorganisms in the gut of dogs and cats. In the current study, the bacterial strains were identified based on the presence of the enzyme CFS (ME/CFS) in the dog and cat house. The results of the current study showed that the enzyme CFS was active in the gut of dogs and cats. This result is in agreement with a study in which the proteolytic enzyme CFS was detected in the human gut [39].
