## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an encapsulated yeast that causes life-threatening infections in immune compromised individuals. Recent studies have revealed a potent range of host defense peptides, including peptides with conserved cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties, including trypanosomates, amphotericin B and peptides with antimicrobial activity, which can be further targeted to affect infection by immune compensatory mechanisms. The importance of these peptides in fungal pathogenesis has been recognized over the past years. In this review, we summarize recent studies demonstrating that some peptides, especially peptides with antimicrobial activity, are actively produced by fungal pathogens and can be used as targets to interfere with host defense responses. The importance of peptides with these antimicrobial peptides in fungal infection is highlighted.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon infection that may occur in patients with defects in innate immune responses. In the context of a normal immune response, the main stimulus for fungal cells to invade the CNS is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where the host immune response is thought to be broadly protective. C. neoformans is believed to acquire its initial infection through the inhalation of spores. This pathogen is thought to cause meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals and may even be acquired from the environment. This presentation is a rare complication of cryptococcosis. We present a rare case of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in a patient with normal immune function, but with advanced disease.


## Methods
Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 atmospher. Cells were harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then washed three times with PBS and then stained with the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody (clone I-6G-EcoRI; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 1:1000 dilution. Cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody (clone I-6G-EcoRI; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 1:1000 dilution.

To monitor the cytotoxicity of the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata, cell suspensions of 10^6 cells/ml were made with RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO_2 for 2 h. Non-phagocytosed Alternaria alternata cells (100 µl) were lysed with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 1000× g for 10 min, and supernatant was removed. The supernatant from the culture was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and the fluconazole concentration in the supernatant was measured using a micro-plate spectrophotometer. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Quantification of the Cytotoxic Potential of Fluconazole
The fluconazole concentration in the supernatant was determined by the reduction of the fluconazole concentrations in the supernatant by the ratio of the fluconazole concentrations in the supernatant to the total fluconazole concentrations in the supernatant. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The fluconazole concentration in the supernatant was determined by the ratio of the fluconazole concentrations in the supernatant to the total fluconazole concentrations in the supernatant. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Statistical Analysis
The results of the experiments were considered statistically significant if the error bars were equal to or less than 0.01. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).


## Results
The negative control (control) and the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia were grown for 2 days on solid medium, and the conidia were treated with fluconazole (.5, 1, 2 mg/ml). After the treatment, the viability of the conidia was evaluated. The viability of the conidia treated with fluconazole was significantly decreased by 70% (p<0.001) compared to that of the untreated control (Figure 1A). When the conidia were treated with fluconazole for 4 h, the viability of the conidia treated with fluconazole decreased by 37% compared to that of the untreated control (Figure 1A). In addition, the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia showed a significant decrease in viability compared to that of the untreated control after treatment with fluconazole (Figure 1B). The viability of the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia after treatment with fluconazole was significantly decreased by 20% compared to that of the untreated control (Figure 1B).

To further analyze the effect of fluconazole treatment on Alternaria alternata, conidia of the control and fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia were used to determine their viability. In addition, the viability of the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia was significantly decreased by 77% compared to that of the untreated control (Figure 1C). In addition, the fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia showed a significant decrease in viability compared to that of the untreated control after fluconazole treatment (Figure 1C). The fluconazole-treated Alternaria alternata conidia were also viable after treatment with fluconazole for 4 h.

## Discussion
The complex pathogenesis of Candida spp. and its treatment with anti-fungal drugs leads to a complex interplay of factors including the immune system, host response and biofilm formation. There is substantial evidence that C. albicans is capable of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and the host immune response is the most critical factor in the control of infection. In this study, we described the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the G1 and G2 super-groups of Candida spp. in the mouse, and explored the impact of these genetic and phenotypic factors on the pathogenicity of these two pathotypes. We found that the G1/G2 super-group is involved in the virulence of C. albicans. G1/G2 super-groups are involved in both biofilm formation and virulence of C. albicans [24,28]. We also observed that G1/G2 super-groups are involved in the resistance of C. albicans to phagocytosis by macrophages. These findings suggest that the G1/G2 super-group is involved in the pathogenicity of C. albicans.

The role of G1/G2 super-groups in the pathogenicity of C. albicans is in agreement with the previously published work [28]. These studies showed that G1/G2 super-groups are important in the pathogenicity of C. albicans. We found that the G1/G2 super-groups of C. albicans are involved in the pathogenicity of C. albicans. The G1/G2 super-groups of C. albicans are required for the pathogenicity of C. albicans. However, the mechanism of the pathogenicity of C. albicans is not yet fully understood.
