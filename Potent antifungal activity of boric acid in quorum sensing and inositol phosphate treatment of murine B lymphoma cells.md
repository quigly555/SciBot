## Abstract
We report a case of a post-transplant brain abscess in a patient receiving corticosteroids. This patient had been receiving dexamethasone for epilepsy for which she had no apparent malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a right facial flap with large white matter and white matter folds that appeared to be her left frontal lobe. Because the patient's clinical picture improved following treatment with corticosteroids, her symptoms improved. To our knowledge this is the first case of a facial flap in a patient receiving corticosteroids. Clinically, the abscess healed without any significant recurrence. We discuss potential risk factors, treatment options, and prognosis for this condition, and possible treatment likely within the next few weeks.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are common in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS, with mortality rates exceeding 50% (Barrett and Helen, 2010; Nuss, 2012; Duret, 2013). Candida glabrata is the most common etiological agent of systemic fungal infections, and Candida tropicalis is responsible for the majority of Candida infections (Chu and Cheng, 2013; Li et al., 2014; Ochsenreither et al., 2015). C. tropicalis is also the cause of invasive candidiasis, although the clinical phenotype of the disease is much different (Kelley et al., 2004; Sharma et al., 2009; Duret et al., 2011; Burt and Symonds, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2013). Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can survive and proliferate within the human host. It is also a commensal organism, and it is able to cause superficial and invasive infections in otherwise healthy individuals (Klich, 2005; Burt and Symonds, 2012; Kohlmeyer, 2013). C. tropicalis has two mating types, MATa and MATa, and these two genes are required for sexual reproduction and to cause disease (Klich, 2005; Burt and Symonds, 2012). The sexual reproduction pathway in C.


## Methods
Briefly, B lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin sulfate (Gibco) for 24 h at 37 °. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with RPMI medium and resuspension in PBS. Cell concentrations were determined by plating serial dilutions of B lymphoma cells on SDA agar. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. Mixtures of boric acid and bicarbonate (0.3% v/v) were added to the culture media and incubated at 37 °C. Mixtures containing bicarbonate were incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. Cell concentrations were determined by plating serial dilutions of M1/M2 lymphocytes on SDA agar. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. The results were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and western blotting.

Determination of antifungal activity of boric acid
Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin sulfate (Gibco) for 24 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 1% SDS and 0.1% ß-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. Cell concentrations were determined by plating serial dilutions of M1/M2 lymphocytes on SDA agar. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. The results were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and western blotting.


## Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of P. kudriavzevii genomic DNA
Using a primers designed from P. kudriavzevii pKHR1 and P. kudriavzevii pIP1, we were able to amplify the genomic DNA of P. kudriavzevii using the primers designed from P. kudriavzevii pKHR1 and P. kudriavzevii pIP1. PCR primers were designed from P. kudriavzevii pKHR1 and P. kudriavzevii pIP1. The genomic DNA was prepared from a total of 556-bp paired-end reads and used as the template for subsequent analysis. After the amplification of the primers, each read was sequenced to determine the corresponding pKHR1 and pIP1 sequences. Sequencing of the sequences revealed that P.


## Discussion

In this study, we reported that BAC inhibited the expression of . subtilis virulence factors and biofilm formation in a murine model of pulmonary infection with B. subtilis. The results suggest that BAC acts via BAC-mediated phagocytosis of B. subtilis and subsequent adhesion to macrophages. This is consistent with the reports that BAC suppresses phagocytosis of B. subtilis by human PBMCs [34]. Furthermore, BAC has been reported to inhibit the production of IL-2 and IL-10 in human PBMCs [35], and we did not observe any effect of BAC on this process in the present study. BAC is a widely used therapeutic agent and the efficacy of this agent is also in agreement with the literature in murine models of infection with B. subtilis [36], [37], [38]. In our experiments, BAC-induced production of IL-6, IL-5, and TNF-a was significantly inhibited in B. subtilis PBMCs, and the same trend was observed in the ABA treatment with BAC in murine models of pulmonary infection with B. subtilis. These data suggest that the role of BAC in ABA treatment of pulmonary infection is to reduce the fungal burden in the lung.

Previous studies have reported that the BAC treatment results in increased neutrophil infiltration and IFN-<U+03B3> production in lung epithelial cells [39], which could contribute to the improved ABA efficacy of this treatment. The direct effect of BAC on the development of IFN-<U+03B3> and the production of IFN-<U+03B3>-IL-10 and IL-6 in ABA-treated lung epithelial cells was also observed [40], indicating that BAC could be a beneficial mechanism to improve the ABA efficacy of this treatment. Moreover, these results suggested that the immunomodulatory effects of BAC may be independent from the BAC-mediated effect on IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-10 production in ABA-treated lung epithelial cells. However, the reasons for this inconsistency are not clear.
