## Abstract
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) contains a vast number of fungal species that are medically and agriculturally important. In this study, we investigated the activity of the two most abundant Fusarium strains, MeYi.A.B. and MeYi.B.P, against the two clinically and industrially relevant Candida species studied in this study. Our results showed that the two MeYi.A.B. strains were more effective against both C. albicans and C. krusei (MIC: 0.56 and 2.8 mg/mL, respectively) and their MICs increased significantly over time up to 50% at the most. The two MeYi.B.P. strains showed decreased virulence in both murine and experimental models. However, the results of the antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that the two MeYi.A.B. strains were resistant to fluconazole. These results suggest that the two MeYi.A.B. strains are more effective than the reference strain for treating cryptococcosis and itraconazole use, even though the two MeYi.A.B. strains are more virulent.


## Introduction
This study evaluated the efficacy of lipid-based antimicrobials in a clinical model of . albicans candidemia.

Liposomes represent a powerful class of small molecules that function as antifungal drugs. These molecules are secreted by phagocytes and have multiple functions. First, they release free lipids, including neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) that release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, which can cross the blood-brain barrier. Second, liposomes can kill microorganisms and trigger immune responses. The discovery that IL-12 induces the secretion of other antimicrobial molecules, such as IL-12-40 and IL-13-40, may contribute to the development of antimicrobials. Finally, liposomes can be used to deliver drugs to tissues, either as liposome mimics or as a delivery vehicle.

The authors conclude that there is a correlation between the size of the antifungal liposomes and the immune response to the drug. They then discuss the potential correlation between the size of the liposome and the immune response to the drug, but without elaborating. The authors could not find convincing evidence to support their conclusions. As a result, they conclude, the study did not demonstrate the correlation between the size of the liposomes and the immune response to the drug.

The authors apologize for the minor ambiguity. We have carefully edited the manuscript to clarify the precise language and clarify the conclusions. We have also redone the discussion to focus on the new points.

First, the authors show that the method used in this study is “validation of the role of cell surface antigens in C. albicans infection”. This is a well-known problem in the field of infection studies, where antifungal drugs are used, and the results are clearly demonstrated in vitro. Second, the authors use the name of the broth microdilution method, which is inaccurate in the cited studies. The authors state that they used “flow cytometric methods” but this method is not suited for clinical use. The authors state that they measured the permeability of the suspension, but they did not study the permeability of the broth microdilution solution.


## Methods
Louis, MO, USA) and 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) as well as a non-glycerol-free RPMI mediu. RPMI-1640 medium contains glucose, 5% phenylalanine, 1.5% uridine, and 1.5% galactose. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO_2. After the 5-h culture, the RPMI medium was aspirated and the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microplate, and the cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium. A cell-free RPMI medium was used as a positive control. The RPMI-1640 medium was changed every 5-min period. After the incubation, the microplate was completely covered with a cover slip and the optical density at 570 nm (OD_570) of the wells was measured.

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the liposomes, we prepared a 24-well microplate with the stock solution of RPMI-1640 medium and 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as well as a non-glycerol-free RPMI medium.

## Results
tuberculosis and MDR-MB-B

We first compared the efficacy of different targeting strategies to . tuberculosis and MDR-MB-B (Figure 6). In this study, the combination of the two agents (2.25, 3.25, and 5 µg/mL) resulted in a significant increase in M. tuberculosis activity in the macrophage model in the first 12 h after infection (p < 0.05). In the macrophage model, the combination of 2.25 µg/mL of each agent significantly increased the activity of the MB-MB-B-stimulated eosinophils in the first 48 h (p < 0.05). After 12 h, the activity of M. tuberculosis and MDR-MB-B in the macrophage model was significantly increased (p < 0.05). However, the combination of 5 µg/mL of each agent significantly reduced the activity of M. tuberculosis in the macrophage model by approximately 50% in the first 48 h after infection, and 50% by 48 h after infection (p < 0.05).

The ability of MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages to exert Efficacy against M. tuberculosis and MDR-MB-B is dependent on their activation state
Since MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages were highly activated during the early stage of infection, we next investigated the activation state of the MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophage macrophage macrophage during M. tuberculosis infection. MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages were stimulated with 1 µg/mL of each agent for 24 h and then their activation state was analyzed. As shown in Figure 7, MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages had a strong activation state, which was very similar to that observed for MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages. After 24 h of infection, the MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophage showed a very strong activation state (Figure 7A). In contrast, MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophage had a weak activation state (Figure 7B). The MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophage showed a strong activation state (Figure 7C).

To determine whether MB-MB-B-stimulated macrophages have a high capacity to inhibit M.


## Discussion
However, the prevalence of opportunistic infections is still very low, and not all patients are protected from opportunistic infection. Therefore, the risk of opportunistic infections with liposomes is limited. This is due to the fact that, in addition to immunosuppressive drugs, some other medications can also induce infections in patients. Moreover, immunosuppressive drugs can trigger an inflammatory response in the brain, and these diseases can increase morbidity and mortality [2,4,13]. In addition, several studies have shown that amphotericin B and fluconazole can induce Cryptococcal infections in patients without immunosuppression [14,15].

The risk of Cryptococcal infections with liposomes was not increased in patients with Cryptococcal-Associated Lipomegaly, but increased in patients with Cryptococcal-Associated Lipomegaly, when the risk of Cryptococcal infections with liposomes was reduced. This phenomenon could be explained by the increased sensitivity of the patients to antifungal drugs. Previous studies have shown that treatment with azole-based liposomes (such as liposome 5) can induce Cryptococcus infection in humans [16,17].

However, the risk of Cryptococcal infection with liposomes increased in patients with Cryptococcal-Associated Lipomegaly, suggesting that treatment with liposomes could cause Cryptococcal infection in patients without immunosuppression.

In addition, a large study has shown that the rate of development of Cryptococcus infection was significantly reduced in patients with Cryptococcal-Associated Lipomegaly [18]. However, the reasons for this reduction were unclear. One possible explanation could be that Cryptococcus is more virulent in patients with Cryptococcal-Associated Lipomegaly, but Cryptococcus is less virulent in patients without immunosuppression. However, some patients in the current study were treated with liposomes 5 and 8, which was not effective in patients without immunosuppression.
