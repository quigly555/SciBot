## Abstract
The high mortality of recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related complications should be included in the differential diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Cryptococcal meningitis is considered an AIDS defining illness, which may complicate management of the patient and thereby decrease the life expectancy of the HIV-related adult population.

A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with headache and fever. Physical examination revealed a 9 mm H3, with a turbid color, to be photogenic white blood cell count = 8×108/L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL and CSF pH = 7.2. Chest X-ray and computed tomography findings showed multiple multiple nodules with non-focal, splenic lymphadenopathy. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed by both direct examination and direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The patient received amphotericin and flucytosine. The patient was treated with fluconazole for 1 week. The patient was discharged after recovery on good follow-up.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes disease in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. While Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of meningitis in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa, C. neoformans infection in apparently immunocompetent individuals is rare. However, it has emerged as a major public health problem in many parts of the world, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other sub-Saharan countries (1). Despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis remains unacceptably high in low- and middle-income countries (2). This is particularly true in Sub-Saharan Africa where the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has been estimated to be as high as 68 cases per 100,000 as well as to be over 20,000 cases per year (3). It is estimated that cryptococcal meningitis accounts for approximately 1% of HIV-related deaths worldwide and causes over $200 billion in annual deaths (4). The vast majority of deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where cryptococcal meningitis is endemic (5).


## Methods
1 and 2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, US. The data were analyzed with the “profiles” package in R.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activity of Fungal Isolates
The antimicrobial activity of the selected fungi was evaluated by the broth dilution method using the Mueller-Hinton broth microdilution method according to the European Union guidelines for the test of antimicrobial susceptibility [15]. The microorganisms were kept at 4°C for 24 h and used for the assays in accordance with the recommendations of the EUCAST guidelines [15]. The microorganism suspensions were prepared in sterile water. Fungal cultures were cultivated in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) medium at 30°C and 150 rpm for 24 h and were diluted 1:100. The diameter of the colony was measured after 24 h. The fungal growth inhibition index (GRI) was calculated by the following formula:

2.4. Assessment of Antimicrobial Activity of the Fungal Isolates
The antimicrobial activity of the selected fungi was evaluated by the broth dilution method using the Mueller-Hinton broth microdilution method according to the EUCAST guidelines for the test of antimicrobial susceptibility [15]. The fungal strains were kept at 4°C for 24 h and the number of CFU/mL was determined after dilution of the fungal suspensions into sterile water. The fungal suspensions were prepared in sterile water and the final concentrations of the tested compounds were 1 × 10^-2.50, 1 × 10^-4, 1 × 10^-4.50, 1 × 10^-8, 1 × 10^-8.50, 1 × 10^-4.50, 1 × 10^-6, 1 × 10^-6.50, 1 × 10^-4.50, 1 × 10^-3.50, 1 × 10^-2.50, 1 × 10^-1.50, 1 × 10^-0.50, 1 × 10^-0.25, 1 × 10^-0.1025, 1 × 10^-0.1025, 1 × 10^-0.0001, 1 × 10^-0.0001, 1 × 10^-0.


## Results
Construction of a C. albicans BL21 strain that expresses a constitutive proteinase-3 (P3)
The P3 gene in C. albicans has been shown to encode an active proteinase-3 (P3) in C. albicans [16]. We attempted to construct a strain with a P3 gene in C. albicans and express it in this strain. A BL21 gene is constitutively expressed in the P3 gene of the S. cerevisiae P3 gene as described in Materials and Methods. The P3 gene contains a conserved region of approximately 62 kb, which was identified by homology modeling (CAM) in the P3 gene of S. cerevisiae. The P3 gene of S. cerevisiae is located at the promoter of a serine/threonine kinase (SMK) protein, the P2 homolog of S. cerevisiae, and the P1 homolog of C.


## Discussion

In summary, our results demonstrate that the fungal extracts of leaves of . rarutum and A. europaea are active against different kinds of bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, and their activities are similar to those of other plant extracts. This is the first report showing the antifungal activity of different plant extracts. The results of our experiments also showed that the fungal extracts of leaves of T. rarutum and A. europaea have similar antifungal activities.

T. rarutum, A. europaea, and A. fumigatus possess diverse secondary metabolites. However, most of them possess less than 80% similarity to phenolic compounds such as sesquiterpenoids and aromatic compounds. The presence of secondary metabolites in fungi has been related to the functions of their primary metabolite, the secondary metabolite that gives rise to the secondary metabolites in their cells. The present study revealed that the production of secondary metabolites by A. europaea is different from that of the other species of the genus, which indicated that the fungal extracts of T. rarutum and A. europaea are different from the plant extracts from T. rarutum and A. fumigatus. This result is in agreement with those reported in previous studies, where the plant extracts of T. rarutum and A. europaea were reported to possess antifungal activity against various fungi and yeasts [21], [22], [23].

The major constituents of T. rarutum and A. europaea extracts are anthraquinones and monosaccharides. These compounds are compounds that are known to have antifungal activity and antifungal activity against a wide range of different species of fungi, as reported in previous studies [23].

In this study, the antifungal activity of the extracts of leaves of T. rarutum and A. europaea was evaluated. The antifungal activity of the extracts of T. rarutum and A. europaea was reported to be higher than that of the other plants studied. The antifungal activity of the extracts of leaves of T. rarutum and A. europaea was reported to be comparable to that of the plant extract from T. rarutum and A. fumigatus.
