## Abstract
At field appearance the same type of wheat grains were found in different geographical region. This study investigated the occurrence, distribution and diversity of different yeasts in wheat and found that the dominant yeasts in the Plateau-round variety were Aureobasidium, Rhodotorula, Debaryomyces, Kluyveromyces, Candida, Sordariomyces and Candida. In addition, these yeast types were also found in several varieties of wheat. A significant number of yeasts were found only in the Turquoise and Cerulean varieties and only in the Gray-Cerulean variety. A number of yeasts were also found only in Kluyveromyces and Sordariomyces strains and only in the Kluyveromyces and Sordariomyces strains. The distribution of these yeast types in the Plateau-round variety were as follows: Distribution of Yeasts in the Turquoise and Gray-Cerulean varieties were as follows: From Plateau to Regions III to IX, Yellow-Cerulean (43%), Kluyveromyces (33%), Debaryomyces (5%), Candida (1%), Sordariomyces (1%), Kluyveromyces (1%) and Kluomyces and Sordariomyces strains were distributed as follows: North, Kluyveromyces (45%), Kluyvermesiella (33%), Kluyveromyces (1%) and Sordariomyces (1%). These distributional changes are of particular interest due to the particular variety of wheat varieties and geographical regions. In particular, the distribution of the yeast species in the Turquoise and Cerulean varieties are in accordance with the geographical region of the wheat cultivar. The yeast diversity of the wheat cultivar, the most dominant type in the world, is not always clear. In particular, the wheat variety with the most dominant yeast type was illustrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).


## Introduction
Microbial biofilms are structured communities of microorganisms adhered to one another and enclosed within an extracellular matrix (Flemming and Jarvis, 2010). The bacterial biofilm is capable of self-filtering and self-improper growth, while the fungal biofilm is protected by a thick and strong barrier composed of proteins, lipids, and other substances (Perez-Mendes and Haberton, 2003; Sánchez-Rocha et al., 2014). Biofilm formation in the presence of antifungal drugs is not only associated with a higher resistance of the fungi to antifungal agents, but also a decrease in the antifungal resistance of Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus strains (Vidal-Arriba et al., 2015; Lam et al., 2017). The antifungal activity of different drugs has been reported to be different and depends on the morphology of the cell wall, cell wall composition, drug binding properties, and drug delivery systems (Li et al.


## Methods
The wheat grains were obtained from commercial orchard in Panchkula, Indi. The wheat grains were pre-harvested for 6 days at 12-h intervals using regular agitation, and then the grains were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and stored at 4°C until use.

Wheat grains were divided into two parts, the first part of which contained the grain (upper part) and the second part (lower part). The grain was used for the following study purpose.

The wheat grains were pre-harvested in a wood shaker at 12-h intervals for 6 days. Then, the grains were washed with tap water to remove any of the nutrient-rich contents. The grains were then ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and stored at 4°C until use.

The samples were subjected to molecular biology analysis on the basis of which the chemical structure of the wheat grains was determined using the method described by P. Kaneko (1951).

The molecular structure of the wheat grains was determined using the method described by P. Kaneko (1951).

For DNA extraction, the samples were treated with QIAGEN® Plant DNA Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and concentration of the DNA was determined using the NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, USA) and NanoDrop® ND 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). The PCR conditions were: 1 µL of each 10 µL PCR product (10 µM) was used as the template, and 1 µL of template DNA was used as the control. The gene sequences of the isolates used in this study are listed in Table 1.

The PCR amplification was performed on a Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA) using the following program: 1 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 53°C, and 30 s at 72°C, and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with GelRed (Promega, USA) and visualized with ethidium bromide staining.


## Results
. Genome Sequencing
Of the 1,731 unigenes, 1,884 (6.5%) were unique, and 735 (36.6%) were constant sequences. The average sequence length of the unigenes was 1,890 bp. The genome coverage was low (3.5%) with an average coverage of 95% and the mean sequencing depth was 7.1 Mb.

The average nucleotide diversity (1.7) was 1.45%, and the highest number of polymorphisms was found in the P. falciparum PIs. The average number of transposons was 47.7, with an average of 12.7 transposon-containing elements. The average number of repeat sequences (26.3) was 7.0, with an average of 29.2 repeat sequences per protein. The average number of introns was 39.3 (5.8) with an average of 3.7 introns per protein. The average base pair numbers of repeat sequences per protein are given in Table 1.

The presence of transposon-containing elements in PIs is generally not well studied (2.1 to 4.1), but several studies have shown that transposon-containing elements can be detected in the genome (15, 16). The paucity of genomic information about transposon-containing elements can be explained, for instance, by the fact that they are not well characterized (17).


## Discussion
On average, in this collection of wheat grown in the USA, the germinating spores were distributed on the surface of the wheat surface, but not in the aerial part. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with two cultivars each. The distribution of germination on the surface of wheat cultivars was similar to that of the cultivars with one cultivar each. The germination of the other cultivar, on the other hand, was not observed in the wheat cultivars. These results demonstrate that the germination of the other cultivar was not observed in the wheat cultivars.

Based on the distribution pattern of germinating spores, it can be concluded that these four species of wheat grown in the USA are characterized by a relatively uniform distribution of germinating spores. Wheat cultivars with two cultivars each are characterized by a uniform distribution of germinating spores. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with two cultivars each.

The germination of the other cultivar, on the other hand, was not observed in the wheat cultivars. These results are in contrast to the distribution pattern of germination of the cultivar with two cultivars each. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with two cultivars each.

The germination of the cultivar with one cultivar each was not observed in the other cultivars. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with one cultivar each. The distribution pattern of germination with the cultivar with two cultivars each was not observed in the cultivars.

The germination of the cultivar with three cultivars each was not observed in the other cultivars. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with three cultivars each.

The germination of the cultivar with four cultivars each was not observed in the other cultivars. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with four cultivars each.

The germination of the cultivar with five cultivars each was not observed in the other cultivars. This distribution pattern was observed in most of the wheat cultivars with five cultivars each.
