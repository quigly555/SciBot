## Abstract
The crystal structure of a realistic fungal cell wall is presented. Dynamic light scattering analysis, electron microscopy, and enzyme activity assays identify polysaccharides in the cell wall that may be responsible for the observed phenotypes. Furthermore, epithelial cells are shown to be exposed to a range of environmental conditions that may result in the emergence of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcus possesses various virulence factors that may have a direct effect on the host cell wall.

Fungi are extremely difficult to isolate, and genome sequencing and biochemical analyses are necessary to gain insight into their biology. In this study, we used computational genetics to analyze the cell wall, the cell wall integrity, and the immune response in the pathogen. The presence of various polysaccharides, specifically glucans and mannans, in the cell wall structure of C. gattii was studied by dynamic light scattering analysis. To visualize the immune response in the host, we constructed a biofilm and used fluorescent dye dye antimycin to quantify the levels of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids in the biofilm. We found that the immune response is primarily directed towards phagocytosis, and that the protein and carbohydrate levels are constant over time. Finally, we measured the apoptosis in the biofilm, and we found that the immune response directed against the fungus in the biofilm is similar to that directed against the pathogen in the host biofilm. These results suggest that the immune system in C. gattii is more efficient at killing pathogens. We also show that a key immune cell type in C. gattii is the interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) producing cells, and our work establishes a link between IFI and apoptosis.


## Introduction
One of the most striking features of pathogenic fungi is the transition from mycelia to yeast. For many fungi, this transition is a prerequisite for survival in the environment and even proliferation, development, and reproduction. In Candida albicans, this transition is initiated by the recognition of a host-cell receptor (Cascass, 2003). Once activated, Cascassocytes sense extracellular signals and initiate a cellular response known as the response to infection (Rao et al., 2009). In addition to recognition of the host cell surface and extracellular environment, Cascassocytes recognize extracellular sites and initiate morphological changes in response to infection (Yin et al., 2011). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the C. albicans cell surface is known to be recognized by several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide sugar recognition receptors (NLRs) (Timmermann and Keller, 2004). The recognition of fungal cell wall polysaccharides by NLRs is mediated by CD44, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2011).


## Methods
. RNA Extraction, Poly(A)-Seq, and Data Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from a naturally infected carrot (C. krusei) mycelium after 15 days of incubation at 25Â°C.


## Results
Molecular phylogeny of P. blakesleeanus
The P. blakesleeanus genome sequence, available at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the eBURST tool, was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the two species. The resulting phylogeny (Fig 1) provides the first evidence for the genomic origin of P. blakesleeanus. The three most abundant exon sequences in P. blakesleeanus (NP_124670) are P. blakesleeanus (PDB: 1PQXQ), P. blakesleeanus (PDB: 1PQE), and P. blakesleeanus (NP_137050). The other two sequences (NP_137050 and NP_137049) were collected from the U.S. and Australia. In this study, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locus was identified in the P.


## Discussion
The frequency of the majority of pulmonary fungal infections is now considered to be within the range of the distribution in humans [17].
