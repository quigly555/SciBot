## Abstract
Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is anamorph from a saprophytic plant pathogen to a necrotroph. It is widely distributed in the environment and is widely used to treat rheumatoid, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid-vomiting disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the production and characteristics of some essential oils from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous in order to determine their potential as therapeutic agents. The essential oils were obtained by steam extraction and analyzed by GC-MS to determine their amount of phenols and esters, and their alteration in the composition of the essential oils. The essential oils were further analyzed by GC-MS to determine their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. The essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS to determine their in vitro antifungal and antibacterial activity against the viruses, yeasts, and molds. The results showed that X. dendrorhous extract showed in vitro good radical scavenging activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin, with an average of 33.5% and 9.5%, respectively, from T. marneffei, T. mirabilis, and T. bifida, respectively. X. dendrorhous essential oils also exhibited significant antifungal activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, the viruses, and the yeasts. The results demonstrated that the extracts from X.

Phospholipase C, which is activated upon Pho1 expression, is a major enzyme in the carbon metabolism and is involved in the catabolite repression (CRT) pathway. Pho1 expression is promoted in response to glucose deprivation, fructose, and sucrose and the CCRT pathway is involved in this response. The expression of phospholipase C is regulated by a conserved zinc finger domain, which contains three serine and threonine amino acid residues, and is activated by phosphatase 2B. Pho1 phosphorylates and phosphodiests sulfoquinoline, which in turn is activated by cAMP. Pho1 is activated by two different activators, propionate and urease, and the third protein, SKN7, which in turn is activated by various substrates. The phosphorylated protein is subsequently transferred to the nucleus, where it activates phospholipase C and activates the transcription factor, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and iron homeostasis [13, 14].

Glucose and fructose are the two major sugars in the mammalian body, and glucose is synthesized by the endochondria. Whereas glucose is first converted to fructose and then transported across the cell, fructose is first converted to UDP-glucose and then UDP-d-glucose and then transported across the cell membrane by UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose [15].


## Methods
Inoculum was prepared by adding 100 µL of Y-buffer to each well of 96-well plate and incubating for 60 min at 37°. The MIC of phospholipase (µg/mL) was determined as the lowest concentration of the phospholipase enzyme that inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. The MIC of yeast cell growth was determined as the lowest concentration that did not inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. Inoculum was performed with 5 µg/mL of Phospholipase from yeast.

To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the Chloroplast Lysates (PCR) against Candida albicans ATCC 90028, a Chloroplast Lysate-Survivable Candida species isolate, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 was used as a positive control and to evaluate the viability of the Chloroplast Lysate-Survivable Candida species. The Chloroplast Lysate-Survivable Candida species isolate was maintained at 37°C in YPD broth for 24 h and then centrifuged at 3,000× g for 10 min at 4°C, and then the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and stored at 4°C. The stock solutions of Chloroplast Lysate (1 mg/mL) were prepared by dilution of the stock solutions in RPMI medium and were added to the wells of 96-well plates. The concentrations of Chloroplast Lysate were determined by using the TLA method [44]. The results were expressed as the percentage of cell viability, and the final concentrations of Chloroplast Lysate were 0.0, 1, and 100 µg/mL.


## Results
The results showed that ROS accumulation in the phi-infected cells was significantly reduced (Figure 3A. Therefore, ROS accumulation from phi-infected cells was further examined using the fluorescent dye FITC-labeled ROS produced by the ArsA-depleted cells. The results showed that ROS accumulation from phi-infected cells was significantly reduced (Figure 3B).

Oxygen Accumulation in the Presence of Phospholipase ArsA
As shown in Figure 3C, ROS accumulation from phi-infected cells was significantly reduced (Figure 3C). Therefore, oxygen and other carbon sources were added to the phi-infected cells to stimulate phi-dependent ROS production. The results showed that the phi-infected cells were significantly less able to produce ROS than the control cells.

Phenotypic and Functional Characterization of Phi-Induced ROS
In the above results, ROS accumulation in phi-infected cells was quantified. In order to evaluate whether the ROS accumulation in phi-infected cells was dependent on phi-induced ROS production, the ROS accumulation in the phi-infected cells was quantified by time-lapse imaging using the fluorescent dye FLO11 and by fluorescence microscopy. In order to compare the ROS accumulation of phi-infected and control cells, the phi-infected and control cells were incubated with higher concentrations of ROS (1 mM or 10 mM) for 10 min. The results showed that the phi-infected and control cells accumulated significantly more ROS (Figure 4).

Phi-Induced ROS Production by Phi-Induced Cells
To evaluate the phi-induced ROS production by phi-infected cells, the production of ROS was measured by time-lapse imaging using the fluorescent dye FITC-labeled ROS produced by the phi-induced phi-infected cells. The results showed that the phi-induced ROS production by phi-infected cells was significantly less than that of the control cells (Figure 5A). Therefore, phi-induced ROS production by phi-infected cells was further investigated using the fluorescence microscopy.


## Discussion

In a previous study, Rhizopus arrhizus, which is closely related to . fumigatus, was shown to be a potent inducer of A. fumigatus, particularly of phospholipase A. In this study, Phospholipase A was found to be induced in cells treated with G. mellonella in vitro, which was significantly higher than that found in yeast cells. In addition, a recent study reported that G. mellonella provides a suitable platform to study the potential of this fungus in the treatment of fungal infections in humans, and that it could be used as a novel model for studying infection patterns and virulence. In this study, the effect of the fungus in controlling parasite fitness on human body temperature was studied. We observed that the fungus on G. mellonella also induces the expression of virulence-related genes in both the yeast and yeast cells, and that the fungus induced the expression of the virulence-related genes. The induction of the virulence-related genes was also found to be higher than that of the other inducer, G. mellonella. This result is in accordance with the previously reported study conducted by Alves et al. [28].

The effect of the fungus on T-cell proliferation was also studied in S. cerevisiae. This study showed that the fungus induced the expression of virulence-related genes, and that the fungus induced the expression of the virulence-related genes. However, the fungal strain lacking T cell proliferation, i.e., the wild-type strain, had the highest number of T cell clones, i.e., it had more T cell clones than the other strains. This suggests that the fungus may induce the expression of the T cell clones by T cell proliferation in A. fumigatus. It also suggested that the fungus may induce the expression of the genes encoding proteins involved in the T cell proliferation to induce the expression of virulence-related genes. This could be the reason why the expression of the virulence-related genes was higher than that of the other inducer, G. mellonella.

Finally, our results showed that the fungus induces the expression of the genes encoding the proteins involved in the T cell proliferation, i.e., the T cell proliferation-associated proteins.
