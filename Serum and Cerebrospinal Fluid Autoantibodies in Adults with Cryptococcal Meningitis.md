## Abstract
The central nervous system (CNS) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and the BMECs are highly vascular endothelial cells that are essential to control neuronal and inflammatory responses to invading pathogens. However, the mechanisms of the mechanisms of regulation and plasticity of the BMECs and their plasticity have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we report that the cell-encoded RNA interference (RNAi) machinery is required for normalization of BMECs and allows them to adapt to environmental stimuli. The regulatory circuit network of the BMECs consists of a series of modules, including two genes, BmECRTKG (encoding an RNA for mAb of 8S rRNA) and BmECGRN (encoding for a protein of <20 nM in a GßRßR residue).


## Introduction

The manuscript is presented in an intelligible fashion, and the presentation style is acceptable for the reader to follo.

I recommend that the authors consider including additional controls to ensure that the study controls for known conditions. The authors should include controls for double blind and conscious controls in the manuscript, as well as a method to determine if the controls are able to control for the condition.

I recommend that the authors include controls for animal models to establish if the control is able to control for the condition.

I recommend that the authors include controls for animal models to establish if the mouse model can control for the mouse condition.

I strongly recommend that the authors carefully revise the manuscript to clarify the rationale behind the study, to clarify the rationale behind the methodology, and to re-evaluate the ethical issues raised.

I strongly recommend that the authors address the concerns raised by the reviewers.

I am very happy with the purchase of this product.

I am very happy with the purchase of this product.

I am unsure if this test has been performed correctly or not. As stated in the sample preparation, the serum was reconstituted with AmB and diaZWF, and after 10 minutes of incubation, it was completely clear.


## Methods
gatti. C. gattii was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an adult patient (female age =18 years) and used for statistical analyses.

For infection controls, HIV-1/HIV-2 seropositive patients (age =18 years) were included in all analyses.

C. gattii cell culture and analysis
The C. gattii cell culture was performed as described previously [21], with minor modifications. Briefly, a C. gattii cell culture kit (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 1:5 dilution of a BSA standard (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added to the culture media. The culture media was incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged at 6000×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU mL^-1. To analyze the C. gattii cell morphology, 10 µL of the cell suspension was spread onto Luria-Bertani (LB) plates and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h. The medium was removed and the culture supernatant was discarded. A 1:5 dilution of the cell suspension was added to the Luria-Bertani medium and the culture was incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 incubator for 24 h. The culture medium was then removed and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of RPMI-1640 medium and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU mL^-1. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 6000×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of RPMI-1640 medium and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU mL^-1.


## Results
Inhibition of CCL2/PSK2 Influences Virulence
In order to elucidate the mechanism of CCL2/PSK2-mediated infection, the intracellular survival of C. albicans was monitored at 24 hpi. As shown in Figure 1A, C. albicans was less susceptible to C.


## Discussion
Several studies have shown that the fungal burden of the lungs, brain, and other body systems is significantly increased in adults with cryptococcosis [4,7. While none of these studies showed significant differences in the fungal burden of the lungs or brain between adult and children, the lung and brain tissue burdens of the lungs and brain were significantly increased in adults with cryptococcosis [4,7,8]. Furthermore, the fungal burden of the brain, brain, and brain tissue was significantly increased in adults with cryptococcosis [4]. In addition, Cryptococcus neoformans was found to be increased in the brain tissue in the presence of CD4+ cell depletion [4].

Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon fungal infection in adults. However, in recent years, cryptococcosis has been reported in children and adults with meningitis [7,8,9]. This association has been observed in studies from different locations and ranges [4]. The association between the development of a fungal infection and the severity of the disease was also found in studies from different locations [6,8,9]. The association between Cryptococcus neoformans and HIV/AIDS patients is also seen in cryptococcosis [4,7,8]. In addition, this association has also been observed in other studies from different locations [6,8,9].

The association between cryptococcosis and other systemic diseases was also observed in a cohort of adults with cryptococcosis in North America and Europe [4]. The association between HIV/AIDS and cryptococcosis in children was also noted in a study from Spain [9]. This association was also observed in the study from India [9].

Interestingly, the association between HIV disease and cryptococcosis was not observed in our study. Our study revealed that the association of HIV disease and cryptococcosis was significantly increased in adults with cryptococcosis. However, the association between HIV disease and cryptococcosis was not observed in our study. The association between HIV disease and cryptococcosis was also noted in a study from Japan [5].

The association between Cryptococcus neoformans and HIV disease was also observed in a cohort of HIV/AIDS patients in South Africa [7]. This association was also observed in a study from Nigeria [5].

The association between HIV disease and cryptococcosis was also observed in a study from India [5].
