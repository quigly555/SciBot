## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Estimates suggest that there are approximately 1.6 million cases of TB worldwide and 6 million associated deaths each year [1]. The World Health Organization estimates that there are approximately 23,000 new cases of TB worldwide per year, with over 250,000 deaths per year [2]. TB is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) and multiseptic disease characterized by multi-drug resistant biofilm formation [3]. The main mode of transmission of TB is via aerosolization, where the spores are inhaled into the respiratory tract. Once inside the host, the fungus converts to form active pulmonary form of the disease [4]. The pulmonary form is the most common form of the disease and the MDR form is associated with high morbidity and mortality [5].


## Methods
In this work, we use GISPs to differentiate the different intracellular forms of hypertension [24. The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [25,26]. The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [27].

The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [28]. The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated. The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [28].

GISPs are specifically designed to act as a balanced or strong inhibitor of the two-domain intracellular forms of hypertension [29,30]. They can be used in combination with other inhibitors to inhibit or activate the intracellular forms of hypertension [31]. The compounds are available in a range of concentrations in the final volume of 200 µl.

The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [31]. The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated.

GISPs are well characterized for their affinity to intracellular forms of hypertension, as the intracellular forms of hypertension are not inhibited by GISPs, as are intracellular forms of hypertension [32]. The intracellular forms of hypertension are not inhibited by GISPs, as are intracellular forms of hypertension [33].

The intracellular forms of hypertension are calcium-receptor mediated, chloride-receptor mediated, phospholipase mediated, and tyrosine-receptor mediated [34]. The intracellular forms of hypertension are not inhibited by GISPs, as are intracellular forms of hypertension.


## Results
Since . brasiliensis has no discernable “alveolar” cavities (Figure 3B) and is not associated with any endocytic system, its role in the blood-brain barrier is unclear.

A number of fungal pathogens have been reported to be associated with endocytic pathways [34]. However, in our data, P. brasiliensis has no clear connection to any endocytic system. In addition, P. brasiliensis has a small genome (~25% of the genome) and has been shown to be pathogenic to humans [35], and has not been previously associated with any endocytic system.

Identification of S. sclerotiorum PbPbSRE
To identify S. sclerotiorum PbPbSRE, and PbPbSRE, we used three P. brasiliensis mutants (e.g., pbrB, pbrC) and two P. brasiliensis wild-type strains (e.g., pbrD) as well as the three P. brasiliensis PbPbSRE mutants (pbrA, pbrD). We generated single and double knockout mutants for each P. brasiliensis mutant and then purified the PbPbSRE mutant from these mutant strains, and used the PbPbSRE as the reporter to investigate the S. sclerotiorum PbSRE. After purification, PbSRE was also stained with Nile red (Figure 4A) and the total number of S. sclerotiorum PbSRE cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The total number of PbSRE cells was significantly higher than that of wild-type cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, we also identified the PbPbSRE mutant as being more resistant to the antifungal drugs fluconazole and itraconazole, which inhibit the growth of P. brasiliensis in the presence of PbSRE (Figure 4C). These results suggest that PbPbSRE is a key enzyme in the P. brasiliensis endocytic pathway.

PbPbSRE is dispensable for the stress resistance of P.


## Discussion
In this study, we found that GISP-deficient cells showed an increased susceptibility to the disease in a manner similar to wild-type cell. However, we did not find a correlation between the GISP-deficient mutant and the severity of the disease in the brain, as previously reported [35,36]. In addition, we found that GISP-deficient cells were more sensitive to the infection in a brain-derived tumor model, which was consistent with the GISP-deficient mutant being more sensitive to infection in the brain. The increased susceptibility of GISP-deficient cells to infections in the brain was also reflected in the presence of GISP-deficient proteins and in the resistance to infection. The increase of GISP-deficient cells in the brain and the increase in the susceptibility to infection of the GISP-deficient mutant in the brain suggests that these cells are more resistant to infection in the brain.

Previous studies have shown that the cell wall is an important barrier for the innate immune response, but also contributes to the pathogenicity of pathogens [37]. It is well-known that cell wall chitin is one of the cell wall components that acts as a cell membrane matrix in the fungal cell [38]. C. neoformans, which has a hypervirulent phenotype and is a high-risk yeast, is able to form wall chitin-like structures in the cell wall [39]. GISP-deficient cells show increased chitin content in the cell wall and cell wall chitin contributes to the resistance to infection by C. neoformans [40]. Moreover, chitin has been shown to play an important role in the virulence of C. neoformans and this molecule has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Cryptococcus neoformans [41]. However, whether GISP-deficient cells are more resistant to infection in the brain and other organs remains to be determined.

The potential to develop novel antifungal drugs is also a powerful strategy for clinical development. In the study of Chatterjee et al. [42] and Karthogaray et al. [43] on the susceptibility of C. neoformans to antifungal drugs, they observed that the fungal cell wall did not affect the susceptibility to azoles and amphotericin B.
