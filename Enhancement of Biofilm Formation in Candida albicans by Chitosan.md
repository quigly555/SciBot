## Abstract
Nigroboletus is the last member of N. tritici. It was introduced into Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Ptenentrophytomyces camelliotomannan as a novel species for analyzing fungal communities. The aim of this study was to provide molecular evidence that Nigroboletus can co-transcriptionally co-transcriptionally co-enriched with Phytozoa lignans. DNA sequencing of the mycelia and hyphae were performed to examine genes involved in fungal co-enrichedness. A total of 40 putative genes were identified, and sequence analysis of these revealed the existence of a mycelia and a mycelia-like phase in the fungus. Nigroboletus was identified as Pyrenophthora infestans and Pyrenochaetopsis chlamydospora, the two most closely related genera of P. infestans. The pyrenelle mycelia and hyphae of P. chlamydospora are phylogenetically related to those of Pyrenophthora infestans. We conclude that Pyrenophthora species, Nigroboletus can co-enriched with Phytozoa lignans, is a novel species for studying the fungal co-enrichedness and may represent an additional member of N. tritici.


## Introduction
Fungi are widely distributed in the environment, yet they are only present in extreme habitats, such as water bodies, soil, and high-altitude areas (Nakano, 2006). These extreme habitats are rich in microbial biodiversity and diversity, which allows for colonization of many novel species (Hof, 2010). The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a commensal and an opportunistic human and animal commensal, and it can cause life-threatening systemic infections (Scherrer, 2013). C. albicans can survive in a variety of environmental conditions, such as in an environment contaminated by organic matter, water, and decaying wood, and in mucosal or skin surfaces (Scherrer, 2013). Moreover, the ability to form biofilm has been demonstrated as a key factor for C. albicans pathogenicity (Scherrer, 2013). Biofilms are defined as a complex community of cells that are attached to the substrate, enclosed within an extracellular matrix (Fitzpatrick et al., 2005). Biofilms are stable in various conditions and display high tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions (Chen et al., 2012).


## Methods
For the construction of the Chitosan BV450 NHE inhibitor Chitosan BV450, Chitosan BV450 was first synthesized by Ni-NTA-polyethylene glycol (Ni-NTA-polyethylene glycol) metho. The reaction of the Chitosan BV450 NHE inhibitor was then induced by adding the appropriate amount of the Chitosan BV450 NHE inhibitor, which was then heated to 50 °C. To the NHE inhibitor, the NHE inhibitor was then added with the NHE inhibitor and heated to 40 °C, and the product was then filtered through sterile 0.45-µm filters (Nexcelom). The product was then concentrated by ultrafiltration (Bio-Rad) and it was then dialyzed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dialysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Chitosan BV450 NHE inhibitor Chitosan BV450 was then analyzed by an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Dionex 1200 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA).

3.4. Chitosan BV450 NHE
The Chitosan BV450 NHE was synthesized by Polymethyl methacrylate chromatography method. The reaction of Chitosan BV450 NHE was then induced by adding the appropriate amount of the Chitosan BV450 NHE inhibitor, which was then heated to 50 °C. To the NHE inhibitor, the NHE inhibitor was then heated to 40 °C and the product was then filtered through sterile 0.


## Results
Cell surface showed a similar pattern to that of the reference, which was characterized by the absence of staining of the culture medium and the appearance of a diffuse surface that showed a distinct and distinct color from the referenc. The detailed biological experiments carried out in this study were carried out in the presence of an established medium for Candida albicans and the absence of a functional medium for Candida albicans. The results of the fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that the cells were able to form biofilm. As shown in Fig 2a, the color of the cell surface was not a predominant feature, but the cells were able to form biofilm. The cell surface color of the cells was also consistent with that of the reference (Fig 2b), which was also consistent with the observation that the cells were able to form biofilm. The same results were obtained when the cells were grown in the presence of an established medium. The results indicated that in the presence of an established medium, the cell surface color of the cells was not a predominant feature.

The composition of the cell surface color in Candida albicans was compared to the reference. The results indicated that the color of the cell surface was not a predominant feature in Candida albicans (Fig 2c). These results were also consistent with the observation that the cells were able to form biofilm. The composition of the cell surface color in Candida albicans was compared to the reference. The results indicated that the color of the cell surface was not a predominant feature in Candida albicans (Fig 2d). These results were also consistent with the observation that the cells were able to form biofilm.

Induction of Candida Alumens in Candida
Candida albicans is an opportunistic human opportunistic pathogen that is known to cause fatal opportunistic fungal infections in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. In addition, it is an opportunistic human opportunistic pathogen that is often associated with HIV-associated and pulmonary infections. The cell membrane of Candida albicans is not normally stained and the cell wall is often thin. Candida albicans can be transferred from the mother cell into the daughter cell.


## Discussion
Roles of different genetic background in gene expression regulation in A. fumigatus
In the present study we identified genes that are expressed in the hyphal tips of A. fumigatus and that are either up-regulated or down-regulated in the hyphal tips of A. fumigatus, depending on the phenotypes of the two genes (Table 1). Two genes (gldH and gldA) were up-regulated in A. fumigatus and down-regulated in A. fumigatus. GldH encodes a transcription factor that controls the transcription of urease, which is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of urease (28). In A. fumigatus, the GldA gene is required for the hyphal tip development (11). In contrast, the hldA gene encodes a homologue of the gene in A. nidulans, which is required for the formation of the ovoid hyphal cell (29). In the present study, the GldA gene is up-regulated in the hyphal tips of A. fumigatus, and down-regulated in A. fumigatus. The hldA gene is also up-regulated in A. fumigatus, and down-regulated in A. fumigatus. The roles of different genetic backgrounds of the two genes are related to gene expression regulation and pathogenicity (Figure 3 and Table 1).
