## Abstract
A 14-year-old male presented to the ER with a 1 day history of 1,200UFC/mL/day for the treatment of intermittent/diremia/fibromyalgia/meningococcal osteoarticular dermatitis and a 2-week history of 1,200UFC/mL/day treatment for intracranial calcification of the face, trunk, and upper extremities. Workup revealed a 2-week history of noncontroversial, unresponsive plasma/serum cortisol levels, and workup directed to his Jensen VS system was negative. His respiratory symptoms and workup for recurrent pseudotumour were improved with antifungal agents. Serum cryptococcal antigen was positive and an Xpert® anti-coagulant was in addition to antifungal medications. There was no change in his workup or work history concerning his treatment of fibromyalgia, nor with any worsening of his workup regarding calcification of the face or neck pain. Serum cryptococcal antigen was negative and an Xpert® anti-coagulant was in addition to antifungal medications. He was treated for a second Xpert® cystromycin treatment after a 2-week course. Workup for this patient was unresponsive, and his cortisol level was negative. His workup for this patient was unresponsive and his Xpert® anti-coagulant was in addition to antifungal medications. His workup for this patient was unresponsive and his cortisol level was negative. His workup for this patient was unresponsive and he was treated for a second time after a 2-week course. Workup was unresponsive. His workup for this patient was unresponsive and his Xpert® anti-coagulant was in addition to antifungal medications. His workup was unresponsive. His workup for this patient was unresponsive and his Xpert® anti-coagulant was in addition to antifungal medications. His workup was unresponsive.


## Introduction
glabrata (Casadevall, 2004. Whereas the vast majority of phagocytes are commensal and primary producers, some individuals colonize and invade the host and establish a latent coccobacillus (Li et al., 2008). Such mucosal infections are considered to be among the first episodes of superficial and deep-seated candidiasis (Crouch, 2007).

In addition to C. glabrata, there is an emerging group of fungal pathogens (Kang et al., 2012; Orgiazzi et al., 2015) that cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of reported systemic infections due to fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and C. glabrata, as well as Candida tropicalis (Babu et al., 2015; Pfaller and Diekema, 2015; Pappas and Diekema, 2016). Despite being isolated from the body cavity, Candida tropicalis can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients (Babu et al., 2015). As C. glabrata accounts for almost all of the reported systemic infections in immunocompromised patients, it is the most common fungus in these patients. The most common fungal infections are superficial, i.e., oral, at the skin, mucosa, and nails. The most common sites for systemic candidiasis are the oral cavity, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina (Pfaller and Diekema, 2015). The number of reported cases of systemic candidiasis in the United States has increased from 33 in 2006 and 33 cases in 1999 to 70 cases in 2003 (Brown et al., 2004; Pappas et al., 2007; Khandelwal et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2014).

C. glabrata is classified into four serotypes: C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Pappas et al., 2007; Khandelwal et al., 2010). While the most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic infection, the other four species can be differentiated into non-albicans, albicans, and non-albicans yeast forms (Meyer et al., 2015; Meyer, 2015; Voglmayr et al.


## Methods
) was used for inoculation of . graminearum (F. graminearum) [22]. F. graminearum is a highly virulent fungal isolate, with 99% killing of F. graminearum. F. graminearum ATCC MYA-3681 was used as a positive control.

Fungal cells were grown in 10 mL of a complete medium (CM) medium (YPD) at 28°C and were harvested at the late exponential phase. The culture was maintained on a rotator at 30°C for 3 days. Fungal cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with distilled water to remove non-phagocytosed fungi. Then, the fungal biomass was concentrated by centrifugation. Then, the concentrated fungal biomass was mixed with a sterile spatula and then homogenized with a sterile pestle in 1 ml of sterile water. The homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant (containing 0.5 ml of 2% ß-mercaptoethanol) was discarded. The homogenate was then centrifuged again and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of methanol. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of methanol and the sample was kept for 1 h at 30°C. Then, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant (containing 0.5 ml of methanol) was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of methanol and then kept for 1 h at 30°C. Then, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant (containing 0.5 ml of methanol) was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of methanol and then stored at -20°C. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of methanol and then stored at -20°C. The fungal cell wall was stained with 0.05% Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v in methanol) and observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse 80i).


## Results
We next evaluated the capacity of . oxysporum to colonize and invade the host tissue in vitro. F. oxysporum significantly colonized both the primary and invasive hyphal structures in the primary and invasive hyphal structures (Fig 5). F. oxysporum colonized both primary and invasive hyphal structures in the primary lesions. In contrast, F. oxysporum colonized both primary and invasive hyphal structures in the invasive hyphal structures in the primary lesions (Fig 5). In contrast, F. oxysporum significantly colonized both primary and invasive hyphal structures in the primary lesions and invasive hyphal structures in the invasive hyphal structures (Fig 5).

F. oxysporum is able to colonize both primary and invasive hyphal structures in vitro and induces a severe inflammatory response in the host tissue [8]. Thus, we compared the ability of F. oxysporum to induce severe inflammatory response in the primary and invasive hyphal structures in vitro. In the primary lesions, F. oxysporum induced a moderate inflammatory response (Fig 6) and the invasive hyphal structures were severely affected. In contrast, F. oxysporum induced a moderate inflammatory response in both primary and invasive hyphal structures and the invasive hyphal structures were not significantly affected.

F. oxysporum Is Exposed to the Osmotic Stressor IRF32-33 and Controls Meningo-Branching
The ability of F. oxysporum to induce the major inflammatory response in the primary hyphal structures is very similar to the inability to induce disease in the invasive hyphal structures [8]. We then assessed the ability of F. oxysporum to induce the major inflammatory response in the primary hyphal structures. F. oxysporum induced a strong inflammatory response in both primary and invasive hyphal structures in the primary lesions (Fig 7). F. oxysporum significantly colonized both primary and invasive hyphal structures in both primary and invasive hyphal structures in both primary lesions. In contrast, F.


## Discussion
IL-17A and IL-22 play a prominent role in regulating phagocyte recruitment and phagocyte traffickin. Tumor cell-mediated immune responses and Th17 cells are highly enriched in the infected wounds. In Candida, the response to infection is controlled by Th17 cells, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines (see below), which are controlled by IL-17A and IL-22. The Th17 cell response is induced by IL-17A and IL-22, and the Th1 cell response is induced by IL-22 and IL-33. IL-22 is known to trigger Th17 cells and induce Th1 cells, and IL-33 is known to trigger Th2 cells and induce Th17 cells (see below). IL-22 is known to trigger the production of IL-17 by dendritic cells and neutrophils (see below). In addition, IL-17A is known to induce the production of IL-17 by macrophages (see below). IL-23 is known to trigger Th17 cells and induce Th2 cells (see below). In contrast, IL-23 is known to induce the production of IL-33 by macrophages and neutrophils (see below). IL-33 is known to trigger the production of IL-4 by macrophages (see below). In contrast, IL-23 is known to trigger the production of IL-18 by neutrophils (see below). In contrast to IL-23, IL-33 is known to trigger the production of IL-6 by macrophages (see below).

In addition to IL-23, the Th17 cells were also induced by IL-33 and IL-23, as well as IL-23-4 by macrophages (see below). IL-23 is known to induce the production of IL-17 by macrophages (see below). IL-33 is known to trigger the production of IL-17 by dendritic cells and neutrophils (see below). IL-33 is known to trigger the production of IL-17 by dendritic cells and neutrophils (see below). IL-33 is known to trigger the production of IL-17 by macrophages (see below).
