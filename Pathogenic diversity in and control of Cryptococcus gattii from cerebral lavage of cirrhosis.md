## Abstract
This article reviews the latest advances in antimicrobial drug discovery from industry and healthcare organisations. We focus on the increasing number of human antimicrobial compounds and highlight the importance of strategic investments in research and development of potent and high-throughput antimicrobial compounds from resource-limited environments. We also explore the use of materials sourced from natural resources in developing countries where the use of biological materials is increasingly restricted or hampered by regulations, regulations affecting small molecules. We review the use of antimicrobial drugs as natural inoculants, in combination with innovation and with improved processes, for managing bacterial infections and resistance.


## Introduction
The genus of Micrococcus is comprised of roughly 30 species, of which only three species are human pathogenic, i.e. Micrococcus neoformans, Micrococcus gattii, and Micrococcus udag., which are endemic to the grasslands and temperate grasslands of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the production of macroconidia that can penetrate the host tissues and cause ocular disease in animals, which is often mediated by the production of sticky, sunken, and hard, dark, mycelia-laden structures. The morphological differences between the two species are due to the differences in developmental stages (e.g. colour of the conidia) and the importance of the disease-causing fungi in the host-pathogen interaction. Asexual reproduction has been observed between these fungi in vitro, and the sexual morph is more aggressive and lasts for longer than asexual morph. In contrast to other ascomycetes, many species of the genus can be easily phytopathogenic, and the main reproductive strategies of the reproductive system are conidiophore-formation and germination. In most species, there is an abundant, heterogeneous population of haploid, rod-shaped, conidiophores that penetrate the host tissues, eventually penetrate and germinate into mycelia, and then invade the host cells and establish infection.

The most prevalent microconidial species in the genus Micrococcus are members of the genera Lichtheimia and Vuerklandia, and are characterized by the production of macroconidia, conidia, and conidia with distinct, round or cylindrical, or slightly inflated, structures. Micrococcus species occur mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions, and some species are found in the arid and semiarid regions of the USA, Europe, and Australia. Many species are found in the grasslands of the Northern Hemisphere, and some species are reported from diseased or infected infected grasses, which cause serious diseases in humans and animals.

Although the genus Micrococcus has been described as a primary pathogen of many grass species from temperate to arid regions, its pathogenicity towards humans remains poorly understood.


## Methods
In addition, a detailed description of the assay is given in Table .

4.5. Culture and Isolation of Cryptococcus gattii
Cryptococcus gattii strains were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of the patient [17]. The cultures were prepared from cell-free fluid using a modified RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were counted by hemocytometer and the number of CFU was calculated by counting the number of viable cells per mL of RPMI medium. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from the hyphae of the hyphae of clinical isolates [18]. The hyphae were prepared from the hyphal tip of the Cryptococcus gattii strain using a modified Candida spp. method [19]. The hyphae were washed three times with PBS and then transferred to sterile 96-well microtiter plates. All of the media and the hyphae were prepared according to the previously described methods [20].

4.6. Isolation of Cryptococcus gattii from Brain Marrow and Blood Lines
Brain marrow and blood lines of patients with cryptococcosis were obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology of Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNESP). The tissue of each patient was dissected from the cerebrum of the brain of each patient and placed on ice for 1 min. The brain samples were carefully removed and transferred to the homogenizers of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-free diet (1% w/v; Difco) with a volume of 0.05 g/L. The sera were serially diluted to obtain concentrations of 1×10^6-1×10^8/mL and 1×10^6-1×10^4/mL, respectively. The results of sera dilution were also recorded. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

4.7. Assay of Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the tested compounds was determined according to the CLSI (CLSI) M27-A3 method [21]. Briefly, 1×10^6 cells/mL were inoculated in 100 µL of RPMI 1640 and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.


## Results
Identification and molecular characterization of F.


## Discussion
It was reported that the Cryptococcus species are mainly classified in the phylum Ascomycota with the majority of the strains in the phylum Sordariomycetes, with the rest being found in the order Ascomycota [24. Thus, we have here analyzed the distribution of Cryptococcus species in cirrhotic patients in the UK and the United States.

In this study, we found that both the genotype and the strain of C. gattii were present in all patients in the UK. We found that the only strain isolated in patients in the UK was C. neoformans var. grubii which was found only in one patient in this study.

The major phyla (Trichosporon, Aspergillus, and Alternaria) found in patients in this study (Table 1) are those belonging to the orders Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhizopus. The main phyla found in patients were Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Candida, and Cryptococcus. We found that C. gattii and C. neoformans were not restricted to one patient in this study. Although we found C. gattii and C. neoformans in two patients in this study, we did not find them in any of the patients from our previous study, which also included patients from the United States. Therefore, we believe that the concentration of C. gattii in patients from the United States could be very low.

The main phyla found in patients in this study (Table 1) are those belonging to the orders Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhizopus. The major phyla found in patients in this study was those belonging to the orders Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhizopus. It has been reported that these orders are the most important pathogens in the world and that they account for a large proportion of fungal infections [25], [26]. Therefore, we believe that the concentration of C. gattii in patients in the United States could be very low.

The main phyla found in patients in this study was those belonging to the orders Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhizopus.
