## Abstract
The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici causes wilt diseases of wheat, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. However, little is known about its genetic diversity and population structure in the wheat-pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici in the wild. In this study, we identified 75 unique mating types in Z. tritici fruiting bodies and examined mating ability between individual strains. The results showed that strains belonging to the mating classes G and A, including Z, G4, and G5, were more similar in their mating ability compared to the wild-type strain. The Z. tritici strains G4 and G5 were more resistant to biotrophic growth-inhibiting fungi such as Trichoderma virens, Trichoderma nodorum, and Cucumber blight, but were genetically different. The genetic differences in Z. tritici strains G4 and G5 were most pronounced in regions that historically had been known as wheat hosts, including the highlands of Western Germany, Germany, and the state of Hinterland, South Africa. Population structure in Zymoseptoria was similar to other zymopes, including Z. tritici. Gene copy number variation (GV) was common in both sexes and in regions that were known as wheat hosts but were not yet known as hosts of Z. tritici. A high number of Z. tritici strains was previously identified in the genomes of two populations in North America. In both Z. tritici populations, G4 strains were present in almost all samples and in at least two different genotypes. The Z. tritici G4 strain was also genetically distinct from the Z. tritici G5 strain. Using genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) in combination with G4 and G5 genomic DNA sequences, we identified a novel Z. tritici G4 population with 12,718 genetic markers. This population was derived from a single wild-type strain, and we show that the 12,718 markers are highly variable and highly variable within populations. Our results suggest that Z. tritici Z. tritici has acquired a new population structure, with at least 10,720 genetic markers. Population genetic variation is the product of hybridization between different populations and it can arise by recombination, recombination, horizontal gene transfer, or selection. Results of this study provide the first insights into the genetic variation of Z.


## Introduction
Fungi are recognized as a major cause of human diseases and are responsible for over one million annual human diseases, with over 1.5 million new cases and 600,000 deaths (1, 2). Of the fungal diseases, approximately 250 species cause diseases in humans, of which Aspergillus and Cryptococcus species are responsible for most (3). In fact, the most common pathogen in humans is A. fumigatus but, with the exception of the opportunistic yeast pathogen A. baylyi, other fungi are responsible for diseases in humans as well (3). The disease spectrum of the pathogen is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic colonization of indoor environments to disseminated disease in the circulatory system, which can develop into a disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients, which is called the respiratory syndrome (4).


## Methods
Reagents and components
All of the reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma (Shanghai, China) unless stated otherwise. Aliquots of 10 µl of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli OP50 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as the inoculum.


## Results
sclerotiorum on the fungal burden of brain, heart, and spleen in a model of cryptococcal meningiti. The clinical severity of the disease was assessed from the time of sacrifice and at the end of the experiment. The fungal burden in brains, heart, spleen, and kidneys were evaluated over time by counting the number of CFU recovered. Of the fungal burdens in the brain, lungs, and spleen, 10 × 10^5 spores had an 80% reduction in brain fungal burden, whereas 10 × 10^6 spores had a 66% reduction (Fig 3A). A similar experiment was performed to assess virulence in the presence of a 5 × 10^4/ml dose of 10 × 10^5 spores of S. sclerotiorum, but the fungal burden in the brain was very low. Although the brain burden of the 1 × 10^5 spores of S. sclerotiorum was significantly reduced, the fungal burden in the kidneys and spleen was slightly higher than in the kidneys (Fig 3B). Similarly, the fungal burden in the heart and the kidney were significantly higher than in the brain (Fig 3C). The pathogen burden in the heart was markedly higher than in the kidney in all three experiments. The fungal burden in the kidney was significantly higher than in the heart in all three experiments (Fig 3D). The number of CFU recovered from the brain and spleen were significantly higher than in the kidneys and spleen in all three experiments. The fungal burden in the heart was significantly higher than in the spleen in all three experiments. The pathogen burden in the heart was significantly higher than in the spleen in all three experiments. The fungal burden in the kidney was significantly higher than in the spleen in all three experiments (Fig 3E).

Culture-based Biotrophic Effects of 10 × 10^6 Spores of S. sclerotiorum on the Mouse Brain Microbiota
In order to determine the impact of a 5 × 10^6 spores of S. sclerotiorum on the fungal burden of the brain, we inoculated mice with 10 × 10^6 spores of S. sclerotiorum and then compared the brain fungal burden with those of the control group.


## Discussion
schenckii-serotype A strain does not require SSF1 to produce sexual reproduction in an attempt to overcome the sexual cycle in . neoformans [13]. We found that the S. schenckii-serotype A strain produces a sexual cycle independent of SSF1, suggesting that the sexual cycle in this strain is independent of SSF1. S. schenckii strains lacking SSF1 also produce a sexual cycle independent of SSF1 in the laboratory. However, the sexual cycle independent of SSF1 in the laboratory is not complete. To determine whether SSF1 does not require SSF1, we examined the wild-type strain for sexual reproduction in the laboratory using the same approach described in this work. The mating reaction in the laboratory was examined by comparing the ability of the wild-type strain to produce sexual spores with the strains with SSF1 gene deletion. The wild-type strain was then subjected to mating-specific mating-type tests to assess mating-type specificity and haplotype complementation, which indicated that the wild-type strain does not require SSF1 for sexual reproduction.

The ability of the S. schenckii-serotype A strain to produce sexual spores is dependent on the S. brasiliensis yeast cell type used for the mating process. In C. neoformans, the cell type used for mating has been shown to be the cell wall, but not the cell membrane. However, C. neoformans cells with cell wall homogeneous cell wall structure have a larger cell wall, which may limit the ability of S. brasiliensis yeast cells to form sexual spores. Alternatively, a cell wall composed of mannose could serve as a cell membrane that can be used for sexual reproduction. In either case, the strain lacking SSF1 would need to be cultivated in a different culture condition, and the strain would need to be grown in the presence of a cell wall homogeneous cell wall, to allow for cell-to-cell communication between the cells.

The ability of S. brasiliensis yeast cells to produce sexual spores has been observed in other fungal species. For example, in C. neoformans, the C. gattii strain used in the study of hematopoietic cell differentiation is non-self-compatible [24].
