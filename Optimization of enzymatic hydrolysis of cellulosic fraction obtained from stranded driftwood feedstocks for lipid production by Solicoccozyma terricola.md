## Abstract
Recent estimates suggest that the worldwide population will surpass that of AIDS patients by the year 2050. Despite the rapidity with which pathogens are cleared from the human gut, their survival in the bloodstream is a major issue. Persistent viral loads in the bloodstream are the underlying force in preventing viral replication and dissemination. Here, we compare the virulence factors of the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei, which exhibit multiple phenotypic and virulence traits. The ability of these yeasts to grow in the mammalian host is key in establishing a successful and life-threatening infection. While C. albicans and C. glabrata have distinct virulence factors, they each have a unique virulence strategy, which is differentially advantageous and heavily dependent upon the pathogen. In this review, we focus on the innate mechanisms of C. albicans and C. glabrata to combat the spread of virulence factors and discuss their impact on human infections and other important human infectious epidemics.


## Introduction
The number of cases of human infections caused by filamentous fungi has risen in the past two decades (Vargas et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Pfaller, 2014; Skaar, 2014). In the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of patients receiving effective treatment for fungal infections (Duarte and Diekema, 2010; Pavelka and Diekema, 2014). The microbial community is a complex structure composed of a high diversity of microorganisms, with many species, with multiple lifestyles, able to produce a variety of bioactive compounds including antifungal peptides, phospholipases, lipopeptides and antimicrobial peptides (Fey and Smolens, 2012). The bioactive compounds are synthesized in the host cell and have a limited cytotoxic activity in a mammalian host. In this respect, the main microbial pathogens causing life-threatening infections include Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida kefyr, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida kefyr, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and Candida metapsilosis.

Although the clinical manifestations of filamentous fungi are common, the main predisposing risk factor is the immunodeficiency.

The hydrolysis activity of PLs was approximately 5% and 4% for phospholipids from the series of stranded driftwood feedstocks, respectivel.

1.2. Biocontrol Activities of Solicoccozyma terricola
The biocontrol activities of Solicoccozyma terricola were evaluated by using the P. terricola strain in the liquid culture under both the experimental conditions and the in vitro conditions. The biocontrol activity of Solicoccozyma terricola was comparable to that of other filamentous fungi including C. neoformans (Figure 4), C. albicans (Figure 5) and C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 6).

The biocontrol activities of Solicoccozyma terricola were found to be similar to the activities of Candida species including C. neoformans (Figure 5), C. albicans (Figure 5) and C. albicans (Figure 6). The biocontrol activities of C. albicans were more similar to those of C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 5), while the biocontrol activities of C. neoformans var. grubii were higher compared to C. neoformans (Figure 5) and C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 6). The biocontrol activities of C. neoformans var. grubii were higher than those of C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 5), while the biocontrol activities of C. neoformans var. grubii were lower than those of C. neoformans (Figure 5).

Solicoccozyma terricola had the highest biocontrol activities and the lowest biocontrol activities in both the experimental and in vitro conditions.

The biocontrol activities of Solicoccozyma terricola were higher than those of Candida species including C. neoformans (Figure 4), C. albicans (Figure 5), C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 5), C.


## Discussion
starkeyi clade (. starkeyi sensu lato) [22]. This study also revealed that the most efficient cellulase for lipid production by Solicoccozyma terricola was the engineered cellulase, based on the classical S. cerevisiae, R. oryzae and L. starkeyi clade.

The optimized cellulase produced by Solicoccozyma terricola (0.26 g/L) was also obtained from a water suspension (0.13 g/L) of natural Solicoccozyma terricola, and then the strain was grown on fermentable sugars and biomass for 7 days at 25°C, 25°C and 40°C for ethanol production. The optimal cultivation temperature (23°C) for lipid production by Solicoccozyma terricola was 55°C and the strain was cultivated on glucose (16 g/L) for 30 days at 25°C, 25°C and 40°C for ethanol production. The optimal cultivation temperature (23°C) for cellulase production by Solicoccozyma terricola was higher than that obtained from native grass biomass (0.26 g/L) at 30 days of cultivation. The optimized cellulase obtained from Solicoccozyma terricola (0.14 g/L) was the engineered cellulase, based on the classical S. cerevisiae, R. oryzae and L. starkeyi clade.
