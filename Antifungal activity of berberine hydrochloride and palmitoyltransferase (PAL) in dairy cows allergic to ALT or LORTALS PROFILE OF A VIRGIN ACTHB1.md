## Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the anti-Sporothrix sp. activity of the essential oil of Cochlosporus yossidiana, a genus previously associated with leaf spots on Fagus sylvatica. The crude extract was prepared by maceration in phosphate-buffered medium supplemented with acetic acid, and the active components were extracted by maceration in acetic acid solution supplemented with 1% NaCl. The antifungal activity of the extract and its fractions was evaluated by broth microdilution method and determination of MIC. The inhibitory activity of Cochlosporus yossidiana extract and fractions was determined by the method described by PICO, and the activity of fractions against Fusarium verticillioides was determined by the method of VITEK MS. The antifungal activity of the fractions against Aspergillus fumigatus and dermatophytes was determined by the method of Mincle and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by the microdilution method.


## Introduction
 orders of magnitude when compared to the non-altered Pal (Figure 1. The authors further claim that the palmitoyltransferase activity of palmitoylphenol (PAL) was not increased when compared to non-altered Pal (Figure 1).

The authors then go on to state that the increased PA in the lariat should be attributed to palmitoylation of ALT. This statement seems to be too strong in light of the presented results of the study.

The authors then go on to state that the increased PA in the lariat should be attributed to palmitoylphenol because of the increased ability of the PA to bind to L-tyrosine in the lariat. This observation is reminiscent of a previous study that showed that the ability of palmitoylphenol to form a covalent linker in the C-terminal glycine residue of histidine is increased when compared to the unaltered C-terminal C-terminal glycine residue.

## Results
However, the data on susceptibility to a number of other antifungal agents are lacking, which is why this study is not intended as a standard approach to evaluate the possible effectiveness of salicylic acid as an antifungal agen. Therefore, we investigated the effect of salicylic acid on the antifungal activity of fatty acid amines. To this end, salicylic acid was tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of C. albicans and C. neoformans (Table 1). No significant difference was found in the efficacy of salicylic acid for the growth of C. albicans, C. neoformans, or C. albicans-infected animals (p = 0.0383, p = 0.029, p = 0.0813, and p = 0.0479, respectively).

3.2. Effects of Salicylic Acid on the Growth of C. albicans in A Rat Model
The effect of salicylic acid on the growth of C. albicans in A rat model is shown in Figure 1A. In order to analyze the effects of salicylic acid on the growth of C. albicans in A rat model, a significant increase in the colony diameter of C. albicans was observed in the first 24 h of the study (p<0.0001). After 2 h, the growth of C. albicans was inhibited by 3.0-fold, 4.0-fold, and 10.5-fold, respectively, and the inhibitory concentration of salicylic acid in the range of 5 µM was higher than in the control group (Figure 1B).

The antifungal activity of salicylic acid against C. albicans has been reported in a number of studies [5,6]. In this study, the concentration of salicylic acid in the range of 5 µM was significantly higher than the control group (p<0.0001). After 24 h of incubation, the activity of salicylic acid in the range of 5 µM was comparable to the control group (p>0.05). Although the concentration of salicylic acid in the range of 5 µM was higher than the control group (p<0.


## Discussion
The end results revealed that in all the cases, the compounds in the reduced form could be isolated from the acetic acid or from the oleic acid, respectively, indicating that all the compounds were isolated as endophyte.

Furthermore, the compounds were also isolated from the water solvents of different sources, and their presence in the water was also demonstrated for the A. protothecoides and the A. flavus, the latter being isolated from the same source. The finding that the compounds were isolated as endophytes, with their occurrence reported in other studies, together with their potential to be applied in the treatment of allergic diseases, strongly suggests that these compounds can be used in the treatment of allergic diseases.

4.2. Compound 1,2,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde (2-NO_2)
Compounds 1,2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (2-NO_2) were isolated as monoterpenoids (4-O-2-chromenyl) (3,4-dihydro-3,6-dimethyl-2,4,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8-octahydrochloro-8-chromenyl) by electroporation with 0,2-dodecanoic acid.

The electroporation of the compounds showed that the monoterpenoid (2-NO_2) showed a very strong attraction for compounds 2-NO_2. The lowest concentration of the monoterpenoid (2-NO_2) was 200 µg/mL. This value was also consistent with the results of earlier studies. The molecular formula was determined as C_25H_15O_3 with a molecular weight of 34 kDa by the HMBC spectrum of the standard T6H HMBC (France) and the ICH HMBC (Japan) signals of the molecule, respectively.
