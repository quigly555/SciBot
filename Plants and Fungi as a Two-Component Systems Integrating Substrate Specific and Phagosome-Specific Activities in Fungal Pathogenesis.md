## Abstract
Leishmania use sexual reproduction to discover novel drug targets. Sexual reproduction in the absence of sexual reproduction generates many hits to discover novel antifungal targets. The key to the success of this research was discovered by investigating the effect of a new antifungal, daunorubenecidinone-1, which targets the conserved protein kinase B (Calmodulin B5). daunorubenecidinone-1 is a potent antifungal agent that is also effective against Candida albicans. Here we report that daunorubenecidinone-1 acts as an intermediate step in a stepwise mechanism that requires the action of a glycoprotein kinase (gpk) and a protein kinase (prpkA). When combined with the previously identified calmodulin B5 target protein, daunorubenecidinone-1 inhibits Ca2+/Ca2+-dependent intracellular growth of the pathogenic yeast. We report the first case of combined daunorubenecidinone-1 treatment of C. albicans in a mouse model of disseminated infection. Combined daunorubenecidinone-1 treatment did not lead to increased susceptibility to infection, while combined calmodulin A treatment resulted in a small increase in virulence and reduced cellular proliferation of the pathogenic yeast. Taken together, our results reveal that combined daunorubenecidinone-1 therapy is effective in the context of C. albicans infection and provide evidence for combinatorial strategies for finding novel targets for antifungal therapy.


## Introduction

The use of photosensitizers as sensors of the host environment and as fungicides has been widely accepted in several plant familie. The photosensitizers can be classified into three major classes: lipid, polyphosphates and antifungal polyphosphates. The lipid polyphosphates are useful in agricultural applications, controlling herbaceous plants [7], [8] and controlling herbaceous plants in agricultural settings [9]. The polyphosphates are used as fungicides, but are also fungicides and are used as fungicides in forestry [10] and ornamental medicine [11].

Antimicrobial polyphosphates are one of the main classes of antifungal polyphosphates which are widely used in agriculture, forestry and ornamental medicine, and have been used in the production of antibiotics [12]. Antimicrobial polyphosphates can be chemically synthesized. The synthesis of the antifungal polyphosphates involves various reactions, including acid, alkaline, pyrazole and pyridine reactions.


## Methods
 2017. In brief, Fungi were identified using surface staining and growth indicator (SIGMA, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Staining was performed using the following proteins: X-ray film (FluoStar, Japan) and the Streptomyces sp. were used to identify bacteria. For the nucleotide-based analysis, bacterial DNA was isolated using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. To perform the phenotypic analysis, Fungi were washed once with PBS before being resuspended in 200 µl of PBS. Then, the inoculum was prepared and diluted to the desired concentration. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 24-48 h, and the numbers of CFUs (cells/ml) were counted. To calculate the total number of bacterial cells, the number of cells in each plate was counted in triplicate.

2.3. Molecular Analysis of Bacterial Strains
In order to detect bacterial DNA, the following procedures were used. First, the DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Second, the DNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (Shimadzu, Japan) and the concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

2.4. Molecular Analysis of Bacterial Strains
Fungal genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry (Shimadzu, Japan).

2.5. Molecular Analysis of Bacterial Strains
The bacterial strains were tested for their ability to grow in a high-throughput manner using the procedures described in our previous work (Yang et al., 2017). Briefly, fungal genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Then, the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry (Shimadzu, Japan).

## Results
We tested a set of three different . graminearum strains in the capsule-fungal interaction experiment. To test the interaction between these strains and the fungal cell wall, a polysaccharide capsule was produced using a single-component capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3A). The capsule assembly strategy was defined as a polysaccharide capsule assembly strategy in which capsule elements were introduced into a single-component capsule assembly strategy. The capsule assembly strategy was also defined as a capsule assembly strategy in which the polysaccharide capsule was introduced into a single-component capsule assembly strategy. The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3A). The number of polysaccharide capsule produced ranged from 24 to 41. The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3B). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3C). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3D). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3E). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3F). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3G). The total number of polysaccharide capsule produced was determined by the assembly strategy of each capsule assembly strategy (Fig 3H).

We next determined the capsule binding properties of each polysaccharide capsule by SEM (Fig 4). The three strains were used to test binding of each capsule assembly strategy to each polysaccharide capsule (Fig 4). The strains were used to perform the experiment described in Materials and methods. The surface-attaching properties of each capsule assembly strategy to polysaccharide capsule were determined by SEM. The surface-attaching properties of each capsule assembly strategy to polysaccharide capsule were determined by SEM.


## Discussion
In order to study the mechanism of these processes, we used the synthetic supernatants of the three of the four fungal pathogens for protein expressio. The yeast Y. lipolytica, which has been reported to undergo hyphal formation, was used to test the roles of the three hyphal proteins in hyphal formation and the expression of the hypha-specific proteins. The results showed that YlS4, YlS5, and YlS6 were expressed at higher levels in the hyphal-specific proteins (Table S1). The Y. lipolytica cells used in this study were grown in the presence of yeast and the hypha was removed and submitted to desaturation. This desaturase was then purified by centrifugation at 100 rpm and purified using SYTOX column. The final product was analyzed using HPLC and Western analysis.

The S. cerevisiae hypha-specific protein (S4A1), which was specifically expressed in the yeast cells, was also expressed in YlS5 and YlS6. The S. cerevisiae S4A1 was subsequently expressed in the cells and purified. The purified protein was characterized by the expression of the glycolysis-related protein kinase I (KNRK1) and a phospholipase-1 (PPI1). The S. cerevisiae KNRK1 was then purified using SyTOX column. The purified protein was characterized by the expression of the glycolytic enzyme C1-1 (PKS1) and the glycolytic enzyme C1-2 (GEO1). The glycolytic enzyme C1-1 was then purified by SYTOX column. The purified protein was characterized by the expression of the glycerol-binding protein (GHP1). The glycerol-binding protein (GHP1) was then purified by SYTOX column. The purified protein was characterized by the expression of the phospholipase-1 (PPI1) and the phospholipase-2 (PP2) subunits (POP1 and POP2). The phospholipase-1 (PPI1) was then purified by SYTOX column.
