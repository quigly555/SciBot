## Abstract
Metabolic diversity, the ability to adapt to diverse environments, and the capacity of microbes to compete with each other are hallmarks of microbial cells. These hallmarks are consistent with both the inherent complexity and the abundant nature of microbial cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that metabolic diversity in microbial cells may be adaptations of the environment to enable their utilization by microbes. We show that the ability to adapt to multiple environments is a prerequisite for the utilization of all microbes as food, for better nutrient homeostasis, and for functioning as human cells. Our results illustrate the processes of adaptation to diverse stimuli to facilitate adaptation to environmental and microbial changes.


## Introduction
A number of fungal species can produce a wide range of pigments which are potentially useful as biopesticides. Many of these pigments are commonly used in biopesticide production as food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical ingredients. The most commonly used pigments contain a variety of molecular weights ranging from 10^9-10^11 to 10^13 to 10^21 to 10^56. Pigments are mostly yellow (C_1) or black (G_1) and can be synthesized by two different methods: (1) a fluorophore (G_1) and a pigment (G_2). The most widely used fluorophore is a G_2 form of a G_1 molecule, which has been shown to possess high pigment yield and broad range of action (Macdonald and Holzapfel, 1999). Pigments can be synthesized in a number of different approaches, including chemical synthesis, by using sunlight, hydrolysis of pigments, and by using water as a solute (Macdonald and Holzapfel, 1999). Pigments can be stored in long-term storage, which are largely energy-limited, making them promising alternatives to other pigments produced by microorganisms (Stevall and Holzapfel, 1999). The storage conditions for pigments depend on the type of pigments and the application conditions, as well as the environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, osmotic stress, and solar radiation) (Klauser et al., 2001; Klauser, 2001; Kohler et al., 2006).


## Methods
In the longer SBPs, the intron position is defined as the longest single SBP, whereas in the longer SBPs the position is defined as the longest SBP, and thus the SBPs shorter than the SBPs longer than the SBPs longer were not included in the analysi. Since the longest SBPs were only included in the analysis, we did not include the SBPs longer than the longest SBP. In the long SBPs, the first five intron positions were excluded from the analysis since they are not in the same position. Thus, the longest SBPs longer than the longest SBP were excluded from the analysis. We also compared the results of the long SBPs with that of the longer SBPs, with a total of eight SBPs from each group of trees. To compare the distribution of the SBPs in different trees, we repeated the analysis of each tree and compared the distributions of the SBPs in the different trees. The relative and absolute numbers of the SBPs were compared in the two different trees using the relative relative generalized linear model with order by average linkage (LAM) method, as implemented in the “http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/lme/” package of R. The LAM was calculated with the following formula:

In order to evaluate the role of the species on the number of intron positions, we compared the intron positions of two species in the order P1 and P2 (Table 1). Both species had high Intron Size of P1. Intron Size of P1 was around 500 in P2. Since P1, which is considered to be a clade of trees, is the smallest species in the tree, and P2, which is considered to be the largest species, it was found that the intron positions of P1 and P2 were very similar in both species. Therefore, the species was grouped together in the tree as P1 and P2 (Table 1). The species was also included in the analysis of the number of intron positions in a different tree (Table 1). We also compared the number of intron positions in the tree with the number of intron positions in the same tree, with a total of eight intron positions in P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P12.


## Results
These intron positions are not shown in Fig . The intron positions of these intron positions in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are consistent with the intron positions in many other organisms (S1 Fig). Thus, these intron positions are likely to be conserved in the siderophore, but not in other organisms. In order to obtain a more robust and precise information, we performed comparisons among S. cerevisiae and S. pombe intron positions. We found that the S. cerevisiae intron position has a remarkably high similarity to those of the S. pombe intron position (73% and 64% identical, respectively) (Fig 4), and that it is also very closely related to the S. pombe intron position (99% and 100% identical, respectively) (Fig 5). The S. cerevisiae intron position also appears similar to those of the S. pombe intron position (99% identical and 99% identical, respectively), but it is not the same species as the S. cerevisiae intron position (99% identical and 99% identical, respectively) (Fig 4). Overall, these results show that intron positions in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are significantly conserved, and that the intron positions in these species are likely to be conserved in both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, but not in other organisms.

Intron positions in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe differ in conserved domains
The intron positions of intron positions in both species have been shown to differ in terms of their similarity in amino acid residues and domain architecture (36-38). Given the conserved domains in these intron positions, we identified novel domains in these intron positions. We have identified conserved domains in the S. pombe intron position in order to identify potential new sites in these sites. We searched for conserved domains in the S. cerevisiae intron positions in order to identify potential novel sites in these sites. In the S. pombe intron positions, we found seven conserved domains (Supplementary Fig 5). We also identified conserved domains in the S. cerevisiae intron positions in order to identify potential novel sites in these sites. In the S.


## Discussion
S (.9S) alignment (Figure 1) (Figure 2). In total, these analyses identified 2,356 intron positions in South American parrots, 1,819 in C. pachydermatis and 1,294 in C. elegans, with an average length of 3,819 bp (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Using a Bayesian analysis, each intron position identified by both studies was defined by the average of 3' length of the branch leading to each position (Figure 2).

Within the North American C. elegans intron positions, the C. elegans 4' splice site prediction was highly informative (range of >1,000 to >4,000 bp) with the average length of 1,048 bp (range of >1,000 to >1,700 bp) and the average length of intron positions for the three clades of C. elegans (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

In addition to the C. elegans, the C. pachydermatis and C. elegans genes that were identified as being intron-rich in paralarvae (Table 1) were also characterized by the average length of 3,819 bp (range of >1,000 to >4,000 bp) and the average length of intron positions for the three clades of C. elegans (Figure 1 and Figure 2). These results suggest that the C. elegans intron positions may represent the ancestral state of the species, with the intron-rich C. elegans genes likely derived from the intron-poor C. pachydermatis genes and the C. elegans intron positions likely arose during the diversification of the C. elegans species.

Our analysis of the C. elegans gene data indicated that the C. elegans gene set is likely to represent a state in which the intron was retained in an ancestral state. However, the C. elegans gene set also included both gene sets that were unique to each of the species in which the gene was predicted and those that were present in a lineage that underwent two diverged species, one representing the transition from a true intron to a true intron. Both of these divergent gene sets contained a gene set that was unique to the C. elegans lineage and that was unique to the C.
