## Abstract
The rate of genome instability in fungi has been increasing. The most prevalent cause of this is the pathogen Candida albicans, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. It is known that certain virulence factors, such as a- and ß-glucans, act as transporters of environmental stimuli. Fungal a-glucans also known as monosaccharides and osel peptides can interact with a wide range of organisms, including humans and plants. This interaction can lead to interactions that damage the integrity of the host such as the caspofungin armistice of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. This study aims to define the role of a-glucan in the pathogenesis of C. albicans and to identify mechanisms that could explain this outcome. The a-glucan receptor PacC is essential for this interaction. Deletion of the homologous PAS domain abolishes PacC function in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with liposomal or glycosaminoglycan treatment reduced the virulence of C. albicans. These effects were reversed in the caspofungin armistice, and pharmacological inhibition of this receptor in C. albicans failed to reverse the effects. This result suggests that loss of the a-glucan gene pASdomain might reverse the a-glucan receptor action on virulence of C. albicans.


## Introduction
There is a continuing need for new antifungal agents with broad-spectrum activity against dermatophytes. Fungi belonging to the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are among the most important etiological agents of human dermatophytoses, which are difficult to treat. The species Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are commonly pathogenic to humans, while Trichophyton and Malassezia are common etiologic agents [1]. The species of the genus Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of human dermatophytoses, which are difficult to treat [2]. T. and M. canis are the main etiological agents of human dermatophytoses, which are difficult to treat because they are often resistant to antifungal agents. T. and.


## Methods
Then, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyd. The cells were mounted in Tissue-Tek T-Tips and imaged on a Nikon Coolpix 4500 microscope.

For the morphological studies, the cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS and imaged on a Nikon Coolpix 4500 microscope. The slides were mounted on glass slides and imaged on a Nikon Coolpix 4500 microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera and image analysis software version 4.8.6.

Western blot analysis
The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (100 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA) and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-glycine sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. The membranes were then incubated with a secondary antibody to the FITC-labelled FITC-dextran (1:1000, Sigma) for 30 min, followed by three washes with TBS-T, and finally with TBST-Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with a primary antibody to the Alexa Fluor 488-labelled calcofluor white (Invitrogen, CA) for 30 min, followed by three washes with TBST-T and TBST-T. The membranes were finally incubated with the anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen, CA) for 30 min, followed by three washes with TBS-T and TBST-T. The membranes were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).

Protein extracts and Western blot
For western blot analysis, the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.


## Results
The .t. and hcU01 strain used in this study produced lipids of the expected levels, in agreement with the lipid-to-phosphate ratio (LTCR) ratio. In the H99 and JEC21 brains, the lipid production was similar to the lprI control strain, but there were significant differences in lipid content between the two strains (Figure 2). In contrast, in the hcU01 brain, lipid production was higher than that of the lprI control strain, but there was no significant difference between the two strains. These results suggest that the lprI and lprI-induced changes in lipid production in the hcU01 brain are associated with the host response to macrophage attack.

2.3. LPRI Induced L. Protoplast Activation Promotes the Lymphatic Cytokine Cytokine Receptor Activation
The LPRI (LPS) and lprI-induced activation results in Lymphatic Cytokine (LC) signaling pathways. The LPS and LC pathways have been shown to be involved in the regulation of host immune responses [22], [23]. To further characterize the LPS pathway, we used the LPSR (LPSR)-producing L. prosalivarius strain to test the LPSR-induced lymphatic cytokine production in H99 and JEC21 brains. LPSR expression increased significantly in the brain at 3 hpi and reached the highest level at 7 hpi, while LC activity was undetectable in the brain at 7 hpi. Although the H99 and JEC21 brains showed similar levels of LPSR activity, they did not produce significantly higher levels of LC in the brain compared to the hcU01 brain (Figure 3). These results suggest that LPRI activity promotes the Lymphatic Cytokine Cytokine Receptor Activation (LCAAR) pathway.

We further tested the development of CD11b^+ MDC^- cells in H99 and JEC21 brains.


## Discussion
., early post-hatching larvae and larvae of immunocompetent mice) and possess the ability to kill microorganisms and produce various cytokines [52]. In our study, we investigated whether the inhibitor had any effect on macrophages from non-immunocompetent mice. We found that the inhibitor had a significant effect on macrophages from immunocompetent mice, suggesting that macrophages from immunocompetent mice are highly efficient in killing pathogens. In contrast, macrophages from immunocompetent mice were more sensitive to the inhibitor (Figure 2A). In contrast, we did not observe an increase in the production of macrophages from immunocompetent mice. This could be due to the difference in parasite infection or other factors, but we also observed the significant effect of the inhibitor on the production of macrophages in immunocompetent mice (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibitor has no effect on macrophages from immunocompetent mice, suggesting that the inhibitor is not the major factor involved in the mechanism of infection in this species.

The inhibition of phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages suggested that the inhibitor was the major factor responsible for the inhibition of phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans is an important aspect in the infection of immunocompetent patients. As with most other pathogenic organisms, it occurs via the secretion of interferon-ß, which can be found in many opportunistic infections [53]. In addition, the concentration required for phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans is higher than that required for cryptococcal clearance [54]. In addition, phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans is mediated by several pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IFN-<U+03B3> [55]. These cytokines are involved in the immune response against Cryptococcus neoformans and play an important role in the control of infection [56]. Our results showed that phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans was significantly impaired by the inhibitor, suggesting that the inhibitor could have an effect on macrophages in immunocompetent mice.
