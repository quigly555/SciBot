## Abstract
In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of anti-Candida bronchial cells (ABLC) therapy in treating invasive candidiasis (IC). The adhesion of ABLCs to the bronchioles was evaluated by flow cytometry, histopathology, and colony forming unit (CFU) count. The activity of anti-Candida ABLCs against Cryptococcus sp. was evaluated by MALDI-TOF and broth microdilution assay. The antifungal activity of ABLCs was studied in comparison to C. albicans, which is a frequent cause of IC. The antifungal activity of ABLCs against Cryptococcus neoformans was studied in terms of the adhesion counts, which indicated that ABLCs were able to inhibit at least 64.8% of C. neoformans cells. The results confirmed the effectiveness of ABLCs in treating IC, which was greater than that of standard antifungal therapy. Our study provides evidence that ABLC therapy can be used to treat invasive candidiasis in the hope that it might be a useful addition to conventional antifungal therapy for IC.


## Introduction
Phaeohyphomycosis is a group of endemic dermatophytic mycoses that have been documented in Europe, North America, and Asia. It is an emerging mycosis, and it is endemic in Europe, North America, and Asia. In Europe, it is endemic in the region of Bulgaria, Czechia, and in North America, in the states of the eastern Mediterranean area, including Arizona, Texas, and South Carolina, and in the United States, it is endemic in the states of Arizona, Arizona, and California. The clinical presentation is varied, with the yeast forms typically seen in meningeal infections, mainly of the vulvovaginal tract, mainly on cutaneous and mucocutaneous sites, and skin, mucosal, and subcutaneous tissues.

The most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic meningoencephalitis. This case highlights the importance of proper therapy and adequate diagnostic tests in the management of fungal diseases, especially those from deep-seated candidiasis.

This is the first reported case of invasive candidiasis presenting in an otherwise healthy individual, which is the first presentation that may be favorable to the clinician. This is a case of suspected clinical misdiagnosis, unusual clinical features, and/or the failure of antifungal therapy.


## Methods
oryzae, . sympodialis, M. oryzae, and M. gelatinosa, in different combinations: a) wild-type (WT), <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, <U+0394>sfaA, and <U+0394>sfaA), b) deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae, S. brasiliensis, and S. pombe, c) deletion mutants of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and S. cerevisiae, and d) deletion mutants of T. gondii, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. The assays were performed in triplicate and were performed in triplicate. The final concentrations of the compounds were 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 µg/mL. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited visible growth of the test organism compared with the control (1 µg/mL) [14]. All the assays were performed in triplicate and were performed in triplicate.

Plant Growth Assays
The growth of M. oryzae and M. gelatinosa was measured by measuring the colorimetric zones of the mycelium using a microtome with a compound that has been used to identify fungi [15, 16]. The cultures of M. oryzae, M. oryzae, M. oryzae, and M. gelatinosa were harvested from a fresh pile of cornmeal agar (CMF) plates, then inoculated with the fungal spores. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 72 h, and colony diameters were measured at the end of each incubation.

Ethics Statement
The experiments were conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal experimental protocols were approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and followed the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.


## Results
Microbial secondary metabolite secondary metabolite metabolites were grouped into 16-carbon compounds by the following criteria: (i) They were characterized by no significant differences in their chemical structures with standard standard drug-free fungal secondary metabolites (S1 Table), (ii) They were distinct from other compounds identified in the literature (S1 Table), (iii) They had significant (P < .05) differences in their relative abundances with standard drug-free fungal secondary metabolites (S2 Table), and (iv) They were also metabolically active against a wide range of filamentous fungi (S3 Table).

To determine the biological activity of microbial microbial secondary metabolites, we selected four microbial species, three species of Ascomycota, and one Botryosphaeriaceae species. The Gram-positive, Gram-negative fungal species were selected because they produce a wide range of phytochemicals (Fig 1A). Ascomycota fungi are multigene families, and the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites is extremely diverse [10,11,12,13,14]. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the three Ascomycota fungi are distinct from the other Ascomycota species (Fig 1B). The cluster of Ascomycota fungi with the highest number of secondary metabolites was not highly supported (Fig 1C), suggesting that the Gram-positive, Gram-negative fungal species may be more sensitive to the microbial metabolites they produce. To test the potential for microbial secondary metabolite production in fungal pathogens, we isolated and quantitated the antimicrobial activity of microbial metabolites by using the extraction method described in the methods.

Microbial metabolites were extracted from four strains of Ascomycota fungi and one Botryosphaeriaceae species. Extracted metabolites were analyzed using the metabolomics method. For both fungal and Botryosphaeriaceae species, the percentage of free metabolites was high (Fig 2A). However, the relative abundance of non-reducing compounds was low (Fig 2B), suggesting that free metabolites may be more effective against other fungi than the Gram-negative fungi. The lower percentage of non-reducing metabolites was reflected by the low % of the total metabolites that was present in the microbial metabolites (Fig 2C).


## Discussion
There are few studies on the effects of microbial metabolites on fungi, but the main focus of these studies has been on the metabolite composition and metabolite utilizatio. These studies have focused on the effect of microbial metabolites on the fungal secondary metabolism, but there are also studies on the effect of microbial metabolites on fungi. For instance, in the present study, several metabolites of Fusarium sp. were investigated, including acetyl-CoA, acetyl-tRNA, and aceto-ß-D-glucopyranoside (HSP) which were found to be metabolically active against Fusarium species. Also, the accumulation of methyl-GlcNAc, methyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and N-acetyl-N-methylglucosamine was found to be active against Fusarium species (Table 1). The observed CCAAT concentration was consistent with the literature, which indicated that the production of secondary metabolites by Fusarium species is associated with high CCAAT content (50-100 U/mL), which are associated with the production of secondary metabolites by Fusarium species (10). These findings are similar to the results of the present study, where a high CCAAT concentration was observed for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. Although the CCAAT concentration in filamentous fungi is the same as that in fungi, the CCAAT content is a significant factor for the formation of microbial metabolites. The CCAAT content of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei was found to be significantly higher than those of C. albicans and C. krusei, but not of C. albicans or C. krusei (Figures 2 and 3). However, the CCAAT content of C. albicans was lower than that of C. glabrata and C. krusei (Figure 2). The results of this study indicated that the CCAAT content in fungi is higher than that of fungi, which is in agreement with the literature. The CCAAT content of C. albicans was found to be lower than that of C. glabrata and C.
