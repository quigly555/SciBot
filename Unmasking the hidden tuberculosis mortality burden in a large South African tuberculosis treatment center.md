## Abstract
The ability of pathogenic fungi to develop resistance to current antifungals is a concern because of the potential emergence of drug-resistant strains. Fungi are also highly susceptible to host-mediated toxins, and pathogen invasion is considered an important virulence trait of many fungal species. Despite this, fungal species are known to produce a wide array of extracellular enzymes that are used in different biochemical reactions, including energy production, drug metabolism, and virulence. The analysis of fungal extracellular enzymes revealed that many fungi possess enzymes that are specifically made to degrade and even kill intracellular parasites. The analysis of enzymes secreted by fungi and their associated microbes revealed that many fungi have enzymes that are specifically designed to degrade and even kill intracellular pathogens. This review focuses on the discovery, analysis, and identification of enzymes secreted by fungal species and their associated microbes, the production of enzyme diversity, and the role of enzymes in resistance to current antifungals.


## Introduction
The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased over the past decade. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released annual estimates on the number of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) and the annual statistics for the sub-Saharan Africa (SA) are expected to be even greater (Berk et al., 2017). The current situation in the PLWHIV communities is a consequence of lack of effective healthcare, insufficient access to health care, unavailability of trained healthcare providers, and failure of health education (Sobel, 2015).


## Methods
We used a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a rural tuberculosis treatment center model for tuberculosis treatment in a population that has experienced strong consolidation in its impact since the introduction of the Tuberculosis Management Service (TMSS) model in 2013 [19. The trial was designed to assess the impact of a 1.5-year-old Tuberculosis Management Service trial starting in 2010 on the impact of a 2-year-old Tuberculosis Management Service trial starting in 2010. A standardized data management system (CD) was used to record the Tuberculosis Management Service trial outcomes. We aligned the data management system to the TB management system in South Africa [20].

## Results
Here, we compared the number of secreted bacteriophages in the lungs of TB patients with established or new tuberculosis, with that of the lung of healthy individuals with tuberculosi. The secreted bacteriophages were present in both the lungs and the brain, and the proportion of secreted bacteria in the lungs was significantly lower (P<0.0001) than the total secreted bacteria in the lungs (P<0.0001). These results were consistent with the hypothesis that TB patients with tuberculosis had higher pulmonary secretome than the healthy individuals.

To further explore the relationship between the secreted bacteriophage and the secretome of the lungs, we investigated the secretome of the lungs of TB patients by quantitative sequencing of the secretome of the lungs. The total secreted bacteria was present in both the lungs and the brain, and the proportion of secreted bacteria in the lungs was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than the total secreted bacteria in the lungs (P<0.0001). These results indicate that TB patients with tuberculosis have higher pulmonary secretome than the healthy individuals.

To further determine the role of secreted bacteriophages in the lungs, we examined the secretome of the lungs of TB patients with tuberculosis using quantitative sequencing. The secreted bacteriophages were present in both the lungs and the brain, and the proportion of secreted bacteria in the lungs was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than the total secreted bacteria in the lungs (P<0.0001). These results suggest that TB patients with tuberculosis have higher lung secretome than the healthy individuals.

To further validate the results of the previous study, we also examined the secretome of the lungs of TB patients using quantitative sequencing. The secreted bacteriophages were present in both the lungs and the brain, and the proportion of secreted bacteria in the lungs was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than the total secreted bacteria in the lungs (P<0.0001). These results suggest that TB patients with tuberculosis have higher lung secretome than the healthy individuals.


## Discussion
In contrast to previous reports in other studies, the estimated burden of tuberculosis mortality in a South African community of HIV-infected individuals was low [4, 5. This disparity in burden is consistent with previous data from South Africa [4]. In South Africa, the burden of hidden tuberculosis mortality was higher in individuals with advanced HIV disease, as well as in individuals with advanced HIV disease [4], which was not reflected in the South African population [6]. Thus, the burden of tuberculosis mortality in a South African community of HIV-infected individuals was higher than the burden of tuberculosis mortality in a community of HIV-uninfected individuals.

The burden of TB was also higher in patients with high CD4 counts (n = 6). This difference was more pronounced in patients with HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 7) and also in patients with severe CD4^+ T cell deficiency (n = 2). This difference is likely because patients with HIV-uninfected CD4^+ T cell deficiency have a lower burden of TB compared to individuals with CD4^+ T cell deficiency [5]. This finding is consistent with a previous report that suggested that TB incidence was highest in persons with CD4^+ T cell deficiency [5]. We did not see a difference in the burden of TB between persons with and without CD4^+ T cell deficiency in the South African population.

A larger study of African HIV-infected adults found that only those who died of TB had a higher mortality burden [8]. In this study, the majority of deaths occurred in those who had CD4^+ T cell deficiency. The majority of deaths in this population occurred in those with CD4^+ T cell deficiency, and CD4^+ T cell deficiency was a secondary result of CD4^+ T cell deficiency. In this study, we found that TB was associated with a higher mortality burden in patients with CD4^+ T cell deficiency.

The other important finding in this study was that patients with low CD4 counts were more likely to die from TB than those with low CD4^+ T cell deficiency. This finding is similar to a study of African adults who found that patients with CD4^+ T cell deficiency were more likely to die from TB [8].
