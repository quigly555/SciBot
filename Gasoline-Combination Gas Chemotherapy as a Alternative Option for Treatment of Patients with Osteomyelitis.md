## Abstract
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the european model of Streptomyces pullulans, Lmux and Adossum toxinum against Candida species. The results showed that the endophytic fungus Proteum purpureum exhibited the greatest activity against Candida species. The in vitro activity of the Candida species was the least studied.


## Introduction
Plant biomass has been extensively studied over the past decade.


## Methods

. albicans isolates were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), ATCC-Madison, USA. The clinical isolates were isolated from patients with cryptococcal meningitis in the Department of Clinical Medicine, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. These isolates were identified as C. albicans (ATCC 90112), C. dubliniensis (ATCC 16404), C. glabrata (ATCC 6258), C. tropicalis (ATCC 6258), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. lusitaniae (ATCC 56619), C. glabrata (ATCC 9062), C. lusitaniae (ATCC 4327), C. glabrata (ATCC 56619), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. glabrata (ATCC 4637), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. tropicalis (ATCC 6258), C. lusitaniae (ATCC 46619), C. glabrata (ATCC 46619), C. dubliniensis (ATCC 6638), and C. tropicalis (ATCC 46619).

The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The primary endophytic and sporotrichogenic fungi were obtained from ATCC and subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 37 °C for 24 h. The secondary endophytic fungi were isolated from SDA at 37 °C for 48 h. To prepare the SDA agar, the fungus was inoculated on SDA plates. The SDA agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The mycelial pellets were removed from the SDA plates and inoculated onto SDA agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.


## Results
We performed an empirical multicenter, multicenter, and retrospective trial of the terpenoids and peptones combination in 50 patients with osteomyeliti. These trials were conducted in a first-site unit (STU) of the participating hospitals in the town of Zürich, Switzerland. We did not find any promising combination of terpenoids or peptones with the included corticosteroid regimen of Lamivudine, followed by nikkomycin, itraconazole, lamivudine, and micafungin. Furthermore, we did not find a synergistic combination of terpenoids or peptones with nikkomycin or micafungin. We then performed a multicentre, multicenter, and retrospective trial of the combination of terpenoids and peptones combination in 51 patients with osteomyelitis. We found that terpenoids and peptones combination were very effective in treating osteomyelitis in a first-site unit (STU) of the STU of the town of Zürich, Switzerland. In addition, we found that terpenoids and peptones combination were very effective in treating osteomyelitis in a second-site unit (STU) of the STU of the town of Zürich, Switzerland. We also found that terpenoids and peptones combination were very effective in treating osteomyelitis in a second-site unit (STU) of the STU of the town of Zürich, Switzerland. These results suggest that terpenoids and peptones combination are very effective in treating osteomyelitis in a first-site unit.

Inhibitory Activity of Terpenoids and Proteolytic Enzymes Against Osteomyelitis Modeled in the Case of Osteomyelitis
In the case of osteomyelitis, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of terpenoids and enzymes against O. esculenta in vitro using the osmo-specific assay.


## Discussion
In this study, we found that E.
