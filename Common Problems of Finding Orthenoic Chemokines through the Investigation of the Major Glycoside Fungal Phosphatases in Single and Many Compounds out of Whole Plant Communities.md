## Abstract
Vineyards are good sources of fresh berries, fruits, and spices, but their origins are still unknown. In this study, we collected grapes of different cultivars from the VVMA family and analyzed the antioxidant enzymes (ATPases) produced by the berries. The results indicated that the VVMA family is the major component of antioxidant enzymes produced by all Vvärtaliella species investigated. The VVMA family has antioxidant enzymes with a specific activity on Vigecitrin, Cyproeurin, and Fusarium solublorin. It was found that the cultivars were synthetized and their active fractions were quantified. The antioxidant activity of the cultivars was assessed by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum cytotoxic concentrations (MRCs) using broth microdilution method.


## Introduction
2016), has become a common theme in the search for new antifungal agent.

Plants use a number of mechanisms to fight against fungi. Among them are mechanisms of defense against environmental stress, growth conditions, and drug resistance.

The battle against fungal pathogens
Historically, the term “antibiotic” was used to designate a group of enzymes that, when taken into the host, allow the fungus to grow, produce toxins, evade host defense mechanisms, or colonize the plant (Lefebvre, 2007; Kastan, 2013; Ostry and Klionsky, 2017). It has been found that the number of antifungal drugs available for the treatment of fungal infections is increasing, and that the development of new antifungal drugs against fungal infections is hampered by the lack of an approved drug for the treatment of fungal infections. The first antifungal was introduced in the late 1970s and was the fluconazole (FLC) that was approved for use in the 1980s (Binder et al., 1991). In the early 1990s, the number of other antifungals that were in clinical use (subsequently, other compounds) increased considerably, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first triazoles (triazoles that were orally administered for prophylaxis or treatment) in 1992.

Since then, numerous antifungals have been in development, and many new compounds are in the pipeline. The newest class of antifungals is the echinocandins, that target the cell wall of fungi. The echinocandins are a class of small molecules that inhibit fungal cell wall synthesis, and it is generally used to treat fungal infections (Ngamskulrungroj and Martin, 2012).

Although the number of antifungals continues to rise, there are still many drug combinations available. Many antifungals have been approved for use in humans and animals, and some of them are still in clinical development. For example, azoles, which inhibit the enzyme lanosterol 14-a demethylase (Erg11), and allylamines, which inhibit the enzyme ß-d-glucan synthase (ß-d-glucanase), have been approved for use in patients with skin fungal infections (Zakrzewska et al.


## Methods
We considered four of the major glycoside-extract Fungi patterns of interest as ‘purification’ and five patterns of three patterns of five patterns, with a total of seven pattern. We considered two patterns as ‘normal’ and four as ‘probable’. For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘primed’ and two patterns as ‘primed-to-normalized’. For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘primed’ and two patterns as ‘primed-to-normalized’.

For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘probable’ and two patterns as ‘probable-to-normalized’. For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘probable-to-normalized’ and two patterns as ‘probable-to-normalized’. For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘probable-to-normalized’ and two patterns as ‘probable-to-normalized’. For the analysis of the pattern of normalization, we considered one pattern as ‘probable-to-normalized’ and two patterns as ‘probable-to-normalized’.

2.4. Phylogenetic Analysis
In order to determine the phylogenetic relationship between the different Fungi, the phylogenetic tree was inferred from a concatenated data matrix of the data matrix of the major glycoside-extract Fungi (Table 2). We examined the phylogenetic relationships of the major glycoside-extract Fungi in four different species (Table 2). We determined the molecular evolutionary relationships between these four species by performing the Blastp search using the newly generated sequences of the major glycoside-extract Fungi, which were used for the phylogenetic analysis.


## Results

The enzyme activity of a protease was first analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) in both the positive and negative contro. As shown in Figure 2, the protease activity was highest in the protease hydrolysate. The activity of protease hydrolysate was also highest in the positive control. The protease activity of plant roots was highest in the protease hydrolysate.

To obtain a more accurate diagnosis of the fungal activities, all the enzymatic activities of protease hydrolysate and protease hydrolysate were compared. The highest enzyme activity of protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. This enzyme activity was also highest in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity in the protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity of protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate.

In order to increase the sensitivity of our assay to the reaction products obtained from the roots, the protease hydrolysate and protease hydrolysate were subjected to a reaction reaction with the xylose-fructose-6-phosphate-fructose-5-phosphate-fructose-6-phosphate (x6P) as a substrate. As shown in Figure 3, the reaction products from both protease hydrolysate and protease hydrolysate exhibited the highest enzyme activity. The highest enzyme activity in the protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity in the protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity in the protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate.

The highest activity of protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity of protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate. The highest enzyme activity in the protease hydrolysate was in the protease hydrolysate.


## Discussion
The study of the type of fungal species detected in this study showed that . albicans is the predominant phytochemical in plant community compositions of four different compartments (Figure 5, Table 3). This species is frequently isolated from plant tissues and organs, and is mainly found in plant tissue and organs, as well as in roots, leaves, fruits, and flowers (Gadd, 1988; Hassan et al., 2000). In addition, the species associated with plant communities are also found in different plant compartments, such as bark, roots, fruits, and flowers (Gadd, 1988; Hassan et al., 2000).

Phytochemical screening of the plant communities showed the presence of phytochemicals (i.e., the main chemical compounds) such as glycerol, flavonoids, glycerol, and citral compounds, among others (Figure 5, Table 3). This was consistent with previous studies that reported the presence of these compounds in plant communities of several species of Ascomycota (Gadd, 1988; Hassan et al., 2000).

The compounds identified as the main phytochemical molecules of the four compartments were the glycerol, flavonoids, glycerol, and citral compounds. These compounds, as well as the phytochemical molecules, were found in plants, which were similar to the phytochrome families identified in this study. It is important to note that the presence of the phytochemicals was not always confirmed by the chemical characterization, as both the identification and the number of species was small. However, the phytochemical compounds were identified by the chemical analysis of the fungal species, which was also the case in the other studies (Gadd, 1988; Hassan et al., 2000). The results of the chemical identification of the phytochemical compounds identified in this study was similar to previous studies (Gadd, 1988; Hassan et al., 2000).

Phytochemical screening of the plant community of the seven compartments showed the presence of various phytochemicals (i.e.
