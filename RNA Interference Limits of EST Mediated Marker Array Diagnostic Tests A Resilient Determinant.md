## Abstract
.

RDA and RDA-KO results were obtained from a matched library of 1545 transcript sequences generated from the RDA-KO and RDA-DHW3 libraries. The RDA-KO included 21 coding sequences (excluding two novel sequences), and 57 potential candidates. The RDA-DHW3 included 48 candidates, with 34 allogenic. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 included 47 candidates, with 59 allogenic. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 included 49 candidates, with 40 allogenic. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 included 51 candidates, with 41 allogenic. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 included 55 candidates, with 42 allogenic. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 included 54 candidates, with 44 allogenic.

The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 and RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 were the most highly expressed candidate genes, with the RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3 having the highest expression level. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA had the highest expression level in all tissue extracts (including the mouse lung) and the RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA-rDNA libraries compared to the other tissues. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA-rDNA was significantly more active in the mouse lung than in the other tissues, with the difference being an increase in the expression of genes involved in uptake and metabolism by the fungus. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA-rDNA library contained genes involved in the metabolism of the fungus, but genes involved in the transcription of genes involved in the P-C-G-T-K-O-P-D-S metabolism pathway. The RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA-rDNA-rDNA and RDA-KO-RDA-DHW3-rDNA-rDNA libraries also contained genes involved in the metabolism of the fungus, but the difference was an increase in the expression of genes involved in the P-C-G-T-K-O-P-D-S metabolism pathway.


## Introduction
One of the major problems with antibiotics is the overuse and overuse of antibiotics in agriculture. The search for new antibiotics is on to find that many are already used in humans, animals, and plants. Antibacterial agents are produced by different species of bacteria and in many cases have therapeutic applications, even though the effectiveness of these compounds is limited [1,2]. Antibacterial agents can be isolated from different sources such as plants, fungi, algae, and animals.


## Methods
All of the assays were performed in duplicate, and the M_b values were corrected for multiple testin. A beta-diversity index was calculated to assess the confidence of the EST results. A M_b value of 0.5 was considered to be the probability that the observed data were representative of a population. The Chao-square estimator was calculated to determine the relative diversity of the ESTs. A M_b value of 0.5 was considered to be the probability that the observed data were representative of a population. The Fungitell (Fungitell) model was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between the expected values of the tested samples using the Dendroscope module [11] in R version 3.4.3. In this method, the range of parameter values was calculated using the formula: F = (0.5-1.0)^-1/2 where 0.5 is the default value of the parameter and 1.0 is the maximum value of the parameter. The Fungitell method was performed with the following parameters: (0.5-1.0) F = (0.5-1.0)^-1/2) and (1.0-1.5) F = (1.0-1.5)^-1/2) The Fungitell model was also used for the calculation of the relative community similarity between the test samples. The parameter values of the Fungitell method were set to 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. The Euclidean distance method was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between the expected values of the tested samples.

Phylogenetic Analysis
All sequences from the latest published sequences available in GenBank were used for the phylogenetic analyses. These sequences were selected based on the quality and reliability of the phylogenetic tree, and were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 2013) and the additional datasets available in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org). The alignments were manually inspected and optimized for the best-performing model using the “tree.


## Results
oryzae Mutant
We found that we could use ESTs in EST-based gene prediction programs such as GEO or BLAST to identify genes that are highly enriched in EST. To analyze ESTs that are highly enriched in ESTs, we used a gene set of approximately 200,000 ESTs of the G. mellonella genome (Fig 1a). We found that we could predict ESTs of ESTs that were highly enriched in ESTs from both the G. mellonella genome and the gfp genome of M. oryzae.

To analyze the gene expression profiles of ESTs in the M. oryzae genome, we generated a gene set of ESTs of a 6-L3 strain of the G. mellonella species and analyzed their expression in a G. mellonella growth model (Fig 1b). We found that the expression profiles of the gene set of ESTs of G. mellonella were similar to those of the gfp genome, showing that the ESTs of the M. oryzae genome are highly expressed. These data indicate that G. mellonella is a laboratory strain that produces ESTs in the laboratory environment.

Expression of ESTs by the G. mellonella Genome in the G. mellonella Growth Model
We used a gene set of ESTs from the G. mellonella growth model to predict ESTs that are highly expressed in the G. mellonella genome. To validate our gene prediction programs and the expression of ESTs in the G. mellonella growth model, we analyzed the transcript levels of ESTs for which ESTs were highly expressed in the G. mellonella genome. To evaluate the biological consequences of our gene prediction programs, we conducted RNA-Seq experiments with the G. mellonella growth model using a reference strain of M. oryzae. We found that the expression of genes for which ESTs were highly expressed in the G. mellonella growth model were also found in the G. mellonella gfp genome. In the G. mellonella growth model, we found that the expression levels of the transcripts for which ESTs were highly expressed in the G. mellonella growth model were also found in the G. mellonella gfp genome.

To evaluate the impact of the ESTs of M.


## Discussion
mellonella for EST-based diagnostic assays using the . mellonella EST-based approach. We found that G. mellonella is highly responsive to the presence of fluconazole, a marker used in our study. Interestingly, we did not detect a significant difference between G. mellonella and other models of infection with fluconazole. However, we found that fluconazole has a very strong effect on G. mellonella in vitro, and that the level of fluconazole was enhanced when the concentration was changed to a higher concentration. This suggests that G. mellonella may be a suitable model for analyzing the effect of fluconazole on G. mellonella infections.

Furthermore, we found that the level of fluconazole was enhanced in G. mellonella when the fluconazole concentration was increased to 2 µg/mL. This suggests that fluconazole is more potent in G. mellonella than in other models of infection.

We also found that the levels of the GPI-interact protein were increased in G. mellonella when the concentration was increased to 2 µg/mL. This suggests that fluconazole is more potent than in vitro in G. mellonella.

We also found that the level of G. mellonella intracellular fluconazole was increased when the concentration was increased to 2 µg/mL. This suggests that fluconazole is more potent in G. mellonella than in other models of infection.

A total of 3923 out of 3923 GPI-interact proteins were detected in G. mellonella. This is a much smaller proportion of the total number of GPI-interact proteins in G. mellonella.

In G. mellonella, approximately 35% of the GPI-interact proteins were differentially expressed, and we identified 59 GPI-interact proteins that were up-regulated or down-regulated in G. mellonella when the fluconazole concentration was increased to 2 µg/mL. This suggests that these proteins are involved in the response to fluconazole. We also found that the level of intracellular fluconazole was increased in G.
