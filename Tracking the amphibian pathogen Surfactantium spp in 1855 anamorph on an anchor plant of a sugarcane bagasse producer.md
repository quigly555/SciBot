## Abstract
The filamentous fungus Botrytis cinerea is a serious pathogen of insect vectors in North America, and the causal agent of the gray mold rot of Conchobacterium racemosum in the United Kingdom, is one of the most important pathogens of the European Conchobacterium species, the causal agent of the rust green disease in the United States, and of the blue fly rust, which causes rust-like symptoms on rust acellular materials. Two new species, B. cinerea sp. nov. (BcBcRNvR) and BbCinatellia cinerea sp. nov.


## Introduction
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to all life on earth and they are essential to the biological control of gene expression.


## Methods
A thorough literature review was undertaken to collect more detail on the newly discovered species and related fung.

Phylogenetic Analysis
A phylogenetic analysis of Surfactantium spp was conducted using the maximum likelihood method [41] with a Jaccard distance of 100-25%, a mixed-gene substitution model [42], and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method [43]. The Bayesian method was applied to find best-fit nucleotide substitution models for the phylogenetic analysis. We then checked the nucleotide substitution models of Surfactantium spp and Surfactantium spp in all positions of Surfactantium spp without the addition of amino acid residues, so that a maximum likelihood method of 1000 bootstrap replicates was applied. All the trees were rooted with the obtained trees. Bootstrap values were determined from 1,000 replications.

Analysis of Phylogenetic Tree
The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method [44]. The distances of the tree line were calculated using the maximum-likelihood method [45]. The posterior probabilities (PP) were calculated using the neighbor-joining method, and the number of substitution categories was determined by a Bonferroni correction [46]. The probability of PPP = 0.95 was used to determine the significance of the difference between the observed data (N and N+1) and the hypotheses of the branching tree, which was generated by the program PROSA-I [47]. The phylogenetic tree was then generated using the neighbor-joining method [44] and a bootstrap method of 1000 replications. The posterior probabilities (PP) of PPP = 0.95 was used to determine the significance of the difference between the observed data (N and N+1) and the hypothesis of the branching tree (which was generated by the program PROSA-I). The trees were visualized with FigTree 1.4.1 software.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The phylogenetic tree of Surfactantium spp was generated using the neighbor-joining method [44] and the multilevel linear mixed model was used to fit the results [47]. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of Surfactantium spp was inferred using the PHYLIP software [48]. The concatenated tree was visualized with FigTree 1.4.1 software.


## Results
. Damm, the latter being the first to be shown to be a representative of a non-phylumaryophyte. We thus far had suspected that Surfactantium spp are probably the most toxic amphibian pathogens on plant hosts. Thus, we introduce the new name, Surplusamb.Surplusamb.surplusamb.

Surplusamb is a new genus with two new species, Surplusamb.hamburgensis and Surplusamb.muhamburae. The newly collected species has four septa, one in each of the distal and proximal septa, and three additional septa in the distal septum (Figure 1, Figure 2). Although the distal septum of the new species is shorter than the proximal septum of the new species, the distal septum is well defined and well branched (Figure 2). The new species is morphologically comparable to the new species, which has the septal ascomatal appendage and the distal septum of the new species (Figure 1, Figure 2).

The new species has the typical septal ascomatal appendage, but differs in its septum being branched at the distal septum, and its distal septum being slightly shorter than the distal septum (Figure 2).

## Discussion
In this study, we isolated and purified the mycobacterium D742 from the symbiotic fungus C. antarcticum. D742 is the type of mycobacterium D742 isolated from a D1/D2 symbiosis. The mycobacterium was isolated from D1/D2 symbiosis fungi and was characterized by an absence of typical cellulose-like cell wall and a high content of n-hexosylated glucose. D742 is also characterized by a high content of 6-isopropanol, which is an important component of wine fermentation [19,20].

The isolation of D742 in the ethanol extract showed good results with respect to its ability to degrade ethanol. The D742-E and D742-A fractions of the fermentation broth exhibited the highest activity of ethanol degradation. In the ethanol extract, the highest ethanol concentration was observed at 8.2% (w/w). The ethanol concentration in the ethanol extract was similar to that of C. antarcticum, except for ethanol. This ethanol concentration was comparable to that observed in the raw wine product, whereas the ethanol concentration in the fermenting medium was much lower. The highest ethanol concentration was observed in the D742-D742-A extract.

The yeasts C. pseudorhagii and C. krusei, and the mycobacterium Candida sp.
