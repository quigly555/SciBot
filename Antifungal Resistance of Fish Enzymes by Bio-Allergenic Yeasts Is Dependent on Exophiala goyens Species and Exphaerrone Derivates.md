## Abstract
The role of activated T lymphocytes in control of the transition between life-threatening infectious diseases and their medical interventions has evolved over the past century. Today, the circulation of T cells is associated with a variety of critical events, such as the initiation of allergic complications, infections, autoimmune responses, and immunosuppressants. T lymphocytes play an important role in controlling inflammation, stimulate immunity, and modulate the host defense against pathogens. However, the main contribution of activated T cells to these processes remains poorly understood. Our goal is to identify and characterize T cells that are capable of exert their immunosuppressive function in a control role of allergic inflammation. In this study, we identified T lymphocytes in the lungs of mice with severe allergic airway inflammation. Mice deficient for CD11b+ activated T cells displayed a significantly reduced airway responsiveness, and they were also hypersensitive to several cytokines including TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17A. Moreover, mice deficient in CD11b+ dendritic cells had a higher susceptibility to severe allergic airway inflammation. In addition, mice lacking CD11b+ dendritic cells also had a significantly higher Th1 and Th17 responses and a higher Th2 response when they developed lung inflammation. The lung was also more susceptible to fungal infections, in which pulmonary eosinophilia was also associated with lung dysregulated immunity. Our study suggests that activated T lymphocytes play an important role in controlling inflammation, and that Th1 and Th2 cells are also important in the control of allergic airway inflammation.


## Introduction
.


## Methods
. Plant Material
The seeds of P. higginsianum (Theatolia) were obtained from the bee breeding colony of the Federal University of São Paulo (UFSP-São Paulo). The seeds were used as seed material for the inoculation of the E. coli OP50 strain (Protocol # 03/2012), which was grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C in a shaker (200 rpm) for 18-24 h. Then, the bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in PBS. The growth of the bacteria was monitored by measuring the optical density (OD) at 600 nm (Uvat/nm).

4.2. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activities of the plant material were determined according to the method described by José Almeida et al. [19]. The antifungal activity of the plant material was determined by adding the stock solution of chloramphenicol (50 mg/mL) to the following concentrations: 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.


## Results
goyens and . festucae. The salmon are known for their great diversity of eukaryotic lifeforms, including eukaryotes, filamentous fungi and parasites (15, 18). In this study, the presence of a natural host species, E. goyens, was correlated with the expression of the fungal pathogens in E. goyens (Fig 2).

In the present study, we found that the fungal strains of E. goyens, E. festucae and E. festucae did not show significant differences in their expression of the fungal pathogenicity factors, including P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin, C-selectin, K-selectin and F-selectin (Fig 2). However, the expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin were significantly different between the two fungal strains of E. festucae. In addition, the expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin was significantly different between the two fungi strains of E. festucae (Fig 2).

The relationship between the fungal strains of E. goyens and the environmental source of E. festucae is described below. Our results showed that the expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin were significantly different between the two fungal strains of E. goyens. The expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin was significantly different between the two fungi strains of E. festucae. In addition, the expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin were significantly different between the two fungi strains of E. festucae. These results showed that the expression of P-selectin, C-selectin, G-selectin and K-selectin was significantly different between the two fungi strains of E. goyens.

## Discussion
niger and . terreus were highly bio-allergic (Table 2). The highest A. niger bio-allergic yeasts and the lowest bio-allergenic yeasts were identified in the present study. The bio-allergenic yeasts were highly abundant in the summertime, while the bio-allergenic yeasts were highly abundant in the winter time and the lowest bio-allergenic yeasts were found in the spring time (Table 2). In addition, the presence of the bio-allergenic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, an isolate of the genus Acremonium that is known to be highly bio-allergic (Table 2), was detected in the present study. The high abundance of Yarrowia lipolytica in the summertime and the low abundance of Yarrowia lipolytica in the wintertime are consistent with the findings of previous studies (27-29). Moreover, the presence of this yeast in fish was associated with the high abundance of bio-allergenic yeasts and the lowest bio-allergenic yeasts in the summertime (Table 2).

Yarrowia lipolytica has been found in the wine industry and the high abundance of this yeast in the wintertime is consistent with the findings of previous studies (29, 30). The high abundance of Yarrowia lipolytica in the summertime and the low abundance of Yarrowia lipolytica in the wintertime are also consistent with the findings of previous studies (28, 29). The present study also revealed that the bio-allergenic yeasts were present in all the species of the genera Acremonium and Acremyces in the summertime, and the bio-allergenic yeasts were present in all the genera Acremyces and Acremyces in the wintertime. Moreover, the high abundance of the bio-allergenic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica in the summertime and the low abundance of Yarrowia lipolytica in the wintertime are also consistent with the findings of previous studies (27, 28).
