## Abstract
Understanding of the microbiome in hospital settings is important to enable pre-eminent medical institutions to develop strategies to improve care. This paper describes the evidence of the role of different skin care formulations (NPs) in controlling microbial pathology in the context of infection and transplantation.

Background. The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) is increasing, with fungal growth and resistance to antimicrobial agents. Long-term, these infections result in an increased risk of IFI. The aim of this paper is to review the published literature since 1980, to describe the common IFI manifestations, risk factors, and treatments, and to evaluate the implications of long-term use of NPs for IFI prevention.

Methods. We searched the electronic medical records for medical books containing IFI published between 1980 and 2011, and we included relevant electronic-based electronic-displaying (EBA searches) reporting all IFI events. We searched for IFI associated studies in the public-sector and non-intrinsic-patient databases, and pooled data from all IFI studies reported in Pubmed and Scopus databases. We searched for studies published from 1980 to 2011 in three databases, and we pooled data from Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central.

Results. A total of 45 IFI were summarized, most of them related to medical-care paths. Most IFI included the following risk factors: infection, non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) vasculitis, hematologic malignancy, or transplantation-related disease. The incidence of IFI was highest in the IRCCS program, decreasing to 20.3% in 2011 from 23.9% in 1980, with no changes in the decade. IFI were also found in five published studies.


## Introduction
 2013) but the importance of other virulence factors has not been describe.

More than 150 virulence factors have been identified in pathogenic fungi (Liu et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Some of these have been characterized in bacterial pathogens (Müller-Van der Klei et al., 2010) or in fungi (MacKinnon et al., 2004; Cramer et al., 2009; Ngamskulrungroj et al., 2013). A few of them have been described in fungal pathogens. The ascomycete Histoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting immunocompromised patients. In patients with underlying diseases, histoplasmosis may present with histoplasmosis-like symptoms, often involving the lungs, but also spreading to other organs (Zhou et al., 2011).

The formation of hyphal structures by fungi is similar to the formation of spores and hyphae in plants (Yuan et al., 2012). Histoplasmosis has a long history and is considered to be the most widespread fungal pathogen infection in animals and plants (Sanglard, 1998; Zhurbov, 2004). Fungal spores can be inhalated and lodge in the respiratory tract. Once inside the respiratory tract, they encounter host immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Once in the lung, macrophages undergo a pattern-recognition process by which they engulf and neutralize fungal particles, including bacteria and fungi. The macrophage-fungal interaction occurs primarily by two main mechanisms: (1) the activation of macrophage-triggered immune responses and (2) the recruitment of macrophages to the site of infection. The mechanisms by which fungal spores and hyphae form have been well described. However, a few of these mechanisms have been studied in detail. For example, the myeloid cells of the lung are responsible for the recruitment of macrophages to the site of infection (Wang et al., 2000; Qiao and Hu, 2001). A number of myeloid cells such as macrophages and epithelial cells are also involved in the recruitment process of macrophages to sites of infection (Wang et al., 2000). There is also a critical role of innate lymphoid cells in the recruitment process. Indeed, an association between myeloid cells and fungal spores and hyphae has been described.


## Methods
These fungi included Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90018), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 6633), Neospora crassa (ATCC 90020), and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 19606. The pathogenic fungi were classified into four stages: (1) pathogenic fungi, (2) pathogenic fungi, and (3) pathogenic fungi, as previously described [33].

Strains were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) for 3 days at 30°C. Prior to use, the culture medium was replaced with Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) to obtain the appropriate dilution. For fungal cultures, the slants of the SDA were then thoroughly mixed and the resulting mixture was adjusted to the appropriate final concentration. The inoculum was prepared by suspending 1 × 10^4 to 10^6 CFU/mL in 0.5% Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) and poured into a Petri dish and incubated at 30°C for 48 hours. The colonies were then collected and diluted to the appropriate final concentrations. Three grams of the fungal suspension were then spread onto the surface of the SDA plates and incubated for 24 hours at 30°C.

DNA Extraction and PCR Amplification of ITS1 and ITS2, and the Gene Sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from fungal mycelium using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The fungal mycelium was then removed from the tissue, washed, and transferred to a clean clean 2.5 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The mycelium was then placed into a small tube containing distilled water and heated to boiling. The samples were then sonicated and the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was then collected and stored at -20°C for subsequent DNA extraction.

Characterization of Fungal CIRF1
The Fungal CIRF1 gene was expressed in the brain and lung by the R. toruloides strain ATCC 25923 (GenBank accession number: KJ164086). The C. albicans strain ATCC 25923 was grown in BHI broth with glucose, fructose, and galactose and the C. albicans strains were subjected to 1:10 dilution plates. The total biomass and total RNA obtained from the culture medium were higher in the glucose-grown cultures than the BHI culture (Table 1). The results suggest that the Fungal CIRF1 gene is expressed in the brain and lung in the F. graminearum and F. graminearum, respectively.

This study provides new insights into the mechanism of cellular response to fungi-infected human cells and raises new questions about the biology and evolution of pathogenicity of fungi. The current understanding of how these fungi respond to fungal pathogens is based on the ability of fungi to form biofilm-like structures on the host surface. In addition to biofilm formation, biofilm formation has been found in other fungi, including C. neoformans, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis, and the biofilm formation and invasion of fungi have also been found in other fungi [36]-[39]. In C. albicans, biofilm formation has been observed, and the biofilm formation is a process that is induced by light, and the production of biofilm-like structures [40]-[42]. In C. parapsilosis, the biofilm formation and invasion of the fungus has also been observed, and the biofilm formation and invasion of fungi is induced by light [43]. The findings of this study, together with the results of previous studies, indicate that fungal biofilm formation occurs in the presence of specific stimuli and that biofilm formation and invasion are triggered by light.

Our findings also provide new insights into the mechanisms of fungal response to fungal pathogens. The fungus that infects human cells, C. albicans, is reported to have a growth rate that is in the range of 1 to 10 log units of growth [43]-[45]. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, on the other hand, are reported to have a growth rate that is in the range of 1 to 10 log units of growth [46], [47]. The C. parapsilosis strain used in this study was isolated from human serum, and its growth rate is reported to be within the range of 1 to 10 log units of growth. Although C. albicans is a fungus, our findings are in agreement with previous reports, in which C. parapsilosis was isolated from human serum [22]-[24], suggesting that C.
