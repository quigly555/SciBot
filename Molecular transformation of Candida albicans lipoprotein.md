## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is a life-threatening opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Current antifungal therapies have limited efficacy and limited activity in controlling A. fumigatus infections. Therefore, new approaches to enhance antifungal drug response are needed.


## Introduction
Fungal infections are a major public health problem and are increasing in number. In fact, in 2014, a significant increase in fungal infections was observed in the United States (1). These infections are due to the increase in fungal resistance to antifungal agents, increased antifungal susceptibility by Candida species, and an increase in the fungal resistance to azole drugs (2). The incidence of fungal infections has increased in the past two decades. The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) was approximately one-third of invasive fungal infections in the United States in 2008 (3).


## Methods
albicans) and JW1390-JW1391 (. albicans). The PCR program consisted of a 5 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of annealing at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel stained with 1.5% agarose gels. The sequences were checked using the NCBI GenBank database.

Preparation of conidia
In order to prepare a complete monoculture, a single colony of C. albicans (4 × 10^4 conidia ml^-1) was inoculated on Sabouraud agar (SDA, L-McM, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. The cultures were grown for 2 days and then transferred to Sabouraud broth (SBA, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. Cultures were kept at room temperature for 1 h. The conidia were harvested by filtration using a Calfa Laminar flow hood, washed with distilled water, and suspended in distilled water. The conidia were diluted with distilled water to the required density (1 × 10^6 conidia/ml) and prepared as described [22].

## Results
The extract was active in the supernatant of the natural Candida albicans strain (Table 2) and its concentration was detected to be 10-fold higher than the contro. The concentration of ethanol (50 µg/ml) was detected to be 1.5-fold higher than that of acetate (20 µg/ml), which showed to be 1.0-fold higher. The concentration of acetate was found to be 2.6-fold higher than that of acetate, which showed to be 1.0-fold higher. The concentration of ethanol was found to be 1.5-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.3-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was detected to be 1.5-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 1.5-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was detected to be 0.9-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was detected to be 1.5-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.8-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 2.4-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.8-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 2.6-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.6-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.6-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.7-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 2.7-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 2.8-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.6-fold higher than that of acetate. The concentration of acetate was found to be 0.6-fold higher than that of acetate.


## Discussion
In this study, we tested the potential of the . albicans gene-binding protein-derived protein (CAT1) to disrupt the ability of C. albicans to incorporate D-lactam and C-terminal transporters into its native position. The results showed that CAT1 was highly efficient in disrupting C. albicans’ native C. albicans-induced lipid rafts (Table S1). The CAT1 enzyme inhibited the formation of membrane-bound lipid rafts (Pv) and blocked the internalization of lipids (L), a key lipid-stabilizing agent in the cell [49]. In addition, CAT1 was highly efficient in disrupting the intracellular lipid rafts (Rsp), a crucial intracellular lipid-stabilizing agent [50]. The CAT1 enzyme also inhibited the formation of the lipid-stabilizing agent (L) from the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the phospholipid rafts (PRs) [51]. Thus, it is possible that CAT1 could function as a lipid-stabilizing enzyme to increase the activity of the lipid rafts.

To examine the efficiency of the CAT1 enzyme in disrupting the internalization of lipid rafts and the intracellular lipid rafts (IPs), we determined the capacity of the enzyme to block the internalization of lipids (L) in C. albicans. Lipids are a critical barrier for the normal functioning of the liver [52], and the levels of the parasite’s C-terminal transporters (TDR) are critical for parasite survival and progression of the disease [53]. Therefore, the enzyme was highly efficient in disrupting the internalization of lipid rafts and intracellular lipids (L) in C. albicans. In addition, CAT1 was highly efficient in disrupting the intracellular lipids (L) in C. albicans.

The C. albicans gene-binding protein-derived protein (CAT1) was also highly efficient in disrupting the intracellular lipid rafts (Pv) and lipid bilayer (L) in C. albicans.
