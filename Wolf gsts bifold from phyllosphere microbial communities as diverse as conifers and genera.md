## Abstract
Current research has attempted to distinguish yeast and mold species from a host’s host cell, generating hypotheses about host-pathogen interactions among cellular components. While these concepts have many practical implications, they often do not explain the interaction of specific pathogens and phenotypes such as virulence factors, resistance and biofilm formation, or the pathogenicity of yeast species, which have been poorly characterized.

To identify the mechanisms of the interactions between a microbe and a human host, the RNA-seq. and bioinformatics analysis of human Candida albicans cells was used to generate strains with different abilities, in a time-course model. After characterizing the response of the human macrophage to the infection, we postulated that the clustering of the yeasts may be a mechanism to avoid the infection and that the ability to generate these strains may have a role in the host's innate immune response. We found that the fungal cell wall is a very sensitive structure to stimulate the expression of several cytokines, with the same activation that occurs after the infection. Furthermore, the fungal virulence profile appears to be recapitulated during the infection. Finally, we found that the fungal cell wall is an excellent target for the action of vaccines.

Our results indicate that yeasts can interact with and cause infections in both humans and animals, and these yeasts have great potential for developing vaccines and as biocontrol agents.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom contains a diverse but diverse microbial flora with great biotechnological potential (Ueno et al., 2012). The fungal kingdom is comprised of a wide diversity of organisms with potential as biocontrol agents, e.g., plant pathogens, biofilms, plant-associated microbial communities, or as biotechnological instruments (Gomez et al., 2006). Research in the field of plant-microbe interactions is necessary to develop new biocontrol and antimycotic strategies (Dujardin et al., 2017).

A recent study (in the field) evaluated the potential of metagenomic sequencing to identify the composition of plant microbiota in the natural ecosystems of four temperate areas (Naseem et al., 2017). The study was based on metagenomic sequencing of ITS and ß-tubulin and revealed that metagenomic sequencing of the ITS region revealed the presence of a high diversity of phyllosphere fungi and bacterial phyla (Naseem et al., 2017). However, the analysis of ITS1-5.8S rDNA gene from the ITS region revealed a low diversity of phyllosphere fungi and bacterial phyla (Naseem et al., 2017). Thus, the ITS sequence data generated by this study may be useful for future research in the field of plant-microbe interactions. However, the ITS sequence data generated by the metabarcoding approach could be useful for further analysis of plant-microbe interactions and their potential as biocontrol agents. In this study, we aimed to develop an ITS metabarcoding approach that could potentially identify phyllosphere fungi and bacterial phyla in the natural ecosystem of three temperate regions of the Mediterranean basin.


## Methods
Data collection and analysis
The analyzed data sets included data on opportunistic species, colonial/fungal taxa, and P. infestans/sporococcinolata (a.k.a. S. ym, from B. infestans) and the species sampled from Thailand. The data sets were obtained from the Pacific Biodiversity Institute (PBI), Agarical Thailand (TA), and the National P. infestans Collection (P.


## Results
This is in line with the ability of the . faecalis and B. gescalia bifold to colonise and survive phyllosphere environments (Fig 1).

We next compared the effect of the cecumene-based biocontrol and the cecumene-based biocontrol of the three major key players: the cecumene-based biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction and the cecumene-based biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction.

Biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction
Our analysis of the effect of the three key C. albicans biocontrol agents on phyllosphere microbial communities suggests that the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction is highly effective in the absence of the biocontrol of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction.

For instance, the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction and the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction in the absence of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction are highly effective in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction. This finding contrasts with the results of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction and the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction in the presence of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction. For instance, the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction is highly effective in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction. This finding contrasts with the results of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction and the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction in the presence of the plant-pathogen interaction.

When we consider the impact of the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction, the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction is highly effective in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction. In addition, the biocontrol of the plant-pathogen interaction is highly effective in the absence of the plant-pathogen interaction.


## Discussion
 2015.

The genus Alpinus is a host of species of metazoan-like species with wide-spread distributions in tropical, temperate, and tropical and subtropical regions (Rajan et al., 2013). Alpinus brasiliensis is a species of filamentous and saprophytic fungi known to inhabit a wide range of substrates, including mangrove, sand, and algae (Rajan et al., 2013). The genus Alpinus is distinguished from the genera Alpinus, Alpinus, Alpinus, Alpinus, and Alpinus on the basis of the ability to produce multinucleate, multialleolate, multilocular, multiseptate spores (Rajan et al., 2013). The genus Alpinus, which is closely related to Alpinus marinus, is known to produce multinucleate, multilocular spores and multiseptate spores (Rajan et al., 2013). Aphaerotinus is a well-known species of saprophytic fungi and associated with decaying wood and leaves (Séru, 2006). The genus Aphaerotis is a fungus with wide-spread distributions in temperate and tropical regions (Rajan et al., 2013). The genus Alpinus, which includes species that produce multinucleate, multilocular, multiseptate spores (Rajan et al., 2013), is a group of fungal species that produce multiseptate spores (Rajan et al., 2013). Alpinus marinus is a species of saprophytic fungi that produces multinucleate, multilocular, multiseptate spores (Rajan et al., 2013). The genus Alpinus, which includes species that produce multinucleate, multilocular, multiseptate spores, is also known to produce multinucleate spores (Rajan et al., 2013).

The genera Leptothrema, Leptothrema, and Leptosphaeropsis were previously described in the same forest, but the taxonomic placement of these genera was not possible (Liu et al., 2014). We present here the placement of Leptothrema bifolia and Leptothrema eucalypti in the same forest.
