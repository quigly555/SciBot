## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the causative agent of cryptococcosis in humans and animals. The primary cryptococcal virulence factor of C. gattii is polysaccharide capsule, which is elicited by exposure to capsule-rich medium in the mammalian host. Previously, we demonstrated that C. gattii produces a polysaccharide capsule upon contact with macrophages. To identify molecules that mediate the stimulation of cryptococcal capsule, we generated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from C. gattii cells treated with high doses of amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, ketoconazole, nystatin, or itraconazole. EVs were also examined by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to determine capsule release. We found that amphotericin B, flucytosine, ketoconazole, nystatin, and vesicular inhibitor ketoconazole induced a large volume capsule release with a capsule permeability. Ketoconazole induced a capsule swelling and disrupted the cell wall. Ketoconazole induced a rapid swelling and capsule disruption. The results suggest that C. gattii produces a capsule via a post-translational modification process involving the inducible host cell. These findings suggest that treatment with a capsule stimulator can modulate cryptococcal capsule release. Finally, we investigated the effects of amphotericin B, flucytosine, and vesicular inhibitor ketoconazole on C. gattii hypha morphology, and found that the addition of ketoconazole too soon led to significant capsule enlargement of C. gattii hypha. These findings strongly suggest that treatment with a capsule stimulator before the induction of the immune response is a useful strategy to reduce the risk of infection of C. gattii.


## Introduction
Coffee is a popular traditional Indian delicacy which is grown in over 50 countries worldwide. In India, it is grown in large quantities around the world. Coffee is traditionally made from a single plant, the coffee tree. The first recorded human contact with coffee occurred with the earache of a Asian man named Anung-Mappe, who died from a cerebral hemorrhage, about 100 years ago (Morrison and Barton, 2011). Coffee was not eaten before that time, but today is grown in some of the most developed countries such as China, India and Nepal. Coffee is still grown in the United States, and even though the quantity of coffee consumed in China is less than that of its Asian counterpart, it is still grown in most Asian countries including India. Coffee is grown in many parts of the world and is grown in many countries throughout the world. Coffee is grown in many countries, including the United States, in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Coffee is also grown in many countries throughout the world. Coffee is produced from the environment. Coffee is grown in different countries such as China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil. Coffee is sold at various retail stores in various countries. Coffee is usually sold in large quantities in many countries, but the volume can vary. Coffee is sold in quantity by millilitre to several hundred kilogram quantities annually. Coffee is sold at a marketable price. In the United States, coffee is sold in large quantities in many countries. Coffee is traded at a marketable price. The global market for coffee in India is estimated to be worth $3 billion in 2017. Coffee is grown in India and is traded at a marketable price. In the United States, a substantial amount of coffee is traded worldwide. Coffee is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( Mercantilism Commission, New York, NY, USA).


## Methods
Fungal strains and culture conditions
All fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The A. fumigatus strain Af293 was kindly provided by Dr. David S. Beresford (University of California, Davis, CA, United States). The A. fumigatus strain was stored as a stock at -80°C in 20% glycerol at -80°C. A. fumigatus strains used in this study were stored as frozen stocks at -80°C and stored at -80°C.

Yeast strain maintenance and growth conditions
A. fumigatus strain Af293 (the A. fumigatus wild-type strain and the gene deletion mutants) was cultivated in liquid yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500× g for 5 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and resuspended to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5-0.8, with or without 1.5% NaCl.

For growth curve analysis of A. fumigatus strain, cells were grown overnight at 30°C in YPD broth at 200 rpm. The cells were diluted with 100 µl YPD broth to an OD_600 of 0.6-1.0. For growth curve analysis of A.


## Results
The rat-type IFG-binding globin, named IFG-binding globin, is a widely used mouse IFG-binding protei. It has a peroxidase activity, and is responsible for the production of the peroxidase and the efflux pump [27]. As shown in Figure 2, the rat-type IFG-binding globin has a significantly lower peroxidase activity than the rat-type IFG-binding globin, but the absence of the peroxidase activity of the rat-type IFG-binding globin did not change the overall pattern of peroxisomal expression of the rat-type IFG-binding globin. These results indicate that the presence of the peroxidase activity of the rat-type IFG-binding globin does not influence the overall expression of the rat-type IFG-binding globin.

Effect of IFG on the Expression of the Induced High-Income and High-Income-Loss Syndrome (HIS) Gene by Expression of the Inhibitory Gene and Other Phenotype-Related Genes
In order to determine the effect of IFG on the expression of the other phenotypes associated with the HIS phenotype, we analyzed the expression of the other phenotypes associated with the HIS phenotype and other phenotypes associated with the moderate HIS phenotype. The HIS phenotype was characterized by a decreased expression of the human FK506 transporter, P2B3 [28]. P2B3, which is produced by the N-terminal end of the human FKBP12 protein and is known to be associated with the pheromone response pathway in S. cerevisiae and A. niger, has been implicated in the production of the pheromone response factor pheromone receptor in A. fumigatus [29]. In addition, it has been shown that A. fumigatus P2B3, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans is a molecular target of human P2B3 [29], [30], [31].


## Discussion
This study was conducted to investigate the potential of the G1/M1C receptor, a common target of classical molecular targeting, to be targeted to the surface of C. albicans by using a mixture of in vitro and in vivo mutant strains. We found that the addition of cAMP resulted in increased surface expression of C. albicans PAS1, a marker of M1C receptor activity, and increased surface expression of C. albicans PAS2, a marker of M1C receptor activity. The addition of cAMP to the in vivo mutant strain showed an increase in surface expression of C. albicans PAS3, a marker of M1C receptor activity. The addition of cAMP to the in vivo mutant strain also resulted in enhanced surface expression of C. albicans PAS4, a marker of M1C receptor activity. These results are consistent with previous studies, which showed that cAMP is associated with M1C receptor activity [28-30]. The addition of cAMP to the in vivo mutant strain also resulted in an increase in surface expression of C. albicans PAS5, a marker of M1C receptor activity. The addition of cAMP to the in vivo mutant strain also resulted in an increase in surface expression of C. albicans PAS6, a marker of M1C receptor activity. These results are consistent with the previous studies showing that cAMP is associated with M1C receptor activity [28-30].
