## Abstract
Amoebiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of humans and is caused by the protozoan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi in the Americas. It causes life-threatening infections mainly in immunocompromised patients. We have examined the frequency of the Tg variant Tg18 in the T. gondii genome and the T. cruzi genomes of 33 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 12 toxoplasmosis-related seropositive patients. The genetic structure of the Tg variant Tg18 was analyzed by BLAST analysis and the results indicated that the Tg variant Tg18 is more closely related to the Tg19 variant Tg19 than to Tg18. In these Tg18 genomes, the genes coding for sterol biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. FAD1 and FAD2) were clustered and the presence of a conserved mitochondrial helix in the Tg variant Tg18 genome was not found. Instead, the genes encoding ergosterol and polyketide synthases were found to be homologous.


## Introduction
The cell wall is a key component of the fungal life. It is the first and last cell wall component that interacts with proteins. This structure plays a critical role in fungal cell wall organization, structure, and function. It protects the cell against environmental stresses, and it also plays a role in regulating the immune system, morphogenesis, and the expression of virulence factors (Malloch and Wilson, 2009). In fungi, the cell wall is a dynamic structure, consists of interconnected layers that form an interconnected structure that can be functionally manipulated using different chemical strategies (Gross et al., 2000; Doss et al., 2000; Pappas and Axelsson, 2002; Martel et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Maziarzou et al., 2008; Quang et al., 2009), and is activated by specific extracellular signals such as phospholipase A1 (Doss et al., 2000; Schmit et al., 2001; Cai et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2003; Herrmann et al., 2003; Thiele et al., 2003; Giaever et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006).

The cell wall is a complex network of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids that control cell growth, survival, and morphogenesis (Hogan et al., 1995; Taylor and Bassler, 1997; Stahl et al., 1998). The cell wall is a complex structure, containing a layer of glycoproteins, proteins, and lipids (Metzenhau and Hochholder, 1996). Glycosyl hydrolases (GPs) catalyze the reduction of glycosyl residues by means of a “glycosidase” (Glyanase) to generate anionic, hydroxylated polysaccharides and sugars, which are then further processed into compounds. Glycosyl hydrolases are found in all eukaryotic species and are grouped into three major groups: the genus Glycosyl hydrolase, which is responsible for the carbohydrate hydrolysis, and the genus of glycoproteins (Doddapaneni et al., 2003).


## Methods
Fungal isolates and cultivation
A total of 38 isolates of P. digitatum were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and their sequence and molecular structure was described by Biaserend et al. (2007) [5]. The data were deposited in the Mycology and Mycology Collection of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Togo (Togo, Nigeria).

Genome sequencing and annotation
A total of 43 isolates of P. digitatum, of which 30 were P. digitatum clinical isolates, and 22 were clinical isolates of P. digitatum, were sequenced by Illumina (V5 plate reader, HiSeq 2000, Illumina, CA, USA) on a MiSeq platform. Sequencing reads were assembled using STAR-FLX, version 4.1.5 [31] and aligned to P. digitatum reference genomes P. digitatum H99 and P. digitatum verrucosum (MCEP02/MCEP04) [32]. The P. digitatum P5C and P. digitatum verrucosum genomes were also sequenced. The analysis was conducted using the STAR-FLX pipeline as implemented in STAR-FLX 2.5.1 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/p5c/) and the accession numbers of each gene were given in Table 1. The annotation of P. digitatum gene sequences was carried out using the annotations of P. digitatum reference genomes P. digitatum H99 and P. digitatum verrucosum, and the P. digitatum P5C and P. digitatum verrucosum genome were also annotated. The program STAR-FLX was used to generate the CDS-formatted alignment of the P. digitatum genomic sequence using the CDS-formatted alignment tool in the CDS-formatted alignment tool in the STAR-FLX 2.5.1 package. The identified P. digitatum genes were then aligned to the P. digitatum reference genome using the CDS-formatted alignment tool in the CDS-formatted alignment tool in the STAR-FLX 2.5.1 package and the alignment was then used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method [33]. The phylogenetic tree was then visualized using the WebLogo software [34].


## Results
Production of Trp Biosynthetic Proteins and Proteolysis of Polyketide Synthetic Proteins
The proteins used in this study were identified using the R. solani gene-tblast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast/index.cgi). The identified proteins are shown in Figure 1A. In addition, the protein structures of other known fungal trp proteins are presented in Supplementary Table S1. To elucidate the potential role of the Trp proteins in fungal trp biology, the fungal glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (TF) Trp2, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (GT), the glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor (GTI), the glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor (GHI) Trp1, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (HAI) Trp2, and the glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor (GHI) Trp3 were analyzed. The results showed that the observed proteins are the most similar proteins to those of other Trp proteins.

In addition, the analysis of the predicted glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (GT) Trp2, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (GT), the glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor (GT), the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (HAI), the glycosyl hydrolase inhibitor (GHI), the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (HAI), and the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme (HAI) demonstrated that the glycosyl hydrolase enzymes were functional. In the case of Trp3, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp1, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp2, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp1, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp2, the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp1, and the glycosyl hydrolase enzyme was found to be the most similar protein to that of Trp2.


## Discussion
We present a case of EBV-related subtype-2 pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient with endobronchial tuberculoma. The patient had a history of travel to the United States, and EBV seroconversion was suspected. The patient presented with altered pulmonary function with progressive dyspnea, alveolar leakage and white matter involvement.

A detailed history of EBV disease, with the diagnosis of EBV subtype-2 pulmonary tuberculosis, was also reported by Lee and Goh in an outbreak of EBV-related subtype-2 pulmonary TB in the United States. [1] This patient had an EBV seroconversion, which was confirmed by EBV polymerase III sequencing. [2]

A possible explanation for EBV-related subtype-2 pulmonary TB in our patient is that EBV-related subtype-2 pulmonary TB is not uncommon, and the patient was not HIV-negative. [3] However, EBV-related subtype-2 pulmonary TB has been associated with a high risk of death or infection with other pathogens. [4] The patient had a history of travel, anemia, prolonged stay in the ICU and non-respiratory complications.

EBV subtype-2 pulmonary TB has been reported in patients with non-HIV-associated TB and sub-Saharan Africa. [5] EBV-associated TB is a chronic disease of tuberculoma in patients with sub-Saharan African descent. [6] This patient had a history of travel, anemia and limited abdominal excretion of ETC. However, EBV infection was not associated with tuberculoma in our patient.

Although EBV subtype-2 pulmonary tuberculosis is rare, it has been reported in the literature. [7] This case was unique in that EBV was isolated from EBV-positive patients. [8] In one report, EBV was isolated from patients with HIV infection. [9] In our patient, EBV was isolated from patients with a history of travel to the United States.

The patient had a history of travel to the United States and TB. This case demonstrates the importance of EBV in TB diagnosis in the developing world. The patient had a history of travel to the United States. There was no history of TB, and the patient had a normal CD4+ T cell count.

The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B, followed by oral fluconazole.
