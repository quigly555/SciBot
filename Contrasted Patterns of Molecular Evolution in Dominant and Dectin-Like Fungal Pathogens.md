## Abstract
The Cryptococcus species complex comprises three sibling taxa C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. gattii, and is comprised of at least 90 isolates, with the majority being diagonally related. Genes D1 and D2 are major regulators of polysaccharide biosynthesis in C. neoformans, and C. gattii is divided into D1 (genes for melanin synthesis) and D3 (cell wall) domains. We used sequence analysis to infer the evolutionary history of the D1 and D2 domains of the fungal mycorrhizan lectin FcF to show that these two domains have been independently lost. Analysis of the mycorrhiza-1 and mycorrhiza-2 genomes did not support the idea that these two domains were derived from horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotic organisms. Instead, FcF-fuc-1 and FcF-fuc-2 are transcription factors derived from genes for the two mycorrhiza-1 and mycorrhiza-2 domains, which appears to have contributed independently to the extreme phenotypic diversity of the C. neoformans species complex. Our results provide the first comparative analysis of the mycorrhizan lectin FcF and the cell wall polysaccharide capsule of C. neoformans.

Cryptococcus is a major fungal pathogen that is responsible for devastating the lives of millions of people worldwide each year. The cell wall is one of the most important structural components of the fungal cell, and is extensively modified by interactions with other components, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident cells, proteins, and cell wall carbohydrates. The mycorrhizan lectin FcF (Myc FcF) has been reported to be involved in different signaling pathways, and its role in Cryptococcus is supported by the data herein. Here we analyzed the distribution of FcF in the genomes of two C. neoformans isolates, one with a novel mycorrhizan domain, and the other without. To analyze the functional and evolutionary features of the FcF-fuc-1 and the cell wall polysaccharide capsule of C. neoformans, we examined the genomes of the isolates separately.


## Introduction
This is a huge number and shows a tremendous diversity in terms of the diversity of taxa and degree of specialization and speciation [11,12. It is also a large and diverse ecosystem that can be found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats as well as deep-sea, marine, and arctic environments [12]. The diversity of microbial species is also reflected in the degree of taxonomic diversities, which can be found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species groups [13]. These species are generally much more diverse than those found in marine organisms and can be found in the marine environment. It has been reported that prokaryotes are less diversified and, to a large extent, still remain mono- and ectoparous with prokaryotes being the most abundant [14,15,16]. Conversely, eukaryotes exhibit some of the highest abundances of both ectoparous and non-etoparous species [15]. In contrast, marine fungi exhibit a higher diversity of species than prokaryotes. In contrast, prokaryotic species tend to be more diverse and can be found in many marine habitats [17]. These species tend to be found on the lower substrate, such as sediments, beaches, and alcoves, but also in deeper water, such as in the deep sea and deep subsurface waters [15,18].

These two different groups of organisms constitute a vast diversity of living entities that can be found in diverse habitats [19,20,21]. They may be isolated from environmental conditions, e.g., freshwater may be in a saltern or cave, but also in a deep sub-surface water, such as the deep sub-atoms of the deep sea [22,23]. In addition, they may be found in all three regions of the earth [24,25,26,27]. They may be present in marine sediments, from coast to coast, even from ocean to ocean [28,29]. They may be present in the groundwaters of marine habitats as well as in marine bays, where they are found in high densities [30,31].

Strains and Growth Conditions
A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The plasmids used in this study are listed in S1 Table. The A. fumigatus strain, <U+2206>CmeA<U+2206>, was used for the preparation of the mating type fusion protein construct. The plasmid pUC19 was used for the construct of the <U+2206>CmeA fusion protein. The plasmid pGEM-T vector was used for the construction of the <U+2206>CmeA fusion protein.

## Results
For this, we generated a phylogenetic tree based on the bootstrap method and reconstructed the individual gene trees (Fig 1, Table 1. To understand the evolutionary histories of the Dictyostelium species, we first reconstructed the phylogenetic tree based on the Bayesian method. For this, we obtained the dendrogram (Fig 1, Table 1) and reconstructed the individual gene trees (Fig 2, Table 1). We compared the tree topology with the Bayesian tree topology of the Dictyostelium species. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed with the Bayesian method was shown in Fig 3. In the tree topology, the Dictyostelium species are divided into three distinct groups.

The first group consists of the sister clades to the other two groups, the first two of which are described in the second group (Fig 1). The sister group to the second group is the basal group to the Dictyostelium species, which is named Dictyostelium-Ascochyta. These two groups are described as separate groups in the phylogenetic tree. The topological relationship of the sister group with the other two groups is not supported by the Bayesian tree (Fig 1, Table 1). This clearly indicates that the main lineages within the Dictyostelium species are in disagreement with the other two groups.

The second group is composed of the sister group to the other two groups, the second group is described as sister group Dictyostelium-Ascochyta, and the third group is described as sister group Dictyostelium-Ascochyta. These two groups are described as sister groups in the phylogenetic tree. In the tree topology, the Dictyostelium species are divided into three distinct groups.

The topological relationship of the sister group with the other two groups is not supported by the Bayesian tree (Fig 1, Table 1). This clearly indicates that the main lineages within the Dictyostelium species are in disagreement with the other two groups.

The relationship between the two basal lineages is shown in the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1, Table 1).


## Discussion
In the Cd-phox interaction, the presence of a broad signal-to-noise ratio of F4/80 for the signal intensity (1-F4-F80-F80-F80) and signal intensity at different distances (1-F4-F80-F80-F80) is sufficient to activate the Cd-fungal gene expression in . neoformans and C. gattii. Conversely, the presence of the signal in F4/80-F80-F80 signal pairs (1-F4-F80-F80-F80) is sufficient to activate the Cd-fungal gene expression in C. neoformans and C. gattii. However, in the Cd-fungal interaction, the presence of F4/80-F80-F80 signal pairs (1-F4-F80-F80-F80) only activate the Cd-fungal gene expression in C. neoformans and C. gattii. In contrast, the presence of signal F4/80-F80-F80 signal pairs in Cd-fungal genes (1-F4-F80-F80-F80-F80) only activate the Cd-fungal gene expression in C. neoformans and C. gattii. Therefore, the Cd-fungal signal and the Cd-fungal gene expression are the key determinants for the evolution of Cd-fungal gene expression.

Since the Cd-fungal gene expression was the main process in C. neoformans and C. gattii, the Cd-fungal gene expression was the main process in C. neoformans. The F4/80-F80-F80 signal pairs were able to activate Cd-fungal gene expression in C. gattii. However, the presence of F4/80-F80-F80 signal pairs only activate the Cd-fungal gene expression in C. neoformans. The Cd-fungal gene expression was the main process in C. gattii.
