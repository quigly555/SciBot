## Abstract
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a bacterial group that exerts considerable influence on human health. It has been estimated that MAC has more to do with its composition than with its genes. A number of factors, including its size and composition, influence the expression of MAC genes, leading to its potential role in human health. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of our current understanding of MAC and its relationship with other microorganisms. In particular, we highlight the importance of its composition and the relationships between its components and its genes, which are described in the context of its pathogenesis and relevance for human health. Our analysis highlights the recent advances in our understanding of MAC, its genes and its interaction with other microbes that, in addition to highlighting the diversity of its natural products, may contribute to the understanding of its role in human health.


## Introduction
Then, the transformation time is binomial with the log_2 integral of the transformational tim. The log_2 is a measure of the transformation time between the transformational transformants. For example, if a gene is transformed in half the time it is expected to transform in half the time. But if the gene is transformed in half the time, the time is too slow for us to observe the difference. For this reason, the transformants are usually expressed as log_2 integral rates. For example, the log_2 is expected to change with the frequency of 100,000 genes and expressed as log_2/log_2/log_2/log_2/log_2. The expression of each gene in the transformation process is the sum of the log_2 and the expressed rate. The transformation process is normalized with respect to the expression rate. In addition, the transformants are expressed as log_2/log_2/log_2/log_2/log_2. The total time of transformation is log_2/log_2/log_2/log_2. This is the basis of the analysis of the biological properties of a gene. The second step is denoted by the “third step”: the first one is the denoting of the transformants and the second is the expression rate. The third step is denoted by the “fourth step”. In addition, the fourth step denoted by the “”“” has to be denoted with the highest fold when the gene is expressed.

The third and final step is denoted by the “””“principle of molecular evolution”. The “”principle of molecular evolution” is based on the principle of “one genome over, one protein”. The “”principle of molecular evolution” is based on the principle of “one gene under, one protein under”. The “”principle of molecular evolution” is based on the principle of “one subpopulation over, one protein under”. The “”principle of molecular evolution” is based on the principle of “one subpopulation over, one protein under”.


## Methods
The extracted DNA sequences were used for design and statistical analysis (S1 Data. For construction of the gene models, the genes were amplified from genomic DNA with the primers fRPB1 and fRPB2. The amplified primers fRPB1 and fRPB2, were fused to the gene with a site-directed mutagenesis vector pRS316 (Li and Meyer, 2011) using the oligonucleotide primers pRS316-F (5'-GTGCCAGCMGCCAGAACA-3') and pRS316-R (5'-GGCTCAGCGTTGGTTGG-3') (Wu and Hu, 2014) and the oligonucleotide primers pRS316-F (5'-GGCCAGGAGCMGCCAG-3') and pRS316-R (5'-GGCTCAGCGTTGGTTGG-3'). The resulting DNA sequences were transformed into the E. coli expression vector pBluescript SK (Invitrogen). The cDNA was isolated from the reaction by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified PCR products were sequenced and the gene model was subsequently validated by DNA sequencing (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The program MEGA v. 5.2 was used to design the gene models for the gene models. All sequences of the genes are available in the NCBI (GenBank).

The three gene models of Aspergillus nidulans were initially selected for their potential to induce plant or animal diseases. For this purpose, we designed a preliminary model to identify the four gene models of Aspergillus nidulans. We first selected the genes based on the model parameter values (AUC) and their interaction with plant pathogens (AUC_M) for the models. The gene models of Aspergillus nidulans were selected based on the interactions between plant pathogens and fungi (AUC_H), and the interaction between the plant pathogens and Aspergillus nidulans (AUC_M). All models were tested for homologous interactions between the three gene models by homology modeling.


## Results
nidulans and . fumigatus, on the production of basic amino acids and amino acid transporters (Table S3). The metabolic activities of the Aspergillus nidulans strain (UJB00608) and A. fumigatus strain (UJB00608) were examined (Table S3). The metabolic activities of the A. fumigatus strain (UJB00608) were more similar to those of A. nidulans than A. fumigatus (Table S3). The metabolic activity of the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) was more similar to that of A. fumigatus than A. nidulans (Table S3). The ability of the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) to produce amino acids and transporters was not significantly different from that of A. fumigatus strain (Table S3). The production of transporters and transmembrane proteins in the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) was more similar to those of A. fumigatus than A. nidulans (Table S3). The results suggest that the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) has greater capacity to produce transporters and transmembrane proteins than A. fumigatus strain. These results strongly suggest that the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) is a better producer of transmembrane proteins than A. fumigatus strain.

The ability of the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) to produce amino acids and transporters was not significantly different from that of A. fumigatus strain (Table S3). The results suggest that the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) has greater capacity to produce transmembrane proteins than A. fumigatus strain. These results are in agreement with the previous report that the A. nidulans strain (UJB00608) has higher capability to produce hydroxyproline and acid-reducing enzymes than A.
