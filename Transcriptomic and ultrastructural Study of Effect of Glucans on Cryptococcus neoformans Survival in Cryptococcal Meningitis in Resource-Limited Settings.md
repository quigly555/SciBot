## Abstract
Zinc plays a critical role as a critical role in the synthesis of proteins and metabolites necessary for all living organisms. Zinc is essential for numerous biochemical reactions and as such is a necessary structural component of cellular membranes. Zinc is also essential for the growth and development of many diseases, for energy, enzymes, and other compounds. Zinc is also essential for the survival and reproduction of pathogens, as well as for many other biological functions. Zinc is also essential for life as a biotransporter, evasive and disruptive pathogen, for tissue regeneration, for transmission of pathogens, and as an antagonist for pathogens.


## Introduction
Virulence studies using heterologous expression of a toxin to different host cells are highly relevant in both clinical and environmental contexts. Bacteria are the major source of virulence factors, which are expressed as extracellular vesicles (EVs) during infection and are responsible for pathogenicity [1-3]. Host cell-based microevolution is thought to be the most widespread mechanism of host cell evolution. Host cell-based EVs are considered to be the most diverse type of EVs [4-7]. Among the thousands of EVs produced by different cell types, EVs are most abundant in the gut [8-10]. Gut EVs are found in the normal gut flora, but can be observed in the hair and mouthparts of healthy individuals [11-14]. In addition to the normal microbiota, the gut EVs are found in the intestine of both humans and animals [15-17]. However, the presence of these EVs in the intestines of different species has been linked to their importance in pathogenesis [18]. Notably, several intestinal bacteria express secretion systems that are specialized for delivering cargo to the host cells.

The first EVs are produced by most pathogenic bacteria, which are digested by a diverse community of microbes, including archaea, viruses, and protozoa [19-22]. Numerous EVs are secreted to the extracellular environment, which allows them to deliver cargo to the cell. EVs can be produced in response to many stimuli, including pH, nutrient availability, host cellular temperature, and microbial lipids [23]. For example, the bacterial lipase Salmonella enterica secretes EVs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [24,25]. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathway is a critical host cell signaling pathway that is essential for the virulence of many pathogens [26].


## Methods
b.dtu.dk/services/Ritex) [28]. The two-step RT-PCR approach was used to determine the specific transcriptomic properties of the mutant strains, which were also performed on the basis of the RNA-seq data. Briefly, the PCR mixture was a mixture of 5 µL of 10 × PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 0.25 µM of each primer (10 µM), 0.5 µL of template DNA, 0.25 µM of each probe, 0.2 µL of TEF1 and 1.2 µL of cDNA (10 U/µL). The reaction was performed using the following protocol: 5 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C and 1.5 min at 72°C; 1.5 min at 72°C; 1.5-2.0 h at 72°C; and final extension at 72°C for 10 min.

RT-PCR analysis
For the RT-PCR analysis of the mutants, the gene-specific primers were designed using Primer3 software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/primer3/) [29]. The PCR product was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the size-selected nucleotide of each primer was measured by a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, USA) at a resolution of 0.8 nm. The PCR products were purified using a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced on a Next-Seq Terminator v2.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Illumina, USA). The PCR products were checked for quality using the Agilent Bioanalyzer with the software BioStat v5.0 (Agilent Technologies, USA). The PCR products were purified using Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced on a Next-Seq Terminator v2.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Illumina, USA).

Phenotypic characteristics of the mutants and their gene-specific primers
The phenotypic characteristics of the mutants were measured as described previously [30].


## Results
Protein Genome-wide Comparisons of C. neoformans Infected With or without an Alternative C. neoformans Pathogen
To examine the differential expression of various human proteins in C. neoformans infected with or without an alternative pathogen, we performed gene expression analysis of human proteins in C. neoformans after infection with or without an alternative pathogen. We focused on the yeast C. neoformans var. grubii (KN99a) infection model.
