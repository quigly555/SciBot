## Abstract
Candida albicans is a common human fungal pathogen that infects immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-infected individuals. In addition to the limited ability to mount a successful resistance to antifungal drugs, the most common resistance mechanism of C. albicans to triazoles is the polymyxin class, which is the primary antifungal drug target of currently used antifungal therapies. Polymyxin belongs to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) family of proteins and represents a structural motif of the C. albicans ATPase-related subunit. CAMP is a major component of the innate immune system and is essential for resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs including amphotericin B, atazanavir, caspofungin, and fludioxonil. The polymyxin family is divided into five subfamilies called polymyxin-A, polymyxin-B, polymyxin-C, and polymyxin-D. The polymyxin A, polymyxin B, and polymyxin D subfamilies are drugs of oral and vaginal origin. The mechanism by which polymyxin binds and functions is still poorly understood.


## Introduction

## Methods
This data has been assembled with the JGI Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis pipeline [24] and a pipeline for annotating protein sequences was created using Coot [25. The assembly and annotation data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [26] and a local BLAST search was performed against the Fonsecaea genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/Fonsecaea) [27]. In order to identify the true nature of the Fonsecaea complex, a multiple alignment of the protein sequence of interest was performed. This was performed with the Coot pipeline and with a GEO annotation database. In brief, the amino acid sequences of the protein sequences were aligned and the phylogenetic tree was inferred using the maximum likelihood approach with MEGA7 software [28]. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using the program Treeview 2.7 [29]. The algorithm “Approximate likelihood-ratio-tests” was used to test the significance of the observed phylogenetic relationships between the Fonsecaea complex and other fungi, and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Analysis of the Fonsecaea complex in Escherichia coli
Cells were grown in LB media at 37°C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm) with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in a sterile PBS solution. Cell suspensions were prepared from the cell pellets by addition of 1 ml of a 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NaCl and 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension was heated at 95°C for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, to pellet the cells. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile PBS and transferred to a sterile 96-well microtiter plate. The cell-free supernatant was removed, and the cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards (for Triton X-100, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Tween 80, 0.5% ß-mercaptoethanol).


## Results
Both sxiB null mutants were indistinguishable from wild type strains in terms of growth, conidiation and conidial morpholog. The wild type strain grew poorly on plates containing potato dextrose (PDA) medium (Figure 1A). The sxiB null mutant produced conidia in a pale brown color (Figure 1A). The sxiB null mutant produced wild type-like conidia, whereas the sxiB null mutant produced a black color (Figure 1A). The results suggested that cAMP-dependent Fonsecaea relapse was not caused by the loss of the fonsecaea-regulated gene cAMP-dependent transcription factor protein SxiB, but rather by the sxiB-independent transcription factor pathway.

The sxiB null mutant and the wild type strain were also indistinguishable in terms of their vegetative growth, conidiation and sporulation characteristics (Figure 1B). A clear difference was observed in vegetative growth of the sxiB null mutant and the wild type strain (Figure 1B). The sxiB null mutant was as dry as the wild type strain on minimal medium containing the oleic acid hydrolysate (Figure 1B). The sxiB null mutant produced only wild type-like conidia and a black color (Figure 1B). The sxiB null mutant was as dry as the wild type strain on PDA medium containing the oleic acid hydrolysate (Figure 1B). The sxiB null mutant did not produce any additional conidia in the culture medium (Figure 1B). This indicated that the cAMP-dependent Fonsecaea relapse was not caused by loss of the fonsecaea-regulated gene cAMP-dependent transcription factor protein SxiB.

Expression of Fonsecaea Genes Involves in the Biosynthesis of Fonsecaea Resting Hydrolysis
To understand the functions of Fonsecaea re-engulfing hydrolases, we examined the expression levels of these genes during the dormant and dormant periods of Coccidioides and Fonsecaea re-engulfing hydrolases.


## Discussion
Transcriptome analysis revealed that Exogenous APX001 and Zeta B were up-regulated in the dark, and then down-regulated in the light, respectivel. In contrast, the expression of the transcript and gene product was up-regulated in the dark, and then down-regulated in the light. These results indicate that the light response might be involved in the Coccidioides recovered from the dead zone. Furthermore, the same gene product was down-regulated in the dark, suggesting that the light response was not involved in the Coccidioides recovered from the dead zone.

Although the light response was primarily responsible for fungal infection, the repressor gene product was also responsible for the response to oxidative stress. In addition to repressor, Coccidioides repressor was also down-regulated in the dark, but up-regulated in the light. The light response was important for the survival of Coccidioides and it was also involved in the fungal invasion. In addition to light response, gene product was also involved in the response to other stressors. In addition to repressor, Coccidioides repressor was also up-regulated in the dark, but up-regulated in the light. The expression of Coccidioides repressor was down-regulated in the dark, but up-regulated in the light. This could be due to the light-sensitive nature of Coccidioides. The expression of Coccidioides repressor was also down-regulated in the dark, and then up-regulated in the light. This could be due to the light-sensitive nature of Coccidioides.

The transcriptional response of Coccidioides to stress conditions was further analyzed by RNA sequencing. Coccidioides transcript and gene product were significantly down-regulated in the dark, and then down-regulated in the light. In addition to repressor, Coccidioides repressor was also up-regulated in the dark, but up-regulated in the light. This could be due to the light-sensitive nature of Coccidioides. The expression of Coccidioides repressor was also down-regulated in the dark, but up-regulated in the light.
