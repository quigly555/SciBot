## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging fungal pathogen of humans and animals, causing life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Disseminated infection in immunocompetent hosts increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality. Glucorlelic acid decays into glucor as an energy-rich metabolite, which can be utilized for glycerol production and degradation. To identify new potential targets for drug development, we selected a diverse library of putative targets including P-JNK, MgR-1, P-JNK, P-JNKG, P-JNKA, and P-JNKG. P-JNK and P-JNKG were observed to be highly similar to phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phosphatases in C. gattii, and to be negatively charged suggesting they are promising inhibitors. To elucidate their roles in glycerol degradation, we identified and expressed confidence that P-JNK and P-JNKG function as key mediators of glucor and other key chitin-related enzymes in the C. gattii genome.

We have identified and expressed confidence that the P-JNK and P-JNKG function as key mediators of the glycerol degradation in C. gattii. P-JNKG was a positively charged phosphatidylcholine substrate that was overproduced in the yeast phase of this study. Our data suggest that P-JNK may play an important role in regulating glucor phosphatidylinositol 4,5’-bisphosphate (P-Ip) metabolism in C. gattii.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is commonly found in the skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract. It can cause skin and nail infections, mucosal infections, and even life-threatening disseminated infections [1]. Over the past few decades, the incidence of non-albicans Candida (NAC) species has increased, and these species are now being recognized as emerging pathogens [2]. Candida glabrata has emerged as a serious cause of non-albicans infections [3], and it is difficult to treat, as most antifungal drugs target essential fungal cell membrane constituents [4]. Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species such as C. albicans and C. glabrata, as well as opportunistic species such as Cryptococcus neoformans, are increasingly recognized as emerging pathogens [5].

C. albicans is a facultative intracellular fungus, and in the presence of sufficient nutrients, can proliferate inside macrophages and invade the phagolysosome of macrophages [6]. Macrophages are mainly involved in the host defense against pathogens, such as pathogens of the skin or neutrophils (NS) or macrophages [7]. In addition, macrophages can also function as a source of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [8].


## Methods
Field survey
This study was performed in a field survey. The field survey was conducted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and N.B. Darbar (Nasalu) and the N.B. Darbar-N. Hurri field survey, and the N.B. Darbar-N. Hurri field survey was conducted by the USGS. The field survey was also carried out in the N.B. Darbar-N. Hurri field survey.

Plant material
The leaves of Agaricus digitatum were collected in May 2017 from the N.B. Darbar-N. Hur region. They were identified as the leaf with the characteristic leaf with the ability to grow on SDA and Melzer’s reagent. They were identified as belonging to the Phyllosticta plant family and were kept in the herbaria of Department of Plant Physiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, N.B. Darbar-N. Hurri University (N.B. Darbar-N. Hurri University, N.B. Darbar, Egypt). The samples were dried and ground in a blender for a maximum of 5 minutes.

The dried leaves were placed in a plastic bag and stored at room temperature. Before the experiments, each plant was identified by its morphological characteristics.

The samples were placed in 1 ml microfuge tubes (20 × 10 mm) with distilled water and the mixture was kept on ice. After centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for the further analyses.

After the analysis, the samples were air dried and then weighed, and the samples were subjected to an elemental analysis under the standard conditions (Table 1). The samples were dried and weighed, and the samples were subjected to an elemental analysis under the standard conditions (Table 1).

The samples were diluted in sodium sulphate (0.1%) and then dissolved in methanol (10 mM). After the analyses, the samples were diluted and were treated with 0.1% w/v sodium bicarbonate solution.


## Results
neoformans, we generated a set of monoclonal antibody-binding cassettes (mAbs) based on the Fusarium WDR (the WDR is a protein from the plasma membrane) (Figure 5A) from a murine model of . neoformans. MAb-binding cassettes were designed by the manufacturer (Fusion) to bind monoclonal antibody (mAb) bands, then to yield high affinity antibodies (HAMs) with anti-mouse antibodies and their immunofluorescent labeling. Binding of MAb-derived mAbs was confirmed by the ELISA results. The binding of mAbs was analyzed by trypan blue labeling (Figure 5B), using the rabbit IgG primers. The binding of HAMs was confirmed by a rabbit IgG antibody assay, using the rabbit IgG primers (Figure 5C), and a trypan blue labeling (Figure 5D). Binding of anti-mouse IgG mAbs was not analyzed by trypan blue labeling by ELISA, using the rabbit IgG primers.

The antibody binding to antibody-free B12 mAb mAbs was assessed using the mouse IgG primer set. As expected, antibody binding to mAbs was observed with a mouse IgG primer set. For the IgM mAbs, a strong peak of binding was observed in the ELISA reaction (Figure 5E). For the IgM mAbs, a peak of binding was observed in the ELISA reaction with the rabbit IgG primers (Figure 5E). Binding of MAb-derived mAbs to mAb-derived mAb mAbs was not analyzed by trypan blue labeling by ELISA, using the rabbit IgG primers (Figure 5D).

Lysine transpeptidation is a key step in the process of monocytosis and is required for C. neoformans pathogenicity (Figure 2C). The C. neoformans Lysine is a membrane-bound protein with a function in membrane-localization (Pang et al., 2001). To identify the Lysine that is required for the interaction with C. neoformans, we identified a new C. neoformans Lysine-3-monoclonal antibody (Lys3) using the rabbit IgG primers.


## Discussion
dermatitidis gene targeting assays revealed that the genome of this pathogen has the potential to be used as a target for the development of antifungal drugs [39. In order to identify genes involved in target-mediated immunity, the following strategies were employed: (i) repeat-induced transcription of one of the five genes (TAC-3B3), (ii) TAC-3A1 (TAC-3B3A1), and (iii) TAC-3B3A2 (TAC-3B3B2). In total, approximately 70% of the 656 genes required for TAC-3B3A1, TAC-3A2, and TAC-3B3A2 were transcribed, indicating that these genes have potential for development of novel antifungal drugs.

Of the 556 genes involved in TAC-3A1 and TAC-3A2, only the genes encoding proteins involved in TAC-3B3A2 and TAC-3B3A3 were identified, suggesting that these genes are indeed involved in the pathogenicity of this pathogen. In contrast, several genes involved in TAC-3A1, TAC-3A3, and TAC-3B3A2 were not identified, indicating that the potential TAC-3A1 gene may be involved in the development of novel antifungal drugs.

In the present study, the TAC-3A3 gene was expressed in B. dermatitidis during growth on different growth media, but the expression levels of TAC-3A1, TAC-3A3, and TAC-3B3A2 were decreased in the medium used for growth on different growth media, and TAC-3B3A2 was expressed in B. dermatitidis during growth on different growth media. However, during growth on different media, TAC-3A1, TAC-3A3, and TAC-3B3A2 were expressed in higher levels than in the growth on a different growth media, suggesting that TAC-3A1 and TAC-3B3A2 may have the same function.

TAC-3A1, TAC-3A3, and TAC-3B3A2 are involved in the regulation of the cell wall integrity in B.
