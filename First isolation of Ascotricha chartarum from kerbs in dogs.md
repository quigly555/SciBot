## Abstract
Itraconazole and fluconazole are two highly effective antifungal drugs used for the treatment of fungal infections in humans. However, the effects of azole on the host immune response has been rarely reported. We report here that a 74-kDa fluconazole-resistant strain of Aspergillus niger developed abnormal systemic mycoses and developed drug-resistant mycobacterium. Impaired cellular immunity was defective in this A. niger strain, which results in abnormal mycobacterial growth. Furthermore, the inability to secrete antifungal drugs was reversed by treatment with the drug fluconazole. These results demonstrate that A. niger requires intact fungal membrane integrity for survival in the host. Thus, the loss of integrity of the fungal membrane could be key to the establishment of azole-resistant fungal infections.

Itraconazole and fluconazole are two highly effective antifungal drugs used for the treatment of fungal infections in humans. However, the effects of azole on the host immune response has been rarely reported.


## Introduction
Importantly, the microbial population increases with ag. We believe that over the next few years, the microbial population will increase in proportion to the age of the dogs and cats and in proportion to their age, increasing in size, and reaching new proportions.

Epidermal keratitis (ERK) is a sight-threatening, chronic infection of the epidermis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates (1). Various pathogenic microbes can cause keratitis and it is important to understand their pathogenesis and how they can influence our eyes. The keratitis concept first appeared about two decades ago and has been widely used in the literature to study keratitis in dogs and cats. However, the definition of the disease in dogs and cats is still broad, and the most commonly seen pathogenesis of the disease in humans is microbial keratitis (2,3). While many bacteria and fungi can cause keratitis in dogs, the most prevalent fungal species are Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (4). Infection of the epidermis is the most common cause of inflammation in the eyes. The bacteria colonize the cornea by either small droplets, or by spreading through the epidermis into the eyes. When the bacteria are engulfed, they enter the eye's cornea, and the fungus can cause ocular infection. In addition, keratitis is sometimes mistaken for ocular infection. It is true that the pathogen can spread through the optic nerve, optic nerves, skin, mucous membrane, and lymphatic vessels and through the skin and nails, resulting in ocular infection (5).

Ocular keratitis is a common finding in dogs, and the condition is often associated with a pattern of clinical features including retinal detachment, diffuse retinal detachment, refractive acute ocular disease, and abnormal color vision. In addition, the occurrence of keratitis in dogs is often inconsistent with other diseases in humans, and is often associated with factors such as trauma, malnutrition, hematological malignancy, and congenital or immunosuppressive diseases (6). Other canine diseases such as canine infectious keratitis (KIN) are often associated with canine ocular disease. Several cases of KIN are reported in dogs but no cases of keratitis have been described in humans.


## Methods
The tree was collected from the central region of the Netherlands, and its rootstocks were preserved at the University of Fondel, in Limbur. The rootstock was also collected from an area of Ascotricha that has been studied for its root-scrubbing ability [42].

All bark and leaf materials were sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min. The bark was washed with 70% ethanol and was then dried under a stream of nitrogen. To make the rootstock, bark was soaked in water and then treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate for 5 min. The dried rootstock was then soaked in potassium hydroxide and the same procedure was repeated. The dried rootstock was then soaked in potassium hydroxide solution and then, dried on a stream of nitrogen. To determine the rootstock concentration, the quantity and purity of the rootstock, were analyzed using the Densitometer VfL (Ø3,000) (VfL, Oberkochen, Germany). The concentration was calculated as the concentration of 10^6-µg/mL, and the purity was recorded as the concentration of 10^6-µg/mL.

Determination of Ascotricha species
The bark was suspended in 50 µL of 0.1% (v/v) sodium hydroxide. The suspension was placed on a glass slide and covered with aluminum foil. The slide was closed with a cover slip and the water was removed from the slide. Then, the oil was dried in a stream of nitrogen. Then, the dry material was dissolved with a solution of 1% (w/v) sodium hydroxide. Then, the dried material was used as a solvent for the determination of Ascotricha species. The solvent was discarded after 1 min, and the dried material was dissolved with a solution of 1% (w/v) sodium hydroxide. Finally, the concentration of Ascotricha species was calculated as the concentration of 10^6-µg/mL, and the purity of the species was recorded as the concentration of 10^6-µg/mL.


## Results
The Ascotricha chartarum isolate was obtained from two dogs (. and Mrs.) that all had either a white dog (Barrageer & Babcock) or a grey dog (Murphy). Isolates were obtained from two different breeds (grey and white), and all were obtained from the same dog with a different colour (Fig 1A). Isolates were first isolated from one grey dog (Myrtus) and two white dogs (Murphy) and were subsequently isolated from three other grey and white dogs (Barrageer & Babcock). Isolates were then tested for their ability to colonise keratinocytes. Isolates were obtained from two grey dogs (Myrtus) and three white dogs (Murphy). Isolates were then tested for their ability to colonise the skin (Fig 1B).

The model system for the isolation of the Ascotricha chartarum isolate was then tested for its ability to colonise keratinocytes. The three dogs tested were all white dogs, and therefore were not members of the same family. However, we confirmed that the three white dogs were able to colonise the skin (Fig 1C). Furthermore, the five black dogs were all white and therefore were not members of the same family.

The isolation of the isolates from the three different breeds was performed with a single rabbit (Barrageer & Babcock). Isolates were isolated from two dogs (R. and Mrs.) that all had either a white dog (Barrageer & Babcock) or a grey dog (Murphy). Isolates were then tested for their ability to colonise keratinocytes. Isolates were isolated from one dog (Barrageer & Babcock) and one dog (Murphy). The three dogs tested were all white and therefore were not members of the same family.

The isolate from the white dog was obtained from the dog with the other dog with the same colour (Fig 1D).

Isolation of Ascotricha chartarum from the black dog
Our model system was used to identify the isolate from the black dog.


## Discussion

Ascotricidea
Ascotricidea are one of the most common micro-organisms in the human body, causing human skin infection. The genus Ascotricha is a group of yeasts that have been isolated from many different habitats, including dogs, humans, and even humans. These yeasts have been isolated from various human pathogens, including C. neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, C. albicans, and C. tropicalis, and they are often responsible for causing fungal infections in humans and in dogs. The genus comprises species in the order Ascomycota and the orders Pezizomycetes, Bacteroides, and Zygomycota. However, the genus Ascotricha is not a genus, but a collection of yeasts isolated from different species in different parts of the world, including dogs.

Ascotricidea are widespread in the human body. They are an invasive group of yeasts that have been isolated from different habitats and even from dogs. Ascotricidea are also frequently isolated from a variety of habitats, including soil, air, water, and food. These yeasts are usually pathogenic to humans and cause disease in humans. Ascotricidea have been isolated from different species, including fungi and animals, and they are frequently isolated from different habitats. Many species are susceptible to antifungal drugs, and they are also susceptible to the various chemical classes of antifungal drugs. The clinical manifestations of fungal infections are often caused by pathogenic fungi. Fungal infections are caused by fungi that are saprophytic and are resistant to a wide spectrum of antifungal drugs. This group of fungi is mainly resistant to a wide range of antifungal drugs, including fluconazole, itraconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B. However, the clinical manifestations of fungal infections are not common, and the most commonly encountered fungal infections are aspergillosis and aspergillosis-like infections. In the past, antifungal treatment for fungal infections has been highly successful, with a good yield of clinical results.
