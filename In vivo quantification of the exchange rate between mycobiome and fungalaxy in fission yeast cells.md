## Abstract
The ability of cells to sense extracellular stimuli is of fundamental importance in all symbiotic organisms.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is an important airborne fungal pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis (IA) and can cause severe, life-threatening, and even life-threatening, infections in immunocompromised patients (1). IA is a result of the production of aspergilli, spores, or conidia by the mycelial form, A. fumigatus, which can subsequently disseminate and cause invasive disease in other warm-blooded animals, including humans, horses, and dogs (2). In the case of the human-to-animal ratio, A. fumigatus can cause infections in both humans and animals. However, A. fumigatus is not a typical fungal pathogen, and it has been shown to be able to cause infections in a variety of hosts, including human, dog, cat, and rabbit, with mortality rates of up to 40% (3).


## Methods
Thus, F_t is the number of fungal generations, F_g is the total number of generations and F_t_g is the total number of fungal generation. For calculation of the exchange rate between the mycobiome and the fungalaxy, the equation (2) was used: (2) mycobiome = F_t/F_g (2-1) = {2 - F_t} × 100. Thus, F_t is the number of fungal generations, F_g is the total number of generations and F_t_g is the total number of fungal generations.

The mycobiome and fungalaxy were examined in 0.5% agarose gel containing 0.5% agarose in 1×TBE buffer (pH = 6.5). The mycobiome and the fungalaxy were stained with an appropriate complement of four different mediums (three time-points, at least five times) to obtain mycobiome and fungi-fungal diversity. The gel was stained with gold-palladium solution and photographed in a camera (Nikon D90-E camera) with excitation wavelengths of 365 nm and 495 nm.

For the calculation of the exchange rate between the mycobiome and the fungalaxy, the equation (3) was used: (3) mycobiome = F_t/F_g (3-1) = {3 - F_t} × 100. Thus, F_t is the number of fungal generations, F_g is the total number of generations and F_t_g is the total number of fungal generations.

For the calculation of the exchange rate between the mycobiome and the fungalaxy, the equation (4) was used: (4) mycobiome = F_t/F_g (4-1) = {4 - F_t} × 100. Thus, F_t is the number of fungal generations, F_g is the total number of generations and F_t_g is the total number of generations.


## Results
neoformans cells grown in liquid culture for the measurement of the exchange rate between mycobiome and fungalax. Both mycobiome and fungalaxy were also quantified in the same manner using both fractions of the same fungus. The exchange rate of mycobiome and fungalaxy was quantified in the first and second time points. Our data indicate that the exchange rate of mycobiome and fungalaxy is very low in the first time point, with the exchange rate of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass of 0.20 × 10^-3 g^-1. These data are in agreement with those reported by Koch and colleagues [5], who noted that the exchange rate of mycobiome and mycobiome biomass is very low in the second time point. The ratio of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass is close to 1.45 × 10^-3 g^-1 in the first time point. This ratio is not very close to the value observed in the second time point, where the exchange rate of mycobiome is 0.60 × 10^-3 g^-1. In the first time point, the exchange rate of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass is very low in the second time point, with the exchange rate of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass of 0.26 × 10^-3 g^-1. These data suggest that the exchange rate of mycobiome and mycobiome biomass is very low in the second time point. In contrast, the ratio of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass is close to 1.4 × 10^-3 g^-1 in the first time point, which is a lower value than the value observed in the second time point. The ratio of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass is very low in the first time point, with the exchange rate of mycobiome/mycobiome biomass of 0.11 × 10^-3 g^-1. These results suggest that the exchange rate of mycobiome and mycobiome biomass is very low in the second time point.


## Discussion
destructans (PdGfp1) in a yeast cell line and analysis was carried out using the Sfp1 promoter of . fumigatus (Sfp1). The interaction of Sfp1 with Sfp1 was confirmed by real-time PCR. The results showed that the interaction of Sfp1 with Sfp1 was confirmed by quantification of the enzyme substrate concentration in the yeast cell culture and the transcript level of the enzyme-encoding genes in the yeast cell culture, while the interaction with Sfp1 was not observed in the fungal culture.

The effect of temperature on the activity of Sfp1 was confirmed by its expression levels, as well as the degree of the inhibition by temperature. The results showed that the enzyme activity in the yeast cell culture was significantly inhibited by 20 °C and 20% NaCl at pH 5.3 and 6.2, respectively.

The results showed that the enzyme activity in the mycelia of F. destructans was significantly inhibited by 20 °C and 20% NaCl at pH 5.5 and 6.2, respectively.
