## Abstract
Meningitis is the most common manifestation of infection in HIV-infected patients, and meningitis is the second most common cause of death in these patients. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of meningococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients, and to evaluate its correlation with the severity of infection.

We retrospectively studied the mean serum cryptococcal antigen titers of 36 patients who developed meningitis between 2006 and 2015. The serum CSF antigen titers were compared to control patients who had a normal CSF antigen.

The mean serum cryptococcal antigen titers of 36 patients who developed meningococcal meningitis were 43.4±8.3 and 41.1±7.4 for the meningitis group and ~8.6 and ~9.8~4.3 for the control patients, respectively. The mean serum cryptococcal antigen titer was ~3.9 and 2.4×10-9 in the meningitis group and 4.5 and 2.9×10-9 in the control patients, respectively. The cryptococcal antigen titer was higher in the meningitis group (4.5×10-9) than in the cryptococcal antigen titer in the HIV-infected patients (3.5×10-8).

The cryptococcal antigen titer was higher in the meningitis group than in the controls. There was a correlation between the CSF cryptococcal antigen titer and the severity of infection. Higher serum cryptococcal antigen titer was detected in the meningitis group for meningitis. The CSF cryptococcal antigen titer could be a proxy for the severity of infection in HIV-infected patients, which may be associated with the extent of meningitis.


## Introduction
Streptococcus pneumoniae (P. pneumoniae) is an important nosocomial bacterium that causes meningitis and septicemia in immunocompromised patients [1]. The most common clinical presentation is meningoencephalitis, but other presentations, such as pneumonitis or meningoencephalitis, can also be present in asymptomatic patients [2]. P. pneumoniae infections are usually detected by infection-stimulating drugs such as the pneumococcal ovalbumin (PPA) class I, the pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) class II, and the PPS class III drugs [2,3]. However, pneumococcal infections are often not detected by pneumococcal antigen detection assays, although they may be detected by pneumococcal antigen detection assays.

Pneumococcal infections are relatively uncommon in the general population. However, there are cases in which serotypes C and D are present in patients, suggesting that these serotypes may be a cause for infection. This review focuses on the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen (PPS) and the pneumococcal antigen, as these are major virulence attributes that allow P. pneumoniae to evade detection by pneumococcal detection assays. The polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence factor that is a part of the capsule that protects the pneumococcus from killing by the host immune system [4,5].


## Methods
The solution (µL) was dissolved in a saline solution (.9%) and applied to a spectrophotometer at a concentration of 0.5 cm^-1. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 220 nm (transmittance change) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.4 with sodium phosphate buffer (NaPB). The pH value was measured by measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm.

2.2. Isolation of Total Salic Acid from Washing Potato
The Washing Potato (Potato dextrose) was prepared as described by Yung et al. [14]. The pretreatment of the water with the different types of calcium carbonate was performed with shaking at 120 rpm for 3 days, before the addition of the pH indicator solution (PDS) and to the solution of NaPB. The pH indicator solution was added and the pH was determined.

2.3. Purity of PDS-PDS Assay
The pH indicator solution of PDS-PDS was diluted in distilled water to a final concentration of 1.0% by vortexing for 1 min. The solution was then added to the above-mentioned PDS-PDS solution (0.2% NaPB) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The pH indicator solution was then diluted in distilled water to a final concentration of 1.0% by vortexing for 1 min and then further diluted 1:3 in distilled water to a final concentration of 0.9% to give a final pH value of 6.5. The solution was then poured on the C-18I column (5 µm, 4 mm × 4 mm, 3.0 µm) and washed with distilled water. The C-18 column was eluted with Na^+- solutions (0.2% Na^+ and 0.2% Na^+) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The C-18 column was eluted with 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and the flow rate was maintained at 1.5 ml/min.


## Results
albicans strain was further confirmed by the observation that the pH of the culture medium was shifted by about .5% to below that of the control pH by 1.5% at 7 dpi. The pH of the cultures was maintained at 1.5% (Fig 1A). The pH of the cultures was significantly shifted from -6.4 to -6.3 in 10 dpi (pH 2.7). The pH was maintained at 5.5 and 6.5 in 10 dpi (pH 7.4), and slightly shifted from -6.3 to -6.3 in 20 dpi (pH 6.9).

The pH of the culture medium was shifted from 6.3 to 6.7 in 10 dpi (pH 3.5), and slightly shifted from -6.3 to 6.7 in 20 dpi (pH 6.9). The pH was significantly shifted from 6.4 to 6.2 in 10 dpi (pH 2.7), and slightly shifted from -6.4 to 6.4 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4).

The pH of the culture medium was shifted from 7.4 to 7.4 in 20 dpi (pH 3.5), and slightly shifted from 7.4 to 7.3 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4). The pH was significantly shifted from 7.4 to 7.6 in 20 dpi (pH 2.7), and slightly shifted from 7.4 to 7.6 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4).

The pH of the culture medium was shifted from 7.9 to 8.1 in 20 dpi (pH 3.5), and slightly shifted from 8.1 to 8.1 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4). The pH was significantly shifted from 8.1 to 8.9 in 20 dpi (pH 2.7), and slightly shifted from 8.9 to 8.9 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4).

The pH of the culture medium was shifted from 8.0 to 8.4 in 20 dpi (pH 3.5), and slightly shifted from 8.0 to 8.4 in 20 dpi (pH 7.4). The pH was significantly shifted from 8.0 to 8.


## Discussion
The pH-responsive signal is not present in . cerevisiae and the pH-responsive signal is not present in S. paradoxus, a yeast species that does not have this signal (52). In S. cerevisiae, a single gene encoding a calcineurin-dependent kinase (CdaK) was found to be required for the pH response (53). In addition, Pmc1p is expressed in response to a variety of stimuli (54). It was also found to be required for the osmotic response in S. paradoxus (55). The fact that Pmc1p is expressed in the nucleus and not in the cytosol and that the pH response is not present in S. cerevisiae suggests that Pmc1p plays a more important role in the pH response than Pmc1p in S. cerevisiae.

Protein kinases have been shown to be involved in the osmotic response to osmotic shock and cell death in S. cerevisiae (56, 57). In S. cerevisiae, Pmc1p is required for the pH response and cell death (58). Pmc1p is also required for the pH-responsive response (Figure 3C) and osmotic response (Figure 2) in S. cerevisiae (Figure 3A and Figure 2). In contrast, in S. paradoxus, Pmc1p is not required for the pH response. Pmc1p is not required for the pH-responsive response (Figure 3B). Although Pmc1p is not expressed in the nucleus, it is expressed in the cytosol and in the cytosol of cells that were treated with AICDP, suggesting that Pmc1p is expressed in the nucleus. In addition, Pmc1p is expressed in the nucleus of cells that were treated with the pyrrolidine alkaloid 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl-5-methylpropane (1,4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-deoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl-5-methylpropane (2,3,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid) (Figure 3B).
