## Abstract
The large orders VNI-VI (neurotoxiensis-like growth) and VNII -VI (neuroblast growth) fungi were recently reported as pathogens in several leishmanial species, as a result of their use as animal vectors, drug leads, and as human pathogens. These fungi are usually of the phylum Leishmania and have been mainly associated with sporocystidia. However, recent data indicate that Leishmania phylum is also associated with a wide range of parasitic and bacterial diseases.


## Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) are two of the most common and important human fungal pathogens, both with an estimated burden of over a million infections and ~700,000 deaths per year, respectively [1-3]. They cause approximately 15-20% of AIDS-related deaths worldwide [4]. They are highly pathogenic and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, especially in resource-limited settings. The most common opportunistic agent is Mtb, but other opportunistic agents such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and mycobacterium leprae infections are also problematic.

The main etiologic agents of TB and Cn are Mtb and Cn. Mtb is usually isolated on the skin, but other sites such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and skin are also associated with the infection [5-8]. Infection occurs most frequently in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS. In this regard, Mtb is generally considered to be a non-virulent agent, whereas Cn is known to be more virulent [9]. The lungs of a susceptible host are a hostile environment for the growth of both Mtb and Cn. However, in a susceptible host, Mtb is able to escape from the macrophages. It is also able to survive in the extracellular environment of the macrophage and invade the phagolysosome of the host cells.


## Methods
Isolates
All fungal isolates used in this study were obtained from the culture collection of the Agricultural Research Service of China (BGI) (Baozhou, China) and were maintained in potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Cambodia). The fungi used in this study were collected in the month of April 2017, and are listed in Table 1. They were subcultured on PDA at 37°C for seven days, and the mycelium was harvested, washed, and re-suspended in sterile distilled water. Fungal spores were collected, and the fungal isolates were grown in PDB at 37°C for seven days. The fungal isolates were maintained on PDA at 37°C for seven days and the mycelium was harvested, washed, and re-suspended in sterile distilled water.

Morphology of the fungi
For morphological analysis, 10-day-old fungal cultures were used, and the spores were collected. The mycelium was removed, and the mycelium was snap-frozen in liquid N_2.


## Results
GAS/ATL Microarray Analysis
The GAS/ATL microarray was used to evaluate the expression of the selected genes in all the isolates. For this purpose, the entire set of all the tested isolates was sequenced and the expected number of genes was taken into account (Table 1). The largest number of genes were identified in the gAS/ATL isolates with significant expression in both the glucose and fructose samples, which was in agreement with the data from the experiment using a more complex system (Table 1). This result indicates that the gAS/ATL isolate was different from other G.


## Discussion
fumigatus Infection

Mutations in the ß-mannan-like proteins were found to be common in . fumigatus and A. terreus, respectively [42], and in A. flavus [43]. The combination of ß-mannan-related mutations and non-ß-mannan-specific mutations were found to be advantageous in A. fumigatus, in particular for fungal virulence in murine models [42]. Although the aflatoxin production was not altered, the most significantly increased M1 macrophages in response to C. albicans were induced to the fungus. The main effect of ß-mannan mutations was increased production of mannoproteins, suggesting that ß-mannan-related mutations may contribute to the enhanced macrophage activation. The increased ß-mannan-related mutation levels were also associated with decreased survival of A. flavus, whereas the loss of ß-mannan-related mutations did not affect the survival of A. fumigatus. The ß-mannan-specific mutations were found to be associated with enhanced fungal burden and virulence, suggesting that ß-mannan-related mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus.

The enhanced macrophage activation response to C. albicans in response to C. albicans infection was also observed in our previous study [10]. The presence of ß-mannan-related mutations in the ER-resident mannoprotein kinases (Mpk1 and Mpk2) was found to be associated with enhanced macrophage activation in the mice [14]. It has been reported that macrophages deficient in Mpk1 and Mpk2 showed a greater susceptibility to C. neoformans infection [14]. The increased mannoprotein kappa B (Mpk1/Mpk2) production was also associated with the enhanced macrophage activation in mice [10]. The increased mannoprotein kappa B levels were also found to be associated with enhanced macrophage activation in the mice [14]. Furthermore, the increase in mannoprotein kappa B was also associated with enhanced A. fumigatus virulence [10]. The enhanced macrophage activation response was also observed in the mice infected with C.
