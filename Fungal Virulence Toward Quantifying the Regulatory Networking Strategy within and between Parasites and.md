## Abstract
Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a causative agent of HHV-6 infection, with a high rate of HIV-1 replication in patients infected with other viruses. To understand the genetic and immunological factors which contribute to the development of HHV-6, we analyzed the genomes of 100 clinical and environmental isolates of patients with viral infections. The genetic architecture of HHV-6 was genetically similar, with approximately the same number of highly conserved regions as in the parental isolates. The genotypes were classified by their nucleotide sequence similarity using a Grunwald transformation algorithm. To identify the genetic architecture underlying the development of HHV-6, we applied the methods of the binary search method to compare over 200 highly conserved regions among 107 HHV-6 genotypes from seven clinical and nine environmental isolates. The results showed that HHV-6 nucleotide sequences were highly conserved within the genome and within the host genome, with approximately 97% similarities. This similarity was significantly greater than that observed for other viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, Streptococcus pyogenes, herpes simplex virus-2, Herpes simplex virus-1, Epstein-Barr virus, and Varicella Zoster virus. In addition, the genome similarity was similar between all but two environmental isolates. The spread of HIV-1 among this group was independent of nucleotide sequence similarity, and was mainly driven by the two environmental isolates. Genes encoding viral alpha lipopeptides, which are critical for viral replication, were also found widely distributed among the HHV-6 genome. Our results provide an initial model for understanding the development of HHV-6 and provide a model that may help to find novel therapeutics for HHV-6 infection.


## Introduction
Intrinsically invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (1).


## Methods
. Ethical Statement
The study was conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council and the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Brazilian National Council of Animal Experimentation. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo.

2.2. Strains and Growth Media
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or YPD+2% glucose. For the determination of iron status, cells were grown at 37 °C in YPD+1% glucose for 4 days. Cells were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then resuspended in PBS. For the determination of iron accumulation, cells were grown at 37 °C in YPD+1% glucose for 4 days. The iron content of the supernatants was determined by the method of Zhu et al. [21].


## Results
tuberculosis and the host, it is crucial to understand the regulatory mechanis. We have shown here that the interaction between the host and endomicrobials is important in order to understand the local immune response. In order to study the regulatory mechanisms of infection, we compared the local immune response to infection by M. tuberculosis with that of the pathogens isolated from a public health situation. The results indicated that the host-associated bacterial pathogens, including M. tuberculosis and the endomicrobial pathogens, were also the most dominant in terms of numbers of these bacteria in the blood, as shown in Figure 7. In the analysis of the interaction between the bacteria and the host, we identified in terms of numbers of the most dominant bacteria in the blood, with the most prevalent in the blood being C. albicans, followed by M. tuberculosis.

## Discussion
A gene prediction strategy was used to identify the regulatory networks that could be observed across a parasite-parasite interactio.

Our gene prediction network, which consisted of genes predicted by the method implemented in RDPFungalV1-1, consisted of genes predicted by the method implemented in RDPFungalV2-2, which contained genes predicted by the method implemented in RDPFungalV3-1, and the gene predicted by the method implemented in RDPFungalV4-1 (Fig 5). The analysis of the gene networks inferred from the analysis of the other networks was performed using the BLASTNG server [25]. To identify genes that were associated with the regulatory networks, we used the dsRNA gene prediction network. The BLASTNG server identified a total of 46.16% (119 genes) of the genes in the dsRNA gene network. A total of 5.79% (109 genes) of the genes in the other networks were found to be associated with the genes in the dsRNA gene network (Table S1). The gene networks in the dsRNA gene network were strongly connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The BLASTNG server identified a total of 35.20% (67 genes) of the genes in the dsRNA gene network. The gene networks in the dsRNA gene network were highly connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The BLASTNG server identified five genes in the dsRNA gene network. The dsRNA gene network was strongly connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The BLASTNG server identified 12 genes in the dsRNA gene network. The dsRNA gene network was also connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The dsRNA gene network was also connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network).

The network of the dsRNA gene network was highly connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The BLASTNG server identified the dsRNA gene network (Table S2). The dsRNA gene network was strongly connected (all genes were connected to the dsRNA gene network). The BLASTNG server identified 6 genes in the dsRNA gene network.
