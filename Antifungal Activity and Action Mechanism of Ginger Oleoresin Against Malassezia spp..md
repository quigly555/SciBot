## Abstract
Fungal pathogens of plants present various advantageous characteristics for the management of disease. They include the ability to proliferate rapidly in diverse microenvironments; large multicellular populations with varied environmental interactions; high growth pigment production, broad spectrum of expression, and ability to undergo pathogenicity. Candida albicans is one of the most common etiologic agents of candidiasis. It has been shown that C. albicans can proliferate for a considerable period of time within the human host. This ability is of great significance in the treatment of infections and in the prevention of disease. To understand the factors that determine the persistence of C.


## Introduction
The genus Prunus are an important order in the order Polyporales, which comprises saprobic, pathogenic, and soil microorganisms. The genus Prunus is distributed throughout India and comprises over 150 species. Prunus infect humans, plants and animals. One of the most important diseases caused by this pathogen is candidiasis. The disease is a common opportunistic infection of the skin and nails. In immunocompromised patients, the disease is mainly attributed to its immunodeficiency and immune deficiency. However, immunocompetent individuals also develop Prunus disease and are also referred to as immunosuppressed patients. Prunus disease is also called candidiasis and is characterized by its broad spectrum of clinical presentations. The infection process in the host depends on the interaction between pathogen and host cells. The most important pathogen of humans and animals is Candida albicans, the most important pathogen of humans. The fungus is found in the environment in tropical and subtropical regions. The fungus may cause various clinical manifestations. It can be either a commensal or an opportunistic pathogen. The opportunistic pathogen is characterized by the presence of the yeast form, characterized as hyphae or yeast cells, on the skin and mucous membranes of the upper and lower extremities, and the mucosal infections. The most common opportunistic pathogen is Cryptococcus neoformans, the major cause of fungal meningitis. C.


## Methods
The assay was performed according to the standard broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline.

The MIC was determined by the microbroth dilution method according to the CLSI guidelines.

Gel-free mouse blood was obtained from a healthy female BALB/c mouse. The serum samples were collected after the mice had been trained to perform repetitive experiments and collected on days 3, 6 and 9 of infection. The serum samples were stored at -80 째C until further use.

After the mice had been trained to perform repetitive experiments, they were observed for signs of inflammation. The animals were considered to be dead when they did not move. The animals were humanely euthanized with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg). A single colony of C. albicans (ATCC 90028) was inoculated into a 0.85% saline solution in PBS and the mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 째C. The bacterial cultures were stained with India ink (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and observed under the microscope. The killing index was calculated according to the following formula:

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the agent that resulted in visible reduction of viable organisms after 24 h of incubation.

2.3. Screening of G. mellonella Infection
For evaluation of the inhibition of the G. mellonella survival ability, we used the method described in a previous study [17]. The antifungal activity of G. mellonella was determined by the disk diffusion method [18]. Briefly, the A. baumannii strains were grown in 5 mL of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 30 째C for 24 h in a rotator shaker at 200 rpm. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of sterile saline and incubated at 37 째C for 3 h. Then, 0.5 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St.


## Results
Phylogenetic analysis
In this study, the combined data of the ML analysis, MP analysis, and Bayesian analysis are shown in Table 1. The topology of the Bayesian tree is very similar to the topology of the combined results of ML and MP analyses. However, the Bayesian tree is significantly different from the topology of the ML analysis (p<0.05, rho = 0.80, nho = 0.58, t-test, t-test p<0.05).
