## Abstract
The PBRF4-like helicase domain is a key enzyme in the catalytic subroutines for the transport of a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from heavy metal ions to nascent organic molecules. In this study, we report a novel biochemical method that was able to fully elucidate the activity of PBRF4-like helicase domain and compare it with that of the other domain complements using a random walk approach. By using the PBRF4-like helicase domain with random walk we found that the PBRF4-like helicase has an even stronger affinity for metal ions and may be more accessible than other helicases in certain ligands of the enzyme. The affinity of PBRF4-like helicase domain to the ligands containing the metal ion is further increased by the addition of heavy metal ions.


## Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem, especially among highly susceptible populations such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and those undergoing long-term immunosuppressive treatments (1). These patients are at the prime risk of developing serious, life-threatening infections, including acquired immunity-associated (AID) pneumonia (2), sepsis, and severe septic shock (DSS) (3).

Symbiosis is a key concept in both theoretical and experimental studies of the mechanisms of infection and clinical management. Symbiosis is thought to be a basic feature of the innate and adaptive immune system that enables cells to sense and respond to microbial pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms and roles of Symbiosis in the host are still unclear.

Symbiosis is thought to be the most conserved and sophisticated of innate immune cells. The Symbiogenic Host Defense Protein (SNARE) proteins are an integral component of the innate immune system and are essential for the establishment of an efficient pathogen response in host tissues. SYPs are classified as members of the non-protein complex Symp-Acp 1 (SNARE) complex and are expressed in many cells of the body, including Gram-negative bacteria, and are mainly associated with bacterial virulence (4-7). The SNARE complex consists of four components: Symp-1, Symp-2, Symp-3, and Symp-4. Symp-1 and Symp-2 play important roles in the pathogenesis of human infections, and are expressed in several cell types, including dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and macrophages (8-10).


## Methods
cerevisiae strains of MAT were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) (Madison, USA. These strains were originally isolated from potato (Solanum lycopersicum) and rice (Eucalyptus syringae) plants, and their genomes were obtained from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Sequences were edited and aligned using the software program MEGA v7.0 (Tamura et al., 2011). The phylogenetic tree was drawn using the program MEGA 7.0 (Tamura et al., 2011).

To assess the evolutionary rates of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 alleles, the DNA sequence of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 was compared to the sequences of the MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 alleles of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger, respectively (Sanger Institute, San Jose, CA, USA). The genotypic diversity of these fungal strains were calculated as described previously (Sangalli-Zavala et al., 2013). The genera and species of the S. cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus niger were determined by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of each strain. The ITS region was amplified using a nested PCR protocol using ITS1 and ITS4 primers (Vilgalys and Hester, 1990; White et al., 1990). The resulting PCR product was purified and used as a template to amplify a 1.5 kb fragment of the rDNA using the universal fungal primers ITS3 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990). The PCR products were sequenced by Genewiz (San Jose, CA, USA) using the same method as for the amplification of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) region. The sequences obtained were compared with the sequences of the original sequences using the program BioEdit v7.0.5 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html). The phylogenetic tree was drawn using the program MEGA 7.


## Results
The extracellular matrix (ECM) system is an important tool in the clearance of pathogens and the formation of fungal hyphae and fungal spore. Maturation of the extracellular matrix and pathogenicity are important factors for fungal virulence and pathogenicity [34]. However, our data indicated that the intracellular matrix did not have a significant impact on the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi. In addition, the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi varied depending on the host plant (Table S1). In plants, the extracellular matrix induced the death of extracellular fungi, whereas it did not affect their viability [19]. Therefore, our data showed that the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi varied depending on the host plant. In plant, extracellular fungi are known to be a potential virulence factor of human pathogenic fungi such as A. fumigatus [35] and A. terreus [36]. Our results suggest that extracellular fungi may be a potential virulence factor of the human pathogenic fungus A. fumigatus.

The Influence of the Plant Fungicide Mixture on Intracellular Survival of Extracellular Fungi
In order to determine whether extracellular fungi were a potential virulence factor of A. fumigatus in planta, we compared the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi on the same planticide mixture (Table S1). In our study, the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi was highly correlated with their fungal growth in the medium (Figure 4A). The intracellular survival of extracellular fungi was strongly correlated with the fungal growth in the medium, but not with the fungal growth in the presence of the planticide mixture (Figure 4A). Our results suggest that the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi was correlated with the fungal growth in the medium, but not with the fungal growth in the presence of the planticide mixture.

In addition, the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi was also strongly correlated with their fungal growth in the medium (Figure 4B). Our results suggest that the intracellular survival of extracellular fungi was correlated with the fungal growth in the medium.


## Discussion
The most prominent changes were the large changes in the M- and C-region (Figure 1 and Figure S3), which was similar to previous findings in other extracellular vesicle. This finding indicated that the MVB-1 localized into the cell membrane was altered in M-Vesicularlla and M-Vesicularlla. The change of the matrix was also found to be specific for the M-region and the M- and C-region of the vesicles (Figure 1). The change of the matrix for the M- and C-region was also found to be specific to the M-region of the vesicles (Figure S3). This result suggested that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region (Figure 1). The finding that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles suggested that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles. However, the finding that the M- and C-regions of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region indicated that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles. The finding that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles indicated that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles. The finding that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles indicated that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles. The finding that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles indicated that the M-region of the vesicles had a more prominent effect than the C-region and the M-region of the vesicles.
