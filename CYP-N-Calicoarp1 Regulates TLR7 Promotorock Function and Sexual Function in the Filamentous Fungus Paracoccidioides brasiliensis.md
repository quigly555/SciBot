## Abstract
Meningitis is a common cause of neurologic disability in developing countries. It is usually due to a variety of conditions, mainly viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections. Neurologic decline due to malignancy in patients with malignancy is usually secondary to infectious causes. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a 40-year-old man with acute onset of left-sided weakness and weakness of his left frontotum and right frontal cortex. He had been treated with amphotericin, flucytosine, and fluconazole for consolidation and consolidation of his left frontotum and consolidation of his right frontal cortex, but had significant visual impairment. MRI showed mild, but thrombocytopenia with marked round and diffuse lesions. Serum cryptococcal antigen was positive, and a flucytosine and flucytosine drug were also required for a rapid diagnosis. The patient was started with fluconazole and amphotericin. He died of progressive and fatal complications of multiple myeloma (MM) in a rural area of Cameroon.

This is the first report of disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient with acute onset of left-sided weakness and weakness of his left frontal cortex and the presence of a thrombocytopenia with marked round and diffuse lesions. There was a rapid diagnosis of cryptococcosis and the patient was started with fluconazole and amphotericin.

This case highlights the importance of knowing the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis in patients with acute onset of left-sided weakness and weakness of both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system in the setting of an active MM. The patient was initially diagnosed with disseminated cryptococcosis, and after two weeks was treated with fluconazole and amphotericin. The patient was then diagnosed with MM, and the patient’s treatment was started with fluconazole and amphotericin. Unfortunately, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required mechanical ventilation. He died of multiple complications of multiple myeloma (MM) in a rural area of Cameroon.

This case documents the development of an acute onset MM with a thrombocytopenia that developed rapidly in a 40-year-old HIV-infected male with severe anti-fungal autoimmunity.


## Introduction
As a result, the secretion of cytokinesis and the secretion of inflammatory cytokinesis are induced during the sexual development of the fungus in response to cell culture condition. In this regard, the activated cell response of the mating fungi Spore-forming fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Neurospora crassa is a form of classically activated cell response in the mating. This process is modulated by the activation of various components of the mating-type regulatory network, such as the mating-associated protein (MAP) kinase C (MAPKK) and the pheromone-regulated MAPK (pMAPK) pathways. These pathways control mating-type behavior and in turn the expression of sexual-specific genes and other genes [18-21].

The MAPK pathway is responsible for the maintenance of a balance between cell growth and development during mating. This pathway is activated by the cell-cell adhesion molecule (CAM) pheromones, which act as ligands for the MAPKK complex and mediate the signaling pathways through MAPKKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, which are responsible for the regulation of cell growth and development [22]. The MAPK cascade functions as a signaling hub to regulate the sexual development and pathogenesis of Paracoccidioides. MAPK cascades are involved in the regulation of a number of biological processes, including cell growth, development, and immune responses [23-26].

The MAPK cascade is highly conserved among fungi, including the human fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The MAPK cascade is activated by the pheromone signaling pathway, which is activated by the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway [27]. The cAMP-PKA signaling pathway activates the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) Hog1/2, which activates the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which in turn activates the MAPK cascades [28]. The MAPK pathway is activated by the mating-type regulatory network (MAP) as a signaling hub [29].


## Methods
 S. Marys, OH). Protein kinase domain kinase domain (PKC) is a conserved protein of different elements and domains of several proteins in fungi [25]. This kinase is a complex protein that exhibits a strong covalent bond and is connected to the cytoplasmic regions of kinase through pKC. It is considered as a kinase-like protein, and is required for the regulation of many proteins in the pathogen.


## Results
oryzae RUG-1, a G1/T cell lysine 5'-substituted protein, is expressed in the G1/T cell lineage and is necessary for fungal pathogenicity [18. However, we found that the expression levels of RUG-1 were higher in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, while that of RUG-1 was less than that of the wild type strain, suggesting that RUG-1 is a target of G1/T cell lysine 5'-substituted protein (Fig 1). We therefore investigated the expression of RUG-1 in the wild type and <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, in which RUG-1 was not expressed, and in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, in which RUG-1 was expressed and expressed as G1/T cells.

RUG-1 was expressed in the wild type and <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, but not in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, at all time points tested (Fig 1). The RUG-1 expression levels in the wild type and <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant were similar in the three time points tested, suggesting that RUG-1 is not expressed in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant. In contrast, RUG-1 was expressed in the wild type and <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant in the three time points tested, suggesting that RUG-1 is not expressed in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant (Fig 1).

The expression of RUG-1 was expressed in the wild type strain in all time points tested, but in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant, it was expressed in the wild type strain at all time points tested (Fig 1). The RUG-1 expression levels in the wild type strain were similar in the three time points tested, indicating that RUG-1 is not expressed in the <U+0394>RUG-1 mutant.


## Discussion
are able to induce asexual development in two distinct ways: via asexual development of sporotrichum-like cells, which are first produced by sexual reproduction in the liquid culture and later observed in the perithecium and ascospores (Fig 3), and subsequently from the perithecium through the ascospores (Fig 5. These two processes were further stimulated by the presence of P. brasiliensis-infected sporotrichum-like cells in the perithecia of the hosts (Fig 5A and 5B), which subsequently produced germ tubes that were subsequently hypha-like (Fig 6A and 6B), and conidiophores (Fig 6B and 6C). The perithecium of the sporotrichum-like cells was then observed in a “spin-free” state, and sporogenesis was subsequently observed via the ascospores, which were then released as spores to initiate sporulation (Fig 6A and 6B). The sporotrichum-like cells also produced an “epidemic” sporulation system, which was observed during sporulation (Fig 6B). The sporotrichum-like cells were then observed again in the perithecia of the hosts, and sporulation was then observed via the ascospores to induce sexual reproduction (Fig 6C). However, the sporotrichum-like cells were still observed sporulating in the perithecia of the hosts (Fig 6D). The sporotrichum-like cells were finally detected in the perithecia of the sporotrichum-infected sporotrichum-like cells in the perithecial body (Fig 6E). However, the sporotrichum-infected sporotrichum-like cells were still observed sporulating in the perithecia of the sporotrichum-infected sporotrichum-like cells in the perithecial body (Fig 6F). These results suggest that the sporotrichum-like cells were not induced to sexual reproduction in the perithecia of the sporotrichum-infected hosts (Fig 6G). These results also suggest that Paracoccidioides spp. may be able to induce sexual reproduction in the perithecia of hosts.

We also observed that Paracoccidioides spp.
