## Abstract
We describe a patient with HIV cryptococcosis who presented with ocular trauma, dysphagia, and focal neurologic deficits. His final diagnosis was cytomegalovirus (CMV) related, and he had a favorable outcome.

•A 58-year-old male patient with HIV-associated CMV, HIV-related endophthalmitis, and an Endothelioidosis requiring a P90L was admitted to our hospital. •CLH4 was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans and gastric involvement was suspected. •Combining clinical symptoms and laboratory findings with results of computed tomography (CT) was as strong as negative. •The CT showed multiple lesions and multiple thickened/reduced diffusely with central, thickened, and thickened lesions. •The liver lesions and meningitis were positive.

A 58-year-old male patient with HIV-associated CMV, HIV-related endophthalmitis, and an Endothelioidosis requiring a P90L was admitted to our hospital. This was the first report of invasive endophthalmitis in a renal transplant recipient. A successful outcome was achieved.

A patient with HIV-associated endophthalmitis, HIV-related endophthalmitis, and an Endothelioidosis requiring a P90L was admitted to our hospital. This was the first report of invasive endophthalmitis in a renal transplant recipient. Computed tomographic findings and positive CSF for HIV-1 infection were positive. HIV infection should be suspected in patients with endophthalmitis.


## Introduction
In recent years, as the world faces an ever-increasing immunocompromized patient population, there is an increased concern on the development of drug-resistant pathogens. The spectrum of antifungal drugs available to treat infections is remarkably vast, with a very large number of drug classes available that have different mechanisms of action that are highly conserved in all eukaryotic lineages (1). Additionally, there is a growing interest in the development of new antifungal agents with novel mechanisms of action that will be of special interest in the development of antifungal therapy.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of molecules characterized by a conserved sequence that consists of at least eight amino acid residues and is found in all eukaryotes and the most abundant eukaryotic class of proteins. AMPs have broad antimicrobial activities that include activity against bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Although the precise mechanism of action of AMPs has not been well understood, they act by reducing or increasing the membrane permeability of the cell, or by interfering with the cell membrane integrity (2).


## Methods
cerevisiae strains were cultured in PDA (2% peptone, 1% dextrose, .165 M NaCl, pH 8.0) at 25°C for 7 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Cell pellets were resuspended with 1 mL of PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The cell suspension was then serially diluted (10-fold) to 10^3 CFU/mL. Tumour cells were added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The inhibition of cell growth was measured as the absorbance of the cell suspension at 405 nm. The control, in which GalXM was used to inhibit cell growth, was performed in the same way. The assay was repeated three times. The absorbance value of the cell suspension was measured with a plate reader at a wavelength of 520 nm (SpectraMax M2 microplate reader, Molecular Devices, USA). The assay was repeated three times. The results are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).

For the determination of the inhibitory action of GalXM against Tumour Microbiota, S. cerevisiae strains were cultured in PDA (2% peptone, 1% dextrose, 0.165 M NaCl, pH 8.0) at 25°C for 7 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Cell pellets were resuspended with 1 mL of PBS-T and then serially diluted (10-fold) to 10^3 CFU/mL. The cell suspension was then incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The cell suspension was then serially diluted (10-fold) to 10^3 CFU/mL.

## Results
We have shown that galactomannan (GA)-deficient mice and galactomannan-deficient mutant mice exhibited similar killing behavior as those of wild-type (WT) mice (Fig 7A. When the killing activity of galactomannan and galactomannan-deficient mice was compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice, wild-type mice and galactomannan-deficient mutant mice exhibited similar fungal burdens in the lung (Fig 7B). In contrast, the killing activity of galactomannan-deficient mice was significantly reduced compared to the killing activity of the wild-type mice. In the same study, we found that galactomannan-deficient mice and galactomannan-deficient mutant mice exhibited similar fungal burdens in the lung (Fig 7C).

To further understand the synergistic effect of galactomannan and galactomannan-deficient mice, the production of extracellular galacto- and extracellular protein-ß, as well as the extracellular glycoproteoglycan glycoprotein (ERG) and the extracellular glycoprotein-ß, were measured. As shown in Fig 8A, galactomannan-deficient mice produced a greater amount of ERG, but significantly lower amounts of glycoprotein-ß, and a lower level of glycoprotein-ß, than wild-type mice. Galactomannan-deficient mice produced significantly more ERG and glycoprotein-ß in the lung.

Galactomannan and Galactoside Disulfide Biosynthesis Improves the Killing Activity of GalXM by Inhibitory Proteins
We next compared the ability of galactomannan and galactoside-deficient mice to kill Tumour microorganisms by means of end-point dilutions of both extracellular proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins.
