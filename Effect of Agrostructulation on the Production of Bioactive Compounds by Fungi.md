## Introduction
In addition, the functional aspects of bioactive compounds have been extensively studied in fungi and bacteri. They are synthesized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) where they are assembled into two groups of complexes, the active-site complex and the non- active-site complex [10,11,12]. The MRCs are the most abundant form of cellular protein in the fungal MRC and play a vital role in the synthesis of proteins. In addition, MRCs are found in the extracellular matrix in fungal cells, where they are involved in many cellular processes, such as cell wall formation and cell migration, as well as regulating various processes like angiogenesis, oxidative stress, iron homeostasis, and temperature sensing [13,14].

Many fungi produce a wide range of bioactive compounds, which include enzymes, lipids, and pigments, which can be recognized as bioactive compounds. In addition, some fungi can produce a variety of secondary metabolites, which have been shown to be active compounds in the MRC [15,16].

Some studies have indicated that several fungi can produce a wide range of bioactive compounds, which includes enzymes, lipids, and pigments, which can be recognized as bioactive compounds [17,18,19,20]. The genus of Trichoderma species has been known for more than 40 years and has been isolated from many natural and human sources, including soil, water, plants, plants-mushrooms, and fruits [21,22,23]. Most of the Trichoderma species produce edible fungi, which are used in traditional medicine, such as for the treatment of diabetes, dysentery, headache, gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, cough, dyspepsia, and vomiting, and the use of natural products [24,25,26].

Some of the fungi are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of digestive disorders, diabetes, and dysentery [27,28,29]. In addition, some Trichoderma species are used in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and also for the treatment of muscle soreness, and the use of vitamins and other compounds is widespread [30,31,32,33,34]. The genus Trichoderma also contains many species that are used as medicinal plants, such as Fusarium verticillioides, for the treatment of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases [35,36,37].


## Methods
[22] and the results were reported as absorbance at 405 n.

For bioactive compounds, the method of TIGR and the method of EI by EI is the same.

The formation of bioactive compounds was reported in the test tubes containing 10% SDS, 5% KOH, 1% (v/v) Tween 80, 1% of MgCl_2, 1% of CaCl_2, and 1% of FeCl_2. The test tubes were placed in a chamber of a BioRad DEAE-10 photochemical device. The test tubes were incubated at 37°C in a solution of 5% SDS, 1% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1% (v/v) CaCl_2. The solution was mixed, then, it was allowed to stand for 2 h at 25°C, and then the absorbance was measured at 405 nm.

The test tubes were prepared with an equal volume of 1% (w/v) DMSO, then, 1% (v/v) DMSO was added to the tubes, then, the absorbance was measured at 495 nm. The percentage of inhibition by bioactive compounds on the inhibition of their absorbance were obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the control and the test tubes.

The test tubes were prepared with 5% SDS, 1% (v/v) DMSO, 1% (v/v) Tween 80, 0.5% (w/v) Na_2MoO_4, 0.01% (v/v) KCl, 1% (v/v) KH_2PO_4, and 0.01% (v/v) Na_3MoO_4. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm.

The test tubes were prepared with 1% (v/v) DMSO, 1% (v/v) Tween 80, 0.5% (w/v) Na_2MoO_4, 0.01% (v/v) KCl, 0.01% (v/v) FeCl_2, 0.01% (v/v) MgSO_4, and 0.01% (v/v) H_3BO_3.


## Results
As shown in Fig 5, no significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of compounds of the three tested strains were observed in the presence of Agrostructulatio.

2.2. Enzymatic Activity of Agrostructulation on the Dispersed Bioactive Compounds by Fungal Species
The enzymatic activity of Agrostructulation on the effused drug compounds of fungi was evaluated by the isoeugenol-decanoic acid (IEC) assay (Table 4). The concentration of IEC in the well of Agrostructulation was very close to that of the control; therefore, we compared the inhibitory activity of the three tested fungal species (Fig 6). The obtained IEC values were consistent with those reported previously for the metabolically inactive fungal species C. neoformans [22]. The inhibitory activity of Agrostructulation on the effused drugs of C. neoformans was clearly found to be 100% in all the tested fungal species.

2.3. Analysis of Bioactive Compounds by ELISA
The bioactive compounds of the three tested fungal species were identified by ELISA from the reaction of the reaction products with the product of Agrostructulation. As shown in Fig 7, the concentration of the three tested species were significantly higher than that of the control; therefore, the activity of Agrostructulation was determined to be different from the control (100%).

2.4. Antifungal Activity of Agrostructulation
The antifungal activity of Agrostructulation against C. neoformans was tested against a panel of clinical isolates of C. neoformans. The results shown in Fig 8 indicate that Agrostructulation showed better antifungal activity than that of the control.

2.5. Minimum Effective Concentration (MEC) for Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of Agrostructulation against C. neoformans was determined using the minimum effective concentration (MIC) assay (Table 3). The results showed that Agrostructulation demonstrated better activity against C. neoformans than that of the control. However, the MIC of Agrostructulation was found to be much higher than that of the control.


## Discussion
The strains used in this study are the strains used in the previous study (6) and the strains used in this study are the strains used in the previous study (7.

The bioactive compounds were obtained by the bioassay using either two different methods: an ABTS solution or a standard agarose gel solution. In ABTS, the ABTS solution is a mix of a mixture of glucose and ABTS, which are the usual forms of carbon dioxide in nature. In this study, the bioactive compounds were obtained by the ABTS solution using either ABTS or an aqueous solution.

The Agroformic Effect of Fungi on the Production of Bioactive Compounds
The results of the bioactivity assays are shown in Figure 1.

In the fermentation of glucose, the yield of bioactive compounds was obtained at 34.7%. This value was not more than 10% lower than the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica strain ATCC 20509. The biosynthetic pathway of the biosynthesis of glucose-6-phosphate in Fungi consists of the two steps (6-phosphoglucomutase and 6-phosphoglucomutase) [16]. The main enzyme in the biosynthesis of 6-phosphoglucomutase is phosphoglucomutase, which is expressed as a GPI-anchored protein. The biosynthetic pathway of the biosynthesis of 6-phosphoglucomutase in fungi is the a-ketoglutarate-1-phosphate synthase (6-PPPS1) [17]. The 6-PPPS1 catalyzes the conversion of 6-phosphoglucomutase into phosphoglucomutase, and the 6-PPPS1 is converted into phosphoglycerate, an active form of phosphoglucomutase. In the production of bioactive compounds, the biosynthetic pathway of the biosynthesis of 6-phosphoglucomutase was also activated, which is the most important biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of the biosynthesis of 6-phosphoglucomutase. In addition, the biosynthetic pathway of the biosynthesis of 6-phosphoglucomutase was also activated in the VpsA system.
