## Abstract
The yeast Cryptococcus gattii is a severe obligate intracellular pathogen that causes deadly meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Upon contact with water, C. gattii causes disease. How the yeast interacts with the water-soluble host defense system, and how it survives inside the host, is not understood. Here we show that a cDNA encoding a master regulator of secretory responses (RsaT), which regulates the yeast-to-water transition, is indispensable for full pathogenicity in a water- and C. gattii-infected water-referred Pichia pastoris. We show that RsaT is also essential for survival of C. gattii within a host and that this response is essential for full pathogenicity in the host. We demonstrate that Pichia pastoris can readily be infected by water treatment of its resident cells, and that the ability to survive water treatment enhances the ability of this yeast to translocate within host cells, thereby becoming a water reservoir for infection. We found that cells treated with C. gattii exude a competitive NaCl-mediated volvocine release upon water treatment. We discovered that C. gattii secretes a potent fungistatic inhibitor, doriconazole, in order to survive and replicate within host cells. doriconazole treatment was able to abrogate the effects of water treatment on water-soluble cell adhesion molecules, such as the NRPSI-class of the S100 family of tyrosine-based transcription factors. Moreover, we discovered that doriconazole was highly effective in controlling the adherence of C. gattii to host cells, and we show that doriconazole treatment of C. gattii correlates with survival in the water-referred Pichia pastoris, as determined by the severity of the symptoms of infection and effluent flow measurements. This study demonstrates that the ability of P. pastoris to form lifelong filaments correlates with the virulence of a single strain, suggesting that the survival of a C. gattii infection in water-referred P. pastoris could be closely related to the ability of this yeast to remain viable within host cells.


## Introduction
Neuropsychiatric diseases, such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), frontotemporal amaurosis (FTAL), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are collectively named “psychiatric disorders,” and are characterized by pervasive, repeated and subinhibitory deficits in thinking, learning and memory.1, 2 These disorders are characterized by acute or subinhibitory symptoms, the loss of which can be detected at any time of the year. The etiologic agents of these disorders are diverse, including neuropsychiatric drugs, mainly benzodiazepines and warfarins, and some of them can be fatal.3 The epidemiology of FTD is complex and varies from country to country, and even from decade to decade, and even from individual to individual. However, an accurate description of the disease is difficult because it varies from country to country. In Africa, it is known that there are several million people with cerebral disorders and this varies from country to country. It is also known that the prevalence varies from country to country. It is very difficult to diagnose a disease due to its fast onset, low resolution, and difficulty to track its progression. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all people with severe mood disorders should be placed on a psychotherapy program. Clinicians need to be counselled and equipped with appropriate resources to be able to perform the appropriate treatment and follow-up.3

The most common cause of death in patients with FTD is cryptococcal meningitis (CM), a disease with a fatal outcome of approximately 80% in patients with frontotemporal dementia.


## Methods
In this study, four endangered white-fish species (Delphi arctica, Zymosphaeria maculans, Panamomarpha porcine s., and Xenopus litchi) were included in the study (Table 1).

In addition, we also evaluated the endotoxin B availability in the feeding time of three species (Malus litchi, Malus norvegicus, Malus piceatus and Malus oxysporum) from the H. mediterranea [3] and Malus brasiliensis [3] in the feeding time of the M. litchi and M. piceatus species. In both species, the feeding time was 3-5 days, with the feeding time being chosen as the end-point of the study. The M. litchi and M. piceatus species were fed in the same way, and there were no differences in the number of feeding time points between Malus litchi and Malus piceatus.

In addition, the methods of nitrate reduction (NO_2), nitrite reduction (NO_3), and nitrate saturation (NO_4) were done to evaluate the endotoxin B availability in the feeding time of M. litchi and M. piceatus. Nitrate reduction was done by the addition of 2% NaNO_3, and NaNO_3 and NaNO_3 were done by the addition of NaNO_3 and NaNO_3. The methodology of nitrate reduction was done using the two-step method, which is based on the reduction of the concentration of nitrite by the addition of NaNO_3. The nitrite concentration was adjusted by adding NaNO_3 and NaNO_3, and NaNO_3 and NaNO_3 were added to the diet of the M. piceatus species. Nitrite reduction and nitrite saturation were done by adding NaNO_3 and NaNO_3 to the diet of the Malus litchi species. The method of NO_2 reduction was done using the method of nitrate reduction and the addition of NaNO_3. The method of NO_3 saturation was done using the method of NaNO_3. The method of NO_4 reduction was done using the method of NaNO_3. The method of NO_5 reduction was done using the method of NaNO_3.


## Results
As described in the Materials and Methods section, the optimized fed-batch feeding time (Table 1) is significantly longer than that of the conventional feeding strategy, which can be achieved by increasing the time by one second for all feeding times, with the last feeding step being the most effectiv. The fed-batch feeding method produces similar results as the fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy, with the following feed parameters: nutrient density, temperature, feed volume and time of the feeding (Table 1).

The fed-batch fed-batch feeding method (Table 1) is particularly suited to use in the field. The fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy yields similar results as the fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy, with the following feed parameters: nutrient density, temperature, feed volume and time of the feeding (Table 1).

The fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy can be employed to expand the number of feed bottles and feed cycles needed for each feeding cycle.

The fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy can be used to increase the number of feed cycles required to obtain high performance feedstocks (Figure 1). In this study, the fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy produced a feed consumption rate of 5.9 ± 0.8 g/day (dry weight) and a feed volume of 9.3 ± 2.2 g/day (dry weight) for the fed-batch fed-batch feeding cycle. The fed-batch fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy produced a feed consumption rate of 5.4 ± 0.9 g/day (dry weight) and a feed volume of 9.3 ± 2.2 g/day (dry weight) for the fed-batch fed-batch feeding cycle. The fed-batch fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy produced a feed consumption rate of 5.4 ± 0.9 g/day (dry weight) and a feed volume of 9.3 ± 2.2 g/day (dry weight) for the fed-batch fed-batch feeding cycle. The fed-batch fed-batch fed-batch feeding strategy produced a feed consumption rate of 5.4 ± 0.9 g/day (dry weight) and a feed volume of 9.3 ± 2.


## Discussion

Many studies have used different approaches to explore the potential use of the Nematocida as alternative gut microbiota in feeding white-fis. In one study using white-fish as a human diet, the Nematocida was used to colonize gut of both adults and larvae in the same diet, and the Nematocida was found to be active in the stomach of adult worms of adult worms (Figure 2). A study using the invertebrate Yarrowia lipolytica as a human diet resulted in the utilization of Nematocida to facilitate gut colonization of adult worms by larvae (Kohn et al. 2010). A study using white-fish as a human diet showed the Nematocida to be active in the stomach of adult worms and adults in both adult and juvenile white-fish (Wu et al. 2015). In this study, the Nematocida was also active in the stomach of the adult worms in the same diet. The study of Neisseria guttateola as a human diet showed the Nematocida to be active in the stomach of adult worms of adult worms in the same diet, and the Nematocida was found to be active in the stomach of adult worms in the same diet. Another study using white-fish as a human diet showed the Nematocida to be active in the stomach of adults and adults of juvenile worms in the same diet (Wu et al. 2015).

We found that the Nematocida was active in the gut of the white-fish larvae in the same diet. The Nematocida has been reported to be active in the gut of other invertebrates such as the nematode Prochloriniella phagocytophilum (PCC) (Kohn et al. 2010) and the black-throat beetle D. melanogaster (Sloan et al. 2016). The nematocida was active in the gut of the white-fish larvae in the same diet. However, the Nematocida was inactive in the gut of the adult worms in the same diet. The larvae from the white-fish diet contained more Nematocida than larvae from the adult worms. The Nematocida was active in the gut of the white-fish larvae in the same diet. The Nematocida was inactive in the gut of the adult worms in the same diet.
