## Abstract
The intestinal microbiota is an intricate structure that is essential for both health and disease. The intestinal jaundice is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gut due to the microbial colonization and amplification of inflammatory microorganisms that contribute to the development and progression of intestinal disorders. This review discusses the mechanisms by which Crohn’s disease (CD) patients acquire chronic inflammatory gut microflora and discusses the gut-brain axis during CD and ulcerative colitis. This information will provide a critical, stepwise guide for managing patients with CD and other forms of intestinal dysfunction.


## Introduction
Fungi are an ever expanding group of eukaryotic organisms that can cause serious fungal infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised patients. Opportunistic and opportunistic fungal infections are the most common manifestation of disease in the developed world, and are also responsible for over two million life-threatening infections annually [1]. Invasive fungal infections are common in burn patients, as they can disseminate and reactivate both in vitro and in vivo. The most common fungal species involved are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Invasive fungal infections can lead to as high as 30% mortality [2,3]. The most common fungal diseases are associated with opportunistic fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., and C. albicans [1,4]. The most common clinical form is candidiasis, with Candida spp. accounting for less than 5% of all fungal infections [3,5]. However, invasive fungal infections are also seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with neutropenia, organ transplants, leukemia, and AIDS [6]. Invasive candidiasis is also seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in those with nephrotoxic kidney disease (NPPDD) [7]. The incidence of these infections is increasing, with the most common agents being Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jirovecii [1,6,8].

The emergence of emerging fungal pathogens has resulted in the emergence of new pathogenic species that can cause disease in humans. These include Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp.


## Methods
Three other new species and a new combination of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were isolated from soil samples of various soil. The three new species and the new combination were identified as the definitive genus Indracellushmya. The identification of the new species was based on the morphological characteristics and molecular analysis of the isolated morphologically similar species. The isolated species was named as Indracellushmya as described previously [26].

DNA extraction and PCR amplification
Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified CTAB method [27] and PCR products were purified using the CTAB enzyme and DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA was performed using the ABI Prism BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR product was visualized on 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified PCR product was sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the fungal ITS region was amplified by PCR with the primers ITS4 and ITS5 [28]. The fungal ITS region was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4 [29]. The PCR product was visualized on 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified PCR product was sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the fungal ITS region was amplified by PCR with the primers ITS1 and ITS4. The PCR product was visualized on 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified PCR product was sequenced by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the fungal ITS region was amplified by PCR with the primers ITS1 and ITS4. The PCR product was visualized on 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).


## Results
The most common species was . vesicatori (39) isolated from the sea in China. Agaricales was most common in Japan (8), followed by A. cinnabarina (4), and P. vesicatori (4).

Two cases of P. vesicatori (8) were also found in the literature. A. cinnabarina was identified in the literature as a synonym of P. vesicatori (8), but in the case of P. vesicatori, the conidial material was obtained from the sea. The other species of P. vesicatori, P. vesicatori-baeense (9), P. vesicatori-baeense (10), P. vesicatori-baeense (11) and P. vesicatori-baeense (12) were found to be distinct from P. vesicatori, respectively.

In the present study, all the isolates of P. vesicatori and P. vesicatori-baeense were well distinguished. The conidial material was obtained from the sea. The most common species was P. vesicatori (4) isolated from the sea in Japan. Agaricales was the most common species in Japan, followed by P. vesicatori (4). In the present study, the isolates of P. vesicatori and P. vesicatori-baeense were also well distinguished. However, P. vesicatori-baeense was not well differentiated, and the conidial material was obtained from the sea. The other species were P. vesicatori-baeense (9) isolated from the sea in China, and P. vesicatori-baeense (10) isolated from the sea in Japan.

The fungus used in this study was P. vesicatori, and the isolate was isolated from the sea. In the present study, the isolate was well differentiated and was found to be distinct from P. vesicatori.

Taxonomic consequences: new species record
C. rosetta (N.L. gen. n. triculare, of or belonging to this genus) was recorded on the basis of the LSU rDNA sequence analysis (ITS1-5.8S, ITS2-6.6S, TEF1.4-3.8S) in the collections examined. This species has been recorded from the same locality, but the ITS sequences were not available for this species. The new species is lichenized on different trees, but the ITS sequences have not been available for this species.
