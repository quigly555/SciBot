## Abstract
Progression of cancer depends on the chemokine receptor (CPR) ligand CD11 on the plasma membrane, and the activation of the immune system plays a key role in this process. While several lines of evidence have demonstrated a correlation between CPR ligand homeostasis and tumor progression, there are still many unanswered questions regarding this relationship. In this study, we explored the role of CPR ligand on immune cell migration and killing by breast, colon, and human neutrophils. Our results show that CPR ligand promotes migration and killing of CCR2-deficient neutrophils by regulating their pro-inflammatory immune response. We also show that treatment with a liposomal peptide disrupts the neutrophilic-internalized plasma membrane, increasing the activity of immune cells and thus inhibiting migration and killing of this cell type. We also show that the increased activity of neutrophils migrates to and kills cancer cells in vitro, and these effects are dependent on a C-terminal pattern peptide that is also a key step in migration. This novel understanding of immune cell migration and killing by immune cells may be useful for the development of vaccines for cancer and other diseases that cause inflammation and cancer-related mortality.


## Introduction
%) with cryptococcosis, compared to 13,500 (1.4%) with only mild forms of cryptococcosis. The incidence of both mild and severe cryptococcal meningitis in those who were non-HIV was 6.4% and 2.4%, respectively. The incidence of severe cryptococcal meningitis in those with HIV was 3.4% and 1.5%, respectively. The incidence of severe cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV patients with no history of cryptococcal meningitis was 2.6% and 0.9%, respectively.

In a follow-up study of a subgroup of HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis, mild meningitis was seen in 2.1% of the patients and in 1.4% of the patients, compared to a prevalence of 2.2% in HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis in the same study [15]. The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis in the same study was 2.2% [15].

In a clinical study of HIV-positive patients with mild or moderate meningitis, the incidence of mild meningitis was found to be 3.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The incidence of severe meningitis in non-HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis in the same study was 1.4% [15].

In a follow-up study of HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis, the incidence of severe meningitis in HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis in the same study was 1.4% [15].

The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV patients with mild or moderate meningitis is estimated to be 6.2% and 2.2% [21]. The incidence of severe meningitis in HIV patients with mild to severe meningitis in the same study was 2.2% [15].

In a study of non-HIV patients with mild or moderate meningitis, the incidence of severe meningitis in non-HIV patients with mild or moderate meningitis was found to be 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively.


## Methods
Participants were prospectively recruited from HIV/AIDS hospitals, public and private clinics in Vancouver Island, BC, Canada and interviewed by medical officers from each hospita.

Data collection
The data were collected on an electronic questionnaire, which was placed in a dedicated secure area and then entered into a database. This data was kept private. We collected the following data: HIV/AIDS patients aged =18 years with a score of =5 was excluded; those with a score of >4 were excluded; those with a score of =4 were included in the study; and those with a score of =5 were excluded.

We categorized the cryptococcal meningitis cases into two groups: ‘Cryptococcal meningitis’ and ‘Multicellular meningitis’ (Supplementary Figure S1, Supporting Information). Multicellular meningitis was defined as patients with a score of <4 on the macroscopic examination of the lateral brain areas and no further examination of the brain tissue was performed. The presence of microcephaly was defined as a positive India ink stain or a positive India ink stain with India ink, respectively. The presence of hemolytic meningitis was defined as a positive India ink stain or a positive India ink stain with India ink, respectively.

We calculated the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis per 100,000 population by the percentage of patients who were immunosuppressed in the study period and then compared the numbers of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population with the number of cryptococcal meningitis cases in the study period. We calculated the number of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population by the following formula: % = number of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population + (number of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population)/(number of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population)/(number of cryptococcal meningitis cases per 100,000 population).

The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was compared with the overall population of HIV/AIDS patients in the study period, which comprised all patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis from the HIV/AIDS study period.


## Results

In this nested analysis, we found that HIV infection was associated with higher odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection: age, sex, CD4 count, HIV status, and use of a combination prophylactic therap.

The pooled association between HIV status and cryptococcal infection was a strong negative association (P=0.001). HIV infection was associated with a lower odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection: age, sex, CD4 count, HIV status, and use of a combination prophylactic therapy.

In the pooled association between HIV status and cryptococcal infection, the odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection were significantly lower (P=0.001).

The pooled association between HIV status and cryptococcal infection was a weak negative association (P=0.001).

The odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection were significantly lower (P=0.001).

The pooled association between HIV status and cryptococcal infection was a strong negative association (P=0.001).

There were no significant differences in the odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection: age, sex, CD4 count, and use of a combination prophylactic therapy.

Multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection
In this multivariable analysis, HIV infection was associated with a lower odds of cryptococcal infection among people who received a multivariable analysis of factors associated with cryptococcal infection: age, sex, CD4 count, HIV status, and use of a combination prophylactic therapy.

The pooled association between HIV status and cryptococcal infection was a weak negative association (P=0.001).


## Discussion
%) patients had clinical evidence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients aged 17-68 year. A total of 73 (44.5%) Chinese patients had an immunocompetent status and these patients were registered in the Multicenter Chinese Hospital Hospital. However, there were no patients with an immunocompetent status registered in the Multicenter Chinese Hospital. The prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients was 8.2% (95% CI: 3.5-29.1%, P = 0.05) [8]. In our study, this was the first study to report the prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients aged 17-68 years in this setting. This finding was in contrast to a previous study in Taiwan [9] which reported a prevalence of cryptococcal infection of 9.2%. This difference may be due to different methods of diagnosis among different studies. This study is the first to report cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients aged 17-68 years in this setting.

The present study has several limitations. Firstly, this was a single center study that could not assess the prevalence of cryptococcal infection among the Chinese population in Taiwan. Secondly, the data were only collected in patients with a valid work-up. Thirdly, the prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients was low. Fourthly, the study was only completed in patients with an immunocompetent status. Fifthly, the study was not conducted in patients with an immunocompromised status. Sixthly, the study was only conducted in patients with an HIV infection and patients with co-existing immunosuppression. Seventhly, there were no reports of cryptococcal infection among HIV-positive patients in Taiwan. In addition, there were no studies of cryptococcal infection among Chinese people in Taiwan.

In conclusion, this study provides important information regarding the prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients in this Taiwan provincial capital. The prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients was 8.2%, and the prevalence of cryptococcal infection among ethnobotanized Chinese HIV/AIDS patients was 19.7%.
