# Comparative intron lengthomics in orthology and phylogeny reveal the formation of clonal shuffling domains
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The large number of introns found in this clonal genome limits experimental phylogenetic resolution to a single set of ancestral genes, yet we demonstrate that these ancestral genes are more similar to the present orthologs than are ancestral protein. The length of the shuffled gene family is likely to have increased during evolution as a consequence of the increased number of introns found in the genome. Our study of the genomic basis of this intron expansion provides a resource for comparative genomics studies of eukaryotes, allowing comparisons of intron length across a large group of species or a group of closely related species.

IMPORTANCE Histone acetylation is a common structural and biochemical feature of mammals, resulting in genes with diverse functions and phenotypes in response to environmental signals. Histone deacetylation is a key determinant of the formation of the link between the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in vertebrates. In this study we investigated the role played by histone deacetylation in aging in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that deacetylation is an essential step in the lifespan maintenance phase of S. cerevisiae, and deacetylation of the N-acetylglucosaminidase required for the elongation step. We also identified an N-acetylglucosamine dehydrogenase (NAGID) in the Hormone-Induced (HAI) model of neurodegenerative disease, which is responsible for the growth defect in axonal cultures of H. gloeosporioides. In contrast, the role played by deacetylation of the N-acetylglucosamine dehydrogenase (NAGID) in the H. pylori infection model was not found. Taken together, our results indicate that the H. gloeosporioides N-acetylglucosamine may play an important role in the phenotypic aging of S. cerevisiae.

Hormone-like 2,3-diol (H2L) is a structural and functional variant of histone deacetylases that is present in a variety of organisms, including fungi.


## Introduction
The genus Fungi contains many important and well-known fungi, many of which are pathogenic to humans and animals [1]. In recent years, a great number of fungal species have been isolated from the skin and nails of animals, plants, and human, and some of them have been reported to cause human infections such as Histoplasmosis, Sporothrix schenkii, and Penicillium marneffei. The genus Fungi, like many other fungi, can cause skin infections and infections of the nails and hair [2,3]. Fungal infections of the nails and hair are very common and usually associated with opportunistic fungi such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Cryptococcus. Fusariosis is one of the common opportunistic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and is the most common fungal nail disease in that condition [4]. Fusariosis is one of the most common systemic fungal infections, and it is mainly caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Coccidioides immitis [5,6]. It is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised patients and it is usually associated with opportunistic fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Talaromyces [7,8].


## Methods
Strains and Growth Media
The C. albicans strains used in this study were: Y-17a (ATCC 32068), the strain used in this study to generate the yeast-like strain (Y-17a), and the strain to generate the mutant strain Y-17a (MATa), which showed better than expected size-exclusion error (SEM) in a conventional cultivation. All strains were cultured at 30 °C for 16 h in YPD media, except the Y-17a strain (MATa), which was cultured at 30 °C for 16 h in MM media. The other C. albicans strains were cultured at 30 °C for 16 h in MM media.


## Results
This has provided an alternative approach for understanding intron evolution by combining intron gain and loss with evolutionary histor. Intron gain and loss are both unique and likely ancestral. To explore the evolution of functional intron structures, we used the intron gain and loss pathways to investigate intron gains and losses of these pathways. This analysis revealed two main groups of intron gain and loss pathways. The first group involved the intron gain and loss pathways and the second group was the “deep-branching” pathway. Both these pathways are likely ancestral and likely originated from distinct genealogies. It is not clear whether the “deep-branching” pathway is directly linked to the intron gain or has been linked to intron gain and loss.

Intron gain and loss pathways are not the only routes of intron gain and loss in fungi
Previous studies have shown that intron gain and loss pathways are not the only routes of intron gain and loss in fungi. For example, the “deep-branching” pathway was recently shown to be linked to intron gain and loss in C. albicans (Barr et al., 2013). These findings support the hypothesis that intron gain and loss pathways are the major routes of intron gain and loss in fungi. The “deep-branching” pathway was shown to be linked to intron gain and loss in S. cerevisiae (Oliveira et al., 2009). These findings also suggest that intron gain and loss pathways are the major routes of intron gain and loss in fungi.

To identify potential pathways of intron gain and loss in fungi, we performed multiple introns for these genes. In addition to intron gain and loss, we also used the “deep-branching” pathway to study the intron gain and loss pathways in the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans genomes. We observed that the “deep-branching” pathway is also not associated with intron gain and loss in the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans genomes (Figure 4).

## Discussion
This is consistent with the pattern observed in other phyla, including the basidiomycete phyla, where all intron gains and losses have been reported [41, 43. It also suggests that intron gain and loss are common in different evolutionary lineages.

Consequently, it is not surprising that some introns are retained in a certain orthology. However, it is interesting to note that some intron gains and losses have been reported in fungi and mammals, as well as in prokaryotes, and that the relationship between intron gain and loss is not clear. In addition, it is possible that the level of intron loss and retention is very high in some taxa. In addition, the type of intron in each of the two groups might influence the position of the intron to the right side of the coding sequence. Alternatively, a reduction in intron number in the gene set of fungi might also contribute to this phenomenon.

There is no obvious intron gain or loss that is common in some eukaryotes. It is tempting to speculate that intron gain and loss might be rare events that are unlikely to occur in other eukaryotes. The observed intron gain and loss of introns are more likely to occur in fungi, because they are much more common in fungi than in other eukaryotes. Although intron gain and loss have been reported in a few eukaryotes, they were not reported in all eukaryotes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence to suggest that intron gain and loss are rare events. In addition, there is no clear evidence for intron gain and loss in the leucine zipper gene of C. elegans. The Leu_LTR1 gene of C. elegans is a weakly conserved intron (data not shown). However, there is no evidence that intron gain and loss are rare events, and the Leu_LTR1 gene is only present in a few eukaryotic species. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that these events are common in eukaryotes, but rare in fungi.

The presence of introns in many eukaryotes has been observed in fungi [25], including some of the most closely related fungal species. However, the number of introns found in fungi is low.
