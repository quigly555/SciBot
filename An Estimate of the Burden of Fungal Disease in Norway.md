Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The antifungal activity of the essential oils from Thymbra capitata and Thymus species (Proteaceae) were assessed in vitro using disk diffusion and disk diffusion assays. Thymbra species was the most reported species, followed by Thymus species, T. minutis, T. violida and T. schenckii. Thymbra species was not only reported for its antifungal activity, but also its chemical activity, such as T. stolonifera, T. stolonifera, T. violida and T. schenckii. Thymbra species was the most active in terms of anti-inflammatory activity against Candida albicans, a globally important human fungal pathogen. Thymbra species showed the most promising results and also had the most promising results in terms of antifungal activity.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella comprises an estimated about 200 species, mostly associated with asexual morphs, and the sexual morphs are responsible for causing diseases such as blast disease, scab disease, blast, perithecia, and pycnidioa (Dinan and Wilson, 2007; Wilson et al., 2007). In the past, asexual genera were classified as pycniacophytes, phytopathogenic fungi, or saprophytic or pathogenic fungi, depending on the anatomical location, morphological characteristics, and host (Dinan and Wilson, 2007). However, the release of a number of new genera and species in recent years and the growing number of sequenced genomes (Johnson et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013) has challenged the classification of Mycosphaerella and led to a considerable increase in the number of mycosphaerella-like species (Dinan and Wilson, 2007).

In recent years, several Mycosphaerella-like species have been reported associated with diseases in various plant hosts, including maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Nicotiana) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), wheat (Zymoseptoria graminis) and barley (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Wilson et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2013; Dang et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016). In these studies, several Mycosphaerella-like species have been isolated from plant tissues, including many from European and Asian cereals, which are considered to be important food crops in the Asian and African populations of these crops (Wilson et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2007; Dang et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016).


## Methods
The number of cases per million inhabitants per year was calculated from the formula: [per million inhabitants] Ã— 10. A standard deviation of the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year was calculated.

Assessment of the impact of non-specific mortality on fungal burden
The impact of non-specific mortality on the fungal burden in Norway was determined using a non-specific mortality rate method [24]. A general mortality rate (GIR) was calculated from the mortality rate calculated in the National Statistics System (NSS) [25]. The GIR for each year was calculated from the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year. The death rate for each year was calculated from the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year, divided by the total number of deaths per million inhabitants. The mortality rate for the following year was calculated from the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year. The GIR for the following year was calculated from the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year.

Assessment of the effect of non-specific mortality on the fungal burden in Norway
The effect of non-specific mortality on the fungal burden in Norway was assessed by the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year. The number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year was calculated from a population density curve (PD) [24]. The number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year was calculated.

Assessment of the impact of non-specific mortality on the fungal burden in Norway
To determine the effect of non-specific mortality on the fungal burden in Norway, we calculated the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year as the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year (the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year per year per year per year was calculated from the number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year per year per year per year, divided by the total number of deaths per million inhabitants per year per year per year per year).


## Results
The data were visualized by the publication dates of the studies and published reports, including the country, the month, and the year (Table 4. The number of studies reporting fungal infections in all locations was low, with the exception of the Danish case, where the prevalence was higher in the Netherlands, Finland, and the United States than the United Kingdom. The overall burden of fungal infections was significantly higher in the Netherlands than the United Kingdom. However, the incidence was higher in the United Kingdom than the United States, which is a country with high fungal burden. However, the incidence of fungal infections was lower in the United Kingdom than in the United Kingdom.

3.6. Parasite Reacts to Environmental Conditions
To test the hypothesis that environmental factors affect fungal infection, the number of animal-associated viruses was estimated by the publication date of the studies. The number of animal-associated viruses in the Netherlands was estimated by the publication date of the studies. The number of animal-associated viruses in the United Kingdom was estimated by the publication date of the studies. The number of animal-associated viruses in the United Kingdom was estimated by the publication date of the studies. The incidence of each animal-associated virus in a rat was estimated by the publication date of the studies.


## Discussion

This study provides a comprehensive review of the effect of climate change on fungal burden and disease in the sub-Antarctic regio. While many studies have focused on fungal disease in tropical and subtropical regions, our results indicate that climate change is not associated with reduced fungal burden in temperate regions. In particular, we found a strong association between temperature and fungal burden in temperate regions. Our results are in agreement with previous reports of temperate climate change affecting fungal burden in the Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula, which have shown that climate change is associated with increased fungal burden and disease.17,18,19 In addition, the Nordic countries, which are experiencing climate change, have a clear climate change advantage in fungal disease.20,21 Our results suggest that the climate change in Nordic countries is likely to be a driver of fungal disease in the Nordic area.

The results also support the hypothesis that climate change is likely to have a substantial effect on fungal burden in temperate regions. The studies that studied temperate climate change in Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsula have shown significant increases in fungal burden, disease, and fungal burden in temperate regions, and our results are consistent with these studies. However, the same study reported a significant decrease in fungal burden in temperate climates, suggesting that the impact of climate change on fungal burden and disease is different in temperate climates. In contrast, our results suggest that climate change is unlikely to be a significant driver of fungal burden in temperate climates.

Our results also suggest that climate change may be more severe in temperate climates, which are characterized by high salinity and temperature. These findings are similar to previous studies of temperate climates in the United States, where climate change was associated with increased fungal burden and disease.22,23 Our results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies, which have found that climate change was associated with increased fungal burden and disease in temperate climates.23,24,25 In our study, climate change was also associated with increased fungal burden in temperate climates. Our findings are also in agreement with previous studies in temperate climates.23,25 The results of our study suggest that climate change may be more severe in temperate climates, which are characterized by high salinity and temperature.
