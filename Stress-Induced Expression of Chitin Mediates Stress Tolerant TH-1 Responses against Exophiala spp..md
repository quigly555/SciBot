## Abstract
Candida glabrata is an emerging fungal pathogen that can cause infections ranging from superficial to life-threatening systemic and organ failure rates. However, its ability to thrive in diverse microenvironments is mediated by the transcription factor (TF) C-22 and its contribution to virulence remains poorly understood.

We report a novel mechanism whereby C. glabrata enhances the secreted protease Cdc11 to enhance pathogenicity in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Using a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, we show that Cdc11 is required for optimal growth and that a C. glabrata <U+0394>cdc11<U+0394> double mutant is more sensitive to the stresses of an acidic pH environment than wild-type strains. Cdc11 is essential for optimal pathogenicity in C. glabrata, by promoting survival within macrophages and, to a lesser extent, by facilitating proliferation within host cells. Cdc11-mediated pathogenicity in C. glabrata is critical for the virulence of C. glabrata strains that do not. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this factor is not required for infection of the human yeast form fusariumota in vitro, as virulence in the clinically-relevant murine model of systemic candidiasis was attenuated in a C. glabrata <U+0394>cdc11<U+0394> double mutant model. Our findings highlight a key role for C. glabrata as an opportunistic pathogen of humans, capable of modulating the pathogenicity of both humans and animals, through its transcription factors.


## Introduction
The genus of yeasts comprises 14 species [1]. Of the yeast species, only five species are pathogenic to humans. These are Pichia pastoris, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Nakaseella mucilaginosa [2]. Yeast infections are well known in the tropics, especially in Brazil [3, 4]. In the country, yeasts are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in immunosuppressed patients [5]. The pathogenicity of yeasts is based on three major features: their morphological transition from yeast to hyphae and the formation of flagellated structures at host internal organs [6]. The first feature is asexual reproduction and the second one is morphological transition. The pathogenicity of yeasts is based on the morphological transition and the ability of the yeast to form biofilms [7]. Biofilms are structured communities of cells of varying size and morphology that consist of cells that are attached to each other and to a surface. The formation of biofilm is required for the pathogenicity of yeast [8].

In the last decades, a number of studies have investigated the virulence of pathogenic yeasts. In this study, we investigated the morphological transition of the pathogenicity of the pathogen Candida albicans, in comparison to standard antifungal drugs. The results showed that C. albicans morphological transition was induced by macrophage infection and induced by inducing an oxidative burst at host internal organs. The pathogenicity of C. albicans is dependent on the cellular response to the stress imposed by the host. The C. albicans biofilm is characterized by an extracellular matrix composed of chitin, glucans, and chitin fibers [9].


## Methods
circinelloides in . circinelloides cell culture media [16]. The effect of drought stress was measured in three experiments. The pH of the media was adjusted to 5.5 before use. The media was grown at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm for 14 h. Then, 10 µL of a cell suspension (1 × 10^5 cells ml^-1) was pipetted into each well of a 96-well plate and the plate was incubated for 18 h at 37°C. The plate was then carefully washed with PBS before the addition of 1 µL of a-PAS solution (0.1 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mM ß-d-d-galactoside, and 1 µM p-nitrophenyl sorbitol). After a gentle shaking, the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then treated with 100 µL of M. circinelloides cell-conditioned media at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm for 18 h. The plates were then washed twice with PBS and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 µL of RPMI-1640 medium and treated with 100 µL of 5 mM MgCl_2. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 3 h and then at 37°C for 30 min. After the M. circinelloides culture media was aspirated, the culture supernatant was collected, and the M. circinelloides media was aspirated. The M. circinelloides media was then aspirated and the M. circinelloides cell culture media was aspirated. The M. circinelloides cell culture media was then removed and the pellet was resuspended in 3 µL of RPMI-1640 and the M. circinelloides cell culture media was aspirated. The plate was then centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the M. circinelloides cell culture media was discarded. The M.

## Discussion
melanogaster displayed a growth-inhibitory phenotyp. Using a cell-free control, we found that TH-1 immune cells treated with exogenous chitin-1, i.e., exogenous chitin-1, did not show a growth-inhibitory phenotype, despite the fact that the expression of the stress-tolerance genes was greatly increased. Furthermore, we found that TH-1 immune cells treated with exogenous chitin-1, i.e., exogenous chitin-1, also displayed a growth-inhibitory phenotype, even though the chitinase-producing strains produced significantly less chitin (Figure 3). Importantly, the concentration of chitin-1 required for the growth-inhibitory phenotype of TH-1 immune cells was the same as the control strain. This indicates that exogenous chitin-1 induces a transcriptional response that is similar to the cell-free control. This conclusion is supported by our previous work showing that exogenous chitin-1 induces the expression of a large number of stress-tolerance genes, including genes involved in the response to environmental stresses and protein synthesis, such as those involved in the stress response to infection and stress-response to stress-reflex stressors in the host (30).

Chitinase-mediated transcriptional regulation of stress-tolerance genes was previously reported to be complex and involve several proteins, including the expression of a number of stress-related genes. For example, the stress-related gene Aft1, which is involved in the response to cold stress, was previously reported to be expressed in TH-1 cells and treated with exogenous chitin-1 (31). In contrast to the chitin-1 and exogenous chitin-1, exogenous chitin-1 did not stimulate expression of Aft1 or any of the stress-related genes in TH-1 cells. Moreover, chitinase-mediated transcriptional response of TH-1 immune cells was previously reported to be induced by exogenous chitin-1, and this induced transcriptional response was then induced by exogenous chitin-1 (30).
