## Abstract
We report a case of Trichosporon fungemia caused by Trichosporon tomentosa in a immunocompromised host.

Trichosporon tomentosa is an important opportunistic fungus causing fungemia in immunocompromised individuals. The mechanism underlying the fungemia has been elucidated in some cases through different forms of hematological disease. In this report, we report the case of a 40-year-old immunocompetent male who presented to the emergency department with the appearance of abdominal pain, fever, myalgia, and weakness of the glomerulosic and metazoan skin on a fine imaging background. The peripheral blood CD4 count was abnormal, and the fungal smear culture of the patient was negative for growth of T. tomentosa. The patient was treated with systemic antifungal therapy (Impermeable) for 1 week.


## Introduction
An infectious microbe or pathogen can initiate infection by hiding its cell surface from the host immune syste. This means that the host cell can exploit the host cell’s defensive immune system to colonize it or to hinder its infection. The cell surface, called the cell wall, is an intimate organelle that facilitates communication between the immune system and the fungal cell. The cell wall is also a source of nutrients, as the host cell produces carbohydrates that are needed for the immune system to attack and kill its own bacteria. This interaction requires the activity of the immune system to protect the host cell from invasion by the pathogen. The cell surface, the cell wall and the secretory system, which are different from the secretory system, are found at different sites in the cell. The surface components include laminin, fibronectin, elastin, pectin, and gelatin. The presence of these components in cells also influences the process of host cell invasion. The secretory system contains protein components that are secreted to the cell surface and can function as a pump that is activated upon host recognition.

A variety of fungi produce polymers that are secreted by the cell surface. Some of these components include Fusarium graminearum, which is a basidiomycetous fungus that can produce pheomelanin and hyphae, and Ustilago maydis, which produces conidia. The secreted proteins include chitin, glucosinolates, peptidases, and pheromones. These components are secreted by a variety of fungal species to the extracellular environment. The production of secretory proteins is part of the cell wall structure of fungi and, therefore, the secretory system is important for the pathogenesis of fungal infections.

The secretory system of Cryptococcus neoformans is composed of a core core core protein family including glucosylceramide, sialyl-c-sialic acid, and the small GTPase S3. The core family proteins of C. neoformans includes glucosylceramide, glucosylceramide, chitin, sialyl-ceramide, and c-glycosylinositol (GPI). The S. cerevisiae cell wall consists of an acidic complex and glycoproteins.


## Methods
tuberculosis . typhimurium in mice, mice were randomly assigned to the groups S and H, which received the same treatment regimen. The mice were housed in a standardized area with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and the mice were monitored daily and sacrificed at the end of the experiment when the mice became moribund. The lung tissues of the mice were homogenized with 10 ml of 0.9% saline and the cell concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 10^6 CFU/ml. Mice were sacrificed at the time of the experiment and blood was collected by cardiac puncture at predetermined time points. At the end of the experiment, blood was collected from the right ventricle by cardiac puncture and centrifugation, and the whole blood was used for the experiments.

Mice were treated with the same treatment as the untreated group (control) at the indicated time points, except that the volume of the blood was 10 ml. The number of animals in the experimental group was calculated as the number of mice in the control group divided by the number of animals in the experimental group. The mice were sacrificed at the time of the experiment. The lung tissue was collected from the right ventricle by cardiac puncture and the number of animals in the experimental group was calculated as the number of mice in the control group divided by the number of animals in the experimental group.

Ethics Statement
The use of animals in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Institute of Medical Research and the IACUC (Protocol #2014-EEC-2010). The animal experiments were performed according to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental Procedures and were performed in accordance with the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for scientific purposes.

Virulence Assay
To determine the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis S. typhimurium in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (HBF) sample, the group of female BALB/c mice was inoculated with 5 × 10^5 CFU/ml of M. tuberculosis S. typhimurium. The BALB/c mice were monitored daily and sacrificed at the end of the experiment when the mice became moribund. The lungs were harvested, weighed, and homogenized with 5 ml of 0.


## Results
tuberculosis strains was studied in BALF and brain samples from three independent groups of mice infected with . tuberculosis strains. The M. tuberculosis strain was able to grow in the CNS and the brain in all groups. In the BALF group, the M. tuberculosis strains were able to produce an inflammatory response in the CNS and in the brain in all three groups. However, in the brain, the M. tuberculosis strains were unable to kill the host cells (Figure 2). The inflammatory response of the host cells was more pronounced in the brains than in the CNS, as was the response of the infected cells in all three groups. In addition, the CNS showed increased fungal burden in the brains compared to the brain (Figure 2).

In order to investigate the impact of M. tuberculosis on host cell functions, the expression of the M. tuberculosis gene MTLR2 was induced in both groups. In the brains, MTLR2 expression increased in the brain and in the CNS. In the brain, MTLR2 expression increased in the brain and in the CNS. In the brain, MTLR2 expression increased in the brain and in the CNS. In the brain, MTLR2 expression increased in the brain and in the CNS. MTLR2 expression was higher in the brain than in the CNS, as was the response of the infected cells in all three groups.

## Discussion
The lungs and the other respiratory tract are the major sites of infection and systemic infection are common, while the oral cavity and the skin are the sites of infectio. Mice are able to mount an infection in a murine model, and the mice have a longer survival time (10-15 days) compared to the mice infected with the wild type [27]. Furthermore, both the lung and the skin are highly susceptible to infection by C. albicans. This is in contrast to the brain where the mice have a very low survival time and the mice have a much higher infection rate (20-30 days vs. 1 day, respectively). It has been shown that C. albicans can cause chronic inflammation and inflammatory diseases in humans [28], while C. neoformans can cause chronic granulomatous inflammation and systemic infection in humans [29].

The high mortality of C. albicans and C. neoformans in mice treated with antibiotics is in line with previous reports [30]. C. albicans has been shown to be able to survive in the lungs of mice treated with antibiotics and in C. neoformans by injection into the alveoli [31]. C. albicans has been shown to survive in the lungs of mice treated with antibiotics and in C. neoformans by the injection into the alveoli [31]. In addition, C. albicans has been shown to survive in the blood of mice infected with C. neoformans by the injection into the alveoli [31]. In C. albicans, C. albicans is a major virulence factor in humans [32]. C. albicans is a natural host for human infections, and infections in humans usually result in an immune response that is deficient in the lungs and the brain [33]. Furthermore, infection in the brain of C. albicans is rare, but it has been reported in a few patients [34]. C. albicans has been found in a small number of animal models of human infections [35-37].

Mice and C. albicans are capable of colonizing and establishing infection in humans [27, 38]. In our study, the mice infected with C. albicans had a significantly higher percentage of viable C.
