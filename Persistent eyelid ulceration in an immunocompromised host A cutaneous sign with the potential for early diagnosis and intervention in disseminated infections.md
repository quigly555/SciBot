## Abstract
The theory of the causative role of enzymes involved in the synthesis of protein-degrading glycosylated polyketides (KEGG) was first proposed by the pioneering work of the late nineteenth century. Despite the significance of the concept, there is little information available on the production of KEGGs from glycoside hydrolases isolated from organisms with known antifungal activities, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichosporon oleaginosus. To determine the relative contributions of these enzymes in normal human keratinocytes and Candida glabrata, we screened the Pathogenicity Index (PFI) database for enzymes that produced KEGGs, including several uncharacterized examples of C. glabrata KEGG synthesis. These enzymes were identified to be phosphosylceramide (PK), pseudoseptoseptoseptide (PS), aspartyl sterol (SOD), indoleic Trichoderma castaneicola KEGG (ILK), indoleic ß-D-xylose, tyrosol, and phenol. Sixteen were selected on their antagonistic activities against the pathogenic fungi Candida glabrata and Cryptococcus neoformans, and their inhibitory effects against the non-targeted Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Candida auris. Two KEGGs were produced during the synthesis of ILK, which were most strongly affected by temperature and pH. We also identified two KEGGs that were involved in the virulence response in the Galleria mellonella model, and these enzymes were subsequently tested in vivo for their participation in this model. The ability of these enzymes to produce KEGGs in human keratinocytes is an interesting finding given the known antagonism between these glycosylated polyketides and the natural antifungal drug FK506.


## Introduction
The genus Eucalyptus is one of the most important plant and animal genera, with more than 2000 species, many of which are important edible mushrooms. Eucalyptus species are common in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide and, because of their inconspicuous size, the genus is highly prized. The species are used for the production of edible mushrooms.

The genus Eucalyptus contains about 12 species. Many of them are edible, which are found in tropical regions worldwide. Eucalyptus species are widely distributed in temperate regions of the world, such as the Northern Hemisphere, and particularly in Asia, Australia, Africa, and North America.

The genus Eucalyptus contains about 70 species. Some are of commercial importance, such as E. tannii, E. ancorus, E. fusca, E. spinulosa, E. poleofri, and E. restanci, which are distributed in Asia, Europe, and North America [1,2]. The species in the genus Eucalyptus are often misidentified as other species. For example, E. spinulosa is misidentified as E. spinulosa [3], and E. ancorus as E. poleofri, E. restanci, and E. poleofri are misidentified as E. restanci [4]. The genus Eucalyptus has three species, namely E. spinulosa, E. spinulosa, and E. spinulosum. The species in the genus Eucalyptus are commonly misidentified as other species. For example, E. spinulosa is misidentified as E. spinulosa, and E. spinulosum is misidentified as E. spinulosum. Species in the genus Eucalyptus are commonly misidentified as other species. For example, E. spinulosa is misidentified as E. spinulosa, and E. spinulosum is misidentified as E. spinulosum.

The genus Eucalyptus has two accepted species, E. spinulosa and E. spinulosum. The species in the genus Eucalyptus are widely misidentified as other species. For example, E. spinulosa and E. spinulosum are misidentified as E.


## Methods
Study design
We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with cryptococcosis who were treated at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and were seen in the first 3 months of 2012. The data were collected at the onset of the first episode of cryptococcosis, and the clinical characteristics were recorded. The use of cryptococcal meningitis treatment was approved by the ethics committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The cryptococcosis case was defined as a clinical episode of cryptococcosis and the treatment was performed according to the guidelines of the Clinical Management of Cryptococcosis of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1998.

Participants
A retrospective study was performed using a case-control study. The study was conducted by a resident of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and was approved by the ethics committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All patients were evaluated by the treating physician of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the diagnosis of cryptococcosis was confirmed by the pathologist. All patients were informed about the study and signed a written statement confirming their informed consent.


## Results
The ulcerative lesions on the upper surface of the spleens of immunocompromised hosts were most likely caused by bacterial or viral infections; however, the ulcerative lesions were also commonly caused by parasite. A recent study of a pediatric immunocompromised patient with ulcerative lesions on the spleens of a highly immunosuppressed patient showed that the lesion size was about 16-16 × 6-8 µm [39]. It is possible that the ulcerative lesions on the spleens of immunocompromised hosts were caused by a pathogen or by opportunistic infection. It is important to mention that the ulcerative lesions were much smaller than those on the spleens of immunosuppressed hosts. There are several studies in the literature reporting that opportunistic infections of immunocompetent hosts caused by parasites or other opportunistic agents have been reported in immunocompromised patients. For example, the virus-associated infections caused by Chagas virus and chagas virus are both believed to be secondary to human disease caused by Chagas [40]. Furthermore, human disease caused by a large number of Chagas viruses and chagases have been reported in immunocompromised patients in the past [40].

The ulcerative lesions on the spleens of immunocompromised hosts were generally caused by a bacterium or yeast, and usually were associated with an inflammatory lesion. In some studies, the ulcerative lesions were also found on the spleens of immunocompromised patients. For example, there are reports that the ulcerative lesions on the spleens of immunocompromised patients are associated with an inflammatory disease and that the parenchyma can be caused by a bacterium or a yeast [40]. It is also important to mention that the ulcerative lesions on the spleens of immunocompromised patients were often associated with an inflammatory disease and that the parenchyma can be caused by other pathogens. In another study, the ulcerative lesions on the spleens of immunocompromised patients were associated with other bacterial and viral infections [40].


## Discussion
We have presented a case of patient with CMV encephalitis after ingestion of a large capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected adults [5]. In this patient, a significant increase in the temperature during the day and the patient's immune status were observed, which is in contrast to previous reports that it is not uncommon for Cryptococcus neoformans to occur in HIV-infected patients [6]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen and occurs in nearly all clinical settings, including patients with HIV infection. Cryptococcus neoformans infections are mostly found in the lungs and other body sites, although there have been reports of Cryptococcus neoformans in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract of HIV-infected individuals [7]. Cryptococcus neoformans can also be found in the gut of other human and non-human immunocompromised patients, such as immunocompetent patients and those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [8]. In contrast to other opportunistic infections, Cryptococcus infection has been identified in a wide range of immunocompetent individuals, including the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus [9]. Cryptococcus neoformans has been also reported to cause invasive infections in patients with immunocompromised states such as those with HIV infection and those with CMV encephalitis [10]. It has also been reported that Cryptococcus can cause a transient and chronic form of the disease, which is often fatal, and that it is significantly more virulent than Cryptococcus neoformans in immunocompetent hosts [11].

Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare cause of meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected individuals [12]. It has been reported that there is no report of cryptococcosis in patients with HIV infection. We have reported the case of an HIV-infected patient with CMV encephalitis after ingestion of a large capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected individuals [5]. It is also a cause of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent individuals [13].
