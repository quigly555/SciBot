## Abstract
The traditional use of mushrooms and their products in traditional medicine and their abuse are of great concern in the scientific community, particularly due to the possibility of cross-contamination. The aim of this work was to elucidate the interaction between yeasts and phytopathogens, and to determine the influence of yeasts isolated from different medicinal plants on the expression of surface-secretome 2 (PS2) and its regulatory pathways. PS2 and the transcription factor Spch1 were isolated from the phytopathogenic fungus Sphingobium sp. and purified. Subsequently, a series of phenotypes of PS2 were detected, especially the ability to stimulate the expression of secreted protein kinases and its active site. The functions of PS2 were mostly in the regulation of the phospholipid-biking and phosphotransferases, especially the induction of surface active sites. In particular, Spch1 was involved in signal transduction, especially the production of the high osmolality-attenuated ovo-inhibitor, zethromethanesulfonate (ZTSA). The expression of PS2 and Spch1 was induced during the late phase of growth and it was shown that ZTSA was important for the induction of the active site. The regulation of PS2 was also changed during the transition from vegetative growth to hyphal growth. Moreover, the expression patterns of PS2 and Spch1 were different during vegetative growth compared to hyphal growth. These data suggest that Spch1 is a potential target for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by fungi, such as SpchA and SpchD, or its indirect impact on the expression of the active sites.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. CNS cryptococcosis can be acquired from environmental sources, including bird excrements and bird droppings, or from animal droppings or soil, and rarely is it from environmental sources such as human beings [1]. C. neoformans and C.


## Methods
It is one of the major sources of lipids and can be used for the treatment of various infections [5. It is also a source of essential fatty acids that can be used for the treatment of many infectious diseases [6, 7].

2.5. Lipid Extraction
The reduction of lipids in the lysing solution in the presence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NACD) was performed as described previously [8]. In brief, the lysing solution was adjusted to pH 3.0 with NaOH and then stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was cooled to room temperature and used for the determination of NACD level by alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) using a Shimadzu LC-20i HPLC system equipped with a C18 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 with NaOH and then adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH before use. The gradient of NACD was then set to 50% for 0 min, then to 40% for 1 min and to 80% for 4 min with a flow rate of 1 mL min^-1, followed by a 3-min blank injection. The samples were injected at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min^-1. The lipid content in each fraction was calculated by the equation:

2.6. Inhibition of O_2 and K_2DCF
In order to determine the antagonistic effect of O_2 and K_2DCF on pulmonary infection of rice twigs, the in vitro in vitro growth of the fungus was conducted as previously described [9, 10]. The inoculum was prepared by growing rice twigs at 30°C in a shaker (180 rpm) for 5 days, followed by harvesting with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 80) and lysis was performed by adding 100 µL of 1% NP-40 (pH 4.5) and then incubating at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 g for 10 min, 4°C) and washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.


## Results
Trans fatty acids are essential oils and can affect the metabolism and physical and biochemical properties of the cel. Some of these trans fatty acids have been shown to be associated with virulence factors in the pathogenic fungi, including pathogenic development [27-29], [30], [31]. Several trans fatty acids are also active against Gram-negative bacteria, but their role remains to be determined. In addition, trans fatty acids are also able to modulate the expression of the virulence factors that are related to the pathogenic development of the host. Moreover, the trans fatty acid and their trans fatty acid derivatives have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects [32], [33], [34], [35].

Trans fatty acids have been shown to have antifungal and fungicidal properties against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. krusei-HBV, and C. krusei-M-15 [36]. Trans fatty acids were shown to possess antifungal activity against the species of Candida [37], Candida glabrata [38], C. krusei [39], C. krusei-HBV [40], C. albicans [41], and C. glabrata [42], as well as against the human pathogen Candida krusei [43], [44].

Trans fatty acids have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects [37], anti-inflammatory effects [37], anti-tuberculosis effects [45], anti-tuberculosis effects [46], and anti-tuberculosis effects [47], [48].

Trans fatty acids have also been shown to have antifungal and fungicidal properties against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei-HBV, and C. krusei-M-15 [35], [36]. These data indicate that trans fatty acids have antifungal and fungicidal properties against these fungi.

3.3. Evaluation of Antifungal Activity of Trans Fatty Acid Compounds
Taken together, the above results suggest that the trans fatty acid derivatives studied here have antifungal and fungicidal properties against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C.
