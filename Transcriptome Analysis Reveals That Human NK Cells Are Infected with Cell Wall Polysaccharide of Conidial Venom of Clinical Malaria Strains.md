## Abstract
The invasive growth of Cryptococcus gattii, the etiological agent of cryptococcosis, is controlled by the activation of a specific transcription factor (Tfg1). A C. gattii <U+0394>ccc mutants that are haploidentical, lacking the N-terminal guanine-containing cDNAs, were obtained by employing amino acid substitutions and genetic engineering to enhance Tfg1 function. The increased rate of intracellular replication of C. gattii <U+0394>ccc mutants in the presence of the Tmr1 protein resulted in an ~20-fold decrease in survival following intracellular infection. These results demonstrated that the enhanced Tmr1 function, along with the enhanced intracellular replication ability of the <U+0394>ccc mutants, could be important for controlling cryptococcosis progression.


## Introduction
Melanins are small, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, oxidized or otherwise insoluble pigments that are produced by diverse microbial species. They are characterized by high redox potential, high desaturation and low permeability due to their abundant, hydrophobic, non-protein and hydrophobic nature [1]. Melanin is mainly produced by the microbial species Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus megachikaryensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus subtilis jensenii, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus subtilis jensenii, Bacillus megachikaryensis, Bacillus megachikaryensis, Bacillus megachikaryensis and Bacillus subtilis [2], [3]. In addition, melanins can be synthesized by some microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Langerhans cells [4], [5].

Melanins are abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of all fungi [6], [7]. The ECM is composed of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, such as chitin and glucans, which are attached to the cell wall.


## Methods
We purified RNA using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA synthesis was performed using a PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Microscopy
Dendritic cells (100 µl) were seeded on glass slides (5 × 10^4 cells/well) and cultured for 4 days at 37°C in medium containing 1% (w/v) non-essential amino acids, 20% (w/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (w/v) endotoxin. After 4 days, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 2 h. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After the addition of 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, the slides were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica, Münster, Germany).

## Results
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) was identified between the single nucleotide polymorphism in the single nucleotide polymorphism in the ITS region and the nuclear localization (Figure 2A. A reciprocal 97% SNP was identified between the nucleotide polymorphism in the single nucleotide polymorphism in the ITS region and the nuclear localization (Figure 2A). Thus, NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide from clinical isolates, as well as from clinical isolates of other virulence pathogens, are derived from NK cells.

To further investigate the pathogenicity of NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide from clinical isolates, we isolated single and double positive NK cells from clinical isolates at day 7, day 14, and day 21 of the study. We identified single nucleotide polymorphism in the genome sequence between the single nucleotide polymorphism in the single nucleotide polymorphism in the ITS region and the nuclear localization (Figure 2B). A reciprocal 97% SNP was identified between the nucleotide polymorphism in the single nucleotide polymorphism in the ITS region and the nuclear localization (Figure 2B). Thus, NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide from clinical isolates, as well as from clinical isolates of other virulence pathogens, are derived from NK cells.

NK Cell Wall Polysaccharide Is Associated with Cryptococcus neoformans Biofilm Formation in the Culture Media
NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide may be associated with fungal biofilm formation in the culture media. To determine the fungal biofilm forming ability of NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide, we assessed the fungal biofilm formation ability of NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide at the end of the culture media. As shown in Figure 3A, NK cell derived cell wall polysaccharide produced a higher number of colonies at the end of the culture media (10.2%), which was consistent with the above observations.


## Discussion
The cytosolic secretome of . albicans was sequenced and compared to mammalian macrophages. The total number of secreted proteins in the secretome of C. albicans is 31.2%, which is much higher than the total number of proteins secreted in the secretome of C. albicans (21.4%) (Figs. 6 and 7). The C. albicans secretome is very similar to that of C. neoformans, which is comparable to the total number of proteins secreted in the C. neoformans secretome (30.6%) (Figs. 7 and 8). In addition, the secretome of C. neoformans was similar to that of C. albicans (29.6%) (Figs. 7 and 8). The secretome of C. neoformans was not as large as the C. albicans secretome. The total number of secreted proteins was 25.4%, which is much higher than that of C. albicans (22.2%) (Figs. 7 and 8). The C. neoformans secretome is comparable to that of C. albicans (20.0%) (Figs. 7 and 8). In addition, the C. neoformans secretome was significantly smaller than that of C. albicans (22.0%) (Figs. 6 and 7). This suggests that the C. albicans secretome contains much more proteins than C. albicans.

The complete secretome of C. albicans was compared to that of C. neoformans. The total number of secreted proteins in C. albicans is 35.1%, which is much higher than that of C. neoformans (14.0%) (Figs. 4 and 5). The C. albicans secretome is similar to that of C. neoformans (28.8%) (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, the C. neoformans secretome was significantly smaller than that of C. albicans (29.8%) (Figs. 4 and 5). The C. albicans secretome is similar to that of C. neoformans (25.4%) (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, the C. albicans secretome was significantly smaller than that of C.
