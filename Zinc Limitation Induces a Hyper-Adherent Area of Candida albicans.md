## Abstract
Fungal infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. These conditions can complicate fungal treatment options and have the potential to affect liver transplant patients more so than other immunocompromised patients. The use of agents that act on the cell wall integrity of the liver is the cornerstone of the treatment of fungal diseases, including disseminated infection. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the role of cell wall integrity (CWI) in antifungal drug susceptibility and in the evolution of resistance to antifungal drugs.


## Introduction
Bacterial infections have become a significant problem of life in the clinic over the past 30 years and today, the mortality rate is estimated to be over one million deaths per year [1]. The first line of antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected or confirmed human pathogenic bacteria is the administration of amphotericin B, a broad-spectrum antibiotic [2]. Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to name a few [3]. The activity of amphotericin B against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria has been described in vitro and in vivo. Amphotericin B is active against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria, including K. pneumoniae, and it has also been shown that amphotericin B may also inhibit the growth of the most aggressive Gram-negative pathogen, E. coli, in the presence of antibiotics such as rifampin [4,5].


## Methods
albicans is a class II or III monocytic, we performed quantitative PCR on the cDNA of . albicans strains, using the standard yeast-phase PCR procedure as described by Puchar et al. (2015). Briefly, PCR amplification of the ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions was performed using primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and the primers LR0R and LR5 (Vilgalys & Hester 1990). The PCR program consisted of a denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 55°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. The specificity of the PCR product was confirmed using an agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified products. The amplification products were purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The purified products were then treated with DNA-free™ FastAP^TM (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and the product was directly sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).

Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed as described by Yung et al. (2016) using the primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). The PCR program consisted of a denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, annealing at 54°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. The specificity of the PCR product was confirmed using an agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified products. The product was subjected to a nested PCR using primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). The PCR program consisted of a denaturation at 94°C for 10 min, annealing at 56°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 5 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.


## Results
albican. We focused on a candidate in our analysis. The presence of SDS-conjugated l-arginine, which is an antimicrobial peptide, is known to be associated with hyper-adherentness. To test the hypothesis that the observation of hyper-adherentity could be due to the presence of L-arginine, we analyzed the presence of L-arginine in C. albicans, a nonpathogenic fungal pathogen, and then examined whether the hyper-adherent phenotype was associated with a different peptide, l-arginine. L-arginine was present in a concentration-dependent manner in both C. albicans and C. glabrata, but was absent in C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. The addition of L-arginine to the L-arginine concentration-dependent manner did not result in a hyper-adherent phenotype (Fig 2). However, when the concentration of L-arginine was doubled to 10^4-fold that of the initial concentration, a hyper-adherent phenotype was observed in C. albicans and C. glabrata (Fig 2). Thus, L-arginine was detected in both C. albicans and C. glabrata.

Hyper-Adherentity of C. albicans Caused a Double-Blind Infiltration of Candida Cells
To further analyze the mechanism of hyper-adherentity, we next investigated the effect of L-arginine on the proliferation of C. albicans cells. L-arginine was added to C. albicans cells prior to the addition of L-arginine to normal cells to generate a double-blind approach.


## Discussion
In this study, the level of Ca^2+ in the brain was significantly increased in the presence of . capsulatum. In addition, we found that H. capsulatum actively secreted extracellular Ca^2+ and that H. capsulatum induced the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain.

In this study, the level of Ca^2+ in the brain was significantly increased in the presence of H. capsulatum. This study showed that H. capsulatum induced the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain. These results are in line with the previous study, which showed that H. capsulatum induced extracellular Ca^2+ in the brain [19].

Furthermore, we found that the level of the extracellular Ca^2+ was significantly increased in the brain of H. capsulatum infected mice. We found that H. capsulatum was able to induce the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain. H. capsulatum was able to induce the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain. H. capsulatum was able to induce the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain. These results are in line with the previous study, which suggested that H. capsulatum was able to induce extracellular Ca^2+ in the brain [19].

In our previous study, we found that H. capsulatum induced the extracellular Ca^2+ in the brain. In addition, we found that H. capsulatum was able to induce the extracellular Ca^2+ in the brain. The results of the current study indicate that the extracellular Ca^2+ is induced in the brain.

However, the mechanism by which H. capsulatum induces the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain is not known. The H. capsulatum is able to induce extracellular Ca^2+ in the brain. It is possible that the extracellular Ca^2+ is not required to induce the extracellular Ca^2+ concentration in the brain. The mechanism by which H.
