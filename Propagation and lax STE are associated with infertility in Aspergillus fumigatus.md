## Abstract
In this study, we report the case of a post-transplant presenting with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed acute lymphocytic leukemia (IFNIL) after initiation of HA therapy. A patient had been treated with a high-dose of prednisone. Prior to the initiation of HA, he developed focal subacute lymphoblastic leukoencephalopathy and was treated with dexamethasone. Three months later, he developed focal subacute lymphoblastic leukoencephalopathy and was treated with a high-dose of prednisone. Both he and the patient were on corticosteroids. According to the results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the A. fumigatus IFNIL was elevated. The patient was treated with combination of prednisone and corticosteroids. A positive serum antibody response was observed on day 4 and he was started on maintenance therapy with prednisone. At day 18, he developed focal subacute lymphoblastic leukoencephalopathy and was treated with a high-dose of prednisone. According to the results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the leukoencephalopathy was markedly increased. He recovered rapidly after the treatment with corticosteroids and steroids. Clinicians should consider IFNIL raised in a RA patient given prior to treatment with prednisone, especially for focal subacute lymphoblastic leukoencephalopathy. A high index of suspicion should be given IFNIL raised in a patient with IFNIL raised in a patient with RA, even in a non-HIV patient.


## Introduction
Over the last decades, a number of studies have demonstrated that autophagy is crucial for maintaining host homeostasis, immunity and growth, and pathogenesis [1-3]. In the course of this research, it was found that disruption of the autophagy pathway leads to defects in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can be triggered by various pathogens [4,5].

The immune response to infections is generally not well defined and depends on the type of immune cell. In particular, the innate immune system is characterized by the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are highly reactive molecules that play important roles in innate defense and are able to counteract invading pathogens and protect the host from damage. AMPs are expressed as pathogen-derived peptides (PDPs), which are produced as part of the innate immune response to pathogens [6-11].

The innate immune system is composed of the two cell types of the macrophage and the neutrophil class, which are both important for the infection of pathogens. The macrophage is the main source of IFN-<U+03B3> and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which helps in the eradication of the pathogen by the neutrophil. Therefore, the innate immune system is divided into two main classes, class I and class II [12-15]. Class I molecules are produced by the cell and are synthesized as a specialized class I IFN-ß by the enzyme IFN-ß, and then they are released as apoptotic cells. The class II molecules are produced by the cell and are produced by the neutrophil and are produced in an apoptotic fashion. Therefore, the class I molecules are involved in the eradication of the pathogen.


## Methods
Aspergillus fumigatus infection in women was estimated to be caused by one or more of the following: a) vaginal yeast, b) vaginal yeast, or c) vaginal yeas. The samples were taken from a different part of the vagina as detailed in [17]. The infection was carried out by oral gavage and was performed as described by Zajjar et al. [18]. The vagina was kept moist and disinfected with 70% alcohol and then the samples were inoculated by inoculation into Sabouraud's dextrose broth (SDA) at room temperature. The yeast inoculated in 50% DMSO were used as control. The samples were stored at 4 °C for up to 48 h. The samples were also considered positive if the cells grew rapidly.

Inoculum preparation
The conidial suspension of Candida parapsilosis (S2A) was prepared from 1 × 10^6 conidia/mL of the stock suspension of Penicillium campestris (S2B) and was diluted to 10^3 conidia/mL with sterile distilled water. The solution was poured into a sterile 96-well plate and 100 µL of this suspension was added to the other 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then the cells were collected. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and the number of viable cells was counted using the comparative cell count method [19]. The conidial suspension was divided into two parts. The first part was used to inoculate the well and the second part was used to inoculate the test tubes. The inoculated test tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then 100 µL of the conidial suspension was added to each well. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were collected and the counts were calculated. The conidial suspension was divided into three parts. The first part was used to inoculate the test tubes and the second part was used to inoculate the test tube. The inoculated test tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then 100 µL of the conidial suspension was added to each well. The test tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, 100 µL of the conidial suspension was added to each well and the wells were sealed. The number of viable cells was counted and the conidial suspension was divided into three parts.


## Results
Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of septa in septa-less strains is associated with the occurrence of degenerate spindle-shaped inseminata [12. However, the analysis of septal morphology revealed that in all the strains, the mother cell produced a defined spindle. However, when the septal shape of the spindle was normal in the septalless strains, the number of septa was very variable. In S. pombe, the average number of septa is 27, whereas the average number of the centromere in S. cerevisiae is 19 (7). Interestingly, in S. pombe, the average number of centromeric regions is 36. In S. pombe, the average number of centromeric regions is 20 in S. cerevisiae, 18 in S. pombe, and 24 in S. pombe. In the presence of high salt, the average number of centromeric regions in S. pombe is 20, whereas the average number of centromeric regions in S. cerevisiae is 20. In S. pombe, the average number of centromeric regions is 26 in S. cerevisiae, 21 in S. pombe, and 16 in S. pombe. In the presence of high salt, the average number of centromeric regions is 27, whereas the average number of centromeric regions in S. cerevisiae is 21. In addition, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are one of the most cosmopolitan eukaryotic organisms on earth. In contrast, in S. pombe, the average number of centromeric regions is 30 in S. cerevisiae, 25 in S. pombe, and 21 in S. pombe. In addition, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are one of the most cosmopolitan eukaryotic organisms on earth. Furthermore, the number of septal pores in the septalless strains was similar to those of the mother cell in all the strains. Moreover, the number of septal pores in S. pombe is also similar to that of S. cerevisiae. In S. pombe, the average number of septal pores is 24 in S. pombe, 23 in S. cerevisiae, and 22 in S. pombe.


## Discussion
neoforman. Also, STEs are essential for pathogenesis in C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis [26,27].

The homology models proposed in this work were established through previous studies. For example, in C. albicans, the STE1 gene was found to be involved in cell wall integrity and pathogenicity, and the STE3 gene was found to be involved in pathogenicity and virulence [21,27]. STE3 encodes a protein that physically interacts with a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in cellular membrane integrity and cell differentiation [29]. STE3 is also required for the formation of a homogeneous plasma membrane, which is essential for cell survival in stressful conditions [30]. The current study further showed that STE3 has an important role in the cell wall integrity and pathogenicity of C. neoformans. The proteins in the C. neoformans homologs STE3 and STE3D are found to interact with the cell wall integrity and pathogenicity, respectively, as well as in the host response to infection and virulence. The STE3 gene showed an essential role in pathogenicity and virulence. This result indicates that STE3 is a key factor in the cell wall integrity and pathogenicity of C. neoformans.

The current results show that STE3 is required for virulence in C. neoformans. The only exception was STE3D, which was found to be essential for pathogenicity in C. albicans. These results suggest that C. neoformans STE3 might play an important role in pathogenicity and virulence.
