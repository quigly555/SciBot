## Abstract
Many pathogens utilize extracellular and in vitro antifungal drug resistance to host-selectively kill their target cells. Calcineurin, a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase, is a central component of the signaling machinery for pathogenicity. In this study, we identified a novel, ortholog of C. neoformans calcineurin and a putative FKBP homolog in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. The FKBP homolog belongs to a KIN16 family protein complex composed of nine subunits that is conserved in animals, fungi, protists, protozoa, and helminths.


## Introduction
The use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as agents to treat microbial infections is a widely accepted paradigm in medicine. AMPs target microbial cell membrane potential and are the principal components of bacterial membranes. The biosynthesis of membrane-bound peptides involves a number of processes including membrane biogenesis, membrane biogenesis by endocytosis, membrane biogenesis by endoproteolysis, and membrane biogenesis by endocytosis [1,2].


## Methods
Cell lines and plasmids
Human cell lines used in this study were originally derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) embryonic kidney (HEK) and human embryonic kidney carcinoma (HEJ) lines (LIVE/DEAD, Cell Bank of New Jersey, Rutgers University, and NIH Instat, NIH). Human lines and plasmids used in this study were derived from embryonic stem cells (ESC) from the human embryonic kidney (HEK) and human embryonic kidney carcinoma (HEJ) lines (Boehringer Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Germany).

Fungal strains, media, and growth conditions
The cell lines and plasmids used in this study were cultured in the presence of L. donovani KN99a, L. donovani IEC 9073, and L. monocytogenes 567F, L. monocytogenes 567R, and L. monocytogenes 653F.

## Discussion
Fusarium species are found in tropical, subtropical, temperate, and tropical area. Fusarium species are most often found in subtropical and temperate regions. They are particularly found in subtropical regions such as the Atlantic Ocean, South Atlantic, and Antarctic regions. The distribution of Fusarium species is also restricted to temperate and tropical regions, as reported in the International Joint Network for the Study of the Fungal Communities in the Pacific Northwest of USA [23].

Fusarium species are commonly found in soil, vegetation, animals, and plants, including humans and mice. Fusarium species occur in diverse environmental niches such as soil, the air, water, and human bodies [24]. In this study, we found the occurrence of Fusarium species in soil and soil associated with outdoor activity, recreational activities, and human activity. The occurrence of Fusarium species in soil and the surrounding environment may be a result of the interaction between Fusarium species and soil fungi. Additionally, the occurrence of Fusarium species in the soil and the surrounding environment may be due to the action of soil fungi, such as the genus Cladosporium, which are known to be capable of degrading the plant epiphytes of plants [25].

Fusarium species are often associated with plants and other soil microorganisms, and they are dominant in soil ecosystems, where they are considered a dominant group in soil ecosystems [26]. Additionally, Fusarium species have been reported in soil ecosystems of other eukaryotes, such as Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and in the plant roots of many plants and fungi.

The distribution of Fusarium species in soil environments is currently unknown, but their presence in soil environments has been reported in a wide range of fungi, including C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger [27]. Fusarium species are mostly found in soil environments, with only a few isolated species in human skin and lung [28]. In the present study, we identified a total of 63 Fusarium species in the current study. These species are frequently associated with plants and other soil microorganisms.
