## Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different cold-adapted growth media (DM) on the fungal burden and survival of healthy rats. Healthy rats were intragastrically inoculated with yeasts of the genus Coccidioides and received either a typical DM of -0.5 °C or -1 °C. The intragastrature cell counts and colony counts were determined by a microscopy method. For C. albicans, a positive differential immunophenotyping result was obtained. For C. glabrata, a negative immunophenotyping result was obtained. A positive correlation was detected between the two counts. A statistically significant difference in the counts was observed between the DM and DM, but not between the DM and DM plus scandinized keratin was observed between the DM and DM plus keratin. In conclusion, the DM was found to have an antibacterial effect on C. albicans, but not on other fungi. Future studies using whole genome sequencing might provide a better understanding of this effect and its possible modulatory effect on the host immune response.


## Introduction

The host defense system consists of the defense and inflammation mechanisms of the immune system against invading microbial pathogen. The immune system has three main immune cells that each can use different mechanisms to fight against microbial infection: the innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, and the adaptive immune cells, such as the adaptive lymphocytes and macrophages, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (Bin et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Mora et al., 2009). In contrast, the host defense system can be divided into two types of mechanisms, adaptive immunity, which activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) to mount an effective antimicrobial response against the pathogen, and non-activated immunity, which activate macrophages and dendritic cells to produce antimicrobial effectors. The responses of innate and adaptive immune cells are different and differ in how they respond to different pathogens. For example, the innate cell type (iNLC) and the adaptive cell type (iNCR) both present with the same antimicrobial effector molecules. The iNLC- and iNCR-derived peptides are the best known and most well-characterized types of antimicrobial peptides. Both types of peptides have a cytotoxic activity and the iNLC- and iNCR-derived peptides have antimicrobial activity. The recent clinical trial of diclofenac sodium (DDT) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with mucormycosis demonstrated the use of this agent for treatment of mucormycosis (Moyers et al., 2012). The DDDT has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mucormycosis and other mucormycosis (Lagopodiou et al., 2008). The mechanism of action of the peptide depends on the immune response of the host. In the case of the iNLC, its cytotoxic activity involves the release of antimicrobial peptides from the iNLC and their antimicrobial activity has been shown to be related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Tang et al., 2010). Antimicrobial peptides and their derivatives also have a non-canonical mechanism of action.


## Methods

We have compiled a list of 145 clinically important factors that influence the susceptibility to fungal growth in humans [17]. These include: 1) aerobic (Level 1), 2) aerobic (Level 2), 3) aerobic (Level 3), and 4) non-aerobic (Level 4), 5) moderate (Level 6), and 6) moderate (Level 7).

2.1. Probability of Resistance
We determined whether the organism was susceptible to fungal growth by performing three independent experiments. First, we investigated whether there were any negative effects due to the growth of the organism on the susceptible hosts. The organisms were grown on the susceptible hosts for seven days. Aflatoxins were added to the culture medium to inhibit the growth of the organisms. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that the organism was resistant to fungal growth on the susceptible hosts. The organisms were grown on the susceptible hosts for seven days. The fungi were collected by centrifugation, washed and inoculated on the susceptible hosts with a solution of 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 to inhibit the growth of the fungi. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 14 days. Thirdly, we examined the hypothesis that the organism was resistant to the growth on the susceptible hosts. The organisms were grown on the susceptible hosts for seven days. The fungi were collected by centrifugation and washed with sterile water to remove the Tween 20. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 14 days.

2.2. Inoculum Preparation
Aflatoxin suspension was prepared by inoculating the bacterial suspension on the susceptible hosts. The samples were placed on plastic filter paper (Sartorius, Germany) and poured onto the solid medium. The inocula were prepared by adding an equal volume of sterile water to the filter paper. The filter paper was placed on a sterile filter paper and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for seven days. The percentage of growth inhibition of the fungi on the filter paper was calculated according to the following formula:

2.3. Inoculum Preparation
Ten milliliters of the inoculum was diluted in sterile saline solution and spread on the susceptible hosts at 10-15 cm length. The infected host was allowed to develop for seven days.

## Discussion
The results provide new insights into the relationship between the two ubiquitous plant pathogens, Aspergillus and Penicilliu.

The relative abundance of P. expansum was highest in the soil of a high altitude (32,000 m) and lowest in the soil of a low altitude (25,000 m). P. expansum was distributed over 13,700 km from their sites of origin (Figure 2). It was the most abundant pathogen on P. expansum in this study (Figure 2). The findings of this study have provided important new information about the distribution of pathogenicity in the fungal community.

Pseudocercospora was the most abundant fungus on P. expansum (Figure 2). This species was also the most abundant fungus on P. expansum and P. heterosporum in the soil of the same altitudinal gradient (Figure 3). In this study, we have identified a new pathogen of P. expansum and demonstrated that P. expansum may be a major environmental fungal pathogen.

The distribution of this pathogen on P. expansum and P. heterosporum is similar to previous studies on fungal communities in soil and air [17,19,21]. This finding allows us to identify a new host genus on P. expansum. The highest abundance of P. expansum in soil is associated with Pinus multiflorus (Figure 2). The tree species P. multiflorus was first identified on P. expansum [22]. Although P. multiflorus was originally identified on P. expansum and P. heterosporum in South America [23], its distribution is now reported on P. expansum in Europe. P. multiflorus is the causal agent of the black spot disease of pomegranate, a sweetpotato in Spain [24]. The pathogenicity of P. expansum is still poorly understood, but a new species is being investigated.

The second most abundant fungus on P. expansum in the soil of a high altitude (25,000 m) was Aspergillus niger. This species was also the most abundant fungus on P. expansum and P. heterosporum in the soil of a low altitude (25,000 m) and the soil of a low altitude (25,000 m).
