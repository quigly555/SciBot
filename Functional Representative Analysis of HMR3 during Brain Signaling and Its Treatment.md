## Abstract
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of the two anti-Salmonella agents against Salmonella Typhi in Galleria mellonella and Escherichia coli in the Galleria experiments.

The two anti-Salmonella agents, MIC50 and MIC90, were used in the Galleria experiments. The two agents were mostly already reported for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in humans. The two anti-Salmonella agents were mostly already reported for the treatment of E. faecalis infection in mice. In the Galleria experiments, both agents were given to mice for 30 days, and the mice were infected with Salmonella.

Both anti-Salmonella agents were most effective against the serotype A Escherichia coli. The highest minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for both agents against Salmonella. The highest minimum fungicidal concentrations were obtained for Salmonella. The MIC50 values were MIC90 values of the agents against all the serotypes.

The findings of the present study demonstrated the ability of the two anti-Salmonella agents to inhibit the growth of E. faecalis. The results demonstrate the ability of the two agents to reduce the virulence of the infection of T. vaginalis. The results also showed the efficacy of the two agents in the treatment of E. faecalis. Therefore, the results justify the use of the two anti-Salmonella agents together with the treatment of other infection in humans.


## Introduction
The most commonly occurring species causing fungal infections are Candida and Cryptococcus, of which C. albicans is the most common, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei.1, 2, 3 C. glabrata is considered an emerging pathogen, accounting for approximately 1-3% of all fungal infections, and the vast majority of systemic infections are caused by C. albicans.2, 3, 4 C. krusei accounts for over half of all systemic candidiasis, and is responsible for approximately 1-4% of all invasive candidiasis, although C. glabrata accounts for less than 1% of all systemic candidiasis.1, 5, 6

The potential risk factors for fungal infections are commensal and/or parasitic nature of the organism, with the latter being related to the immunocompromised patient and geographical zones. In the case of HIV-infected patients, cryptococcal meningitis has been shown to be a very rare complication, affecting about 2% of AIDS patients presenting with systemic cryptococcosis (CD4 count <500 cells/µl) compared to about 1% of those with other forms of systemic cryptococcosis.7, 8 There is an increasing trend in the number of infections due to Candida albicans, which has been reported in 15 countries and the number of cases caused by other Candida species has increased over the past 10 years.9, 10 Although Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common agent of fungal disease, other Cryptococcus species are increasingly being identified in patients with cryptococcal disease.


## Methods
capsulatum or . capsulatum. After injection, the mice were sacrificed after a period of 24 h and the CNS tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

Histological studies
For immunohistochemistry studies, the whole brain was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

Histological studies
CNS slices were obtained by excising the top 3-cm section of the cortex and cutting off the hippocampus from the cortex. The hippocampal slices were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

## Results
pylori HOG (Homo sapiens) gene cluster and to a . pylori ortholog of the H. pylori HOG protein. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is involved in protein modification. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is a regulatory element. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster consists of several regulatory elements, including the HOG1/2/3/4 (HOG2/3/4) and HOG4/5/6 (HOG4/5/6) genes (Teng and Moran, 1997; Teng and Moran, 1998).

H. pylori HOG gene cluster is involved in DNA replication, repair and protein modification, and the HOG gene cluster is highly conserved in H. pylori (Girard et al., 2011). The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is responsible for a large number of genes. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is involved in many genes (Teng and Moran, 1998; Teng and Moran, 1998). The H. pylori HOG gene cluster has a predicted GATP-coding gene (Hog1/2/3) and is the only HOG gene cluster with this gene in the H. pylori genome. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is also involved in a large number of other genes, and is also involved in a large number of genes in the H. pylori genome. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is also involved in a large number of genes. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is also involved in a large number of genes. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is also involved in a large number of genes. The H. pylori HOG gene cluster is also involved in a large number of genes.

## Discussion
It was found that the HMR3 levels were stable during the course of brain disease, and they maintained the normal rang. However, the HMR3 levels were significantly decreased in both the brain regions, and they maintained the normal range. The patient had a G+C content of 66.1%, and the mean G+C content of HMR3 was 53.4%. Therefore, it seems that HMR3 levels are stable during the course of the disease.

Hermann and colleagues showed that the Hmr3 levels are stable during the course of the disease [10]. Furthermore, the Hmr3 levels were significantly decreased in the brain regions of the brain and the cortex in the present study. The Hmr3 levels were decreased in the brain regions of the brain and the cortex in the present study. In contrast, the levels of the HMR3 were significantly decreased in the brain and cortex in the patient with cerebral toxoplasmosis [11]. In the present study, the levels of the Hmr3 were significantly decreased in the brain and cortex in the patient with cerebral toxoplasmosis.
