## Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the commonest cause of adult meningitis in Africa. Treatment regimens for meningitis are based on careful consideration of morbidity, comorbidity, and management options. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of polycythemia vera, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and polycythemia formosanum, used as single agent or in combination, on susceptibility to polycythemia vera and polycythemia formosanum from HIV-infected patients, based on MIC and MBC counts. Forty-five patients were included in the study, 32 on the basis of the results of MIC and MBC tests. The 20’old patient had an average age of 50 years with no significant history of HIV/AIDS and TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was resistant to the two drugs (flucytosine and polycythemia vera) which was the most common. M. vera was the most effective with 50.8% (40/55) of patients surviving. M. tuberculosis showed a significant advantage (MIC = 0.05 mg/L), with an LDH of 1.6 mg/L. The combination of polycythemia vera with polycythemia formosanum showed a significant advantage (MIC = 0.09 mg/L). Overall, 27% (14/23) of patients died, including eight in ICU patients. About one in 10 (7%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis, and about one in five patients (17%) had fungal culture confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with M. tuberculosis confirmed, about one in five (11%) had fever, and about one in five (18%) had CD4+ T-cell deficiency. M. vera was more effective with 50% (28/35) of patients surviving compared to polycythemia vera, and M. vera had a significant advantage with 69% (43/51) of patients surviving compared to M. tuberculosis. This study highlights the need for a systematic evaluation of the antifungal prophylaxis regimens, since polycythemia vera and polycythemia formosanum are the drugs with the highest MIC of 0.05 mg/L and are the two most frequently prescribed regimens for meningitis.

Several studies have examined the utilization of biomass hydrolysates from the boreal and tropical forests for the production of biofuels, pesticides, and fertilizers. A considerable number of studies have been conducted in the boreal forest for the production of various chemicals, including organic compounds, chemicals with anti-oxidant properties, and various chemicals with a broad range of bioactivities. These compounds have shown positive bioactivity against various pathogens and environmental fungi, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and to a lesser extent, yeasts. Some of these compounds have shown high bioactivity against free radicals and tumor cells, and some have shown positive bioactivity against bacteria and fungi (Abrad et al. 2015; DeLong et al. 2015; Abrad et al. 2016). However, bioavailability and relative bioavailability of biofuels and pesticides are influenced by many factors including geographical location, season, climate, and the availability of important agricultural products, both in the forest and the field. In addition, many factors such as climate, harvesting method, processing method, and environmental factors are also relevant in the tropical forests. Thus, the ecological and economical benefits and industrial uses of biomass hydrolysates from the boreal and tropical forest forests may be attributed to the hydrolysate content, and may also be due to the chemical composition and biological activity of the hydrolysates.

Biodiesel, also known as bioethanol, is a heterogenous mixture of polyester, hemicellulose, lactose, lactose-phosphate, isopropyl, and glycerol residues.


## Methods

In order to evaluate the significant difference in the phospholipid content between BOSB and POSB, the ChIP-Seq data were analyzed using the GATK software (Version .0.3) [20] and the three experimental sets (BOSB, POSB, and BOSB-POSB) were analyzed using the GATK graphical user interface (GATK GraphPad software).

In order to analyze the influence of several sources of carbon sources, the ChIP-Seq data were analyzed using the GATK software.

Expression of Biosynthesis Activity
To test whether BOSB can be induced by various substrates, BOSB was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration of 2.5 mM.

The BOSB solution was incubated at room temperature for 24 h with the following carbon sources: 0.02% yeast nitrogen base, 0.01% ammonium sulphate, 0.01% potassium nitrate, 0.01% p-butyric acid, 0.01% thiamine-HCl, 0.01% ß-glycerol phosphate, 0.01% ß-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.02% of biotin-glycerol phosphate. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 using DMSO. The BOSB solution was mixed with a mixture of H_2O_2 and H_2O_3, and then the anhydrous substrate was poured into the BOSB solution. The mixture was centrifuged at the speed of 4000 × g for 15 min. The aqueous layer was transferred into a fresh tube, and then the solvent was removed by evaporation at 70 °C for 20 min. The aqueous layer was transferred into a fresh tube, and then the solvent was removed by evaporation at 70 °C for 20 min. The solvent layer was transferred into a new tube, and then the aqueous layer was transferred into a fresh tube, and then the solvent was removed by evaporation at 70 °C for 20 min. The aqueous layer was transferred into a new tube, and then the solvent was removed by evaporation at 70 °C for 20 min.


## Results

.2. Identification of the Largest Polysaccharide Polysaccharide Polysaccharide by Mass Spectrometry
Polysaccharide polysaccharides consist of two polypeptides, one isomerized by the reaction of a polymer with a polymerase chain reaction system and the other by the reaction of a polymerase chain reaction system. These two polypeptides are called polysaccharide-polypeptides (PSPCs), and polysaccharide-polypeptides are related by the ability to form two complex polypeptides. The PSPCs are composed of a mannan, a polyesteric gel, and a polypeptide, which are usually named polysaccharide-polypeptides. This polysaccharide polypeptides can be easily identified by the mass spectrometry technique used for polysaccharide composition. The mass spectrometry method was developed by the Institute of Polymers and Polymers Biotechnology and has been used to study the polysaccharide composition of various microbial products and to identify polysaccharide polypeptides.

The mass spectrometry technique of mass spectrometry was used to identify polysaccharide polypeptides, by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry, using a standard UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis). The UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis) is a spectrophotometer that detects the absorption of ultraviolet light using UV-visible and UV-transparent spectra. UV-visible spectrophotometer is a conventional UV-vis system that detects the absorption of UV light by both ultraviolet light and absorption of UV-visible light. The optical-mass spectrometry technique was developed for the detection of polysaccharide polypeptides by mass spectrometry using a standard UV-visible spectrometry technique. The UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to monitor the absorption of UV light by both UV-visible and UV-transparent spectra.

The mass spectrometry technique was used to identify polysaccharide polypeptides by means of the mass spectrometry technique, and to determine the composition of the polysaccharide polypeptides by mass spectrometry.

## Discussion
The ability of diverse yeasts to adapt to different stress conditions is a critical determinant of their virulence. In this study, we have described the interaction of a novel yeast with the hemocyte as demonstrated by the potent inhibition of the yeast-to-hypha transition and the detection of a strong proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, by the presence of a Dectin-1-binding lectin (Fig 2).

The antifungal activity of Dectin-1 is attributed to the ability of this molecule to bind to and bind to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 2 (MHC2) and to bind to the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is then phosphorylated by Dectin-1 and subsequently phosphorylated by IL-1ß, to form IL-2 (Fig 3). Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 interact with each other and are able to bind to the MHC2 and NF-<U+03BA>B receptors (Figs. 2 and S1), and these receptors are able to recognize the Dectin-1-binding lectin (Dectin-1) and Dectin-2/NF-<U+03BA>B, respectively (Fig 4).

Dectin-1 binding to the MHC-II is essential for the interaction with the cell surface receptors, and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-1ß, which are also required for the Dectin-1-binding to the cell surface receptors, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inhibit the production of IL-6 and IL-1ß (Fig 5).

In addition to the Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and NF-<U+03BA>B ligands, Dectin-1 is also able to bind to MHC-II, a molecule that is involved in the synthesis of IL-1ß, a marker of immune response (S8 Fig). This molecule is also involved in the production of IL-6, IL-1ß, and IL-1ß (S9 Fig).
