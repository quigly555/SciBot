## Abstract
Bacillus cereus is a ubiquitous bacterium that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and is the most prevalent pathogenic bacterium worldwide. One of the novel virulence factors of B. cereus is its ability to efficiently evade host defense mechanisms, which include the production of cytokines by the host and the ability to resist endogenous and adaptive immune responses. B. cereus has developed an extraordinary genetic mechanism to evade the immune system of the host. To surpass the innate immune response in B. cereus fitness, the host must have optimal levels of both active and defense mechanisms. The expression of hereditarily active protein A (AspF), a component of the innate immune response, is highly induced by starvation conditions and acts as a strong reprogramming factor of the secretory pathway to enable the colonization of specific genomic regions of the B. cereus genome. Glucorhamnan (GlcA) is a key regulator of the immune system of B. cereus and is essential for the viability of the pathogen. Glucorhamnan is also the main molecule used by B. cereus to escape the innate immune response and to form viable cell walls. The addition of exogenous glucorhamnan to the host genomic region induces a strong negative response and is required for the viability of the pathogen. Thus, the ability of B. cereus to evade the host's immune system and to form viable cell walls is an important characteristic that will drive the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for the control of human and bacilli from invasive infection.


## Introduction
 2017.

Kap1, a protein with a 67-kDa N-terminal domain, is expressed by numerous pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans (Soler et al., 2015; Dax et al., 2016). Although this protein is abundant in the human body, its role in fungal virulence is poorly understood (Soler et al., 2015).

The key effector protein of fungal virulence is carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, morphogenesis, invasion, and immune evasion (Hader and Sahl, 2003; Fisher and Perfect, 2007). Notably, the ability to sense and respond to diverse environments is highly conserved throughout the fungal kingdom. In this regard, the ability of fungi to sense and respond to diverse environments is an important virulence factor. CAZymes are expressed by various fungal species, including pathogenic fungi (MÃ¼ller et al., 2005), and are modulated by environmental factors (Rosenblueth and Perfect, 2013). In pathogenic fungi, the effector proteins of the CAZymes family play important roles in the adaptation of the fungus to the environment and the cell cycle (Griest et al., 2004; Saito et al., 2008).

The role of fungal CAZymes in pathogenesis has been well-studied in Aspergillus fumigatus (Garcia-Contu et al., 2005), Candida albicans (Chao et al., 2007), and C. neoformans (Chao et al., 2007). For example, the ability of C. albicans to sense and respond to glucose starvation and a variety of amino acids in response to carbon starvation is mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is activated by multiple stimuli including phosphorylation of the ERK-CARD9 signaling protein (ERK1) and glucose availability (Chen et al., 2012). The ERK1 pathway is activated by ERK1 signaling in response to glucose starvation, and ERK1 in turn activates the downstream target genes, including the cAMP-PKA/ERK1 signaling pathway (Chen et al., 2012).


## Methods

Infection methods
The in vitro antagonism of the antimicrobial peptides of the antimicrobial peptides of the antimicrobial peptides of the drugs was performed as described by Roussel et a. (2016). The methods for in vitro antagonism of the antimicrobial peptides of the antimicrobial peptides of the antimicrobial peptides of the antimicrobial peptides of the drugs were as described by Bai et al. (2013) and Zheng et al. (2014).


## Results
During the period from 2004 to 2015, 36 C. neoformans isolates were isolated from seven different sites, from which 13 were from the lungs of mice. Of these, 9 were from the lungs and 5 from the skin of the rats. These isolates were all initially identified as belonging to the genus Cryptococcus. After the analysis of the two strains from each site, the strains belonged to two different species, C. neoformans var. grubii (CBS 854.47) and C. neoformans var. neoformans (CBS 959.91).

Hemolysis was assessed in all isolates. Of the five most common conditions used to characterize C. neoformans isolates, three were found to be atypical and three were found to be the least common. Three isolates were isolated from blood vessels in two dogs and one from a cat. Another isolate from a dog was isolated from the skin of one of the two cats. All the five most common isolates of C. neoformans var.


## Discussion

Our results showed that Malawi is the only African country to contain all species of . gattii, and a clear distinction has been made between the clinical and environmental strains. The clinical strains of C. gattii have been described in different regions of Africa. There have been reports of C. gattii infection in the Cape of Good Hope (3), Cape Verde (6), and Gambia (7). However, the most recent report in Nigeria (8) found only two cases of C. gattii infection in the same region.

C. neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii have been reported in a different geographical region (9). According to an epidemiological study carried out in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1995-96 (10), only 14 isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii were isolated from C. gattii isolates from three different geographic regions (2,5,8,13). The majority of the isolates in this study were also recovered from other regions of South Africa. The epidemiological studies of Cape Town, South Africa reported that only one case of C. gattii infection in South Africa was reported in 2004 (11). The main source of infection for C. gattii in Cape Town is the surrounding area. In this study, the patient was from South Africa, which does not have a highly endemic area.

Our results suggest that C. gattii is a distinct species, but the clinical characteristics of this species are not as well established as in other C. gattii species. The current data is the first to report on C. gattii in South Africa. Furthermore, there have been no reports of C. gattii infection in the state of Malawi, where there is little to no commercial animal consumption. In the city of Malawi, C. gattii is considered to be a rare disease, and the main source of infection is inhalation of the fungus in people. In this study, the patient was from Malawi, which does not have a highly endemic area. The infection was diagnosed in the city of Malawi.

We believe that the current study represents a first report on the epidemiology of C. gattii in Malawi. The isolates were recovered from C.
