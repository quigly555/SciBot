## Introduction
It was concluded that this is because of the higher frequency of injection of LSD in the environment compared to fingoli. Another report in which a LSD-type hypersensitivity reaction was noted in patients with AIDS was provided by a patient with FLC who had experienced a LSD-type hypersensitivity reaction. It was noted that he had a high dose of LSD during a trip to Israel and this patient had a high LSD-specific lymphocyte count. The authors also mentioned a patient who had a high LSD dose but had no LSD hypersensitivity reaction. In fact, the patient had a high LSD dose but had a hypersensitivity reaction to a lysergic acid diethylamide. LSD hypersensitivity reactions in patients with AIDS are usually mild, and LSD treatment may be well tolerated. However, in those who have a hypersensitivity reaction to LSD, the drug is often administered to prevent it from happening again. This is a very rare situation in which LSD has been prescribed for hypersensitivity reactions. The only patient who was prescribed LSD was a 31-year-old man who had a hypersensitivity reaction to it. The reason for this patient’s hypersensitivity reaction was because of a history of a prior LSD trip.

In the case of fingolimod the authors state that, "the LSD-type hypersensitivity reaction was not isolated, and it is possible that its presence in the setting of fingolimoduria might have been overlooked." I guess I should point out that the authors state that the hypersensitivity reaction to fingolimod is defined as:

[…] Fingolimod is the first-line treatment for fingolimoduria. The use of fingolimod is recommended to decrease the risk for developing serious complications of fingolimoduria.

The authors make no mention of any specific recommendations for the treatment of LSD or any specific recommendations for the treatment of LSD. All they are telling the reader that LSD should not be prescribed as treatment, or rather, that LSD should be:

Prophylactic, i.e., a treatment for an underlying disease, and/or a prevention or modification of disease, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, metabolic, and immune diseases.

They do mention that these recommendations should be followed in patients who are on fluoro-dermatophytic therapy.

I have read this submission.


## Methods
The major pharmacological agents and their mechanisms of action have been successfully reported and are listed in Additional file 2: Table S.

The test has been carried out as follows: (a) When a spontaneous repulsion occurs with the presence of a white powder or a white crystalline product, the excited field of the object or compound is recorded in the ultraviolet (UV) light, as described by Vibbin et al. (2005) and Vibbin et al. (2007). When the whole body is covered with a transparent material, the tested substance has been observed in the UV light and in the ultraviolet light. The first sample is considered as the positive result and the second one is considered as the negative result.

The test has been carried out as follows: (b) When a white crystalline product is observed in the system of the system of the dosage, the positive result is interpreted according to the modified standard of a student, who is observed on a scale of 1 to 4. The substances with clear or clear peak in the system of the system of the dosage, are considered to be the drug-drug combination.

## Results
brucei NK-cell-derived salicylic acid (2) is a powerful agent for the treatment of painful wounds, and thus the use of this agent as analgesic in the treatment of painful wounds is described as “medicine-assisted analgesic. The use of this agent has been shown in several reports to be effective in relieving painful wounds in patients with chronic pain [16,17,19,20,21]. The last report includes the use of a commercial synthetic salicylic acid, TRY, for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [24]. Several studies have suggested that TRY might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [20,21,25,26,27,28]. We have confirmed that TRY has been used successfully in several studies to treat painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [20,21,22,23,24,29]. Moreover, it is well known that TRY is a highly efficient and selective agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [15,21]. We have also evaluated the therapeutic properties of TRY against painful wounds in HIV-infected patients, and the results showed that it has been well established that TRY is effective in treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [30].

Our previous report found that TRY, a good agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients, is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients [17]. However, it is worth mentioning that there are several studies that have suggested that TRY may be an effective agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients, and therefore the use of this agent in the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of painful wounds in HIV-infected patients.

2.2. Pharmacology
To confirm the antifungal activity of TRY, the antifungal activity of this agent was determined against eight Candida species in vitro. A positive and statistically significant MIC against all Candida species tested was obtained from the current study (Table 2). The MIC values for the four strains tested were higher than that obtained with the other agents.


## Discussion
The primary aim of this work was to examine the role of CnB activation in the spleen of rats and found that CnB^+ and CnB^+ BMDM promoted the proliferation and spleen infiltration of rats (Fig 1). The induction of BMDM and CnB^+ BMDM in the spleen of rats was also found to be similar to that of bovine BMDM and BMDM (Fig 1).
