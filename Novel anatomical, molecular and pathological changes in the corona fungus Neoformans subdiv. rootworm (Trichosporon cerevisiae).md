## Abstract
The evolution and divergence of these TFs have been studied, but the primary TFs are poorly understoo.

The aim of this study was to provide an in-depth analysis of the evolution and divergence of the primary TFs in C. neoformans, which is a fungal plant pathogen closely related to the major human-pathogenic fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus.

A representative genome sequence from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of each member of the family MyxoboA was assembled. This genomic assembly revealed: (i) the first direct evidence that the primary TFs are present in C. neoformans, (ii) a major difference between the A. fumigatus secondary TFs and the majority of the TFs in Aspergillus; and (iii) the difference between the TFs in A. fumigatus and A. nubilis. ITS regions were separated into different functional groups and analyzed by IR, TUB, BLAST, ORF, or RNAseq. Each functional group was analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficient.

Comparative analyses of the primary and secondary TFs in the myxoboa revealed that, in most cases, the TFs are present only in the fungus, and in most of the secondary TFs in A. nubilis. Moreover, the secondary TFs in A. fumigatus are divided into functional groups i, ii, and iii, and the secondary TFs in A. nubilis are divided into functional groups i, ii, and iii. Although the functional groups in A. fumigatus are classified as secondary, they are present in A. nubilis. In contrast, the majority of the secondary TFs in A. fumigatus are classified as active, and these TFs are present in all involved myxobolets. Most of the secondary TFs in A. nubilis are absent, and in most cases no difference in functional distribution of the TFs was observed. In the present study, the TFs in A. nubilis were found to be present only in the myxobolets, and it was found that the majority of these secondary TFs in A.


## Introduction

Considering that the main structures of the corona are the layers of dry, rough, hard, and hard-bleached, the exudates of the fungal bodies are thought to be secondary to the interactions of fungal cells with the hos. The decomposition of the fungal cells in the insect cornea is initiated by the contact between the host cornea and the microbial components in the epidermis. The respiratory tract of the insect host is protected by the keratinous layer of the epidermis that contains the keratin-like structures (the epidermal epithelium, epithelium, and epithelia) [11]. These keratinous structures are composed of various components, including epithelial, connective tissue, epithelial, connective tissue, connective tissue, and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as apoptotic, growth inhibitory, and myeloperoxidase cells [12]. In the insect host, the entire epidermal epithelium is covered with keratinous structures, mainly epithelial cells, which contain a dense network of epithelial cells, including epithelial and connective tissue cells [11,13]. In the keratomycosis complex, the epithelial cells are often covered with extracellular matrix, which is usually composed of keratin, fibres, and extracellular polymeric substances [14]. The corneal epithelium contains two types of keratin, termed apical and epidermal. The former contains collagen, keratin, and keratin-like materials and is covered by keratin-like layers that are mostly composed of keratin-like proteins. The latter contains hydrolases, hydroxylases, and hydroxyl hydroxylases [15].

The composition of the cornea varies greatly in different insects and can be determined by several factors, such as the species of insect, insect habitat, host, and insect activity. The composition of the insect host range is not limited to the top-ranked insects, but is equally vast in the top invertebrates, including humans, pigeons, mites, flies, and cockroaches.


## Methods
The morphological characteristics were observed by visual microscop. For this purpose, the corona fungi were stained with: Mitra Black (MBL) stain. Spores were dissected from the roots and the spore suspension was transferred to a fresh culture medium. The spore suspension was incubated at room temperature for 3-5 days and the morphological results were observed. The morphological characteristics of the fungus were observed in the spore suspension.

Transcriptional profiles of the biofilm-associated fungi
The different species of biofilm-associated fungi were collected from different field sites in the Pune District, Maharashtra, India. The biofilm-associated fungi were isolated from the different plots of the Pune District, Maharashtra, India. The biofilm-associated fungi were suspended in physiological saline (SMS) at the lowest concentration of 0.005% (w/v) and the biofilm-associated fungi were incubated at room temperature for 3-5 days. The biofilm-associated fungi were observed by microscopy and the morphological results were observed. The biofilm-associated fungi were observed in the spore suspension. The biofilm-associated fungi were observed in the fungal biomass (fungus) of the biofilm-associated fungi. The biofilm-associated fungi were observed in the conidial suspension of the conidial of the biofilm-associated fungi. The fungal biomass of the biofilm-associated fungi were observed in the conidial suspension of the fungal-associated fungi. The fungal biomass of the fungal-associated fungi was observed in the conidial suspension of the fungal-associated fungi.

## Results

The infectious process of Neoformans was characterized by the formation of the necrotic lesions (Figure 2. In the necrotic lesions, the dark brown cells surrounded by the green cells of the surrounding chloroplastic matrix had an intense cytoplasmic, spindle-shaped appearance (Figure 2). In contrast, the intact nematode cells were devoid of any sign of necrosis. The necrotic lesions appeared similar to those of the original lesion caused by Neoformans or Neoformans + C. neoformans. The necrosis lesions were characterized by the formation of a dark brown zone surrounded by the green cells of the surrounding chloroplastic matrix.

## Discussion
2014), but still maintained normal cell polarity in this cas.

The absence of Ca^2+-mediated Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling is reflected in the in vitro cell-wall stress response in the corona fungus N. bombycis (Sutton et al. 2012) and in the microtubule/filamentous growth response of the corona fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Krishnamoorthy and Thomas 2013). In N. bombycis, the corona fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum (Vecchi et al. 2013) cells are able to produce calcium-dependent signaling by converting calcium ions to its proton-motive force in the cytosol, which is then transported to the nucleus for calcium-independent cellular responses. In N. bombycis, Ca^2+-dependent Ca^2+-dependent Ca^2+ influx via the NADP/Ca^2+ exchanger is associated with cell survival and proliferation in the corona fungus N. bombycis (Nguyen et al. 2013).

In addition to Ca^2+-dependent Ca^2+/calmodulin-dependent Ca^2+-dependent cellular responses, calcium-dependent calcium-binding protein 3 (CaBsc3) was also detected in this case. CaBsc3 was previously shown to be required for proper calcium homeostasis and control of Ca^2+ influx via the MAP kinase Cch1 (Del Poeta et al. 2011). The CaBsc3 mRNA in the cell wall was also detected in the culture of the conidial inoculum. The calcineurin signaling pathway was also implicated in the corona fungus N. bombycis (Sutton et al. 2012).

Previous reports reported that the cell wall and cell membrane were the major cellular targets for Ca^2+-dependent calcium-dependent signaling in fungal cells (Sutton and Cornely 1991; Simmons et al. 1993; Sood et al. 2000; Sedgley et al. 2011). In this case, the cell wall was not damaged by Ca^2+-mediated calcium influx but it was found to be defective in the formation of hyphae, which is characteristic of the morphological changes in N. bombycis.
