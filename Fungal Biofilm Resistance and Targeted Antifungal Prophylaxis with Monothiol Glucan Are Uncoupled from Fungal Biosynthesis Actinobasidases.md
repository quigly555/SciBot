## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiological effects of amphotericin B (AMB) in combination with 5-fluorouracil against mesotheliocarcinoma colonized rats. Radiographic images of the lesions were obtained at 2 weeks and 3 months. The radiological response was evaluated by colony forming units counting and counts of lymphocytes, and the clinical and microbiological damage was evaluated by the antimycotic susceptibility testing of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infected rats. Additionally, a single dose of 10 mg/kg of the dose obtained from the advertisement was administered as the first dose.


## Introduction
The de novo biosynthesis of the drug-degrading enzyme glucoamylphosphocholine (GPP), which is an enzyme that is commonly found in fungi, has been known for decades [25. It was demonstrated that the glucoamylphosphocholine biosynthetic enzyme glucoamylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein GPI receptor (GPI-anchored protein receptor (GPI-anchored protein receptor) [26]) is highly sensitive to the antifungal drug, fluconazole, in vitro and in vivo, and has been detected in various fungal species [27,28,29,30]. GPI-anchored proteins are responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of fungal cell wall chitin and melanin, which is a key constituent of the fungal cell wall. These structural components are important for the fungal cell wall to withstand various stress conditions, such as hypoxia, oxidative stress, and UV-B irradiation [31,32,33]. Glucan is the major component of the fungal cell wall. It is not only the cell wall that is a major source of energy for the fungus, but also the cell wall itself. However, not all cells in a fungus are melanized, and this condition has been reported to cause infection in both human and animal tissues [34,35]. The presence of glucoamylphosphocholine in the fungal cell wall has been confirmed in Cryptococcus neoformans by a method of phenotypic analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [36]. In addition, glucoamyl phosphocholine was also detected in the fungal cells of the model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Aspergillus nidulans [37]. In this study, we investigated the antifungal activity of glucoamyl phosphocholine and its de novo biosynthesis from different fungal cell wall components. This study complements previous findings that glucoamyl phosphocholine was the major biosynthetic enzyme in the biosynthesis of the azole drug, fluconazole. Finally, the anti-fungal activity of glucoamyl phosphocholine was investigated using an in vivo study in mice.


## Methods
The “Biomass Isolation” method was performed with a cell lysate, followed by addition of 10% mononucleotide phosphate buffer (SDS-PAGE) and 8% SDS-PAGE (Boroc (Sigma-Aldrich)), respectively, to prevent cross-contamination of monomers with poly-l-lysine-coated substrate. The “Biomass Isolation” method was performed with a substrate mixture, followed by addition of 6% SDS-PAGE and 8% SDS-PAGE (Boroc (Sigma-Aldrich)), respectively, to prevent cross-contamination of substrates with poly-l-lysine-coated substrates. The “Cell Isolation” method was performed with a substrate mixture, followed by addition of 6% SDS-PAGE and 8% SDS-PAGE (Boroc (Sigma-Aldrich)), to prevent cross-contamination of substrates with poly-l-lysine-coated substrates. The “Cell Isolation” method was performed with a substrate mixture, followed by addition of 6% SDS-PAGE and 8% SDS-PAGE (Boroc (Sigma-Aldrich)), to prevent cross-contamination of substrates with poly-l-lysine-coated substrates. The “Freeze-Thaw” method was performed with a substrate mixture, followed by addition of 8% SDS-PAGE and 0.25% SDS-PAGE (Boroc (Sigma-Aldrich)), to avoid cross-contamination of substrates with poly-l-lysine-coated substrates. The “Freeze-Thaw” method was performed with a substrate mixture, followed by addition of 8% SDS-PAGE and 0.


## Results
In the wild type and the mutant strains, no growth was observed, and the growth was completely suppressed with the addition of monothiol gluca. In the mutant strains, the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition, while the growth was suppressed with the addition of monothiol glucan. In the mutant strains, the fungal growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition, while the growth was suppressed with the addition of monothiol glucan. The growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition (Fig 3C), and the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition (Fig 3D).

Monothiol glucan is a stress-responsive and protective factor that promotes the development of virulence factors by inhibiting the expression of key gene products in the cell wall and protein synthesis pathways. Monothiol glucan is the most important stress-responsive antifungal antifungal factor in the fungal cell wall, and its production is associated with antifungal resistance [3, 4]. The fungal cell wall protein is a key component of the fungal cell wall, and it is produced in response to oxidative stress [4]. Monothiol glucan is also important for the synthesis of fungal cell wall proteins [4].

To investigate the production of antifungal peptides by the F. graminearum FgBNP1 and FgBNP2, the glyoxylate cycle was analyzed. The growth of the wild type and the mutant strains was completely suppressed with the addition of monothiol glucan, while the growth was suppressed with the addition of monothiol glucan. In the mutant strains, the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition, while the growth was suppressed with the addition of monothiol glucan. The growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition (Fig 4A), and the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition (Fig 4B). In contrast, the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition, and the growth was suppressed with monothiol glucan addition (Fig 4C).

To determine the mechanisms of the F.


## Discussion
We have identified a set of antifungal candidate genes encoding a set of fungal-specific FKS proteins and we have used this to identify potential targets for development of new antifungal agent. The antifungal candidate genes are encoded by three highly conserved genes (FKS1, FKS3 and FKS4) and by two additional genes (FKS4, FKS9 and FKS10) that have orthologs in C. albicans, but not in S. cerevisiae (Figure 2). The fungal-specific genes are also encoded by two genes that encode fks1 and fks3 (Figure 3). FKS genes are involved in biofilm formation and asexual reproduction, respectively (47). In S. cerevisiae, the FKS1 gene encodes a fungal-specific protein that is required for full virulence in an ascomycete pathogenic fungus (48). FKS4 is associated with resistance to copper and is required for full virulence in C. albicans (49). In C. neoformans, the FKS1 gene encodes a fungal-specific gene that is required for full virulence and has orthologs in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans (50). The FKS1 gene is expressed in C. neoformans and is required for full virulence and full growth in C. albicans (50). In addition, we identified a novel FKS gene encoding a second FKS protein (Figure 3). The FKS1 gene is a typical candidate gene in the identification of a new fungal-specific gene in C. neoformans, FKS3, which is involved in biofilm formation and virulence in C. albicans (51). In this study, we found that the FKS1 gene is expressed in C. neoformans and was expressed in the C. albicans strain. This gene has orthologs in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. albicans and C. neoformans, but not in S. cerevisiae or C. neoformans.
