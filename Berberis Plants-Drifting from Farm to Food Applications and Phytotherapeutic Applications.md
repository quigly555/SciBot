## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Recently, the emergence of disease in immunocompetent individuals associated with AIDS has become a public health issue, and new treatment strategies are needed. Cryptococcus neoformans has a predilection toward macrophages and other cells of the innate immune response, and this fungus is found in mammalian and in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal effects of anidulafungin (DFG), a folate analog, against C. gattii.

DFG was added to amphotericin B (AMB) and fluconazole (FLF), and inhibited the yeast growth. Microscopy, determination of colony forming units (CFU) and colony forming units (CFUUU) of C. gattii were determined by atomic force microscopy, and antifungal susceptibility testing of seven tested compounds by CLSI method.

All tested fungicides inhibited C. gattii, with MIC values ranging from 0.02 to 0.31 µg/mL. In particular, one of the tested fungicides (hygconoalactoside) showed fungicidal activity, with CFU decrease of 0.83 ± 0.03 in one and fluorescence of dye change activity of 1.42 ± 0.03 when the tested fungicides were combined, the latter indicating that one of the tested fungicides was highly fluorescing, indicating that some tested compounds may be bioactive compounds.

DFG is an important antifungal agent against C. gattii, as well as a promising alternative for topical treatment, which is available in clinical and agricultural formulations.


## Introduction
The earth’s natural resources are finite and threatened by global warming. Climate change poses threats to ecosystem services, especially those that are located in extreme and vulnerable regions. The effort to devise sustainable strategies to combat climate change is urgent. Global warming is expected to cause substantial shifts in the frequency of extreme and warm weather events, temperature extremes, and other environmental characteristics of ecosystems [1]. Current research efforts to understand how the climate change alters nutrient cycling and dynamics, and how the global warming has altered the survival and abundance of plants and animals, are at odds with the model status of the Earth’s ecosystems [2,3]. The models developed to study climate change-induced changes in the dynamics of ecosystems are inconsistent, and many of them are derived from non-model organisms. For instance, the models used in the model of seasonal Arctic permafrost, for instance, are derived from only a few species [4].


## Methods
This knowledge-based approach can be applied to evaluate soil microbial communities in a two-dimensional screen or to assess soil microbial communities in a plant community using the way-on-the-fly methods [55] to help interpret the soils and plant communities as the main determinant. The knowledge-based approach is based on the use of the knowledge-based approach to evaluate soil microbial communities in a two-dimensional screen. It can be applied to evaluate soil microbial communities in a plant community by using the method of eukaryotic and bacterial phylogenic classifications, and by comparing the eukaryotic and bacterial species profiles. The eukaryotic and bacterial classifications are based on the results of the Eukaryotic-bacterial Comparative Database for the Environment (EBDB) [56] and the eukaryotic-bacterial Comparative Database for the Biological Sciences (BSDB) [57], respectively, and the eukaryotic-bacterial Comparative Database for the Natural Environment (DBN) [58], respectively. The bacterial-bacterial comparison is based on the results of the BN-bacterial Comparative Database for the Environment (BDB) [58] and the BN-bacterial Comparative Database for the Biological Sciences (BSDB) [59]. The bacterial-bacterial comparison is based on the results of the BN-bacterial Comparative Database for the Environment (BDB) [58].

The knowledge-based approach to evaluate soil microbial communities in a two-dimensional screen was applied to evaluate soil microbial communities in a soil-associated dish [60]. The knowledge-based approach to evaluate soil microbial communities in a two-dimensional screen was applied to evaluate soil microbial communities in a soil-associated dish at the pot level (Figure 2). The knowledge-based approach to evaluate soil microbial communities in a soil-associated dish was applied to evaluate soil microbial communities at the two-dimensional level (Table 2). This knowledge-based approach can be applied to evaluate soil microbial communities in a soil-associated dish at two-dimensional screen. This knowledge-based approach is based on the use of the knowledge-based approach to evaluate soil microbial communities in a two-dimensional screen.


## Results
Identification of a P. aeruginosa cell-surface metabolite
Phytochemicals of P. aeruginosa, which contain extracellular peptides, were identified as the most abundant phytochemicals in a single isolate of P. aeruginosa (P<0.01; Table 1). In addition, extracellular peptides, which are the first phase of the extracellular metabolism, were identified in a single isolate of P. aeruginosa (P<0.01; Table 1). Extracellular peptides were also identified in three isolates of P. aeruginosa (P<0.01; Table 1).

Proteolysis of P. aeruginosa
The rate of P. aeruginosa cell-surface protease activity was determined using the standard protocols described in the Materials and Methods section.

Protease activity was determined using the standard protocols described in the Materials and Methods section.

Protease activity was determined using the standard protocols described in the Materials and Methods section.

The P. aeruginosa isolate (P<0.01; Table 1) was subjected to a protease digestion with both specific primers and primers for the detection of P. aeruginosa protease activity.

## Discussion
Such strategies include sustainable management of plants, microbial communities, and disease preventio. However, it is not clear whether this approach can be adapted to plant disease in this ecosystem. For example, the ability to manage plant disease requires, for example, the capability to grow on biotic, abiotic, and biotic substrates, as well as the ability to store and secrete a broad range of fungicides. Also, genetic engineering approaches to crop disease management are also challenging due to genetic bottlenecks in plant populations. In this study, we generated a large number of integrated approaches for the management of plant disease in the United States, Europe, and Asia, which are designed to avoid bottlenecks in plant diseases. These approaches can be adapted to any of the plant disease management practices listed above, but these approaches are more complicated and require significant investment in research and development.

Our study is the first to use a combination of integrated strategies to control plant disease in an agricultural ecosystem. We have demonstrated that this strategy is capable of significantly reducing disease incidence in soils. We have also demonstrated that a combination of integrated strategies can be developed to reduce plant disease in grassland, using a combination of biotic, abiotic, and biotic agents. In the future, we will focus on studies that use combined strategies to control plant disease in an ecosystem. In this study, we were able to develop a combination of four agents with the potential to reduce disease incidence in rice. The combination of these agents, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, combined with the use of natural treatments, allowed for a significant reduction in disease incidence in a field.
