## Abstract
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a well-tolerated and frequently used antifungal against various life-threatening fungal pathogens. In the present study, we have investigated the in vitro activity of the AmB-resistant strains of Candida glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans against clinically relevant yeasts and filamentous fungi.

The minimum effective concentration (MEC) of AmB was determined in human phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using the broth microdilution method. The AmB minimum effective concentration (MEC) of Pb was determined in yeast using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) method. The activity levels of the tested Candida species were found to be more or less active compared to the control strain (p < 0.001). The MIC values of Pb against all Candida strains were found to be 0.08 mg/mL and that of A. fumigatus was 0.16 mg/mL (p < 0.001).

Pb demonstrated significant activity against the tested Candida species (p < 0.001). The activity level of the tested Candida species was more active than that of the Pb-resistant strains (p < 0.001). The results suggest that the tested Candida species have the ability to remain viable at low Pb concentrations for long periods of time.


## Introduction
(2015. Species in the genus Phytophthora have been recognized for more than 40 years by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and various committees. Since the first molecular phylogenetic study based on the ITS sequence data of Phytophthora inflatum (Sarwar et al. 2006), the genus has been known from a few different genera, including Phytophthora (Jopson & Pang 2012), Phytophthora (Eriksson et al. 2013), Phytophthora (Gillespie et al. 2015), and Phytophthora (Lilles et al. 2015). Several studies have now also been performed on other Phytophthora species, mainly on a few species of Fusarium and on several of their relatives (Jopson & Pang 2012, Jopson & Pang 2013, Skerratt & Rinalgosta-Lopez 2015).

The genus Phytophthora belongs to the group of black rot fungi which are associated with the decay of woody plants in temperate regions. These fungi are economically important because they cause diseases on both pre- and post- harvest stages, such as discoloration of leaves and bark, which is a common symptom of post-harvest disease. Phytophthora spp. are estimated to cause over 200,000 plantings losses annually in the United States (Pfeiffer et al. 2006) and several other countries (Lilles et al. 2015). Phytophthora spp. are estimated to cause approximately $300 million in annual loss in the United States (Ostrowski et al. 2015) and are responsible for an estimated annual loss of $185 million in crop diseases worldwide (Klaassen et al. 2017). Phytophthora sojae is an important disease of soybean and canola worldwide, causing serious problems of soybean production. Phytophthora sojae is one of the major causes of soybean worldwide. The rice blast fungus, caused by Phytophthora sojae, causes economic losses of up to 50% in the United States (Baker et al. 2002; Patouillard et al. 2006; Patterson et al. 2006). The worldwide outbreak of the rice blast disease caused by Phytophthora sojae in the United States was first reported in the midwest of United States in 2010 (Patterson et al. 2006).


## Methods
Study design and patients
We performed a prospective observational cohort study to evaluate the use of antifungal drugs in patients with candidiasis.


## Results
The first four species were described from the type site of Phytophthora inflamin. The second species was identified from the type site of Phytophthora inflamina. The third species was described from the type site of F. triticina. The fourth species was described from the type site of Phytophthora inflamina. The fifth species was described from the type site of F. delbrueckii. The sixth species was described from the type site of F. triticina.

A total of eight species were reported from the type site of F. triticina (Table 1). The species included in the genus Fusarium were Aspergillus (three species), Penicillium (two species), Penicillium lacini (one species), Penicillium lacini (five species), Penicillium pallescens (three species), Penicillium pallescens (one species), and Penicillium eubayanus (two species). A total of 10 species were reported from the type site of F. triticina (Table 1). The species included in the genus Fusarium were Aspergillus (three species), Penicillium lacini (two species), Penicillium lacini (three species), Penicillium pallescens (three species), Penicillium pallescens (five species), Penicillium pallescens (one species), and Penicillium eubayanus (two species). A total of 10 species were reported from the type site of F. triticina (Table 1). The species included in the genus Fusarium were Penicillium (three species), Penicillium lacini (two species), Penicillium lacini (three species), Penicillium pallescens (three species), Penicillium pallescens (five species), Penicillium pallescens (one species), Penicillium pallescens (three species), and Penicillium eubayanus (two species). A total of eight species were reported from the type site of F. triticina (Table 1).


## Discussion
The ITS1 region of the CBS 1246 gene was sequenced in all the strains analyze. The ITS1 region of CBS 1246 gene was also present in the isolates of the Fungal Pathogen Phytophthora inflamina (B. blakesleeanus) and F. siamensis (B. niger) isolated from soil in the Netherlands (Jenssen et al. 2009). In the present study, C. inconspicua and C. sake are the two species of the genus Candida which are widely distributed in the environment, especially in trees. The number of known species of the genus Candida has increased from 0.04% in 2004 to 0.71% in 2016 (Schoch et al. 2013). The Fungal Pathogen Phytophthora inflamina was the most studied fungus in this study (Table 2), in addition to the species of C. inconspicua, C. sake and C. sake, which all have been reported as major opportunistic pathogens in the environment (B. blakesleeanus, C. inconspicua, C. sake and C. sake) (Vogel et al. 2000).

The C. inconspicua isolate was phylogenetically related to the species of C. sake (0.36% ITS1 region) (Figure 3), which is a representative species of the genus Candida. C. sake was also reported as a cause of death in several species of the genus Candida (Vogel et al. 2000). The Fungal Pathogen Phytophthora inflamina was the second species of the genus Candida isolated from soil in the Netherlands (Vogel et al. 2000). The species of the genus Candida have been reported as a pathogen in various countries in the world, including South Africa, Australia, Germany, Argentina, Egypt, Israel, Mexico, and Vietnam (Orsi et al. 2002). The Fungal Pathogen Phytophthora inflamina is a representative species of the genus Candida. The species of the genus Candida are able to colonize various crops in the world, including fruits, vegetables, and cereals (Vogel et al. 2000). The Fungal Pathogen Phytophthora inflamina was the second species of the genus Candida isolated from soil in the Netherlands (Vogel et al. 2000).
