## Abstract
Fungal infections are important yet underdiagnosed, neglected, and neglected. Involvements range from asymptomatic to severe, ranging from asymptomatic to treatable. Candida species are the most frequently isolated fungal pathogens, being involved in an increasing number of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in both humans and animals. Their presence is usually inferred from epidemiological or other epidemiological data. However, recent data indicate that fungal species with a tendency to develop new infections are increasingly being detected in the environment. Pathogens that are resistant to some essential oils and the like are also emerging, with several potential pathogens causing candidiasis and dermatomycosis. Considerable attention has been focused on the development of novel diagnostic tools for these pathogens. Here we review the development and implementation of a novel multifunctional assay for the detection of these potentially “safe” contaminants, as well as their epidemiology and diagnostic methods. Different databases such as OpenBioInfographic, Janssen and Pubmed are also dedicated to providing users with reliable and unbiased information on the recent advances in the field.


## Introduction
The oleaginous microorganisms are extremely important in the biorefining of large-scale wastewater resources, due to their high biomass, economic importance and ecological impact. Oleaginous microorganisms can be divided into two groups, those that can accumulate more than 10^-6 carbon molecules (C_10) and those that accumulate more than 100^-7 carbon molecules (C_100). These two groups are further subdivided into two main categories: (i) A. flavus, which is a fast-growing and most abundant microorganism, and (ii) A. parasiticus, which is less abundant in the C_10 range and is more abundant in the C_100 range, but is more recalcitrant to wastewater treatment. It is thus not a genetically tractable microorganism, but a macroorganism that can grow in a relatively high concentration in the wastewater column, and that can be transferred from one wastewater treatment plant to another. In general, A. flavus and A. parasiticus are considered to be the most recalcitrant microorganisms in wastewater treatment, and are considered to be of great relevance in the bioremediation of wastewater. The major classes of pollutants that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants are carbon, nitrogen and organic contaminants. Therefore, the principal sources of carbon and nitrogen in wastewater are high concentrations of nitrogenous compounds such as carbonic anhydrase (CAs), organic carbon, calcium, cadmium, copper and sulfides (Manschmidt et al.

 2015; Zhu et a., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; van der Sar et al., 2017; Weiner et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), with minor modifications.

For the analysis of essential oil (O) of Sapindus saponaria, one of the essential oils (O) was identified as being composed of: 5% (w/v) n-hexane, 2% (w/v) methanol, 1% (w/v) ethyl alcohol, 0.001% (w/v) piperidine, 0.001% (w/v) formic acid, 0.001% (w/v) vanillin, 0.001% (w/v) trimethoprim, 0.001% (w/v) cymbopyridium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.001% (w/v) terbinafine, 0.001% (w/v) piperidinium, 0.


## Results

For all these, the essential oil of Sapindus saponaria (Pimenta) had the highest content of hydrocarbons (p < .001), with the same amount as that of the essential oil of Candida glabrata (Pimenta) (p < 0.001), which were also reported to have high contents of other substances. This was the case for the essential oil of Candida glabrata (Pimenta) (p = 0.05) (Table 1).

The total radical content of the essential oil of Sapindus saponaria (Pimenta) was higher than that of the plant essential oil from Valencianthus annuum (Vannavnich) (Table 1). In addition, the essential oil of Sapindus saponaria (Pimenta) had a higher content of phenolic acids, especially lignans, with the highest content of quinones.

The total radical content of the essential oil of Sapindus saponaria (Pimenta) was higher than that of the plant essential oil from Valencianthus annuum (Vannavnich) (Table 1). The essential oil of Valencianthus annuum (Vannavnich) had a higher content of triterpenoids, especially in relation to the essential oil of Candida glabrata (Pimenta), with the highest content of phenolic acids.
