## Abstract
Acanthamoeba spp. are the etiological agents of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a systemic fungal infection of humans and animals. This study aims to assess the antifungal effects of triclosan against A. castellanii and A. graminis, the causative agents of Acanthamoeba keratitis.

A 5.8 µg/mL triclosan dose-dependent dose dependent assay was performed in standard broth and standard buffer cultures for the antifungal activity of triclosan against A. castellanii and A. graminis, and the interaction of triclosan with fluconazole was performed.

Triclosan was positive in all broth cultures. Triclosan potently inhibited the A. castellanii and A.


## Introduction
However, the protective role of MVB in the innate immune response to viral infection remains elusiv.

Human myeloid T cells (CD3^+ cells) are a subset of lymphocytes that express high levels of the mannose receptor (MR) [14,15]. MR is activated by MHC class I molecules and is involved in a number of signaling events, including antibody production [16], cytokinesis [17], and activation of antigen-presenting cells [18]. MR also activates CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells, which contribute to the immunopathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including allergy [19], rheumatoid arthritis [20], and osteoarthritis [21]. The MHC class I-MHC class I molecules are potent cytotoxic molecules. In addition, MHC class I molecules are critical for the initiation and maintenance of autoimmune responses in the setting of microbial infection [22].

In mice, the MR antibody is present at low levels and binds poorly to microbial cells. Infection with a MR-negative strain is responsible for the observed immunopathology. Therefore, the MR antibody selectively interacts with microbial cells, generates reactive oxygen species, and mediates autoimmunity [23]. Furthermore, MR is expressed by macrophages and epithelial cells, which have a role in the adaptive immune response to viral infection. For example, MR is expressed by CD4^+ and CD8^+ cells of T cells, which are crucial for the activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes [24]. In contrast, MR does not interfere with macrophage activation, and is secreted by macrophages, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes [24]. In addition, MR and its receptor can mediate the immune responses against pathogens in a macrophage-independent manner [25]. Although the molecular mechanisms involved have not been clearly characterized, it has been reported that MR has a direct effect on macrophage activation and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines [26].


## Methods
In this study, the MCA-3 component of the MCA-3 (MCA-3) was involved in the defense of a mouse vaccinated with the two antibody-labeled streptomycin (MCA-3) (Zhuan et a., 2012). The MCA-3 was a cell-permeable protein (pNP) that has been extensively used to study the role of endogenous mTOR in pathogenesis (Zhuan et al., 2012). The MCA-3 was expressed in murine hepatocytes and purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA-ACN-based column (Amicon, Sunnyvale, CA) and eluted with a 6 M urea solution. The purified MCA-3 was added to a 15 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The MCA-3 peptide was dissolved in DMSO.

The purified MCA-3 was added to a 1 mL sterile PBS-PBS buffer and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The suspension was filtered using 0.22-µm filters (Millipore) and then placed in a vial with PBS. The MCA-3 was dissolved in DMSO. The volume was then adjusted to 1 mL with PBS. The EK506-Based Phospholipase BcMoj3 Is Required for Host Defense in a Murine Vaccine-Induced Manner [34]. In this study, the EK506-Based Phospholipase BcMoj3 (EK506-Fc, MCA-3) was the cell-permeable protein and the EK506-Based Phospholipase BcMoj3 (EK506-Rb, MCA-3) was the EK506-Based Phospholipase BcMoj3 (EK506-Sb, MCA-3).


## Results
oryzae Mj2p is involved in host defense, we generated Mj2p<U+0394> mj2<U+0394> null mutants in the presence of DTT, DTT-NMR, and DTT-DTT, respectively, in the absence or presence of the inhibitor cocktai. We next evaluated the virulence of Mj2p<U+0394> mj2<U+0394> null mutants in the murine model of invasive aspergillosis. The Mj2p<U+0394> null mutant was avirulent in the mouse model but not in the murine model of invasive aspergillosis (Fig 5B). After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and fungal burden was quantified in the lungs. The Mj2p<U+0394> null mutant presented a significantly higher fungal burden in the lungs (Fig 5C). However, the Mj2p<U+0394> mj2<U+0394> null mutant presented no fungal burden in the lungs at day 7 postinfection (Fig 5D). These data indicated that Mj2p is required for host defense in a murine mouse model of invasive aspergillosis.

Mj2p is Required for Normal Microbiological Development in the Mouse Model of IPA and Novel Infections
We next determined if Mj2p is required for normal macroscopic and morphologic development in the murine IPA model. The M. avium strain was injected intraperitoneally into a mouse model of IPA and fungal burden was determined at 14 and 14 days postinfection (Fig 6). The M. avium strain presented the typical IPA-like symptoms, but the Mj2p<U+0394> mj2<U+0394> null mutant displayed no obvious signs of disease (Fig 6). In contrast, the M. avium strain presented a significant fungal burden in the lungs at day 7 postinfection (Fig 6). These data indicated that Mj2p is required for normal macroscopic and morphologic development in the murine IPA model of IPA and novel infections.

Mj2p Is Required for Sensitivity to Different Antifungal Chemicals
The M. avium strain was used in our previous study to test the virulence potential of Mj2p.


## Discussion
In addition, glycolytic enzymes are secreted from the cell wall of murine and human PBMCs [57. This study showed that phospholipases from T. rubrum were predicted to be secreted from the cell wall of human and murine PBMCs. In addition, the phospholipase BcMoj3 was predicted to be secreted from the cell wall of murine and human PBMCs. This study showed that T. rubrum serotype 2B PBMCs could not contain sufficient levels of phospholipase BcMoj3 to protect themselves against infectious disease (ICD) caused by T. rubrum. It is believed that phospholipase BcMoj3 is expressed in the cell wall of T. rubrum and secreted from the cell wall of murine and human PBMCs. This study suggested that T. rubrum serotype 2B PBMCs could not contain sufficient levels of phospholipase BcMoj3 to protect themselves against infectious disease (ICD) caused by T. rubrum.
