## Abstract
Innate immune responses promote bacterial clearance by mediating inflammation and immune modulation. However, it is still unclear how an immune response suppresses host immune activity. Recently, it was reported that monocytes and macrophages exert influence on immune clearance in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice during the acute phase of infection. We hypothesized that macrophages play a different role during the chronic phase of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, with recruitment of inflammatory cells to the CNS and their ability to suppress host immune activity. In vitro, we found that IFN-<U+03B3> was required for early and prolonged increases in lung inflammation and macrophage activity in the CNS, as well as for the suppression of host immune activity in the CNS during the chronic phase of infection.


## Introduction
The zebrafish are an important model to study the evolution of eukaryotic cell signaling and have been used to study the evolution of bacterial, fungal and protozoan cell signaling pathways [1-5]. In zebrafish, the expression of genes involved in cell signaling has been studied in tandem with those involved in the regulation of other cell types, such as mitochondria and the cytoplasm [6-8]. In contrast, cell signaling is not only an organelles important for cell differentiation and survival, but also a mechanism important for cell survival and replication [9].

Zebrafish are considered an important model for studying the biology of the cell signaling pathway because zebrafish embryos and larvae are easy to manipulate and rewire by manipulating their physiology [10, 11]. However, zebrafish embryos and larvae lack vital components of cell signaling and cell differentiation. It is also not clear how cell signaling is integrated into the genome of zebrafish, especially with the lack of typical aspects of cell differentiation, such as the existence of multiple genes, such as non-reversible mitotic divisions, non-reversible mitotic divisions and the lack of canonical chromatin-modulating mechanisms [12, 13].

In addition to cell signaling, zebrafish embryos are also often used as models for the study of cell metabolism and cell signaling pathways, such as the metabolism of sugar metabolism, the production of cell wall-degrading enzymes, and the regulation of telomere length in many cell types [14-17]. In addition, zebrafish embryos have an important role in studying developmental processes, such as the development of the head and tail fin, the expression of the spermidine-responsive genes, the hypoxic Golgi apparatus, the fission yeast-like state and the cell-to-cell transition [14, 17]. The importance of zebrafish embryos as a model system has been demonstrated for the study of cellular regulation of gene expression, such as the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and mating [18-22]. The regulation of a variety of transcription factors and key regulators has been studied in zebrafish embryos.


## Methods
brasiliensis Pb18 (a gift from .W. Schiestl, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) was used as a recipient strain for antifungal therapy. The virulent isolate was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 25°C for 72 h. A 2-ml aliquot was removed from the plate and serially diluted to get the desired concentrations. For the first round of antifungal treatment, the plate was incubated at 28°C for 24 h. The following day, the plate was rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The number of colony forming units (CFU) was measured and the final antifungal concentration was adjusted to 10^6/ml.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as previously described [29]. Briefly, an inoculum of P. brasiliensis (S. brasiliensis CBS 78871) was prepared from a suspension of 2.5 × 10^4 spores/ml in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffered with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, 1 ml of PBS was added to the suspension and the spore suspension was allowed to settle for 10 min. The inoculated suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant (100 µl) was transferred into 96-well microtiter plates and the MIC was determined as the lowest concentration that resulted in no visible growth on the drug-free medium.

Capsule size determination
The capsule size was determined by measuring the diameter of the visible zone of the petri-dish in a cellophane square. The diameter of the zone was measured from the bottom of the Petri-dish (approximately 0.5 cm) to the top of the Petri-dish (approximately 0.5 cm) using a digital cellophane square (LCT) reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).


## Results
To test whether calcineurin activity was an important signaling factor for the regulation of VMA, the calcineurin activity assay was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes VMA (Figure 2C. The results demonstrated that the wild type and the calcineurin mutant displayed a marked reduction of calcineurin activity at the time of the experiment (Figure 2C). A second assay with the purified calcineurin, which was purified from the anti-G418 antibody, was used to further validate the calcineurin activity assay. The results showed that the calcineurin activity assay showed an apparent increase of calcineurin activity at 2 hpi (Figure 2D). The addition of 2 mM CaCl_2 significantly reduced the calcineurin activity at 2 hpi, but not at 24 hpi (Figure 2E). These data strongly suggest that the VMA signaling pathway is required for the regulation of calcineurin activity.

The Cryptococcal VMA Is Required for the Regulation of Sexual Development and Burden
The inability of the calcineurin mutants to produce viable spores indicated that calcineurin is a critical component of the plasma membrane. To test whether the calcineurin mutants could be regulated by VMA signaling, we analyzed the plasma membrane potential of the mutants. The results showed that the calcineurin mutants were unable to produce viable spores, and the membrane potential of the calcineurin mutants was reduced compared to the wild type and the wild type with the addition of 2 mM CaCl_2. The remaining defects in the mutants were observed only with the addition of 2 mM CaCl_2, and the plasma membrane potential of the calcineurin mutants was not affected compared to wild type. These data suggest that calcineurin activity is not required for the regulation of the plasma membrane potential.

To further evaluate the role of VMA signaling in the regulation of VMA-mediated stress responses, the mutants were subjected to various stresses. The results showed that the calcineurin mutants were more sensitive to oxidative stress, as compared to the wild type.


## Discussion
The CD4 counts were similar in the two groups; however, the CD4 count was significantly higher in non-HIV patients, suggesting that CD4 is more sensitive to CD4 depletio. The CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected patients were significantly lower in the sera of non-HIV patients, suggesting that CD4 cell depletion does not affect the CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected patients. This finding is consistent with previous findings showing that CD4 depletion is beneficial for HIV-infected patients [14]. In addition, our findings are also consistent with a recent study that showed that CD4 depletion decreases the latency of Cryptococcus neoformans to CD4 and that CD4 depletion can also decrease the latency of Cryptococcus neoformans in the brain [25].

The results of this study provide some general insights into the mechanisms that trigger CD4 depletion in HIV-infected patients. CD4 depletion is one of the most commonly recognized biological markers of HIV infection and may be the only marker of the overall frequency of CD4 depletion in HIV-infected patients. We also observed that CD4 depletion has a positive correlation with the severity of disease and that CD4 depletion can also be an indication of disease severity. Therefore, in HIV-infected patients, CD4 depletion is an important marker of CD4 depletion. The findings of this study also suggest that CD4 depletion may be a potential diagnostic marker for non-HIV cryptococcosis, since the CD4 cell counts in non-HIV cryptococcosis patients were significantly lower in the CD4 cell counts of HIV-infected patients, suggesting that CD4 depletion in HIV-infected patients is a diagnostic marker of the severity of disease in HIV-infected patients. This finding also suggests that CD4 depletion may be a biomarker for non-HIV cryptococcosis.

Consequently, the CD4 cell counts in non-HIV cryptococcosis patients were significantly lower in non-CD4 cell counts. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that CD4 depletion increases the CD4 cell population in non-HIV cryptococcosis patients [14], [26]. Our results also suggest that CD4 depletion does not increase the CD4 population in non-HIV cryptococcosis patients.
