## Abstract
An Australian man who was diagnosed with brain abscess after stopping the MMRV vaccine was treated with the combination of infliximab and tenofovir (FIVF). This treatment resulted in complete resolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in less than 48 hours and yielded fewer relapses. However, a brain abscess secondary to FIVF infection was detected in a blood sample taken from a session with the flu and resulted in brain maturation and brain homogeneity.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of a brain abscess caused by FIVF in a human immunodeficiency virus patient treated with infliximab. Frequently encountered paradoxical symptoms and high incidences of infection, including viral reactivation, may explain the delay in diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce relapses and improve outcomes.


## Introduction
The Aspergillus genus, including the species Aspergillus fumigatus, is a ubiquitous and opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis (IA) and other life-threatening infections, especially in immunocompromised patients (O’Brien and Gilmore, 2012). The A. fumigatus is classified as aflatoxigenic (AF) and non-AF (e.g., A. fumigatus-1), and the three different types of AF are divided into two distinct families, AF-1, AF-2 and AF-3. The AF-type genus includes notable pathogenic species such as A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. oryzae, A. oryzae and A. oryzae and many other fungi (Tsao et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Although the genus is difficult to eradicate (Li et al., 2017), AF-borne infections are still difficult to treat and remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (O’Brien and Gilmore, 2012; Wang et al., 2014). The available antifungal drugs are limited and do not cover all of the relevant drug targets. The most common antifungal agents are polyenes, azoles, echinocandins and flucytosine (Binder et al., 2010). The last two classes of antifungal drugs are polyenes and triazoles. The major target of azoles is the central nervous system (CNS) and the most important target of azoles is the echinocandins. Among the echinocandin-resistant fungi, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported to be resistant to the echinocandins.


## Methods
heclinicaltrial.gov/). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Missouri Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The patients were screened for the following risks: (1) opportunistic infection; (2) infections caused by microorganisms other than viruses, such as human herpesvirus (HSV), which have been identified by diagnostic methods [14]; (3) tuberculosis; (4) systemic infection, such as disseminated tuberculosis, disseminated bacteremia, and disseminated herpes virus [15]. To assess the potential for fungal contamination, a pan-fungal infection was performed by streptomycin sulfate-sulfate antibiotic (MIC) or chloramphenicol (CMT) sulfate antibiotic (PCM) (S. typhimurium, CMT, and Candida albicans) (S. typhimurium, CMT, and Candida albicans) and amphotericin B (AMB) sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or hygromycin B (HYG) sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). After infection, the inoculum was diluted in sterile PBS to an optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) of 0.5. The patients were monitored twice a day for clinical signs and symptoms. All participants provided informed consent.

In Vivo was performed on the basis of the results of the in vitro experiments. The main purpose of this study was to explore the synergistic effect of the various plant extracts and fungi on the fungal infection of Diarrhea patients (Table 1). The results of the in vitro experiments were then interpreted as follows: (1) In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Lavonoidin B12 in Diarrhea Patients (In Vivo) (In Vivo) (In Vivo)

In Vivo was performed using the same methodology as in the previous study (Table 1).


## Results
Although the results of the broth microdilution method were promising, it was not the most effective against the infectio. In our study, the broth microdilution method yielded negative results for the most active antifungal agents against the infection (Table 2).

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of the lavonoidin were found to be 1.4 and 0.37 µg/mL, respectively, against S. aureus, 1.1 µg/mL against S. aureus, and 0.2 µg/mL against the yeast Candida albicans, respectively (Table 2). A similar result was obtained for the MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of lavonoids against C. albicans and S. aureus.

2.5. Microdilution Results Showed That The In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Lavonoids Were Very Improperly and Utilously Against S. aureus, S. aureus, and C. albicans Infection
The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of lavonoids against S. aureus, S. aureus, and C. albicans were found to be 0.25 and 0.08 µg/mL, respectively, against S. aureus, 1.5 µg/mL against S. aureus, and 0.05 µg/mL against C. albicans, respectively (Table 2).

The MIC_50 and MIC_90 values of lavonoids against S. aureus, S. aureus, and C. albicans were found to be 0.1 and 0.5 µg/mL, respectively, against S. aureus, 1.2 µg/mL against S. aureus, and 0.2 µg/mL against C. albicans, respectively (Table 2).

2.6. Cytotoxicity Test
The cytotoxic effect of lavonoids against C. albicans, S. aureus, and S. aureus was studied in a model of disseminated candidiasis using the mouse inhalation model. The highest toxicity was observed in the acute phase of the disease (Figure 4).

## Discussion
albicans was evaluated in human oral infection. Lavonoidin B12 was effective against C. albicans, whereas the anti-tuberculosis activity was not evaluated. Additionally, the anti-tuberculosis activity of lecithin B12 was not evaluated, and the activity was inversely proportional to the time of treatment.

Results of the present study demonstrate that the activity of Lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was not significant in the time of treatment, except for the time of treatment for 12 days. The activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was inversely proportional to the time of treatment for 12 days.

Phenomenal Antifungal Activity of Lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans
The phenotypic and phenotypic antifungal activity of Lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans has been previously reported. Lavonoidin B12 was reported to be effective against Candida albicans. However, the activity of the drug against C. albicans was not studied. However, the activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was not significantly higher than that of fluconazole. Lavonoidin B12 was reported to be effective against C. albicans. However, the activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was not significantly higher than that of fluconazole.

The results of the present study demonstrate that the activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans is not significantly different from that of fluconazole. However, the activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans is not significantly higher than that of fluconazole. This is in contrast to the results of studies with fluconazole, which showed that the activity of fluconazole was significantly higher than that of the drug.

Phenomenal Antifungal Activity of Lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans
The phenotypic antifungal activity of Lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was evaluated in human vaginal candidiasis. The activity of lavonoidin B12 against C. albicans was significantly higher than that of fluconazole.
