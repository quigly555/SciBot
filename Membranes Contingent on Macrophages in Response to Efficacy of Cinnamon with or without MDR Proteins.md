## Abstract
The complex interplay between fungi and the human immune system has implications for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) of healthy individuals, as well as those caused by opportunistic pathogens such as Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Histoplasma. The use of antifungal peptides, as well as the development of hybrids between innate and adaptive immunity, is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of some fatal fungal infections. The last decade has seen a noticeable emergence of studies focusing on the role of the immune system in host defense against fungal infections. Some of these studies have been inspired by previous work demonstrating that innate immunity is critical for fungal resistance to antimicrobial drugs and that innate immunity plays a critical role for the control of fungi in the CNS.


## Introduction
Bacterial lysis, or the so-called “biotic matrix” (BCM), is the physical matrix that surrounds cells, organelles and tissues. The BCM protects against bacterial infections and is required for successful cell-cell contact. In recent years, the use of antibiotics, anti-tumoral drugs and vaccines against bacterial infections has become a major concern. Antibiotic resistance has been reported in several European countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, China, the UK and China, and is a major concern in many other countries. Among antibiotics, amphotericin B (AMB) is one of the most widely used drugs and the most frequently used by the patients. The most frequently affected sites are oral cavity and urinary tract, but other sites, such as the central nervous system, can be infected. The most common bacterial pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, and the most common fungal pathogen is Candida albicans. The fungal pathogens are responsible for a number of diseases, including life-threatening meningitis, superficial mucocutaneous fungal infections, otitis media, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, and recurrent blastomycosis [1, 2]. The pathogenic fungi are responsible for over a billion infections and are responsible for more than 100,000 deaths annually [3, 4]. Several factors have been associated with the development of resistance to drugs and the emergence of resistance to antimycotic drugs, such as the availability of newer drugs and the emergence of resistance to existing drugs [5]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antifungal agents, which have a low toxicity and high activity.

Antimycotic drugs, such as the polyenes, flucytosine (5-FC), and the azoles, have been the mainstay of therapy for many decades [6, 7]. However, new antifungal agents, which have anti-microbial properties, are urgently needed. The antifungal activity of the polyenes and the fungicidal effects of the azoles are well-known [8, 9]. However, the development of new antifungal agents with strong and low toxicity has been difficult, especially considering the high development of resistance to all existing drugs [10, 11].


## Methods
 µM; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)

The complete absence of cytokines and chemokines in the MDR-PTS was tested by CFU assay (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and macrophage cytokine and chemokine levels were determined by ELIS.

## Discussion
major-infected mic. Wild-type mice were used for the treatment of L. major-infected animals, and proteins were extracted from macrophages in addition to the different flavan-1-derived compounds. The number of active L. major-infected animals was determined by counting the number of L. major-infected cells (in the presence of the flavan-1-containing compounds) in the lungs of L. major-infected mice. The amount of L. major-infected macrophages in the lungs of L. major-infected mice was significantly increased when compared with control mice. However, the amount of L. major-infected macrophages in the lungs of L. major-infected mice was significantly decreased when compared with the controls. The reason for the differences in the levels of proteins in L. major-infected and control mice was not determined. However, the role of the flavan-1-derived compounds in the anti-inflammatory response of L. major-infected mice was further investigated. In addition to the flavan-1-derived compounds, the in vitro response of L. major-infected mice to flavan-1-derived compounds was investigated. The infection with L. major-infected mice was significantly increased by 17.1- to 23.4-fold compared with that in the absence of flavan-1-derived compounds. The same amount of L. major-infected mice was significantly increased in response to flavan-1-derived compounds compared with that in the absence of the flavan-1-derived compounds.

The L. major-infected mice were infected with a different set of flavan-1-derived compounds, which included the flavan-1-containing compounds, but not the flavan-1-derived compounds. The anti-inflammatory response of L. major-infected mice was significantly increased by 8.9-fold compared with that in the absence of the flavan-1-derived compounds. The response of L. major-infected mice to the flavan-1-containing compounds was significantly decreased by 14.9-fold. This difference in the response of L.
