## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a primary immunodeficiency disease that primarily affects the lungs, with a poor prognosis. The incidence of this disease is increasing in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, with an increasing proportion of patients suffering from immunodeficiency conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in Rwanda. We collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 50 patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and performed quantitative PCR for the nuclear identification of the capsular polysaccharide, Cryptococcus neoformans. In total, 26 (26%) patients were males. The most common CSF sites were the perivascular spaces (4%), intracranial (6%) and periventricular spaces (5%). Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was diagnosed in 33 (26%) patients. The overall morbidity was 21.5 %, with an overall survival of 84 %. The most common site was periventricular and intracranial spaces, with 17 (14%) cases each. There was a decrease in the percentage of patients with periventricular and intracranial lesions in the patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, in particular the case of the patient with periventricular and intracranial lesions. Overall the cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was more frequent in HIV-infected patients (P = .


## Introduction
Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) is an important Gram-positive aerobic bacterium that can colonize the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the endothelial cells and can cause disease in immunocompromised patients (1-3). In the absence of adequate and appropriate antibiotic therapy, S. agalactiae is often associated with death, such as in renal transplant recipients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2). S. agalactiae can cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals and animals (4). In addition, S.

## Discussion

In this study, we show that the inhibition of the catalase activity by eugenol induces a protein kinase cascade and that this protein kinase cascade is triggered by euglenol and apoptosis of CD4^+ T cell. The data reported here indicate that the EZ treatment induces apoptosis of CD4^+ T cell. Moreover, the activity of eugenol is associated with a protein kinase cascade and the activation of the CCAAT-family of CAZymes [51]. The activity of catechol-related proteins in CD4^+ T cells was not affected by EZ treatment. It is known that catechol-related proteins are involved in cell wall remodeling, cell membrane remodeling, cell morphology and cell maintenance, and their activation is required for cell survival and proliferation [52]. We found that the expression of a kinase 1 and the secretion of several phosphatases and a protein kinase were inhibited by eugenol. The inhibition of these kinases and their expression were also in agreement with the results reported by Pfaller et al. [53]. The CCAAT-family CAZymes (C1-C2, CD16-C3, CD32-C4, CD44-C5) are important for cell survival and proliferation [54], and their activation is required for cell survival and proliferation [55]. The presence of these CAZymes can be stimulated by eugenol, and their induction is stimulated by eucrium [56], eucrium-derived peptides [57], and eugenol [58].

In the present study, we confirmed that the eugenol-induced apoptosis of CD4^+ T cell is directly involved in the apoptosis of CD4^+ T cell. This suggests that the induction of apoptosis is mediated by the signaling pathways that are activated by eugenol. These pathways are similar to those reported in other fungal species and other mammalian systems [59,60]. It is known that the degradation of the cytochrome P450 (CYP51) by the catalytic subunit of CYP51 is important for the apoptosis of CD4^+ T cells [61,62].
