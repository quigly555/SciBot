## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is an airborne opportunistic fungal pathogen that has caused many medical problems in immunocompromised patients. The transformation of A. fumigatus to a saprophytic mold in the laboratory environment and the ability to transition into filamentous growth in the airways are among the key characteristics that differentiate this fungus from other filamentous fungi. The more A. fumigatus hyphae are grown in the air, the less efficiently it can cause disease. While the direct antifungal properties of A. fumigatus have been well-studied, the antifungal mechanism of the saprophytic fungus, namely the use of aqueous, terpeneic extracts, or in some cases, a few phenols, remains unknown. In this review, we attempt to discuss the antifungal mechanism of the filamentous fungus and the different uses that it has had in medical and scientific fields. We also discuss the various methods that have been tried in the last few years to alleviate the problem of hyphae in the treated airways.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a serious infection of the lung, skin, and other tissues that can lead to severe sequelae. This infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is often asymptomatic and uncontrolled, often causing a serious form of morbidity and mortality that can sometimes be difficult to treat. In particular, cryptococcal infections can be opportunistic and often difficult to treat, and may lead to the development of life-threatening systemic infections. [1] The main etiologic agents are yeasts such as Cryptococcus neoformans, [2] Candida albicans, [3] Candida glabrata, [4] and, most commonly, C.


## Methods
The purified MMC-3 protein was obtained by affinity chromatography on a 20% Tris-glycine-EDTA (TB-EDTA) column using a hexane/acetic acid gradient (0-20%) for 3 hour. The column was eluted with an equal volume of ddH_2O. The column was washed with ddH_2O to remove unbound MMC-3 and eluted with a volume of ddH_2O. The product was concentrated using a SpeedVac^® Plus C_18 column (GE Healthcare). The elution volume of elution was 1 µl and the protein concentration was adjusted to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. The concentration of MMC-3 was determined using the ECL Western Blotting Assay Kit (GE Healthcare). The assay was performed in triplicate.

MMC-3-mediated expression of E. coli BL21-Blue-specific (eBioscience) and MMC-3-mediated (eBioscience) E. coli BL21-Blue-specific (eBioscience) LAMP-2 transporters
The E. coli BL21-Blue-specific LAMP-2 transporters were synthesized by the T-biofilm assay method [36]. The purified enzyme was purified from the culture supernatant using the QIAGEN (QIAGEN) and subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect the protein bands and to confirm the specificity of the transporters. The E. coli BL21-Blue-specific LAMP-2 transporters were synthesized by the T-biofilm assay method [37].

## Results
CD8+ T cells have been shown to be highly efficient at controlling inflammation and inflammation-induced pulmonary disease [14,15. However, CD8+ T cells failed to prime for virulence in the murine model of cryptococcosis (Table 1), and the fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans was comparable to those of uninfected mice. Moreover, in this infection, the mice were all infected at the early time point (Figure 1). The analysis of the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice after a period of 2 days showed that the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice was significantly reduced compared to that in uninfected mice (Figure 2). This result was also confirmed by imaging of the lungs of mice in the absence of CD8+ T cells (Figure 2). However, the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice was significantly higher than that in uninfected mice (Figure 2). These findings were also confirmed by the histopathology of the lung tissues of mice infected with C. neoformans (Figure 3). Furthermore, the finding of high levels of fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice in the absence of CD8+ T cells was further confirmed by histopathology of the lung tissues of mice infected with C. neoformans and C. gattii (Figure 3). This finding was also confirmed by histopathology of the lung tissues of mice infected with C. neoformans and C. gattii (Figure 3). These findings were also confirmed by the in vitro assays of CD4+ T cells that were used in this study (Table 2).

CD8+ T Cells Protect Lung Membrane from C. neoformans Infection
Because of the substantial and consistent reductions in fungal burden in the lungs of C. neoformans-infected mice in the absence of CD8+ T cells, we next examined the protection of the lung tissues of infected C. neoformans-infected mice with CD8+ T cells. As shown in Figure 4, the lung tissues of infected mice were protected from infection with C. neoformans, as shown by the results of lung morphology and histopathology. Furthermore, the lungs of infected mice exhibited a clear and distinct pattern of fungal cell infiltrate in the lungs of infected mice, indicating that the C.


## Discussion
The majority of studies of the importance of HA-P class and its subclasses in fungal pathogenesis have focused on a few species. The first one is that of Ustilago maydis [15], in which HA-P class is the major class, and Ustilago maydis is an isolated species. Another species is that of Ustilago bicolor [14]. Ustilago maydis is a pathogenic fungus that causes hemolytic sepsis in humans, and it is an opportunistic pathogen that is highly virulent in humans [14]. In addition, Ustilago bicolor was found to be a causative agent of human infections [14]. Similarly, Ustilago maydis and Ustilago hordei were found to be involved in the pathogenicity of S. schenckii [14]. Ustilago hordei is a fungus that was found to be pathogenic to humans [14]. The most common HA-P-class fungi that cause infectious diseases in humans are Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatidis [14]. Blastomyces dermatidis is a yeast that causes skin and mucosal infections in humans and has been reported to cause chronic, life-threatening infections. It has been reported that some Blastomyces strains are capable of causing skin infections, skin infection of the arm [46] and skin infection of the leg [47].
