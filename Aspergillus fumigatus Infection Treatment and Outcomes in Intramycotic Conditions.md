## Introduction
Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungal genus with close phylogenetic relationship to Aspergillus nidulans. The genus comprises two species, P. jirovecii and P. minima. The species are distributed worldwide and cause serious diseases in immunocompromised patients [1]. Pneumocystis jirovecii is one of the most prevalent fungal species, causing respiratory and skin diseases in humans [2]. It is also a major cause of opportunistic infection in AIDS patients [3],  [4],  [5],  [6]. Inhalation of P. jirovecii spores can cause several diseases ranging from localized to disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients.


## Methods
graminearum was adapted from [12], with modification. Fungal stocks of S. cerevisiae were inoculated on the edge of a dissecting board. Groups of 7-10 week-old S. cerevisiae were used for infection and growth control. For infection, 5-10 mL of spore suspension (1×10^6 CFU ml^-1) was placed on a sterile plastic slide and allowed to dry out. Spores were transferred on slides by gentle agitation with a sterile needle and removed from the slide with a sterile razor. The spore suspension was then spread on sterile coverslip paper. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 days. At the end of the incubation, the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted.

The inoculated insect larvae were dissected from the margins of infected individuals using a sterile razor blade. The tissues were homogenized in sterile PBS using a pestle and mortar. The homogenate was filtered through a 0.2-µm nylon filter to remove the unbound spores and then diluted to 1×10^8 CFU ml^-1. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 days.

S. cerevisiae growth control was carried out using the liquid-phase growth assay as described by [12]. In brief, S. cerevisiae suspensions of 10^6 spores ml^-1 were prepared from stock suspensions of S. cerevisiae (1×10^6 spores ml^-1) as described above. Three replicates were performed for each condition.

Determination of the Cell Cycle Potential
The effect of rifampicin on the viability of the sessile cells was determined by incubation of S. cerevisiae cells in a shaker at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The concentration of rifampicin in the supernatant was determined with the method described by [13]. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was used for determining the number of viable cells.

Construction of the cDNA Sequencing Library
Total RNA was isolated from the infected S.


## Results
The outcome was established as a paradoxical outcome with a better outcome at all time points evaluated (Table 4. The survival rate for the 1,000 patients was 100% at the end of the study period. A 4-month mortality rate of 50% was observed in all patients, with no mortality observed in any of the outlier. The mean cumulative CD4^+ T-cell count of the patients was 1.4 log_10^3 (95% CI: 1.1-1.5, p < 0.001). The mean cumulative CD4^+ T-cell count of the patients was 2 log_10^2 (95% CI: 1.0-2.5, p < 0.001). The mean cumulative CD4^+ T-cell count of the patients was 1.0 log_10^2 (95% CI: 1.0-1.5, p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 8.4% (95% CI: 7.0-19.1, p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 10.3% (95% CI: 9.5-21.9, p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 6.5% (95% CI: 5.5-9.0, p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 8.9% (95% CI: 5.5-9.0, p < 0.001) in patients with a CD4^+ T-cell count of 2 log_10^2 (95% CI: 1.0-2.5, p < 0.001).

Overall mortality rates and outcome parameters were similar between the outlier and control groups (Table 5). The mortality rate was 92.9% in patients with a CD4^+ T-cell count of 2 log_10^2 (95% CI: 92.9-96.0, p < 0.001). The mortality rate was 30.8% (95% CI: 31.2-34.5, p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 4.8% (95% CI: 4.9-8.4, p < 0.001).


## Discussion
Three co-localization patterns for the two loci in this phylogenetic tree are evident. The first is the second shared by the two sequences from both loci (Fig 1). A high degree of conservation was observed in the first locus, and in the second locus, and the divergence of the sequences from the first locus was evident in both loci. The divergence of the two sequences from the first locus was much stronger in the first locus than in the second locus (Fig 1).
