## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are difficult to treat and often require the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Neutropenic patients with fungal infection are at increased risk for invasive fungal disease. We describe a patient with a C. gattii invasive fungal infection in a critically ill patient. Although the patient presented with non-specific symptoms and radiological findings, he was initially diagnosed with C. gattii. Because of the high mortalities and poor outcome, an in-depth investigation of this infection is essential to gain a better understanding of the risks and prognosis involved in this difficult and challenging disease.


## Introduction
Protein glycosylation is a ubiquitous modification of the cellular surface and functions, acting as a cofactor in protein trafficking and attachment to host cells. In Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, the regulation of the cell surface consists of multiple isoforms that are encoded by various genes, which in some cases can be transferred to the nucleus and delivered to the cytoplasmic organelles by actin polymerization [1]. Phosphoinositides (PCs) are protein coat proteins that are produced from phospholipids, which are synthesized in the cytosol by cell membrane glycoproteins. PCs are composed of proteins of different types, which are grouped into families based on their functions [2]. In general, PCs contain two types of glycosyl residues, C-terminal glycans and C-terminal cysteines, and, when present, are phosphorylated by the GPI-anchored protein Spo11 to form the Ile1 complex [3]. In bacteria and fungi, the glycosylation of PCs is initiated by the Ile1 protein, which is ubiquitously expressed. Upon engagement of the cysteine residue, the glycans can be cleaved to form glycoproteins and proteins, which then enter the nucleus and are delivered to the cytoplasmic organelles by actin polymerization [1]. Although the glycosylation of PCs is conserved, the glycosyltransferases (GT) encoded by these enzymes are different from the other members of the PC glycosyltransferases. In fungi, the glycosylation of PCs is initiated by the Ile1 protein, which is conserved in both fungi and plants and, when present, are delivered to the nucleus by actin polymerization and glycosylation [3]. In addition, the Ile1 protein has been found to be involved in the biosynthesis of several proteins including lipoproteins, protein-drugs, and antibodies [4]. This protein consists of a carbohydrate-binding domain, which has a unique three-domain motif, and a variable number of non-coding sequences.


## Methods
For the CCT, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell count, and HIV RNA levels, the patients’ responses were considered as positive when the relative survival rate was >50% [25. The LOS was defined as the presence of a positive control of the disease with no LOS or negative control of the disease. The LOS was defined as the LOS present in more than one patient at the same time.

Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Amedeo di Savoy (Affaires-Proc.) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Amedeo di Savoy, S.L. (Affaires-Proc.). All studies were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Amedeo di Savoy (Affaires-Proc.).

Cryptococcal antigen retrieval and antigen clearance
All the CSF samples from the blood, CSF, and pulmonary specimens were collected at the same time, according to the established procedure for CCT [26,27]. The assays were performed according to the standard protocols of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [28], using the following antigen-specific antigens: the 6-hydroxyphenyl-3-methyl-2-p-phenylthiourea (6-MPT) antigen (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), the phorbol myristate acetate dehydrate antigen (PMA-antioxapine; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and the glycerol monostearate thymolase (GST; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The concentrations of the tested antigens were determined at a range of concentrations (0 to 16 µg/mL), and the results were recorded as the percentage of the sample that was positive for the tested antigen.

Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.


## Results
As a result, more than 70% of Candida species are resistant to antifungal drugs [1. Treatment with high doses of caspofungin (30 µg/ml) leads to mortality of patients with candidemia, while 25 µg/ml is effective in treating candidemia [2]. As a result, C. albicans is treated with a combination of azoles, fluconazole (fluconazole-based therapy), and amphotericin B (fluconazole-based therapy) [1]. The use of fluconazole in patients with candidemia and pulmonary cryptococcosis has been shown to cause mortality and morbidity [2]. Although caspofungin treatment can lead to mortality, survival rates of candidemia patients with C. albicans are decreased in comparison with patients with candidemia, as indicated by the use of fluconazole as the first-line therapy [1].

Histopathology of Cryptococcal Lymphadenitis in a Patient with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia on the Antifungal Therapy
Histopathology of the Lymphadenopathy in a Patient with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia on the Antifungal Therapy
Histopathologic examination is an important component of the antifungal therapy for multiple myeloma and candidiasis. Two studies have demonstrated that antifungal therapy is associated with improved histopathologic resolution of candidiasis [1,25,26]. Additionally, C. albicans is more resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin B than C. neoformans and C. glabrata, which are associated with the development of candidiasis [1,2]. In this study, the antifungal therapy of fluconazole and amphotericin B resulted in mortality of C. albicans patients with candidemia and elevated hemoglobin (Hb) of <70% compared with the control group. In addition, there were significant differences in mortality between patients with candidemia and controls (P < 0.001). In addition, patients with candidemia had significantly higher levels of serum hemoglobin than the controls, suggesting a role for the immune system in this case.


## Discussion
Unfortunately, the patient had not received treatment with fluconazol. The patient was in a non-neutropenic chronic granulomatous inflammation, which was likely the result of a concurrent immunocompromised state. The patient was not immunocompetent and thus may not have received the appropriate treatment.

A patient with Cryptococcus neoformans infection who had a non-neutropenic granulomatous inflammation and was treated with fluconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B was treated with itraconazole, flucytosine, and fluconazole, respectively. This patient had a history of non-neutropenic granulomatous inflammation, which may have been the result of a concurrent immunocompromised state. The patient was in a non-neutropenic chronic granulomatous inflammation, which was likely the result of a concurrent immunocompromised state. The patient had a history of cryptococcal meningitis, which may have been the result of a concurrent immunocompromised state.
