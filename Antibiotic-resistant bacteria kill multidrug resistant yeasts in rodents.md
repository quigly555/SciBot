## Abstract
The fungal component of the oral cavity is an important source of bioactive molecules and thus, the antimicrobial activities of currently available antifungal agents. Antimicrobial peptides are novel classes of molecules that have recently been applied to various fields of medicine, cosmetology and electronics. Since the therapeutic effects of antifungal drugs have been well-known, the development of new antifungal drugs with novel mechanisms of action and/or drug resistance is an interesting possibility. Antimicrobial peptides have been used as vehicles for the drug development. However, the physicochemical properties of peptides and their antifungal activity are not yet fully known. In this study, we report the characterization and characterization of a novel peptide derived from the bacterium Pseudomonas jessenii. The peptide displayed potent antifungal activity against several pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Rhizopus oryzae, and it was reported to possess an amino acid sequence that is identical to that of the antifungal drug Avastin.


## Introduction
Microorganisms in the intestinal tract are prone to enter the bloodstream through respiratory tract infections.1 The bacterial outer membrane of Gram-negative species can be affected by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.2,3 This has led to the suggestion that Gram-negative bacteria should be associated with the pathogenic process.4

The outer membrane of Gram-negative species is characterized by the presence of a high amount of proteins, lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acid (L-SNO).5 The outer membrane is composed of oligosaccharides of different size and composition. The composition is dependent on the species, but can be determined by the time it is taken up by the bacteria.


## Methods
 2014. The best-fitting model for the SFMC is called the A. fumigatus-mediated pathogen model (Hu et al., 2014). The above model is based on the main assumption that the TFMC is a well-defined system that can have a wide range of possible values of G. mellonella survival rates. The model for the B. malayi model is more conservative, allowing for a wide range of values of survival rates for each species. The SFMC model is based on a similar assumption that fungi are universally lethal for the target organism. The main assumption is that fungi are known to be less likely to infect other animals than for the control. The SFMC model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the S. cerevisiae model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the C. albicans model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Candida model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Cryptococcus neoformans model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Candida krusei model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Candida parapsilosis model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Candida tropicalis model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Candida parapsilosis model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the Cryptococcus neoformans model is based on the assumption that pathogen-free mice are more likely to die from a pathogen than from a bacterial infection. The model for the C.


## Results
As a result, we were unable to test for resistant bacteria in our studie.

We hypothesized that the specific antifungal activity of P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin would be reflected in their ability to kill the most susceptible, in this case, the most resistant. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin, are able to resist the most resistant yeasts and produce a variety of antimicrobial-resistant peptides [11]. We were unable to determine the most resistant antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin, because the MICs were increased from 4 to 64 µg/ml. In contrast, we were able to test for the most resistant antibiotic-resistant bacteria by testing their ability to produce the antimicrobial-resistant peptides (Table 1). P. aeruginosa showed the highest MIC for P. aeruginosa for P_I, and P. lucimarin showed the lowest MIC for P_II and P_III. The most resistant bacteria were P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin (Table 1). All of the resistant bacteria tested were Gram-negative organisms. The MICs for P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin were 2-6-fold and 6-fold, respectively, higher for P_I and P_II than for P_III. However, P. aeruginosa showed higher MICs for P_II and P_III than P_I and P_II and P_III.

P. aeruginosa showed a significantly lower MIC (2-16 µg/ml) for P_I and P_II than P_III (Table 1). The most resistant bacteria were P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin (Table 1). The most resistant bacteria were P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin (Table 1). The MICs for P. lucimarin for P_I and P_II were 2-4-fold higher than those of P_I and P_II and P_III, respectively. The most resistant bacteria were P. aeruginosa and P. lucimarin (Table 1). P. aeruginosa and P.


## Discussion
 2013. Our study shows that P. aeruginosa had the ability to persist in the lungs of mice infected with E. coli-resistant H99 after 3 days of infection. This bacterium is a major pathogen in humans and is known to be a major pathogen in birds, bats, reptiles, fishes and amphibians (Cian-Gutar et al., 2013). The bacterium is highly virulent in mice, but in mice only, where it has a survival advantage, but it has not been completely eliminated in mice (Cianflone et al., 2013). It has also been reported that the ability of P. aeruginosa to grow in the lungs of mice infected with H99 is not completely dependent on its environment (Cianflone et al., 2013). Therefore, we speculate that P. aeruginosa can persist in the lungs of mice and that H99-resistant mice might have similar innate immune responses.

The ability of P. aeruginosa to grow in the lungs of mice infected with E. coli-resistant H99 (13,48 h) was also associated with the ability of the bacterium to grow in the lungs of mice infected with H99 (13,48 h). The ability of P. aeruginosa to grow in the lungs of mice infected with E. coli-resistant H99 (13,48 h) was also associated with the ability to grow in the lungs of mice infected with H99 (13,48 h).
