## Abstract
The fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has emerged as a key agent for the first time in the environment, causing many health problems in endemic regions due to its polymicroorganism and multidrug resistance. Invasive mycoses are a very common and often difficult to manage often resulting in death and disability. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have long been used for the treatment of infectious and malignant diseases, as well as several surgical procedures. AMPs are highly conserved among all eukaryotes and they are essential for the maintenance of their biological functions and the regulation of gene expression. In this article, we review the use of AMPs in the management of infectious and neoplastic mycoses caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, as well as the role of AMPs in the control of other human and animal diseases, including respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, alternative and more effective AMPs are also described for the control of autoimmune, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other diseases.


## Introduction
Marine fungi inhabit close to every terrestrial habitat in the world, including in Arctic regions and on the Antarctic continent, but marine fungi have a diverse range of habitats, including living and dead regions on the sea floor (1, 2). These habitats are associated with high levels of radiation, nutrient cycling, and the presence of metabolic enzymes (e.g., creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine oxidase) that may be exploited for the production of organic materials, including methanol, fatty acids, and other long chain precursors (3).


## Methods
albicans (CATG_004, CATG_003, CATG_002 and CATG_001) in .01% Tween 80 (v/v) for 3 days, after which the mycelium was filtered and washed with distilled water. The fungi were then inoculated on blood agar plates containing 0.01% Tween 80 and incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. The inhibition zones were measured on a Versamax Optima plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The results were expressed as the diameter of inhibition zone in µg of protein per mg of dry weight. The lower limit of the assay is defined as the effective concentration of the compounds that produced no visible growth.

4.3. Antimicrobial Activity of Fungal Isolates
The antimicrobial activity of all the fungal extracts was measured by the formation of an insoluble suspension of cellophane. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes and washed with sterile distilled water before the preparation of the extracts. Fungal extracts were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) of 0.2-0.3 mg/mL and the suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The bacterial colonies were counted, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated by comparison with a control without cellophane. The results were expressed as the mean of three replicates.

4.3. Antimicrobial Activity of Fungal Isolates
The MICs of compounds were determined using the broth micro-dilution method as described by McIlwain et al. [40]. Briefly, the crude extract of C. albicans SC5314 (100 mg/mL in sterile saline) was diluted with distilled water to an OD_600nm of 0.3 and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The bacterial suspension was transferred to a 96-well polypropylene plate and the optical density at 600 nm (OD_600nm) of the suspension was read. The concentrations of compounds in the supernatant were determined by using the method reported by McIlwain et al. [40].


## Results
The MIC_50 values of the seven selected antifungal drugs ranged from .375 to 250 µg/ml for the five most active plant extracts, including D. minima (Table 1). The MIC_50 values of the extracts ranged from 0.125 to 250 µg/ml for the five most active plant extracts, including D. minima (Table 2). The MIC_50 values of the extracts ranged from 0.125 to 250 µg/ml for the six most active plant extracts, including D. minima.

3.3. Antifungal Activity of Plant-Based Antifungal Compounds against The Isolates of F. verticillioides
The MIC_50 values of the seven selected antifungal drugs were evaluated against five of the five most active plant extracts, including D. minima, D. minima, and D. minima. The MIC_50 values of the six most active plant extracts ranged from 0.375 to 250 µg/ml for the plant-based antifungal compounds, including D. minima, D. minima, and D. minima. The MIC_50 values of the six most active plant extracts ranged from 0.375 to 250 µg/ml for the six most active plant extracts, including D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, and D. minima.

3.4. Antifungal Activity of Plant-Based Antifungal Compounds against Isolates of F. verticillioides
The MIC_50 values of the seven selected antifungal compounds ranged from 0.375 to 125 µg/ml for the five most active plant extracts, including D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, and D. minima. The MIC_50 values of the six most active plant extracts ranged from 0.375 to 125 µg/ml for the six most active plant extracts, including D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, D. minima, and D.
