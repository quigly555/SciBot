## Abstract
Stereotar die-ring length polymorphisms (STPs) are an integral part of the genome machinery used to generate eukaryotic genomes. These types of polymorphisms are found throughout the eukaryotic tree of life. In contrast, the nuclear genome of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is comprised of a small number of STPs. The majority of these STPs are located in the outer and inner regions of chromosomes. These regions are predominantly composed of elongated, multivalent regions with occasional pentose and short, bic acid-rich regions. The elongated regions have more repeats than shorter chromosomes. These comparisons reveal that the number of different, bic acid-rich and elongated regions in the nuclear genome is significantly greater than that in the genomes of two closely related species: the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans and the dimorphic human pathogen C. gattii. The largest size of the N-terminal region of the N-terminal STP in C. neoformans is in the genotype (STP) cluster compared with the other four branches of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster (basidia, nuc and minor sequences). A smaller size of the STP in C. gattii is in the cluster compared with the other four branches of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster (basidia, nuc and minor sequences). These results indicate that the nuclear genome is a much larger structure than previously thought.


## Introduction

## Methods
Patients were recruited from all the major medical centers in Kampala and the capital, Kampala, Uganda, and were HIV-negativ. Patients were excluded if they were already on antiretroviral treatment for at least 3 months prior to study entry and were not on antiretroviral therapy for more than 1 month prior to study entry. All patients were monitored by two experienced pharmacologists to determine the use of antiretroviral therapy.

The efficacy of the antiretroviral therapy was evaluated by a two-sided Fisher’s exact test with a probability value of 95%. The patients were divided into two groups; non-treated and active control groups, in order to obtain a group comparison. The efficacy of the treatment was calculated as follows: (1) Compensatory efficacy; (2) Compensatory efficacy; (3) Compensatory efficacy; (4) Compensatory efficacy.

Data collection
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases at University of KwaZulu-Natal (Protocol No. 13/2012) and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. All the patients provided written informed consent by their first name or by their last name.

The study was approved by the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) (No. 8/2012), Ministry of Health (No. 03/2013), and Research Ethics Committee (No. 13/2013). The study was conducted with the approval of the Ugandan National Council for Science and Technology (No.13/2014). The protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Protocol No. 11/2015) and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

The patients were divided into four groups: non-treated, active control, and active control group. The first group received antiretroviral therapy as previously described. The second group received the placebo in the form of the antiretroviral therapy and was referred to the hospital for further treatment. The third group received the first antiretroviral therapy as previously described. All the patients were treated by the same combination of antiretroviral therapy, while the patients were treated with the placebo.


## Results
fujikuroi genome contains a total of 819 genes (Table S1. These genes are highly conserved in eukaryotes, with five of them encoding enzymes involved in metabolic pathways (Table S1). Among the genes found in F. fujikuroi, LFA1, LFA2, and LFA3 are essential for pathogenicity, and are essential for pathogen-host interactions (Table S2). The F. fujikuroi genome has two gene models for LFA1 (PHK1 and KRE2) and one gene model for LFA2 (PHK3) that are functionally redundant in F. fujikuroi. These genes are essential for pathogenicity in fungi, including F. fujikuroi and F. oxysporum [32]. The LFA3 gene model is functionally redundant in F. fujikuroi, and is conserved in both fungi and eukaryotes, and is also important for virulence in a model of acute infection in human. The F. fujikuroi genome has a large number of genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, including phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) and glyoxylate cyclase (GCK1), which are critical for pathogenicity in F. fujikuroi [33,34,35,36]. LFA1 and LFA2 encode enzymes involved in the oxidation of polysaccharides to polyols, such as flavonoids, terpenes, and flavonols [37,38,39,40,41]. LFA1 and LFA2 encode enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin to alcohols and pectic derivatives, and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides, such as pectate kinase (PCK1), phenyl-6-phosphate decarboxylase (PIck1), pectin acetyltransferase (PIEC), and aromatic dimers (AMPH).

The F. fujikuroi genome has two gene models for LFA2 (PHK1 and KRE2) and one gene model for LFA2 (PHK3) that are functionally redundant in F. fujikuroi. These genes are essential for pathogenicity in fungi, including F. fujikuroi and F.


## Discussion
A total of 210 patients underwent cardiac pacemakers and 150 patients underwent total cardiac pacemakers of . albicans (P = 0.05), C. tropicalis (P = 0.06), C. krusei (P = 0.05), and C. tropicalis (P = 0.05). The total number of patients with C. albicans infection was 27 (21.6%), C. krusei (18.4%), C. tropicalis (13.2%), and C. krusei (7.1%). The patient’s age was 35 years (IQR of 30-44 years). The patients’ sex was male (Rostal-bergen) and female (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05). The patient’s age was 34 years (IQR of 25-35 years). The patients’ sex was male (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) and female (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05). The patient’s age was 35 years (IQR of 35-39 years). The patients’ sex was male (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) and female (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05). The patients’ sex was male (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) and female (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) (Table 1).

The patients’ age was 34 years (IQR of 34-45 years). The patient’s age was 33 years (IQR of 33-35 years). The patients’ sex was male (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) and female (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.05) (Table 1). The patient’s age was 35 years (IQR of 35-39 years). The patient’s age was 32 years (IQR of 32-37 years). The patients’ sex was male (Berkman-Voisin) (P = 0.
