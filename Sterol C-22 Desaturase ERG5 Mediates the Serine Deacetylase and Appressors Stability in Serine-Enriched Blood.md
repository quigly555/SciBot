## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is a neglected, life-threatening fungal infection mainly affecting immunocompromised hosts. Treatment options are limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of essential oils (EOs) of two thyme species, Thymus sylvaticus and Thymus rust, on the growth and susceptibility of C. neoformans and C. gattii in Sydney and Merigon, Australia. Fresh thyme leaf extracts were prepared and characterized using HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The antifungal activity of the thyme species, thyme essential oil (TEO) and thyme-on-yeast (TB-yeast) extracts was determined by using broth microdilution method and broth exclusion and site-directed extraction method. The antifungal activity of the thyme essential oil, thyme extract, and thyme-on-yeast extracts was determined using broth microdilution method and broth exclusion and site-directed extraction method. The MIC values for the thyme essential oil were determined using the recommended exposure time of 1.5 to 2 minutes for TEO and 1 to 2 minutes for TB-yeast. The susceptibility testing of the extracts against four strains of C.


## Introduction
In contrast to the mammalian ERG5, Serine desaturase is expressed as a homolog of the mammalian ERG5 and is found in the ERG5/8-ESR (endoplasmic reticulum) glycoprotein comple. It is a member of the PbsG protein family. Serine desaturase is a multi-pass protein and is expressed in both cytoplasmic and intraluminal Golgi membranes. As a single-pass protein, it is highly expressed in the plasma membrane and is involved in cell signaling pathways, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Unlike the mammalian ERG5, the serine desaturase activity is induced by many other pathogenic microbes and is linked to the resistance to cell wall perturbing agents [25,26].

In addition to yeast, other opportunistic pathogens are often associated with PbSSC. In the model yeast Candida albicans, serine desaturase activity is induced by high pH, neutral or slightly acidic conditions and is associated with pseudohyphal growth [27,28,29]. Similarly, the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans serine desaturase is induced by high temperature and moderately acidic conditions [30,31]. The role of serine desaturase in the host response to fungal infections has not been thoroughly investigated.

The serine desaturase domain of the PbsG protein family is involved in the metabolism of many cellular substrates, including carbon sources, amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids. In addition, PbsG proteins can be divided into two groups, namely, PbsG-like and PbsG-/Ctr, which can be classified according to their characteristics into groups I and II, respectively [32]. PbsG-like proteins can be classified according to their characteristics into groups I and II (“pre-pbs”). PbsG proteins are small, cytosolic proteins that can be secreted and secreted at the cell membrane. They are characterized by the characteristic circular conformation and have a central membrane, which supports the growth of yeast cells and helps them to penetrate the cell wall [33]. The pre-pbs are proteins that have a membrane-binding role. PbsG proteins are organized in the Golgi complex and are mainly present in the Golgi complex.

Molecular methods
T. reesei cells were grown in YPD at 30°C with shaking. For the assays, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-phagocytosed T. reesei, and then resuspended in PBS at the required concentration. Cell density was determined by using an optical density at 595 nm (OD_600) at OD_595 nm.

For the study of the significance of the difference of the cell density between the untreated and treated strains, the following analysis was performed, using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant. In order to determine the cell density differences between the treated and untreated strains, the following analysis was performed, using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant.

For the study of the antagonism of the antifungal drugs, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant. In order to compare the antagonism of the drugs on the target cells, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant. In order to determine the antagonism of the drugs on the non-target cells, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant. In order to compare the antagonism of the drugs on the two-hundredth percentile of the cell density between the untreated and treated strains, the following analysis was performed, using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, with a value of p<0.05 considered statistically significant.

To determine the effect of the antimicrobial agents on the fungal growth, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS at the required concentration. The suspension was then adjusted to an OD_600 of 0.


## Results
We found that the amino acid sequence of the serine in this region was conserved with the sequences of the C-22 desaturase Erg3 and Erg. The C-23 desaturase Erg3 was found to be highly conserved with the sequences of the C-22 desaturase Erg5, but was missing from the C-23 desaturase Erg6. The amino acid sequence of the serine in the C-23 desaturase Erg5 region was found to be very similar to the sequence of the C-22 desaturase Erg5 (Supplementary Fig S4A). These findings suggest that Serine residues in the C-23 desaturase Erg5 region may be conserved with the C-22 desaturase Erg5. These results also indicate that the serine in the C-23 desaturase Erg5 region may be involved in the maintenance of the C-22 desaturase Erg5.

The C-23 desaturase Erg5 is Necessary for C. neoformans Stromal Infection and Systemic Infection
Our previous study showed that the C-23 desaturase Erg5, which is involved in virulence, is required for the development of the systemic infection model of cryptococcal meningitis (4). To test whether the C-23 desaturase Erg5 is required for the development of systemic infection, we also created C-23 desaturase Erg5 deletion mutants. This strain was previously shown to be attenuated in virulence in a murine model of cryptococcal meningitis (4). We first confirmed that the C-23 desaturase Erg5 is required for C. neoformans virulence in a murine model of cryptococcal meningitis. The C-23 desaturase Erg5 deletion mutant was found to be attenuated in virulence in a murine model of cryptococcal meningitis (4).

Next, we examined the virulence of the C-23 desaturase Erg5 in a murine model of cryptococcal meningitis.


## Discussion
In this study, we further identified a C-22 desaturase from the dendritic cells that is involved in cytokine signalin. The C-22 desaturase from C. elegans is an immunoreceptor containing cysteine-rich, serine-rich protein kinase (S5A-I) that plays a central role in cytokine signaling, and is involved in the development of a parasite infection [46].

Sterol C-22 is a serine-rich serine-rich protein kinase, with Serine-33 and Serine-39 in its sequence (Figure 3). C-22 desaturase from the same fungus, Stenotrophomonas sp, is also involved in cytokine signaling. The C-22 desaturase from Stenotrophomonas sp from the human body secretes a serine-rich protein kinase (SKS) domain, which is highly conserved among the protein kinases from other fungi. However, the mechanism of action of the C-22 desaturase from the fungus M. oryzae remains unknown. In this study, we found that the C-22 desaturase from the fungal pathogen T. rubrum, which is associated with the genital tract of humans, is involved in the development of a leucopenia. This result suggests that C-22 desaturase from T. rubrum may play a key role in the development of leucopenia.

In contrast, we found that the C-22 desaturase from the human cervical lymphoid tissue plays an important role in the development of leucopenia. The C-22 desaturase from the human cervical lymphoid tissue is an immunoreceptor containing cysteine-rich serine-39 and it plays a key role in the development of leucopenia [47]. In this study, we found that the C-22 desaturase from T. rubrum, which is associated with the genital tract of humans, plays an important role in the development of leucopenia.
