## Abstract
The aim of this study was to explore the possible roles of HOG2 in the development of the severe sepsis and septic shock syndrome (SSSS) in the rat. The results presented here indicated that HOG2 is required for optimal the development of the sepsis and septic shock syndrome. Furthermore, HOG2 is necessary for the development of the severe sepsis and septic shock syndrome. These results suggested that HOG2 might be involved in the development of the SSSS.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients in many countries [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are about 1.5 million deaths each year due to IFIs in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) [2]. The majority of these deaths are caused by Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus and other non-albicans Candida species [2, 3]. The most common fungal species associated with IFIs are Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei. Other common fungal species associated with IFIs include Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. krusei [2, 4].

Considering the fact that there is a high number of antifungal drug resistance in Candida species [5], the development of new antifungal drugs for these species remains a challenge. There are only two classes of antifungals that are used for the treatment of invasive candidiasis; azoles and echinocandins. Azoles are the first-line antifungal class that targets ergosterol and provides fungicidal activity by the inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14a-demethylase and ergosterol synthesis [6]. It is also the first-line fungicidal class against a broad spectrum of fungal species including C. albicans, C. glabrata, and A. fumigatus.

The ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is essential for the ergosterol synthesis of most echinocandins, including the azoles [6].


## Methods
Briefly, the . cepacia complex (Fc) consists of four major plant-like genera: F. cepacia, F. cinerea, F. graminearum, F. graminearum, and F. niger. The Fc complex is a member of the Congo Fusarium complex (CF), which consists of four major plant-like genera: F. oxysporum, F. oxysporum brevis, F. oxysporum patens, F. oxysporum schizopane, F. sp., and F. sp. Wilhelmina (Beilin et al. 2012). The F. sp. brevis complex is a member of the tree-bearing genera of Pinus spp., which include Pinus sp. and Pinus sp. Xanthorium spp. (Brennan and Seidel 2001), Pinus sp. xanthorium (Brennan and Seidel 2001), and Pinus sp. xanthorium (Brennan and Seidel 2001). A single F. oxysporum species was identified from the F. oxysporum complex of the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (CBS) Utrecht, The Netherlands, and is deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Exeter, The Netherlands.

Fungal material
F. cinerea f. cinerea isolates were obtained from a genetic study of F. cinerea from an area of the Phytophthora infestans [7]. F. cinerea f. cinerea isolates were selected for the study of the F. cinerea complex based on the morphology and morphological characteristics. The isolate was obtained from the field in Utrecht, The Netherlands, where a new species of F. cinerea was identified. F. cinerea f. cinerea f. cinerea isolate was isolated from a soil sample and was deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Exeter, The Netherlands.

F. cinerea f. cinerea f. cinerea (Fc) cinerea f. cinerea f. cinerea (Fc) complex was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 48 h at 37Â°C.

## Discussion
The phylogenetic position of the genus Trichosporon is uncertain because of their relationship with the type species of Trichosporon (T. dujardin, T. dujardin, T. dujardin, T. doncaiense). The genus Trichosporon was originally described by Teixeira et al. (2009), but their original taxonomic assignments are still controversial because the type species of T. dujardin and T.
