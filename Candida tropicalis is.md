## Abstract
The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii is a member of the order Erwinia and is responsible for multiple life-threatening infections in humans and animals. The order’s response to such infections, and the ability of this fungus to develop new strategies to contain the immune response, has been subject of recent studies.


## Introduction
The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against fungal infections. Innate immune system is composed of phagocytes that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as danger signals. Innate immune system can detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as toxins, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and DNA. Innate immune system can respond to the presence of danger signals by triggering a pattern recognition and response (PRR) cascade. PRRs are different from conventional PRRs, which are cell-associated proteins that are secreted into the extracellular milieu. Innate immune system produces cytokines and chemokines that initiate and control the immune response.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
M. tuberculosis strain M. tuberculosis strains were grown in 2% w/v glucose-agar medium at 28°C for 1-2 days, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in distilled water to a final concentration of 2.5 × 10^3 CFU/ml. M. tuberculosis inoculum was prepared by growing M.


## Results
The gut-associated fungal infection has not been associated with the ingestion of plants, algae, or insects (Cicat et a., 2004; Campos et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006).

Several lineages of the family Mycosphaerellaceae were described in the literature, but were not described by our group. The new species is more distantly related to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Fig 1) and has been described in the last few decades. The phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BN) trees revealed that the newly described species formed a well-supported clade (Fig 2). The phylogenetic tree is well-supported by all three methods (data not shown).

Mycosphaerella mycetomatis (Ellis & Everh.) U. Braun, Mycol. Mem. 21: 96. 2007 - Fig. 7

Basionym. Dissoconiidae Dissoconiidae is distinguished from Mycosphaerella by its oblong conidia (Ellis & Everh.) and septation in the apices.

Saprobic on dead wood or bark. Ascomata scattered or rarely aggregated in small groups, subglobose, irregularly ellipsoidal, ellipsoidal to subglobose, subcylindrical, ellipsoidal, subclavate, tapering towards a subobtuse apex, dark brown, oblong to subfusiform, straight to slightly curved, 40-120 × 10-20 µm, apical and basal cell usually darker than the surrounding tissues, thick-walled, smooth, 5-8 × 2-3 µm; wall with inner wall consisting of two layers of brown textura angularis. Asci cylindrical, bitunicate, fissitunicate, cylindrical-clavate, apically rounded with a distinct ocular chamber. Ascospores biseriate, broadly ellipsoidal to oblong, hyaline, straight, fusiform, 2-septate, fusiform, slightly constricted at the septum, smooth, with a minute sheath at the base.

Asexual morph acervular, dark brown, pale olivaceous, smooth, often loosely encrusted in the centre.


## Discussion
 2010. The resistance is mainly caused by mutations in the genes involved in the ergosterol pathway, including the active-site proteins responsible for the ergosterol biosynthesis (E. coli ERG11 and ERG19) and the transporters responsible for the release of compounds that affect the drug transport (C. albicans and C. neoformans) (Rodrigues et al., 2000). Our results suggest that the resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole and amphotericin B is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the sterol biosynthesis enzyme and the genes encoding the other pathways.

The resistance to azole and amphotericin B is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the enzyme that converts the ergosterol (E. coli ERG11) to ergosta-4,5,6 sterol (Erg6) and the enzyme responsible for the ergosta-2,3-diphosphate (Erg6) (Figure 7). In our model, the resistance to azole and amphotericin B is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the ergosterol biosynthesis enzyme and the enzyme responsible for the release of compounds that affect the drug transport (Erg6 and ERG19) (Figure 7). Our results suggest that the resistance to azole and amphotericin B is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the ergosterol biosynthesis enzyme and the enzyme responsible for the release of compounds that affect the drug transport (Erg6 and ERG19) (Figure 7).

The resistance to fluconazole is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of ergosterol (E. coli ERG11 and ERG19) and the enzyme responsible for the release of compounds that affect the drug transport (Erg6 and ERG19) (Figure 7). Our results suggest that the resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B is mainly caused by mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of ergosterol (E.
