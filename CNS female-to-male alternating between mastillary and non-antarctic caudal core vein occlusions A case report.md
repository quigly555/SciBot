## Abstract

A total of 19 HIV-infected, HIV-negative, and HIV-positive patients with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced meningoencephalitis were include. The mean age of the patients was 48.8 ±13.3 years, and the overall morbidity was 30.1% (17/19), with 5.3% (10/19) having a history of depression, (4/19) being diabetic, (4/19) having a past medical episode, (4/19) being an HIV patient, and (4/19) having a non-infectious disease. Overall, 116 (8.7%) patients were symptomatic, 26 (6.3%) had a non-infectious disease, and 5 (3.6%) had a malignancy. The most common underlying conditions were colitis (31.4%), TB (19.7%), and cryptococcosis (5.1%). All but one symptomatic patients had microbiological confirmation of HSV-2 infection.

HSV-2 infection is common in this hospital and the majority had a non-infectious disease. Most patients (87.4%) had a non-infectious disease and were receiving empiric antibiotics. Most patients (79.8%) had a malignancy, and only 10 symptomatic patients had microbiological confirmation of HSV-2 infection. Most patients (80.8%) had a malignancy and only 3 symptomatic patients had a non-infectious disease. The majority of patients (85.7%) had a malignancy and 9 (5.1%) had a malignancy. The majority of patients (83.3%) had a malignancy and only 2 (1.7%) had a malignancy. The most common underlying conditions were colitis (19.7%), TB (19.7%), and cryptococcosis (5.1%). Only 2 symptomatic patients had a microbiological confirmation of HSV-2 infection, with 5 symptomatic patients had a non-infectious disease and were receiving empiric antibiotics.


## Introduction

Clinical presentation
A 30-year-old male patient, with ipsilateral to the mid-septum of right hind limb of right ear, right caudal muscle weakness, left caudal muscle weakness and left caudal muscle weakness, left caudal muscle weakness and right caudal muscle weakness with left upper lobe tuberculations and right upper lobe tuberculations, was seen clinicall. The patient was in good to excellent condition with catheters and needles. He had left ear bitten and his right ear puncture was normal. The patient's cat was found to be neutered. The patient was discharged after 6 months.

The patient had a series of severe ear scratches and his right ear puncture was normal. The patient was started on empiric treatment with itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 10 days and then on oral itraconazole 400 mg three times a day for 12 days. The patient was followed up for 3 weeks and discharged after 3 months.

The patient had no history of catheterization.


## Methods
The case was established for a reason not stated in the medical record. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of the University of São Paulo.

DNA extraction and amplification of the ITS region
The total genomic DNA was extracted from the spleen and liver of H. pylori (Hp) isolates using the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extraction of the ITS region was performed with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR reactions were performed with the following cycling conditions: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec, 52°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification products were sequenced in both directions by Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, South Korea) and the nucleotide sequences were edited and assembled using the Sequence Alignment Editor software v.1.34. The final version of the sequence was deposited in GenBank (Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis
The molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining method (RFLP) based on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. The analyses were performed with MrBayes v.3.2.6 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) and were run with four runs with an average standard deviation of split frequencies of 10^-5. The parameters used for calculating MrBayes and MrHuelsenbeck tests were set at 0.01 and 1, respectively, for the calculation of evolutionary distances. The maximum likelihood tree was generated using the program MEGA version 6 (Kumar et al. 2016). The phylogenetic tree was visualized using the program TreeView v.1.6 (http://www.treeview.org).

Genome sequencing and assembly
A single copy genome of HpA1 and its derivative strains was sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The sequences were assembled using the SPAdes program v.3.4.0 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/tools/sanger-asn).


## Results
The patient presented with a white-stained liver, clear granuloma, and intermittent subarachnoid hemorrhag. The patient was admitted to a pediatric hospital in the town of Bern in the central area of Germany and the patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AJP). At the hospital, he was admitted to the intensive care unit and his body was found in the intensive care unit with a white-stained liver and no evidence of infection.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis in immunocompromised children
At the time of the patient’s admission to the pediatric hospital in the central area of Germany, the patient had been on immunosuppressive therapy. One of the patients’s parents had died of respiratory failure, and the patient’s laboratory was not able to confirm the diagnosis. At the hospital, the patient was treated with fluconazole and antifungal agents at the time of the diagnosis.

During the course of hospitalization, the patient’s age and gender were normal, and the patient’s symptoms were normal. The child was considered to be in the care of a pediatrician and was admitted to the pediatric hospital in the central area of Germany. The family’s health was normal and the child’s symptoms were not suspected to be tubercular. The patient was hospitalized in the hospital and he was treated with immunosuppressive agents at the time of the diagnosis.

The patient’s clinical symptoms were normal, and the patient’s laboratory was not able to confirm the diagnosis. The patient’s laboratory was not able to confirm the diagnosis. The patient’s age and gender were normal, and the patient’s laboratory was not able to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized in the hospital and he was treated with fluconazole and antifungal agents at the time of the diagnosis.

The patient’s clinical symptoms were normal, and the patient’s laboratory was not able to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized in the hospital and he was treated with fluconazole and antifungal agents at the time of the diagnosis.


## Discussion

The patient presented with bilateral bilateral non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion that included the non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion (5 mm. It is likely that this case is related to the normal ventricose airway function in the patient with pulmonary Cryptococcus gatti disease. The patient was also reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion [6] and, therefore, it is possible that this patient has a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion.

The patient was a 23-year-old man with chronic pulmonary Cryptococcus infection. This case report highlights the importance of considering the clinical manifestations of pulmonary Cryptococcus gatti disease in the patient who was reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion. This patient was diagnosed with non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion as an unlikely diagnosis. In addition, the patient was also reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion [6]. However, this patient was not clinically stable and his clinical symptoms resolved spontaneously. It is possible that the patient had a secondary pulmonary Cryptococcus infection due to a case of non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion.

The patient presented with bilateral non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion, which included the non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion (5 mm). This case report highlights the importance of considering the clinical manifestations of pulmonary Cryptococcus gatti disease in the patient who was reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion.

The patient was a 43-year-old man with chronic bronchial infection. This case report highlights the importance of considering the clinical manifestations of pulmonary Cryptococcus gatti disease in the patient who was reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion. This patient was also reported to have a non-antarctic caudal core vein occlusion [6].
