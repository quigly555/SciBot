## Abstract
. pullulans, the yeast-like member of the family of the Franky superfamily, is the only species of Steves that has survived for more than 10,000 years on the surface of seaweeds. Since the end of the nineteenth century, there has been a great interest in the adaptation of this organism to various environments, including the extreme environments of the Antarctic Peninsula, among which are the extreme environments of the deep freeze-thaw cycles and the deep freeze-thaw cycles of the deep freeze-thaw cycles of the deep freeze-thaw zones, where the organisms are found in closed association within closed association with seaweeds and decaying seaweeds that is found to be associated with the fungus Physoletria fortis. The resistance of this bacterium to various stresses, including hydrogen peroxide, is a reason for its survival on the surfaces of living organisms. The adaptation of Seaweed to different types of stress has been referred to many aspects of stress, from the microflora to the molecular biology and physiology of stress resistance. Recent models have shown that the Stevesse obligate biotrophs, including a group of biotrophic protists, have many strategies for coping with different stresses. Their survival on a wide range of stresses is a result of an intricate regulatory program and a direct adaptation by the Stevesse obligate biotrophs to their environmental niches. The regulation of the Stevesse biotrophs is complex and encompasses many different genes, many different developmental programs, and the control of different aspects of their physiology. Here we will provide an overview of the role of the genes and pathways of the two major stress regulators of seaweeds, the SrcA and the SrcB. We will first summarize our current understanding of the molecular processes that control these two major regulators of seaweeds physiology, the biosynthetic genes for the SrcA and the SrcB, which are expressed during the response of seaweeds and the survival of their obligate biotrophs to certain stresses. Then, we will describe their importance in the response to certain stresses to understand the molecular mechanisms of their adaptation to certain stresses in the biotrophic protists. Finally, we will discuss the importance of the SrcA and the SrcB for the adaptation of seaweeds to certain environmental conditions.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that can cause severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. It can survive in the environment, and even in the presence of oxygen, for several months. The phenomenon is attributed to the co-evolution of the yeast to be composed of two forms: a- and ß-glucans, a cell wall rich in proteins and lipids that are essential for fungal survival. During the early stages of infection, Cryptococcus neoformans spores (either yeast or hyphae) are expelled from the infected lung tissue. After reaching the pulmonary alveoli, the fungus can cause a yeast pneumonia that is fatal. The virulence of C. neoformans depends on its virulence factors, including the production of melanin, capsule, and proteinase. Melanization protects the fungus from antifungal drugs and from killing by phagocytes, is required for the virulence of this organism, and is critical for fungal pathogenesis.

Melanization is a form of protection against UV light, but it is also used as a form of thermal stress (Chen et al., 2009; Cheung et al., 2011). Melanization, which is an evolutionarily conserved stress response in fungi, occurs at the molecular level, where proteins synthesize and polymerize in a process known as thermal stress (Khan et al., 2007).


## Methods
 2006; Kaur et a., 2011). A single-locus sequence was generated by sequence alignments, with the aid of BWA and Mega v. 7.0.2 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, Inc., Grapevine, USA) and selected for the annotation. The complete amino acid sequence of its lifestyle modification was also included in the annotation. A gene-specific rRNA gene of S. cerevisiae was used as a reference. The translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef-1a) gene was used as a reference gene for the calculation of the minimum number of nucleotides per kb. The cDNA library of S. cerevisiae was used as a template for PCR amplification of the eukaryotic reference gene (Supplementary Table S1) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. The PCR reactions were performed in 20 µL containing 1 × PCR buffer (MBI Fermentas, Leipzig, Germany), 0.2 µM dNTPs (New England Biolabs, Beverly, USA), 0.2 µM of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), 0.2 µM of each dNTP (New England Biolabs), and 0.2 µM of each nuclease-free water. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and sent to the sequencing service of the Institute of Genetics, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Molecular Phylogeny of the Seaweed Fungus (Pucciniales) Wickerhamia
A combined ITS and tef-1a sequence of Seaweed Fungus (Pucciniales) Wickerhamia (Diptera: Centromorphosporum) was obtained from GenBank (Supplementary Table S1). The ITS sequence was aligned with those obtained from GenBank (Supplementary Table S1) and the tef-1a sequence was obtained from the GenBank database (Supplementary Table S1). The primer sequences were designed using the MEGA v. 5.0 software and were included in the alignments. The ITS sequence of Wickerhamia was also included in the alignments.


## Results
dermatitidis [13] using a two-hybrid syste. However, W. dermatitidis does not produce conidia (Figure 1A) and the conidia of W. dermatitidis WCCA are not well defined and the molecular mechanism of their complex remains unknown.

Although the two-hybrid system does not completely resolve the complex, it is possible to resolve the complex based on the metatranscriptome data (see below). A sequence of the WCCA gene was found to be highly transcribed in W. dermatitidis and the metatranscriptome data indicated that W. dermatitidis WCCA has a function in conidiation. We also found that the conidiation-associated protein in W. dermatitidis (named as WdsA) has been reported to be expressed during the early stages of infection (as described in the Materials and Methods section) [11] and to be an integral component of the fungal cell wall, as shown in the Microscopic Features of WdsA (MFS) sequence shown in Figure 1B.

WdsA is involved in the regulation of virulence in the tomato pathogen, and is also expressed during the infection process
We next investigated the role of WdsA in the regulation of virulence. We first compared the WdsA gene in W. dermatitidis with the P. falciparum PfaA, which is a representative of the highly conserved UAS subunit of the P. falciparum pathogenicity network [11]. The P. falciparum PfaA gene was originally identified as a putative P. falciparum PfaA in the P. falciparum genome database and is thus named PflA [9]. However, the P. falciparum PfaA gene was only expressed in the first 10^5 conidia produced and not in the first 10^5 conidia produced (Figure 1C). This result suggested that the P. falciparum PfaA gene is not a direct product of the P. falciparum PfaA but might be expressed during the infection process.


## Discussion
oryzae and its members of the Rhizophydiales (Lepidoptera: Rhizophydiales) and Leotiomycetes (Chytridiomycetes: Lecanorales.

The conidial diversity of the rice blast fungus was significantly lower than that of other cultivars, such as the red and white cultivars, and the cotton cultivars, such as the gourd cultivars, which were dominated by other cultivars. The total number of cultivars in this study is higher than the number of cultivars reported for the previous cultivars in the same field (21,244 cultivars) [48]. However, the number of cultivars of this study is much lower than those of previous cultivars.

The fungal communities of the rice blast fungus were generally similar to that of other cultivars, except for the red and white cultivars, which had a higher fungal diversity. The fungal communities of the gourd cultivars were significantly different from the communities of the rice blast fungus, and the gourd cultivars, except for the red and white cultivars, had a higher fungal diversity than the cultivars of the red and white cultivars. The fungal communities of the gourd cultivars were significantly different from the fungal communities of the cultivars of the rice blast fungus, and the gourd cultivars, except for the red and white cultivars, had a higher fungal diversity than the cultivars of the red and white cultivars. These results suggest that the fungal communities of the rice blast fungus are similar to that of other cultivars, but the fungal communities of the gourd cultivars are much lower than those of the cultivars of the rice blast fungus.

The fungal communities of the white cultivars were significantly different from the fungal communities of the red and white cultivars. The fungal communities of the gourd cultivars were significantly different from the fungal communities of the cultivars of the red and white cultivars.
