## Abstract
A 5-year-old goat female presented to the veterinary department with a 1-day history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Examination of skin lesions and skin and soft tissue tissue specimens revealed a lymphocytic exudative mass, consistent with a tuberculous lesion. Computed tomography angiography showed an oval-shaped lesion in the left upper lobe. A histopathological examination of skin, lung, and pleural fluid cultures revealed a mixture of granulomatous inflammation. Cryptococcus neoformans was identified as the major causative agent of the abdominal mass. Infectious disease was suspected by presenting lung, liver, and central venous catheter cultures. The patient was treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide and antifungal agents for a first pathology biopsy. The histopathological examination revealed presence of multisystem involvement, including the hepatociliary system, liver, spleen, and pleural fluid cultures. The patient was treated with intravenous fluconazole for a 1-day course, and discharged with residual pulmonary involvement. This case illustrates the importance of an early diagnosis of a lymphocytic exudative mass in order to facilitate prompt and effective management of the infectious disease.


## Introduction
 2012) and the Microbiotomy of Tract Infections in the Animal Vet Study (Poulin et a., 2014). The impact of TST in the functional protection of the two host immune responses has been previously reviewed (Kunze et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012). The relevance of the TST to the pathogenesis of allergenic rhinitis in humans and dogs is not known, although its role in the pathogenesis of rhinitis is thought to be critical in the outcome of allergenic rhinitis (Bruno et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2007).

In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptomics study of the TST of the two model systems. The TST of the phage, E. coli, is a very efficient and versatile tool in transcriptome analysis. The high efficiency and speed of this tool is expected to be extremely important for the study of the whole gene expression network in E. coli, since it will be necessary to perform large-scale transcriptomics studies in order to characterize the effect of the TST on the expression of its target genes. We also performed comparative analyses between the gene expressions of the E. coli TST and the phage E. coli E. coli. We hypothesized that TST of the phage could affect the expression levels of its target genes. We found that the E. coli TST of the phage is highly expressed and interacts with multiple target genes, but the E. coli TST of the phage is only expressed at high levels, which makes it difficult to measure the level of expression of its target genes. We also observed that TST of the phage is more active than other phage-derived e-colipid, the Bacteroides species, which have no detectable expression at all. Surprisingly, the phage E. coli TST was able to induce gene expression changes in the gene expression network of the phage. Moreover, the phage E. coli TST of the phage had the potential to alter the gene expression network of the phage, which is a very efficient tool in transcriptome analysis. We also found that the phage E. coli TST of the phage is highly expressed, but the E. coli TST of the phage is not. Our data indicate that the phage E.


## Methods
For all experiments, we performed in vitro serum free . albicans strains in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in 5% CO_2. The macrophage colony count was performed by counting the number of conidia in each well, which were counted using a hemocytometer chamber. Non-adherent cells were excluded from the study. For in vitro experiments, the primary efficacy endpoint was macrophage macrophage co-infection (HIV) in the rat model of acute infection (AKT) [32]. Briefly, the mice were divided into six groups of four: Control, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, HTLV-4, and HTLV-5. In the HTLV-1 group, 5 mice were infected with 10^7 C. albicans cells in the peritoneal cavity with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 hour. Then, the mice were sacrificed by CO_2 inhalation and the spleen and liver tissue were removed, followed by an additional sectioning of the lung and liver to exclude lymphocytes. The tissue from the liver, lungs, and the spleen was excised, and the homogenate was used for the macrophage colony counting. The numbers of macrophages in each organ were counted by a hemocytometer chamber and the number of conidia in each organ was counted.

In vitro CD4^+ T Cells Isolated from C. albicans Cells
The CD4^+ T Cell Isolation Kit (R&D Systems) was used to label C. albicans cells with CD4^+ T Cells (clone MF38-1, BD Biosciences). The cells were cultured in 24-well plates at the density of 10^6/ml in RPMI 1640 media (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 mM HEPES (Biological Industries) to give a final density of 5 × 10^5 cells/ml.


## Results

We first evaluated the ability of anti-CD3 antibody (CCM7) to elicit allergenicity in . monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes is a pathogenic yeast that is resistant to antifungals, including fluconazole and flucytosine. However, L. monocytogenes does not produce melanin (L. monocytogenes JF12), which is associated with other immune mechanisms (Wehmeyer and Frank, 2000). The L. monocytogenes JF12 is a potential candidate for vaccine-induced colitis (Loh et al., 2006). To evaluate whether the anti-CD3 antibody (CCM7) elicited colitis in L. monocytogenes, we injected the L. monocytogenes JF12 strain into the L. monocytogenes JF12 model, which had been previously shown to produce robust colitis (Loh et al., 2006). L. monocytogenes JF12 cells were viable at the time of injection and were not responsive to antifungals, including fluconazole or flucytosine (Fig 3A). L. monocytogenes JF12 cells were resistant to fluconazole, including flucytosine and S100A (Fig 3A). After 3 h of antifungal treatment, L. monocytogenes cells presented a 2-fold decrease in melanin (Fig 3A). We further evaluated the ability of anti-CD3 antibody (CCM7) to induce colitis in the L. monocytogenes JF12 model (Fig 3B). L. monocytogenes JF12 cells were susceptible to fluconazole, including fluconazole and S100A, and the L. monocytogenes JF12 cells were resistant to fluconazole, including fluconazole and S100A (Fig 3B).

We next evaluated the ability of anti-CD3 antibody (CCM7) to induce IL-10 production in the L. monocytogenes JF12 model. L.


## Discussion
The expression of adaptive immunity in fungal infection is controlled by the transcription factor Fc<U+03B3>R and is mediated by several key factors including its mRNA expression, protein level, and cytokine and chemokine production [15,17.

In this study, we report that, in a murine model of infection with C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. neoformans, the expression of the Fc<U+03B3>R signaling pathway, which is activated in response to fungal infection, was significantly increased in C. gattii and C. neoformans (Figure 6A). This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of Cg<U+03B3>R2 in C. gattii and C. neoformans and by a reduction in the expression of the Cg<U+03B3>R3 transcription factor, which is activated in response to C. neoformans infection [17]. In addition, a reduction in the expression of the Cg<U+03B3>R3 transcription factor, which is activated in response to C. neoformans infection [17], was observed in C. gattii and C. neoformans (Figure 6B). In addition, a reduction in the expression of Cg<U+03B3>R1 and Cg<U+03B3>R3 was observed in C. gattii and C. neoformans (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that the increase in the expression of the Fc<U+03B3>R signaling pathway is modulated by C. gattii and C. neoformans.

We also investigated the effect of the C. gattii strains on the C. neoformans growth in blood. The results showed that C. gattii was able to produce a strong ROS-mediated defense against phagocytosis by neutrophils and that C. gattii strain suppressed the phagocytosis of C. neoformans by macrophages. Interestingly, C. gattii was able to produce an anti-fungal immune response in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans and C.
