## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are life-threatening complications of hematological malignancies and cause high morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Aspergillus fumigatus is a leading opportunistic fungal cause of these infections, especially in patients with advanced HIV. Inoculation leads to increased mortality, and patients infected with A. fumigatus have exacerbated immune responses that can prime a more severe disease state. We present a case of an HIV-infected individual with advanced HIV with a fatal etiology of pulmonary, meningeal, and cutaneous aspergillosis.


## Introduction
This suggests that gut FcRs may be essential for gut . elegans pathogenesis.

Fc-GFP is expressed primarily in the extracellular space, which is an outer layer of the plasma membrane and secreted into the extracellular matrix (Figure 1). The surface of Fc-GFP is composed of a glycoprotein and a glycoprotein-binding pocket that contains a conserved signal peptide (also called an endopeptidase or endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide) and a peptidyl-prolyl chain (Figure 2). The membrane-associated Fc-GFP consists of a protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored with a serine residue and a serine residue on top of the pro-glycosylated endopeptidase-activating peptidyl-prolyl chain.

Fc-GFP is composed of a serine-bound protein and a serine-bound protein of unknown function (Figure 2). Serine residues on the protein are serine-bound and are serine-phosphatidylinositol-anchored (Figure 2). The enzyme contains an amino-propeyl side branch and an isochore intermediate, and the intermediate contains the peptidyl-prolyl chain and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [3H-c]-epimerase, two glycosyl residues on the serine-phosphatidylinositol-anchored enzyme and a proglycosylerimide at the glycosyl residue of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzyme. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzyme and the glycosyltransferase are important for the glycosyltransferase activity of Fc-GFP.

The Fc-GFP has been described as a membrane-associated protein and is highly expressed in the extracellular space. The Fc-GFP has a short cytoplasmic tail, and is secreted into the extracellular matrix (Figure 2). The Fc-GFP has an open conformation, which is conserved across the cell wall and cytoplasm.


## Methods
albicans FcRs from NCBI (18,221 entries) and used these to search for the presence of FcRs in the gut of . albicans. FcRs sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [30] and used to align the proteome of C. albicans. FcRs sequences were also used to determine the FcR abundance in the gut of C. albicans. To identify FcRs from each of the four C. albicans species, we selected the FcRs from the proteomic proteomics data, then used these FcRs to search the FcR abundance in the gut of C. albicans. FcRs sequences were also used to identify FcRs in the gut of C. albicans.

We used the FcR sequences from GenBank (see table 1), FcRs from the UniProt database (see Table 1), FcRs from UniProt FcR2 database (see Table 1), and FcRs from NCBI (see Table 1) to identify the FcR sequences. We used the UniProt FcR2 database (see Table 1) to identify the FcR sequences with FcRs from UniProt FcR2 database. The FcRs from NCBI were also aligned using MUSCLE [30] and aligned the FcRs of the UniProt FcR2 database. FcRs sequences were then manually inspected and used to determine the FcR abundance in the gut of C. albicans.

Gene family analysis
We retrieved all the FcRs from GenBank (see Table 1), FcRs from UniProt FcR2 databases (see Table 1) and FcRs from NCBI (see Table 1) and used these FcRs to determine the FcR sequences in the gut of C. albicans. FcRs sequences were also used to determine the FcR abundance in the gut of C. albicans.

## Results
., the Fc Rs were significantly enriched for Fc Rs from the gut Fc Rs. In order to validate the Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse, the macrophage Fc Rs were co-expressed with the Fc Rs from the gut Fc Rs and the Fc Rs were co-expressed with Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse. After five days co-culture of Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse with the Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse, the Fc Rs were co-expressed with the Fc Rs from the gut Fc Rs. After five days co-culture of Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse with the Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse, the Fc Rs were co-expressed with Fc Rs from the gut Fc Rs. After five days co-culture of Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse with the Fc Rs from the H3K27me3 mouse, the Fc Rs were co-expressed with Fc Rs from the gut Fc Rs.

## Discussion

The gut Fc Rs were analysed by three Fc protein kinase-dependent proteomics experiment. Protein kinases (APK1, UCP2, and FIC1) are implicated in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes including growth, cell proliferation, and differentiation [25,26]. In this study, we identified three APK1 kinases and a Fc-dependent HapX-like protein kinase. APK1 is present in the gut of S. aureus and S. suis [27]. HapX-like proteins are reported to be required for the regulation of the gut bacterial microbiota in the gut of humans and bacteria [28]. The Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins have been implicated in the regulation of the gut bacterial microbiota in various model systems [29,30], including humans [31], mice [32], and pigs [33] with the ability to bind to and degrade HapX [34]. We observed the HapX-like proteins in the gut of S. aureus and S. suis, and the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins in the gut of S. aureus and S. suis. These results suggest that the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins are involved in the regulation of the gut bacterial microbiota in S. aureus and S. suis. Interestingly, our proteomic analysis showed that the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins were present in the gut of S. aureus and S. suis, which were similar to the results reported by Hüss et al. [35]. HapX-like proteins have been reported to be involved in the regulation of gut bacterial microbiota in humans [36,37] and in the gut of S. aureus [37].

We previously reported that the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins were involved in the regulation of the gut bacterial microbiota in S. aureus and S. suis [25]. We found that the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins were present in the gut of S. aureus and S. suis, which were similar to the results reported by Hüss et al. [25]. We also found that the Fc-dependent HapX-like proteins were present in the gut of S. suis.
