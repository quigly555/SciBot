# Pathogenic Echinocandin Resistance in Candida glabrata: Diagnostic Challenges and Antifungal Drug Resistance Strategy
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause life-threatening infection in immune compromised individuals. It is widely recognized as a pathogen that can colonize most of the body including the lungs. However, studies on the lung epithelium overgrowth of C. neoformans have been limited and other poorly studied areas are out of hand. This study focused on the pulmonary epithelium overgrowth due to C. neoformans. We examined bronchiolar epithelium overgrowth with C. neoformans using whole lung tissue from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. We compared cell-wall and epithelial-wall extracts with control. Pathological findings, such as inflammation, lung adhesion, and fungal growth, were also evaluated. We also compared the fungal-attenuated extracts with control. Using an immunoassay (AlcoChip), we compared cell-wall and epithelial-wall extracts with control with bronchiolitis and AIDS-related cell-maturing mycobacterium (BmwC) by multivariate analysis.

We found a positive correlation between BmwC-pseudohyphae and fungal burden (P < 0.01), and a significant negative correlation between cryptococcal burden and lung-node invasion (P < 0.02). Lung-neural epithelium-overgrowth was associated with a poor survival outcome (P = 0.02).

Our results demonstrate that the pulmonary epithelium of C. neoformans is significantly overproduced and that C.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Candida glabrata accounts for 5-8% of IFD cases worldwide (1, 2). Although Candida glabrata is a common pathogen in healthy individuals, it is increasingly recognized as a causative agent of infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients (3-6).

Primary cutaneous candidiasis (PCL) is a common clinical presentation in patients with hematological diseases (7). It may be due to environmental exposure, physical trauma, or infection with contaminated materials. However, PCL is not always caused by any single fungus. Rather, the clinical presentation of PCL may be a combination of different fungi. There are many species of Candida that cause PCL, but Candida glabrata is the most common species reported to cause this clinical form (8). Candida albicans is a normal part of the human flora and causes most Pcl, while Candida sp. is obligate biotrophic. However, certain species of Candida are able to cause fungal infections and may cause severe infections (9).

We herein report the case of a 65-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with candidiasis. He was initially diagnosed with CRAG and treated with amphotericin B (AmB) and caspofungin. He was successfully treated with amphotericin B, but his CRAG-associated mortality was not significantly different from that of other Candida albicans-treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Pcl in an immunocompromised patient.


## Methods
glabrata
We reviewed the literature and the emerging strategies for caspofungin susceptibility testing in clinical trial.

We conducted cross-sectional analysis to compare the susceptibility of susceptible C. glabrata isolates of four clinical sites (S1-S4, S5-S9, S11-S14, and S17-S18) to caspofungin (S1-S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S11, S12, S17-S18) in Pune, India. The data was from August 2014 to January 2015 and are reported in the Supplementary Material and Tables 1-2.

We performed a descriptive analysis of the data and compared the data of susceptible C. glabrata isolates from four clinical sites (S1-S4, S5-S9, S11-S14, S13-S16, S20-S21, S22-S23, S27-S29) in Pune, India. The data were collected on August 2014 and the sensitivity and specificity of the tests were assessed using the <U+03C7>^2 test.

The data were collected on August 2014 and the sensitivity and specificity of the tests were assessed using the <U+03C7>^2 test.

## Results

Infection with the majority of the isolates was caused by an . coli (n = 6, 0.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), or Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 3). Four isolates were treated with fluconazole (n = 3), but none of the isolates were resistant to itraconazole (n = 1). All isolates were treated with fluconazole, but all the isolates were sensitive to itraconazole, and all the isolates were resistant to amphotericin B (Table 2). The MICs of all isolates were 32 µg/ml, and the MIC_50 for amphotericin B was 125 µg/ml. All isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (Table 2).

Clinical manifestations of E. coli/Klebsiella pneumoniae and Cryptococcus neoformans are described in Table 2. All isolates were infected by S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae, and were susceptible to fluconazole (Table 2). All the isolates were treated with fluconazole, but all the isolates were sensitive to itraconazole, and all the isolates were resistant to amphotericin B (Table 2).

Overall, we found that the antifungal drug susceptibility profile of the Candida glabrata isolates was similar to the profile of Candida albicans isolates. The clinical manifestations of Candida glabrata were similar to the clinical manifestations of other pathogens. The clinical manifestations of the isolates were similar to the clinical manifestations of other pathogenic Candida species.

Efficacy of Echinocandin on Echinocandin-Resistant Candida glabrata
The MICs of all the Candida glabrata isolates were 32 µg/ml, and the MIC_50 for fluconazole was 0.75 µg/ml (Table 2).


## Discussion
fumigatus, . albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, and P. aeruginosa, and only C. albicans and P. aeruginosa were found to be susceptible to amphotericin B (1). The MIC against Candida was not higher than 1 mg/L and, accordingly, all the isolates were not susceptible to amphotericin B. However, in the present study, the MIC against C. albicans was not higher than 250 µg/L, and the MIC against C. dubliniensis was not higher than 500 µg/L. Similar results were found in the present study.

The MIC against C. albicans was 0.125 µg/L and was higher than 200 µg/L. Similarly, C. tropicalis was not found to be susceptible to amphotericin B. Similar results were found in the present study.

The MIC against C. glabrata was not higher than 500 µg/L and, consequently, no isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. Similar results were also found in the present study.

The MIC against C. dubliniensis was 0.25 µg/L and was higher than 250 µg/L. Similar results were also found in the present study.

The MIC against C. albicans was lower than 1 mg/L and was higher than 200 µg/L. Similar results were also found in the present study.

The MIC against C. dubliniensis was not higher than 200 µg/L and, consequently, no isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. Similar results were also found in the present study.
