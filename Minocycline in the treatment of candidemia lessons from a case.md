## Abstract
This study aims to present the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of the brain abscess in an asymptomatic patient with diabetic ketoacidosis. In this case report, we described the neurological findings, discussed the causes of the brain abscess, and discussed the diagnostic and treatment strategies.

The patient was a 48-year-old man, with diabetic ketoacidosis, who had been diagnosed to have neuropathic pain due to multiple intrathecal hemorrhagic lesions in the left front artery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of the brain abscess were suspicious for asymptomatic diabetic ketoacidosis. Due to the severity of the symptoms, he was evaluated at the hospital outpatient clinic and he was diagnosed with asymptomatic ketoacidosis.

At the hospital, a computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal, with the addition of contrast. The diagnosis was confirmed by the culture, which showed a retinoiculate lesion. The treatment consisted of itraconazole, metronomicranial nerve Ag, and acyclovir. He was started on itraconazole after the treatment of his asymptomatic ketoacidosis, which did not improve. Eventually, he was started on bupropion, which was added after the treatment of his asymptomatic ketoacidosis.

The results of this case indicate that there is an increased risk of asymptomatic ketoacidosis even in non-immunocompromised patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. In addition, the use of antifungal drugs should be considered even in those patients with a good prognosis, even in patients that fail to improve the symptoms of the brain abscesses.


## Introduction
The genus Carpinia Kunze (Myrtaceae) is a lichenized family, including seven species (Kunze, 1831, Lecciniales, Korijn, & Vogl, 2017, Vogl, Wijayawardnia, & Vanittanen, 2015), with a wide distribution worldwide (Liu et al., 2015). The genus is native to the north of the southern temperate regions of North America, the Mediterranean region, and south in central and south Africa (Liu et al., 2015, 2016). K.


## Methods
This is a prospective study of infection in a clinical settin. The ethical considerations are as follows: (1) to establish if the use of this drug in the clinical setting is inadvisable; (2) to obtain a clinical outcome in order to avoid a discomfaction of the participants, including an inadvisability of the patients with prior history of hospitalization; and (3) to ascertain the validity of the methodology. The primary endpoint of this study is the validation of the clinical outcome of a patient with multiple cryptococcosis diagnoses in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. The primary endpoint is the evaluation of the clinical outcome of a patient with multiple cryptococcosis diagnoses in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. In addition, the secondary endpoint is the evaluation of the safety and health of the patients in the presence of multiple cryptococcosis diagnoses in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine at University of Ghana (FEC approval number 825/09). The protocol for the preparation of serum was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of University of Ghana (CPCM).

2.3. Antifungal Drugs
Capsicum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as the antifungal drug of choice for the treatment of Candida in the laboratory. The antifungal drugs were diluted to a concentration of 2.0 × 10^4 cfu/mL. Aliquots of each stock suspension of Candida were withdrawn from the wells of 96-well plates and the dilutions were plated onto Sabouraud dextrose agar and the number of CFU/mL of Candida was determined. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 48 h. The number of CFU/mL of C. albicans was calculated as the number of yeast forming units (YCFUs) per milliliter of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antifungal drug. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were calculated as the concentration of the drug causing 50% of the colony-forming units (CFU)/mL.

2.4. Preparation of RPMI 1640
The RPMI 1640 was prepared by the method of Zhang et al. [11]. The method of Zhang et al.

3.7. In vitro susceptibility testing of fluconazole against C. albicans
The MIC of fluconazole for candidemia was between 8 and 64 µg/ml for candidemia, in line with the results of the CLSI guidelines.

3.8. In vitro susceptibility testing of fluconazole against C. albicans
The MIC of fluconazole for candidemia was between 2 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml for candidemia, in line with the results of the CLSI guidelines.

3.9. In vitro susceptibility testing of fluconazole against C. albicans
The MIC of fluconazole for candidemia was between 16 µg/ml and 64 µg/ml for candidemia, in line with the results of the CLSI guidelines.

## Discussion
Candida species are a cause of chronic liver disease in immunocompetent patient. In our patient, the candidemia was the most common cause of candidemia and we had not observed any other causes of candidemia.

Candida is a ubiquitous human pathogen that is often found in the environment and is commonly found in the blood, skin, or nails. As the body age, the number of Candida species increases and thus their presence will increase in the environment. The first identification of Candida species has been reported in a case series of patients with candidemia in the United States [6]. Recently, Candida species have also been found in air samples from a patient in Hong Kong [7]. The isolation of Candida species in the blood and urine of the patient, but not the blood samples, showed that the species is present in the bloodstream and the urine of the patient, may be detected in the urine of patients with candidemia [8]. However, the isolation of Candida species from urine samples, might be the reason why the patient had a normal urine sample in the present case.

The use of antifungal drugs has been reported in some patients with Candida infections. For instance, the use of the azole drug, fluconazole, and amphotericin B, which causes invasive growth of Candida species, has been reported in a case report [9]. Similarly, another treatment is amphotericin B, which causes invasive growth of Candida species in patients with Candida infections [10].

The use of antifungal drugs has been reported in patients with invasive aspergillosis.
