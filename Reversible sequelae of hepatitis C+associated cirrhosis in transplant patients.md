## Abstract
We present a case of a 62-year-old male with HIV-1 infection who presented with pain, redness, and redness of the skin along with pain in the distal part of the right lower lobe. He had been given a corticosteroid for suspected hepatitis C and was found to have a history of travel history to other parts of the world. Liver was found to be significantly depleted of ATPase in addition to ATPase-positive cultures. Test results for HIV-1 culture were negative and the patient had a positive viral hepatitis C (VCrcy) DNA positive on the VCrcy assay. VCrcy is a negative test for opportunistic infection. A positive VCrcy test for VCs was also confirmed by VCs. He was treated with an anti-VCrcy test and was found to have improved memory from repeated cultures. To our knowledge, this is the first report of VCs as a cause of pain along with viral hepatitis C. Our report emphasizes that VCs as a negative result in HIV-1 culture can be due to viral hepatitis C and that this can also be the case of opportunistic infection.


## Introduction
In recent years, with the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has become a serious public health problem in the USA. The incidence of CM in HIV infected individuals ranges from 2.6 to 25% and in non-HIV infected individuals from 3 to 9.1% [1,2]. Cryptococcal disease is a major cause of death in the developing world, and due to its high incidence in the developing world, the risk of an opportunistic infection is extremely high [3,4].

The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the early 1990s has significantly increased the survival of HIV infected individuals in many regions of the world, especially in the developing world [5]. The development of HAART in the United States during the 2000s has led to substantial improvements in treatment and reduced incidence of CM in the developed world [6,7,8]. However, in Africa, CM in areas where it has not yet been treated is still a frequent complication [9]. Although HAART has reduced the incidence of CM in the developing world, it has not provided the level of protection against the high incidence of CM in many developing countries.

In contrast to other HIV infected individuals, patients infected with CM have a lower risk of developing CM than patients without CM [10]. In addition, the incidence of CM in HIV infected patients with other conditions is low, occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and in sub-Saharan and low-middle income countries [11,12].

In this study, we investigated the incidence of CM in HIV infected patients with two different conditions: acute CM in patients with B10 gangrene [13] and intensive care unit (ICU) CM in patients without B10 gangrene. Our results showed that low incidence of CM was observed in patients with B10 gangrene.


## Methods
Fungal material
The fungal isolate used in this study was previously described in [12], [15]. The isolate was maintained in potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (0.75% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) at room temperature.

The fungal isolates used in this study are listed in Table 1. The isolates were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium (0.75% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) at 25 °C for 1 month. For the exponential growth of the fungal strains, the medium was changed to liquid medium (0.5% NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2% KNO_3, 1% K_3Fe_2·6H_2O, and 2% glucose) at 25 °C. The mycelium was harvested by filtration, washed with sterile distilled water, and used for inoculations of the sterile water. The fungal colonies were picked and maintained on PDA plates.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
The mycelium of the yeast strains was inoculated on PDA solid medium (0.75% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar) for 7 days. Then, the mycelium was transferred into a 1.5 mL flask with a rotator and shaken. The fungal growth was observed by using a light microscope (S-340, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 120×. The inoculated discs were observed under the microscope.


## Results
% was noted [19. Our patient had a history of liver cirrhosis (Table 1) and also had renal and hepatic failure. Hepatitis C was diagnosed in 36.4% of cases, and other major malignancies (5/36) included diabetes mellitus (n = 18), hypertension (n = 2), diabetes mellitus (n = 1), hematoma (n = 1), and autoimmune disease (n = 1).

The prevalence of lymphadenopathy was found to be 3.6% (Table 1). The median CD4 count was 58 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocytes count was 47 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 100 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 150 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 117 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 738 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 162 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 125 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 225 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 30 cells/mm^3. The median CD4^+ lymphocyte count was 15 cells/mm^3.

The incidence of hepatic failure in transplant patients was 10.6% (Table 2). The incidence of hepatic failure in transplant patients was found to be 5.2% (Table 2).

The incidence of CD4 count in liver cirrhosis and kidney transplant patients was 6.6% (Table 1). The incidence of CD4 count in liver cirrhosis and kidney transplant patients was 6.6% (Table 1).

The incidence of CD4^+ lymphocytes in renal and hepatic failure was found to be 0.9% (Table 1). The incidence of CD4^+ lymphocytes in renal and hepatic failure was 0.7% (Table 1).

The incidence of liver failure in transplant patients was found to be 0.7% (Table 2). The incidence of liver failure in transplant patients was 0.5% (Table 2).


## Discussion
We observed no significant difference in the susceptibility to CM among transplant recipients with and without cirrhosis, suggesting that cirrhosis is not a unique complication of CM in transplant recipient.

The frequency of relapse and recurrence of CM in this cohort of transplant recipients has been described in previously published studies [13,15,16], which are consistent with a previous study [18]. However, we did not see any difference in the frequency of relapse or recurrence between CM in transplant recipients and non-transplant recipients.

No significant difference in the frequency of recurrence of CM between transplant recipients with and without cirrhosis was observed. However, patients with cirrhosis had higher rates of relapse than those with cirrhosis alone. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown that chronic CM in transplant recipients is associated with high rates of recurrence [19,20].

CM in transplant recipients with cirrhosis was associated with increased plasma levels of plasma Fibrinogen, a marker of anti-inflammatory cytokine production [21]. This study has also found that Fibrinogen is associated with the risk of CM in transplant recipients [22]. This is consistent with a previous study that found that cirrhosis was associated with increased levels of Fibrinogen in transplanted recipients [22]. However, this association has been shown to be rare and is rare in cases of CM in transplant recipients [21].

Several studies have shown a relationship between increased plasma levels of Fibrinogen and mortality [23,24]. These studies included two independent cohorts, and they did not find a significant relationship between increased plasma levels of plasma Fibrinogen and mortality.

The frequency of relapse and recurrence of CM in transplant recipients with CM has been described in previous studies [25,26], but we did not see any difference in the frequency of recurrence between transplant recipients with and without cirrhosis.

The frequency of relapse and recurrence of CM in transplant recipients with CM has been described in previous studies [25,26], but we did not see any difference in the frequency of recurrence between transplant recipients with and without cirrhosis.

In this study, we observed a significant association between increased plasma levels of plasma Fibrinogen and mortality.
