## Abstract
The human gut is a nutritional resource that can be exploited by a wide range of organisms, plants and animals. The gut microbiome is an extraordinary resource with over 1000 species described in different taxa, and a good understanding of the function of the gut microbiome is the foundation for its understanding. Here, we describe a small molecule strategy to develop small molecules to restore gut health in humans.

The human gut microbiome is a diverse ecosystem, containing trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other small molecules of all kinds. The human gut contains trillions of proteins, which, in most cases, are encoded based on a common ancestor. Humans have a high genetic diversity of allografts, and the genetic diversity of the gut homeostasis is shaped by many factors, including the abundance of various nutrients, the age of the individual, and the way the gut responds to specific nutrients. It is possible that the composition of the gut microbiome is altered in humans, and it contributes to the development of diseases and health, but it is not clear how this influences disease. In this work, we report the identification of a small molecule strategy to restore gut health, and show how this is exploited by a wide range of organisms to restore gut integrity. We show that in the human gut, fungi are among the most abundant and diverse components of the gut microbiome. They can contribute to the development of different health conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer and have an impact on many other health conditions. This small molecule strategy is particularly useful in the quest to restore gut health after the loss of gut diversity.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon form of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-negative patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (VDS). ^1 There are few studies that specifically evaluate the susceptibility of patients to cryptococcal infection, but two of them found that the crude mortality rate was approximately 20-25% in patients with severe disease, with the highest mortality observed in the patients with severe disease. ^2,3 Therefore, the need for a systematic approach to determine the survival of cryptococcal meningitis patients in the VDS is evident.

We herein report a case of severe cryptococcal meningitis with a crude mortality of 33.9% in a patient with severe cryptococcal disease in our center.


## Methods
The fungus was cultured on PDA at 25°C for 7 day. The liquid cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The obtained supernatant was used for the main OIDF labelling and the elution was carried out with the previously described dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [34]. The samples were placed on agarose (0.45%) sheets and the OIDF labelling was performed in 2 mL volumes. OIDF Labelling was performed by the first step of the protocol using DNS to remove the solidified medium. The DNS solution was then added to the samples and the samples were placed on a glass slide, and the slides were then covered with a coverslip. The slides were then dried and placed in the oven at 60°C for 5 min. The dry residues were dissolved in distilled water and the final concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/mL. For the standard OIDF labelling method, a drop of the drug solution was mixed with 1 mL of 1% DNP and the stock solution was then prepared and diluted to 1 mg/mL. The final concentration of DNP was 1% in the test sample and 1% in the control.

2.3. Determination of the Bioactivity of AmB Inhibitors
The inhibition of the growth of the fungi was determined by the reduction of the DNP to DNP_0 (OD_0 = 0.1). The DNP concentration was then adjusted to 1 mg/mL. The inhibition of the growth of the fungi was measured by the reduction of the DNP to DNP_0 (OD_0 = 0.2). The DNP concentration was then adjusted to 1 mg/mL.

2.4. Resazurin Determination
The resazurin assay was performed on the mycelium of the Candida albicans ATCC 90028 strain, using the same method as in previous studies [15, 16]. The mycelium of the Candida albicans ATCC 90028 strain was cultured on PDA at 25°C for 7 days. The mycelium from the yeast was harvested, washed with distilled water and washed twice with distilled water.


## Results
A total of 513 samples were tested on human blood, blood, urine, vaginal samples, sputum and pu. The most common products included: 1,749 (97.9%) antimicrobial compounds, 19 (1.6%) antifungal compounds, 62 (0.9%) fungicidal compounds, 4 (1.4%) fungistatic compounds, 7 (1.2%) fungicidal agents and 2 (0.8%) fungistatic agents. Antibiotic compounds were the most common compounds, with 440 (67.5%) agents, with 50 (4.1%) agents, with 63 (0.9%) agents and with 65 (0.9%) agents, respectively.

The most common antifungal compound against Aspergillus was Cephalosporium, with eight agents and 66 agents. In the case of Cephalosporium spp., 4 agents and 24 agents were found.

The most common antifungal compounds against Aspergillus were Cephalosporium spp., Cephalosporium spp. and C. albicans, with 75 agents and 47 agents. In the case of C. albicans spp., the most common antifungal compounds were amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, caspofungin and voriconazole.

The most common antifungal compound against Aspergillus spp. was amphotericin B, with six agents and 29 agents. In the case of amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, caspofungin and voriconazole.

The most common antifungal compound against Aspergillus spp. was caspofungin, with one agent and two agents.

The most common antifungal compound against Aspergillus spp. was amphotericin B, with four agents and 29 agents. In the case of amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, caspofungin and voriconazole.

## Discussion
The main concern in the production of these compounds is their antifungal activity as they are potent inhibitors of fungal growth and biofilm formatio. Several studies have been carried out in yeast and filamentous fungi by other authors (Nishida et al. 2006; Kasuga et al. 2011), and also in plant pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus species (Zhang et al. 2012).

The essential oils of the genera Aureobasidium, Malassezia, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Fusarium were investigated for their antifungal activity. The essential oil of A. flavus was active against pathogenic fungi, whereas it was inactive against yeasts (Figure 6). In the case of Fusarium spp. essential oil of this genus was active against all strains tested. This is in contrast to other essential oils, such as oil of Stigmatella spp. (Cao et al. 2015), which was active against all tested species.

The essential oil of the genus Alternaria was active against yeast (Figure 6). This is in contrast to the oil of Fusarium spp. oil of the genera Candida, Malassezia, and Penicillium that was active against both species (Figure 6).

The essential oil of Fusarium was active against filamentous fungi (Figure 6). This is in contrast to the oil of Fusarium spp. oil that was active against both species (Figure 5). The essential oil of C. albicans was active against both filamentous fungi (Figure 6). This is in contrast to the essential oil of Fusarium spp. that was active against both species (Figure 5). The essential oil of S. cerevisiae was active against both filamentous fungi (Figure 6). This is similar to the essential oil of A. flavus.

The essential oil of Fusarium was active against both filamentous fungi (Figure 6). This is in contrast to the oil of Fusarium spp. oil of A. flavus.

The essential oil of P. quadrifida was active against both filamentous fungi (Figure 6).
