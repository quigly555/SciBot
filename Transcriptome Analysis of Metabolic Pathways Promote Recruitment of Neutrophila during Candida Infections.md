The crystal structures of the two fungal strains, C. albicans and C. glabrata, were elucidated on the participation of a novel transport protein, OspA, in the recruitment of neutrophils to the hyphal tip of the yeast. The study also revealed that OspA was required for the pathogenesis of C. albicans in a murine model of pneumonia<|endoftext|endoftext|>Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a life-threatening fungal infection associated with a high mortality rate in systemic and fungal-halternated immunodeficiency (SIR) patients. The development of IFIs after IFIs are poorly defined and cause increased morbidity and mortality. We herein report the first case of a five-year follow-up in a renal transplant recipient with IFIs.

Three hundred and seventy-two transplanted patients were followed up for the preceding 10 years. SIR was measured with serum and bone marrow biopsies. A total of 42,259 (89.5%) patients were followed for the previous two years. SIR was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of mortality (RR = 1.4; 95%CI, 1.1-1.9; P = 0.02). Median age was 36 years (SD = 6); 67.3% were females. The overall incidence of IFIs in our study was 223 (56%) cases per 100,000 patients. The most common infection was Aspergillus terreus (n = 45; 22.9%), followed by Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 10; 17.9%), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 11; 17.9%), and Rhizopus oryzae (n = 6; 16.9%). Patients with culture-proven and aspergillosis had a median of 33 CFU/100 ml (95%CI, 32-45 CFU/100 ml).


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungal pathogen that can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in humans, a disease that is highly recalcitrant to biologic treatments. IPA is a major public health problem in many parts of the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Middle East [1-3]. A. fumigatus is also an important opportunistic pathogen that causes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in humans and animals [4-7]. ABPA is an uncommon and often understudied, but serious, fungal disease, with an estimated incidence of 30% in immunocompromised patients [8]. It can progress from a rare respiratory infection in immunocompromised patients to a severe, life-threatening disease in immunocompetent individuals [9, 10].

Currently, three classes of antifungal drugs are available for treatment of IPA: azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), polyenes (flucytosine), and echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin). However, these drugs are much less effective than amphotericin B and do not penetrate deep into the fungal cells, making them less effective against IPA [11, 12]. The current strategy is to develop novel drugs to treat IPA and develop new approaches to overcome the limitations of currently available antifungal drugs.


## Methods
2.1. Microbial Strains and Culture Conditions
A. fumigatus strain AF293 (serotype A, U.S.A.) was used as a control.

2.2. Preparation of Microbial Growth Media and Heat Treatment
The bacterial culture from E. coli strain MG1655 (serotype B, U.S.A.) was used as the culture medium for heat treatment.

2.3. Transformation of S. cerevisiae
The S. cerevisiae strain was transformed with pAN7-S-deacetylcytosine-pyruvate (SDS-pAN7) as described previously [15]. In brief, genomic DNA of S.


## Results
albican. We used real-time RT-PCR to analyze the transcription of two key genes, HOG1 and SPO4, and one that is known to be essential in C. albicans (S1 Fig). In C. albicans, the expression of the HOG1 transcription factor has been shown to regulate the immune response, and this response has been shown to be required for successful infection in C. albicans [15,17]. In contrast, the expression of the SPO4 transcription factor is down-regulated in response to C. albicans infection [18,19]. In C. albicans, the expression of the SPO4 is critical for the adaptive immune response, and the expression of the HOG1 transcription factor is reduced in response to C. albicans infection [17,19]. We next tested the expression of two key enzymes that are important for the adaptive immune response, HOG1 and HOG2. We used the expression of both HOG1 and HOG2 in the C. albicans response to investigate the role of these two transcription factors in C. albicans infection. In the absence of the HOG1 transcription factor, the expression of both genes is reduced in C. albicans. However, expression of the HOG2 gene was also reduced in the absence of the HOG1 transcription factor. We next tested the expression of the expression of HOG2 and HOG1 in C. albicans and found that the expression of both genes was reduced in C. albicans. This suggests that transcription of both genes is required for the adaptive immune response in C. albicans.

Amorphogenicity of C. albicans Induced by C.Â albicans Infection
To further analyze the effects of C. albicans infection on the C. albicans fitness, we made the C. albicans strain inoculated with 1 mg/ml C. albicans, which was directly administered to the uninfected and infected mice. The results are shown in Fig 2. The survival rate of C. albicans was approximately four times that of the wild-type strain. However, the survival rate of C.


## Discussion
This study was performed to determine the functional and molecular characterization of the novel CNA1 gene in C. neoformans. Previously, we had demonstrated that the CNA1 gene was expressed and expressed at a low level in C. neoformans and that this gene was induced by exposure to different media (29). The results of the present study, however, show that the CNA1 gene is not highly expressed in the cells of the original and current C. neoformans strain, which was challenged with the same antifungal drug.
