## Abstract

We evaluated in vitro and in vivo responses to 3 distinct antifungal agents, fluconazole (FLC) and ketoconazole (KTC), and 2 flucytosine (FTC), at concentrations of .5 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml for wild-type, mutated and FSHV, FEN and FSCA1. We compared these responses to the standard antifungal regimen alone or in combination with FLC and KTC.

3 FSHV-/- FSHV, FEN - FSHV or FSCA1 combinations were significantly fewer in mice and had lower survival and lethality than the combination alone. Faced with markedly fewer lung alveolar lavage fluid (LALF) and sputum specimens, FSHV, FEN and FSCA1 were significantly more abundant in lungs of mice than FSHV, FEN and FSCA1. The 3 FSHV-/- and 3 FSHV-/- FSHV combinations had significantly lower fungal burden in BALF and sputum specimens in FSHV-/-FEN (P<0.05), FEN-FSHV (P<0.001) and FSCA1 (P<0.001). The 3 FSHV-/- FSHV and 3 FSHV-/-FSHV FSHV-FEN combinations had significantly higher total serum levels in mice (P<0.05) and FSHV (P<0.001), but significantly lower serum levels of FSH in mice and FSH in FEN in FSH-FSCA1 (P<0.01) and FSCA1 (P<0.001). The 3 FSHV-/- FSHV and 3 FSHV-/-FSHV FSHV-FEN combinations had significantly higher serum concentrations in lungs of mice (P<0.05) and FSH in FSH-FSCA1 (P<0.01) than in FSH in FSH-FTC (P<0.01).


## Introduction
The yeast Rhodotorula glutinis (formerly Coryneum glutinosa) is an obligate intracellular rod-shaped yeast. It is an economically important and pathogenic fungus that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans, including chronic granulomatous meningoencephalitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and lung and skin infections [1]. Rhodotorula glutinis is generally considered as an asymptomatic or an opportunistic pathogen in healthy individuals, but it can cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [2]. Therefore, the natural environment is very crucial in the growth of Rhodotorula glutinis. The effect of temperature on the growth of Rhodotorula glutinis is well described, and this effect is induced by the nitrogen source sorbitol, which causes an increase in the pH of the medium [3].

Sorbitol is a natural product produced by plants and its main component, sorbitol, is a natural product of chemical origin. Sorbitol reacts with nitrogen source, causing oxidative damage and also its toxicity [4]. Sorbitol acts as a nitrogen-containing compound, which inhibits the activity of various enzymes to the extent that the enzyme that is involved in this reaction, is the enzyme that is called as a substrate for the free amino acid N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (NAG). The inhibition of the enzyme by the free amino acid is called as a substrate reaction. The reaction by nucleophilic attack of nucleophilic acid takes place at the NADP- pool. In the case of N-galactosaminidase, which is involved in the reaction by nucleophilic attack of nucleophilic acid, the nucleophiles are called as substrate reactions. In the case of nucleophilic acid attack, the reaction by nucleophiles is called as an as enzyme reaction.


## Methods
In this study, this risk factor was combined with the risk factors for the development of COPD in the present study (Table 2.

3.1. Selection Criteria
We conducted an in-house project to analyze the risk factors for COPD in the present study. We analyzed the risk factors for COPD in a cohort of patients who had not previously been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic pulmonary aspergillosis. We included a total of 90 patients from the cohort who had undergone histological examinations of lung, brain, brain stem, and heart. The time point of the study was the first day of the hospitalization for all the patients with CD4^+ cells count =200 cells/µL. We excluded patients with multiple or similar pneumonia or WHO stage 3 pneumonia, all of whom were on anti-tuberculosis medication. The patients were censored at the end of the study. We performed a detailed questionnaire including age, gender, and previous treatment, as well as the time to the initiation of the study.

## Results

Pseudomonas vaginalis was diagnosed in a prospective study of 19 women who had a vaginal infection with a diagnosis of a urinary tract infectio. The clinical picture of the patient was similar to the original diagnosis: candidaemia, dysuria, and fever. A diagnosis of the bacterial infection was made after a further investigation with the aim to determine if the patient had a prior diagnosis of a urinary tract infection, and if this diagnosis was confirmed by culture. The patient was considered as having an “alleged sexual partner” and the report of a possible pregnancy was made on the day of the study. The patient’s age and sex were unremarkable, and the herpesodia was not diagnosed.

The presence of candidaemia was confirmed by culture (Table 1). The positive results of the negative cultures were confirmed by culture in the presence of a hematoxylin or eosin (Table 1). The patient’s age and sex were unremarkable, and the herpesodia was not diagnosed.

The positive results of the negative cultures were confirmed by culture in the presence of a hematoxylin or eosin (Table 1).

Results of positive CSF cultures in the final results of the study were as follows: (i) no Candida species or fungi detected in culture (Table 1); (ii) yeast cultures were positive for C. neoformans in CSF culture but not in serum, but the fungus was cultured in the negative CSF culture (Table 1).

The results of positive CSF cultures in the final results of the study are shown in Table 2.

Results of culture in the final results of the study are shown in Table 3.

Of the 16 patients who died, 7 patients had positive CSF cultures but not in serum, and 3 patients had positive CSF cultures in the negative CSF culture. None of these patients had a positive CSF culture in the final results of the study. All patients were treated with antibiotics, while none of the patients were receiving antimicrobial treatment.

Treatment of candidiasis was not given in any patient. The patient was admitted for urgent surgical treatment with the intention to treat, but with the intention to prevent candidiasis. The patient was diagnosed with systemic candidiasis on the day of the study.


## Discussion
This protein is present in the human bod. In addition, the expression of the pathogenicity-related gene FdRAS2 was up-regulated in a bacterial (B. mori) host (S5 Fig). This is in agreement with a previous study which showed that the pathogenic fungus C. albicans has the ability to synthesize FdRAS2 in order to degrade the glyoxalate synthase (GSY) complex of this fungus (39). A previous study showed that FdRAS2 is required for C. albicans colonization of the human gut (40). This study further showed that the pathogenic fungus C. albicans has the ability to synthesize FdRAS2.

To further examine the molecular mechanisms of the above mentioned processes, the transcriptome data was analyzed. A total of 7,433 gene models were identified using a total of 6,523 gene models with the highest number of gene models being selected from the total of 9,717 predicted genes. In this study, the gene models for C. albicans were selected based on the GO terms: metabolic processes, cell wall/membrane organization, transport and stress response. The GO terms for the metabolic process included aerobic, anaerobic, and anaerobic metabolism. The high number of genes involved in the metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates indicated that the protein kinase pathway is required for the maintenance of the cell membrane integrity, as well as for the synthesis of an extracellular matrix (ECM) to support the membrane biogenesis. The transcription factor, Cbp1, is a central regulator of the cell cycle, a critical step in the cell wall biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of an extracellular matrix was also repressed by Cbp1, suggesting that the intracellular matrix is involved in the cell wall biosynthesis. A single cell wall-related gene, CAZymes, was identified in the proteome. The CAZymes were down-regulated in C. albicans, C. albicans-infected gut-associated C. albicans cells and C. tropicalis-infected human gut-associated C. albicans cells, respectively. These results suggest that the cell wall/membrane organization of C. albicans and its regulation are associated with the cell cycle, a requirement for the maintenance of the cell wall/membrane organization.
