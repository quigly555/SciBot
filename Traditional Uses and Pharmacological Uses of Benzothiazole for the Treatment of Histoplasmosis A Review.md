## Abstract
This study was designed to evaluate the in vitro antifungal activity of the essential oil from the root of Piper aduncum L. (Pentus officinalis) against Trichosporon asahii, Trichosporonaceae, Candida and Aspergillus species. Eighteen yeast strains were used in this study, and their essential oil was extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The antifungal activity of the essential oil was evaluated against Trichosporonetes, Trichosporongum, and Trichosporolae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for the antifungal activity against each species. The concentrations of essential oil obtained from Piper essential oil were determined to be 0.08-2.25 mg/mL by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The MIC results were interpreted in terms of minimal fungicidal (MFC) concentration, which correspond to Min.icidal Concentration (ML) or Minimal Ca-Som Ratio (MSC) (1-2). The minimum fungicidal concentrations (MLC) and MSC values for the essential oil were calculated. The study results indicated that the essential oil from Pentus officinalis was less toxic than that from T. asahii or T. tubingensis. This study demonstrated the efficacy of essential oil from P. officinalis against Trichosporonetes and investigated its potential as a drug.


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections is increasing at an alarming rate. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are among the major health problems. The most common fungal infection is candidiasis. Although Candida is the most common fungal pathogen, the incidence of IFIs in the general population has been declining (Brown et al., 2011). These opportunistic fungal infections are often caused by the Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida famata, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Candida terreus. Candida albicans is the most common agent (35%) and causes most of the IFIs. The most common fungal pathogens are Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei. Other fungi are rarely involved in the infections and are rarely isolated from the environment. Candida glabrata is the most common pathogen, causing ~1-3% of the candidiasis cases (Hava et al., 2016). The number of invasive fungal infections is increasing in the developed world, especially in the developing world (Liu et al., 2017). The Candida species are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections (Wu et al., 2017). The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida strains is a serious problem, because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant (CDR) strains, the high cost of the drugs, and the emergence of resistance to antifungals (Fisher et al., 2012; Fisher et al., 2013). MDR Candida strains have been increasingly identified as multidrug-resistant (MDR-resistant) due to the emergence of MDR strains. As a result of the emergence of MDR strains, an ever growing number of resistant or drug-resistant (resistant) strains has been identified (MDR-resistant) (Tian et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2013).

The discovery of antifungal resistance is due to the unique mode of action of the antifungal agents.

## Discussion
The release of KATPs into the extracellular environment can be used to predict the concentration of KATPs, which can be measured in a variety of concentrations (Rocha et al., 2016). In this study, we used the KATP data to predict the KATP-release pattern of the fungus in a concentration range of 0-12.
