## Abstract
In fungi, transcription factors play a variety of roles in diverse physiological and developmental processes. These factors are transcriptionally regulated by a complex transcriptional profile that is composed of numerous regulators of diverse phenotypes. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the transcriptional response to different nutrients, environmental stresses, and stress-induced proteolytic degradation is mediated by the G-protein Bdr1. Bdr1 is a virulence factor that regulates multiple aspects of morphogenesis and pathogenesis in N. crassa. However, the role of Bdr1 in the G-protein pathway has not been investigated previously. In this study, we found that Bdr1 is required for the growth and virulence of N. crassa. In addition, it was also required for the expression of genes regulated by Bdr1. The results demonstrate that Bdr1 is essential for growth and virulence of N. crassa.


## Introduction

In the present study, we focused on the characterization of genes expressed in the Glucose Oxidase Kinases (GSKs. They are key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of starch, sugar, amino acids and sugars, but also can be involved in glycosylation, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy production. Genes that are expressed in GSKs were grouped into six main categories. In addition, the chemical structure of GSKs was analyzed. As a first step in the biosynthetic pathway, we focused on the GAOX2 gene in this strain. The GAGA2 gene is a GaOX2 homolog, and its coding sequence is similar to the sequence of GAGA1 and GAGA2, two GAGA isoforms that are present in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gene expression analysis revealed that GAGA2 is similar to GAGA1, GAGA2 and GAGA3, but similar to the other GaOX2-GAGA2-GAGA2-GAGA2 isoforms of S. cerevisiae. These results demonstrate that GSKs are involved in the biosynthetic pathway of starch and can be involved in glycosylation, fatty acid metabolism and energy production. GAGA2 is a GaOX2 homolog that is expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The GAGA2 gene is related to the GAOX2 gene of S. cerevisiae. Gene expression analysis revealed that GAGA2 is expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The GAGA2 gene is related to the GAGA1 gene, a GAGA2 isoform that is present in the genome of yeast.


## Methods
The lox- and lox-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox enzymes were constructed by the use of the Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and L-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes, respectivel. All enzymes were synthesized and purified from wild-type (WT) and Cdc10-deficient (cdc10^R) mice, respectively (12).

The L-Lys-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and L-Lys-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes were constructed by the use of the Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes, respectively. All enzymes were synthesized and purified from wild-type (WT) and Cdc10^R (cdc10^R) mice, respectively (12).

The L-Lys-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and L-Lys-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes were constructed by the use of the Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes, respectively. All enzymes were synthesized and purified from wild-type (WT) and Cdc10^R (cdc10^R) mice, respectively (12).

The L-Lys-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and L-Lys-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes were constructed by the use of the Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox and Pst-Lox-Rho-Pst-Lox-lox enzymes, respectively. All enzymes were synthesized and purified from wild-type (WT) and Cdc10^R (cdc10^R) mice, respectively (12).


## Results
2008) in . neoformans revealed that the chsA gene has a homolog in C. neoformans, but no homolog in C. albicans (Chokan et al. 2008) and C. parapsilosis (Chokan et al. 2008). Similarly, the protein kinase gene FKBP12 (Nguyen et al. 2009) and the uncharacterized kinase in C. glabrata (Gorkhan et al. 2013) in which we identified a homolog in C. neoformans were not found in C. albicans or C. glabrata, but were found in C. neoformans (Chokan et al. 2008) and C. parapsilosis (Chokan et al. 2008). In this study, we confirmed that the chsA gene is present in C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis, and that this gene was present in the C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis strains.

In addition, the chsA gene was present in both C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis, but it was absent in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis strains (Chokan et al. 2008). This is also the case of the gene present in C. albicans (Chokan et al. 2008). We found that in the C. parapsilosis strains, the chsA gene was present in both C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis strains, but it was absent in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis strains (Chokan et al. 2008). Furthermore, the chsA gene was present in both C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis strains, but it was absent in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis strains (Chokan et al. 2008). We found that in the C. parapsilosis strains, the chsA gene was present in both C. neoformans and C. parapsilosis strains, but it was absent in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis strains (Chokan et al. 2008).


## Discussion
These genes are involved in a variety of processes in the host, including cell wall and cell-wall degrading enzymes, enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acid, and the production of phospholipids (.g., prostaglandins). Moreover, the gene family that encodes enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and fatty acid esters was found in all the strains. This suggests that this family of enzymes plays an important role in the fungal pathogenesis.

Furthermore, several genes involved in the synthesis of non-fermentable carbon sources were found in the genome. These genes include the amino acid catabolism and the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase family. The fatty acid synthase family (FAS_541, FAS_483) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of chitin, and the cellulose-6-phosphate-phosphate-phosphate-phosphate-phosphate-phosphate-phosphate (PPP-PPPP) family (EUC_1626) is a family of non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) enzymes involved in the synthesis of cellulose, and the PPP family (NRPS_421) is a family of non-ribosomal peptide monooxygenases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of pectin and cellobiohydrolases (PPCs) (Pseudomonas pectinase). The PPP family (NRPS_422, NRPS_547, NRPS_491, NRPS_501, NRPS_572, NRPS_501A, NRPS_603A) is a family of non-ribosomal peptide monooxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of pectin and cellobiohydrolases (PPCs) (Pseudomonas pectinase) (Pseudomonas vaginalis).
