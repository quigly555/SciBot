## Abstract
Globally, arid soils are common in highland areas but represent only a small fraction of irrigated lands. As climate change, arid soils are expected to bring about a significant loss in irrigated land. Fungi are known to kill invasive species and to contaminate crop residues. The majority of soil biovaccines target plants rather than non-target insects, that are considered safe for crops. The uptake of biovaccines by beneficial (i.e. soil mycologists and/or plant-beneficial) soil mycologists is undermined by the poor uptake of beneficial (i.e. soil-borne) fungi and by the high toxicity of beneficial (i.e. soil-inhabiting fungi). The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is shown to be a good biovaccine target, but a lack of understanding of the mechanisms governing the toxicity of toxic compounds in biovaccines has compromised the efficacy of many biovaccines. In this paper, we present an integrated approach to understand the regulatory efficacy of two-component pyrolyzed heterologously expressed transcription factors (pTRFs). We show that the pTRFs have very little overlap with the other genes of the fungal kingdom, including those of the mycobiota, and that they can be targeted to different niches and biovacilli. Furthermore, we show that a pTRF-mediated inhibition of fungicide tolerance may prevent rice blast disease by protecting the fungi from the degradation of their natural carbon sources. We also report that pTRFs of the mycobiota of the wheat host are likely to be much more toxic to the plant than previously assumed, suggesting that the pTRFs may be used as bioprotective agents by plants of the host. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory efficacy of biovaccines and provide an evolutionary target for future biovaccine development.

The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is an invasive blast fungus that is widely used in agricultural fields as it is a key factor in the resistance of rice to alternative biovacciliations and in controlling the spread of M. oryzae among crops.


## Introduction
In eukaryotic cells, lipid rafts and membrane proteins are highly conserved, with the membrane proteins acting as a stress-resistance barrier, and in many cases they are also involved in the interaction between proteins and cell membranes. These proteins are involved in different mechanisms that ensure cell integrity, such as protein folding, interaction with the extracellular environment, and transport of nutrients and molecules. In fungi, lipid rafts and membrane proteins are highly conserved and they are often involved in the interaction between proteins and cell membranes. For example, the interaction between S. cerevisiae lipid raft and membrane proteins is essential for the formation of the cell wall and survival of this organism [1].

The regulation of lipid raft and membrane proteins involves many different proteins, including the lipid-binding proteins, phospholipases, sterols, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins [2]. There are two main families of lipid rafts, which are morphologically conserved and have distinct roles in cell biology. The morphological conserved sterol/glycosylphosphatidylinositol (S/GPI) proteins belong to the cyclic peptide regulatory (CPR) family. In the S. cerevisiae cyclic peptide regulatory family, the CPR1 and CPR2 phospholipases are the major substrates in the cation transport chain. In the C. neoformans cyclic peptide regulatory family, the S100 protein phospholipase C (Pca1) is the major substrate, and in C. neoformans, the CPR1 and CPR2 are the major substrates. In C.


## Methods

In this study, the yeast and yeast-producing cells were cultivated at 28 °C in a rotatory shaker (Konaroom 2, Japan. After cultivation, 200 mL of culture were transferred to a flask with 0.9% (w/v) of yeast nitrogen base and 200 mL of culture were inoculated into 250 mL of fermentation medium, while 100 mL of culture were inoculated into a shaker (Konaroom 2, Japan). The culture was kept for 24 h at 28 °C, while the yeast was incubated in a rotatory shaker (Konaroom 2, Japan) at 200 rpm. The culture was kept for an additional 24 h at 28 °C. The yeast-producing cells were transferred to a flask containing 0.9% (w/v) of yeast nitrogen base and the culture was incubated in a rotatory shaker (Konaroom 2, Japan) at 200 rpm. The yeast-producing cells were transferred to a flask containing 0.9% (w/v) of yeast nitrogen base and then the culture was incubated at 28 °C. The yeast-producing cells were observed by microscopy using a light microscope (Motic 2200).

The survival of yeast and the growth of yeast in the liquid medium were analyzed after the addition of 20 µL of 10% (v/v) chloramphenicol. The yeast-producing cells were incubated at 28 °C for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (Konaroom 2, Japan) at 200 rpm. Then, the yeasts were transferred to a glass slide and examined under a light microscope (Motic 2200) to determine the survival rate of yeast and to determine the proportion of the selected yeast cell population to the selected yeast cell population.

Experimental design of yeast-specific protein kinase activities
The yeast-specific activity of proteins was analyzed by using a proteolytic kinase assay (4). The kinase activity of the yeast was evaluated by using an X-ray film assay (5). The kinase activity of the yeast was evaluated by using an X-ray film assay (6). The kinase activity of the yeast was evaluated by using a protease assay (7).


## Results
After 1 h of incubation, the WT, <U+0394>ku70<U+0394>ku70, and <U+0394>ku80<U+0394> mutants were transferred to different MM (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose, YPD) conditions (Fig 3A) to observe the interaction of yeast with host cell. The yeast cells were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C to induce a host-pathogen interaction, followed by the addition of yeast (Fig 3B), which were then transferred to the host (Fig 3C). When the yeast cells were transferred to the host, they were grown for an additional 24 h. The yeast cells were then subjected to the same conditions, as the host cells were moved to the same MM for a further 24 h. The yeast cells were then transferred to the host and the interaction was further assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h. The interaction was then tested for 24 h in more detail, using live yeast cells as a control. The yeast cells were transferred to the host for another 24 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h.

The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for 24 h for a further 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h. The yeast cells were transferred to the MM for another 48 h, and the interaction was then assessed for 24 h.

To test whether yeast cells can provide a broader perspective on host-pathogen interactions, we examined the yeast cells in the presence of a variety of antifungal drugs, including fluconazole, voriconazole, or amphotericin B, which is a key inhibitor of the yeast cell-cell interaction pathway.


## Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that R. sinensis and R. eximia were able to synthesize a broad range of carbon sources, including glucose, lactose, and mannitol, in a dose-dependent manner. This result is consistent with the findings of other studies that reported that C:2 lactose and R. irregularis had similar substrate specificity for carbon sources [16,21,27]. A further study also reported that the contents of sugars, carbohydrates, and amino acids were highly dependent on the culture conditions and were dependent on the growth conditions of the species [20,28]. This supports our hypothesis that R. sinensis and R. eximia could produce a wide range of carbon sources in the medium, but the total carbon source were not determined at the time of the cultivation. To our knowledge, this is the first report that is consistent with the production of carbon sources by these two species.

The carbon sources that we studied were glucose, lactose, mannitol, and glycerol. All of these carbon sources could be produced by these two species. The high substrate specificity of these carbon sources supports the hypothesis that these two species could produce a wide range of carbon sources in the medium. The reported substrate specificity for R. sinensis and R. eximia was glucose, which is in line with other studies that reported that the production of glucose could be independent of R. sinensis and R. eximia [20,28]. The low substrate specificity for R. sinensis and R. eximia might be the result of the production of glucose by R. sinensis and R. eximia, which has been reported in other studies that both species have been cultivated with glucose [28].

Although the optimal carbon source for R. sinensis and R. eximia was not determined, it is possible that the carbon sources could be utilized in some cases in order to produce carbon sources that are superior in biomass production and/or to maintain a sufficient biomass for growth.
