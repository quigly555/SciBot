## Abstract
The release of fungal cells by neutrophils during infections with fungal pathogens are a fundamental mechanism of immune defense. While several virulence factors are known during infections with pathogens, the factors accounting for the fungal survival during infection with neutrophils from healthy individuals were unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of human neutrophils with Pichia kudriavzevii yeast strain L10 (C. kudriavzevii YL-12) results in significantly decreased survival after an infection with a pathogenic strain, Cryptococcus neoformans. Pichia kudriavzevii yeast strain L10 induced more severe and delayed neutrophil release, resulting in a significant decrease in neutrophil viability and an increased risk of cryptococcal meningitis. In addition, neutrophils from treatment group exhibited an increased susceptibility to apoptosis- and necrosis-spectrum responses compared to those from control group. Furthermore, P. kudriavzevii yeast strain L10 also induced a higher level of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-12a secretion compared to control group. Interestingly, P. kudriavzevii yeast strain L10-induced higher levels of M1-type memory responses in human neutrophils. Taken together, these results suggest that P. kudriavzevii yeast strain L10-induced neutrophil influx and migration into the fungal phagosome during infection is important for fungal pathogenesis.


## Introduction
 2017.

The studies of the effects of nematodes are mainly focused on nematodes that are economically important and possess special ecological characteristics. For instance, nematodes are widely distributed in the environment and are relatively easy to be cultivated for breeding because they are large and can survive for several generations. Nematodes are able to produce huge amounts of secondary metabolites that are able to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria, fungi, and protozoa and to protect themselves from many hazards such as environmental pollution, parasites and viruses (Moody et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017). However, in spite of their economic importance, the use of nematodes is relatively limited compared to other animals such as horses, goats, cattle, sheep, fish, and plants. Nevertheless, many species of nematodes are used in the agricultural and industrial sectors (Lloyd, 2006), and some species are still used in medicine and others are not used in the animal husbandry industry (Su et al., 2017). Recently, it was shown that the nematode market is worth $1.7 billion globally (Lloyd, 2006), and the production of new drug compounds is increasing (Moody et al., 2012). Although there is no clear evidence for the harmful effects of nematodes on humans, it is known that they are harmful to animals that are dependent on them (Lloyd, 2006). However, the importance of nematodes in human health and the use of nematodes as food in different food industries is unknown. It is therefore important to understand the nematode diet and disease ecology of different organisms.

The nematode has been used for centuries as a food and tool since it is relatively inexpensive, easy to obtain, and non-toxic. However, it is difficult to study its development because of its enormous number of mating types and the large number of strains. In addition, the environment is very harsh, and the external factors (e.g., heavy logging) can cause extreme stress on nematodes. In addition, the nematode can be easily provoked into non-compliance and the natural environment can be dominated by the presence of predators, such as herbivores (Lloyd, 2006). The use of nematodes has been mainly focused on several animals, such as horses, goats, and baboons (Moody et al., 2012; Su et al., 2017).


## Methods
Nematodes were sporulated by growing on PD. The fungal cultures were collected after two days and used for the antifungal assay. The experiment was carried out in triplicate.

Fungal cultures were routinely grown on PDA at 30 °C and maintained on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at 28 °C. The fungi were collected after two days and used for the antifungal assay. The experiment was conducted in triplicate.

For the antifungal assay, 200 µL of a 1 × 10^5 CFU/mL suspension of nematodes were added to 10 mL of distilled water and the pH was adjusted to 6.5. After inoculation, the test was carried out in triplicate.

The fungal cultures were cultivated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) at 30 °C and maintained on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at 28 °C. The fungal cultures were collected after two days and used for the antifungal assay. The experiment was conducted in triplicate.

The antifungal activity of nematodes was determined by the method of Grünwald [44] and Paribasas [45] with minor modifications. The fungal cultures were cultivated in PDB at 30 °C and maintained on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at 28 °C. The nematodes were inoculated by growing on PDA for four days at 28 °C. The nematodes were washed twice with PBS, and then the nematodes were fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C. Then, the nematodes were embedded in paraffin and observed under light microscopy. The nematodes were observed under high-power field microscopy and the experiment was carried out in triplicate.


## Results
A putative parasite-inhibitor system for the delivery of the crystal structure of P. brasiliensis from the fungus
P. brasiliensis can infect living and dead plants and provides a source of nutrients for the growing host plants. The enzyme responsible for delivering the P. brasiliensis crystal structure to the plant surface, PbPbs, is a virulence factor [28]. The P. brasiliensis crystal structure is 20-22 Å resolution with a well-defined central helix, which is well-developed by a well-defined buried region.


## Discussion
The molecular weight of the synthesized peptide was estimated by HPLC-MS^E analysis to be 74.7 kDa, which was within the range of other enzymes and was within the range of other class of molecules. In particular, in the region of the peptide in the active site of the peptide (inhibition site), the chemical shifts of the ^13C NMR signal and the spectral peak corresponding to the peptide amino acid sequence were detected in different concentrations (Fig 4A). The analysis of the results showed that the peptide was inactive against Mucorales and comparable to a monosaccharide peptide (Fig 4B). This peptide was considered to be a polysaccharide since the overall mass of the peptide is in the range of about 32.0 kDa (MeOH) [10]. The peptide was also inactive against Mucorales. The peptide was also inactive against the tested drug, AmpB. The peptide showed the lowest MIC value of the active sites for all compounds. The MIC value for the peptide is 4.7 µg/mL, which was within the range of the other class of molecules, and was within the range of the other classes of compounds.

The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized peptide against the Gram-negative bacteria Helicobacter pylori (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. epidermidis) and the Gram-positive bacterium Escherichia coli was evaluated using the modified human IgG-PCR assay (Fig 5A). The results showed that the peptide was inactive against these bacteria.

In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized peptide against Staphylococcus aureus (Table 2). The MIC value for this peptide was 2.4 µg/mL against S. aureus.

In a previous study, the active site of the peptide was found to be on the left side of the peptide in the binding pocket. However, this was not the case in this study, and the peptide was inactive against the Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-positive bacteria.
