## Abstract
We describe a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient with acquired immune deficiency treated with anti-CD3 autoantibody therapy, which led to a worse outcome.

A 45-year-old female patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoantibodies. Her CD4 T-cell count was low, and there was no evidence of any intrinsic immunodeficiency. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her brain showed multiple cavitary lesions. After antimicrobial chemotherapy, she had a favorable prognosis.


## Introduction
Most people acquire cryptococcal disease through inhalation of infectious propagules from the environment [1]. The various stages of the disease cycle of cryptococcosis in the human host include the lungs, pulmonary sinuses, skin, and skin lesions [2]. Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening systemic infection that can result in death within days in most cases [3]. Therefore, there is a need to understand the immune response to this fungal infection and to develop new therapeutic strategies.

The human host must be aware of the growing body of Cryptococcus spores in the environment. In the environment, Cryptococcus spp. are known to live in association with the alveolar macrophages and neutrophils [4]. On the skin, Cryptococcus spp. are produced in association with phagocytes, such as keratinocytes, macrophages and neutrophils [5]. However, Cryptococcus spp. are most commonly encountered in the environment, and are not pathogenic in humans [6]. On the other hand, Cryptococcus spp. are found in association with other viruses, such as influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serovars, and Toxoplasma gondii [7, 8]. Cryptococcus spp. can invade the respiratory tract, especially the lungs, causing pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.


## Methods
The topology of the bacterial species complex was studied as described in Section “DNA extraction and PCR amplification” of the whole genome sequence of the bacterial species complex [18. The presence of heterologous yeast species was classified as “possible” when the topology of the yeast complex was positive [19]. The heterologous yeast species were also identified as “unknown” when the topology of the yeast complex was negative. The presence of species of which there was a single or multiple species was classified as “no knowns” or “unknown” when the topology of the yeast complex was positive [20]. The presence of the previously mentioned species was classified as “non-known” if the topology of the yeast complex was negative.

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with the primers ITS1 and ITS4 [21]. The PCR was performed in a 25 µl reaction mixture containing 1 µl of 10× PCR buffer, 2.0 µM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 1.25 U of Taq polymerase (Takara). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 µl containing 1 µl of DNA template (10 µM), 1 µl of MgCl_2, 0.4 µM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each dNTP and 1.25 U of Taq polymerase. The PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 1 µl of 1× PCR buffer, 1 µl of each dNTP, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl containing 1 µl of MgCl_2, 0.5 µM of each dNTP, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 1 µl of 1× PCR buffer, 1 µl of each dNTP, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase.


## Results
The Heterologous Yeast Species Complexes from eight major phyla, including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Glomeromycota, are grouped in four clades, representing the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, and Glomeromycota (Figure 2A. These four clades were separated by the presence of the characteristic Ascomycete and Zygomycete in their genomes (Figure 2B). Although these four species are separated by a large number of genes, their genomes contain the Ascomycete in their genomes (Figure 2C). The genomes of Ascomycete Basidiomycete Pb01_4_420 (a Basidiomycete, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Glomeromycete) and Glomeromycete Mucoromycotina (a Pezizomycotina species) are clustered into the same clade (Figure 2C). These four species, as well as Ascomycete Glomeromycete Fusarium species (a Ascomycete species) are grouped in a sister clade to the Ascomycete (Figure 2C).

Fungal Heterologous Yeast Species are Expressed in the Mouse Lungs
We next assessed the expression of a panel of fungal Heterologous Yeast Species (Table 2 and Figure 3). Three of the four fungal species (P. chrysogenum, P. blakesleeanus, and P. jirovecii) are members of the phylum Ascomycota. This genus has a wide range of metabolic pathways that regulate the fungal biomass, pathogenicity, and virulence. The fungi have been shown to possess a wide range of virulence factors, including antimicrobial peptides, drug resistance, and antiviral and anti-inflammatory immune response. In addition, fungi have been shown to have a wide range of phytoalexin and mycophenolate genes (e.g.


## Discussion
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [46, 49. However, the exact function of this adaptation has not been explored.

In this study, we performed an extensive genome-wide survey to identify genes required for adaptation to different environments. In addition to the genes specifically required for adaptation to different niches, we also discovered that a number of genes are required for adaptation to the same niches. These include a set of genes involved in the biogenesis of ergosterol, a set of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase, and a set of genes involved in the production of the enzyme VEGF, which is a key virulence factor for S. aureus [50]. In addition to the genes found in this study, we also identified genes encoding proteins involved in the signaling pathways, including those involved in the transcription factor Sch9 (encoded by CRY2), which is a transcriptional regulator of the PKA pathway, and genes encoding components of the cell wall remodeling complex (CWI) and cell wall integrity protein (CWI-2) pathways, which are involved in cell wall remodeling and cell wall-degradation processes [51].

While the production of ergosterol in S. aureus is regulated by a number of factors, including the cell wall remodeling complex (CWI) and the signal transduction pathway [52], the role of the cell wall remodeling complex in adaptation to different host niches remains unclear. In contrast to the bacterial pathogens, a number of genes involved in cell wall remodeling, including those involved in the cell wall biogenesis, are not present in this study. This is likely due to the fact that our study aimed to identify genes involved in cell wall remodeling and cell wall-degradation processes in a single bacterial strain. However, the role of a number of genes that are required for cell wall remodeling and cell wall-degradation processes in S. aureus may be different from those in other bacterial pathogens.
