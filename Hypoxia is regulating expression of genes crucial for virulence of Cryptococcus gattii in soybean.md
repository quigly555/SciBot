## Abstract
A 36-year-old male was residing in Mosmann, Heidenreich, Heuß, Heuergen-Bass and a wind farm located in the city of Munich, Germany, a temperature 37°C and humidity 25%. Radiograph and EM- scan of chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules with different body temperatures ranging between 40 and 110°C. Large nodules were found along the vessels in the tracheobronchial fur quarters and peri-trachea. A brain biopsy was performed and serum cryptococcal antigen was positive. This is the first report of an unusual pulmonary nodule manifestation associated with environmental warming in a male. A high-dose steroid should be considered for Cryptococcus gattii infection in immunocompetent individuals.


## Introduction
Antibiotics are used to treat a wide range of diseases, including mycotic infections, bacterial infections, fungal infections, and inflammatory diseases [1]. Antibiotic therapy is frequently based on either established natural products or synthetic chemical compounds [2]. However, the use of synthetic chemicals as antimicrobial agents has led to a growing problem of resistance, resulting in the emergence of pathogenic microorganisms, which are difficult to eradicate and control. In addition, the wide use of antibiotics is associated with the increasing number of people with weak or malfunctioning immune systems, who are often unable to eliminate the pathogens in the first place [3].

Antimicrobial drugs have the potential to control the development of resistance in bacteria and to even control the spread of the antimicrobial resistance [4]. Thus, the development of new antimicrobial drugs is highly desired. The resistance mechanism of bacteria to antibiotics is caused by combinations of antibiotic compounds, which have different modes of action and which are different from those of a human or a veterinary health system [5].

The major mechanism of action of antibiotics is the production of toxic reactive molecules, which can kill microorganisms. Therefore, the development of antibiotics has been developed to inhibit bacterial growth and to produce antimicrobial substances. Synthesis of antibiotic compounds has been considered to be the most effective method to produce new antibiotics, which can be used to treat infections. The development of synthetic antimicrobial compounds has been reported in the last decades [6,7,8,9,10,11].


## Methods
Therefore, all other experimental conditions were performed by commercial assay.

All the plants were grown in a controlled environment (Cogent Garden, SC, USA) and a growth chamber (Euromyces Organic Herbarium, Arras, Spain). All plants were exposed to a standard amount of water. After 48 h, the water content of each plant was increased to 40%. A water-decreasing effect of the supernatant was observed. At 24 h, water content was measured, and the results were expressed as picograms per mL.

2.4. Heat Killing Assay
The heat killing of Cryptococcus gattii on woody leaves was performed as described previously (Nei et al., 2017). For the heat killing assay, 10 µL of cell suspension was added to each of the test strains (Table 1) and the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 4 h. The number of CFU per milliliter of the cell suspension was determined, and the results were expressed as picograms per mL.

2.5. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activity of the treated Candida strains on the disinfected woody leaves was evaluated as described previously (Rabing et al., 2014). For the antimicrobial assay, the stock solution of 0.1% (w/v) chloramphenicol (C), 0.01% (w/v) amphotericin B (C), 0.01% (w/v) ketoconazole (C), 0.01% (w/v) efavirenz (C), 0.01% (w/v) fluconazole (C), 0.01% (w/v) piperacillin (C), 0.01% (w/v) ciprofloxacin (C), 0.01% (w/v) afloboxazole (C), 0.01% (w/v) amphotericin B (C), 0.01% (w/v) micafungin (C), 0.01% (w/v) ampicillin (C), 0.01% (w/v) micafungin (C), 0.01% (w/v) flucytosine (C), 0.01% (w/v) micafungin (C), 0.


## Results
neoformans to oxidative stres. Mitochondrial NADH-dependent oxidation of NADPH is one of the most important virulence factors in the host [25]. We compared the effects of high-dose oxidative stress on C. neoformans and C. gattii growth in a dynamic growth assay. We also examined the effects of high-dose oxidative stress on C. neoformans growth in a lipid-lipid ratio (Lip-R^+) assay [27]. We found that the control strain is much less sensitive to oxidative stress than the H99 and KN99 strains (Figure 4A). In addition, the control strain shows an increase in the Lip-R^+ (0.4 mM) strain in response to oxidative stress (Figure 4A). These data suggest that high-dose oxidative stress negatively affects C. neoformans growth and that this effect is independent of cysteine oxidase activity.

Determining the impact of cysteine oxidase activity on C. neoformans virulence is challenging, and we initially focused on the impact of cysteine oxidase activity on C. neoformans virulence. We used the C. neoformans strain KU-CM11-2 as an outgroup and used the genetic background of the majority of the KU-CM11-2 strains in this study (Figure 4B). We used the RAPDH assay to assess the impact of cysteine oxidase activity on virulence of the same strains in the virulence model. We found that the RAPDH assay results in an increased risk of developing Cryptococcus infection in the RAPDH-resistant KU-CM11-2 background, whereas the KN99 background had a much lower risk (Figure 4B). In contrast, the RAPDH assay results in increased risk of developing Cryptococcus infection in the RAPDH-resistant KN99 background. These results suggest that the RAPDH assay results in an increased risk of developing C. neoformans infection in the RAPDH-resistant KN99 background, whereas the RAPDH assay results in increased risk of developing Cryptococcus infection in the KN99 background.

Given that high-dose oxidative stress induces cell-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion in C. neoformans [26], we next investigated the effect of oxidative stress on C. neoformans virulence.


## Discussion
 2001. In this study, we observed that the gene encoding a putative cell wall stress-response regulator, TEC-4, was induced in THP-1 cells and THP-2 cells, and subsequently, was repressed in THP-3 cells and THP-2 cells. In THP-2 cells, TEC-4 plays an important role in fungal growth and virulence in a murine inhalation infection model (Maruoka et al., 2007). In THP-1 cells, the transcription of a gene for a C-type lectin was upregulated, which is considered as a virulence factor for Cryptococcus neoformans (Van Dijck et al., 2009). In THP-3 cells, the TEC-4 gene, whose transcription was repressed in THP-2 cells, was downregulated, which is considered as a virulence factor for Cryptococcus neoformans (Van Dijck et al., 2009).

In THP-3 cells, the expression of a putative serine hydroxylase gene, S-cAMP-P-kinase, was repressed, which is a serine phosphoprotease, involved in the metabolism of serine and threonine (van Dijck et al., 2009). In THP-2 cells, the expression of a putative serine-threonine hydroxylase gene, S-cAMP-P-kinase, was repressed, which is a serine-threonine hydroxylase, involved in the metabolism of serine and threonine (van Dijck et al., 2009). In THP-2 cells, the expression of a putative serine-threonine hydroxylase gene, S-cAMP-P-kinase, was repressed, which is a serine hydroxylase, involved in the metabolism of serine and threonine (van Dijck et al., 2009). The expression of a putative serine-threonine hydroxylase gene, S-cAMP-P-kinase, was repressed, which is a serine hydroxylase, involved in the metabolism of serine and threonine (van Dijck et al., 2009).
