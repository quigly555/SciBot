## Abstract
The mycoparasitic fungus Blastomyces (B.) blastocis (1875-2002) causes the largest number of devastating diseases of cereals and mushrooms. This fungus is usually found growing on infected plants as hyphae or spores. However, the mechanisms that allow its growth in the presence of different plant material (membrane and cell wall) are not completely understood. In this study, we show that the exocytoplasmic protease (ESP) in Blastomyces causes the extracellular protease protein (PxP) to bind and to bind to proteins that are normally present in the cell envelope of B. blastocis, resulting in a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the polysaccharide capsule of the major fungal pathogen, B. pseudoballosus. In addition, PxP may bind to certain cell wall components (e.g., chitin, protein and fatty acid residues), and to other cell wall components (e.g., adhesion and adhesin). To elucidate the specificity of PxP to cell wall polysaccharides, antibodies against PxP, a major component of the cell wall, and IgG that recognize capsular polysaccharides were generated by affinity tests with some cell wall polysaccharides. PxP and IgG were not able to induce antibody responses in all tested fungi tested. However, when a specific antibody was introduced against PxP, PxG and/or PxF, the percentages of non-polarized cell wall polysaccharides remained constant, even after several transformations. These data suggest that the complex interactions between the cell wall polysaccharides and the proteins that assemble the cell envelope may play a role in the formation of antibody.


## Introduction

The incidence of fungal infections has increased in India in the past two decade. Currently, the most common opportunistic fungal infection is candidiasis. This infection causes approximately 15-20% of all immunocompromised patients, with the highest incidence of invasive candidiasis is in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant recipients, patients with hematological malignancies, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (HIV/AIDS).

The overall incidence of candidiasis is approximately 0.83 cases per 1000 people, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 50% (Swarthachar et al., 2017). The major predisposing factors for candidiasis include (i) infection with non-albicans Candida species, (ii) neutropenia, (iii) prolonged neutropenia, (iv) prolonged neutropenia after neutrophil extrication, and (v) antifungal drug resistance (Perdomo and Manjunath, 2014; Lee et al., 2017).

Currently, only a few antifungals are available for clinical use, such as fluconazole (FLC) and terbinafine. However, resistance to these drugs has been reported in some species of Candida, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida krusei-Jaklou, to some extent (Pfaller and Diekema, 2004; Pfaller et al., 2012).

Another issue that needs to be considered is the resistance to azole drugs to fluconazole, which might be due to several intrinsic resistance mechanisms. FLC, which is a hydroxylated polysaccharide, is the most important drug used to treat fungal infections. Azole resistance has been observed in Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, and Candida krusei-Jaklou. In fact, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei resistance are closely related (Ganja et al., 2000).


## Methods
% with India as the countryâ€™s largest source of bacterial infections, with a total of 21,710 bacterial infections per 100,000 population in India [1. Fungal infections were detected by the use of India Ink, Micro-Oligonucleotide (MOBIO) and Gram-stained India Ink.

Indoor air sampling and data collection
The number of Fungi infections in indoor air samples was recorded by the use of India Ink, Micro-Oligonucleotide (MOBIO) and Gram-stained India Ink. The Fungal Infection Index (FIP) (DU) was used as the standard method to determine the prevalence of fungal infection in the study area [2]. The FIP index is calculated as follows:

The prevalence of Fungal Infections in indoor air samples was determined by using the quantity of air sampled per minute and the length of the sampling period.

Data collection and processing
Data collection and processing was conducted as per the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (CLSI document M27-A3) [3]. The FIP Index was calculated as follows:

The FIP of the fungi was calculated as the number of fungal-specific (fungal-specific) infections per 100,000 persons, while the FIP of bacteria was calculated as the number of bacteria-specific (bacteria-specific) infections per 100,000 persons.

The FIP value of the various microbial species was calculated according to the following formula: FIP value of the most common (fungal-specific) and the lowest common (bacterial-specific) taxa per 100,000 person per year in indoor air samples were converted into FIP value for each taxonomic group.

Data collection and processing
Data collection and processing was performed as per the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [3]. The sampling was conducted in a 96-well microtiter plate format using India Ink, Micro-Oligonucleotide (MOBIO) and Gram-stained India Ink.

Data collection and processing
The FIP of the fungi was calculated as the number of fungal-specific (fungal-specific) and the lowest common (bacterial-specific) taxa per 100,000 person per year in indoor air samples.


## Results
Of the remaining 30,000 patients, 840 patients were identified as having positive stool cultures, and 452 patients had a positive CSF cultur. The diagnosis of candidiasis was not possible in the remaining 5,090 patients.

In the case of candidiasis, the diagnosis of candidiasis was possible in 995 (54.4%) patients. Among them, 1440 patients were diagnosed with candidiasis (92.7%). Fourteen patients had fungal infections, and the diagnosis of fungal infection was possible in 87 (22.9%) patients. The diagnosis of cryptococcal infection was possible in 25 (19.3%) patients.

The infective agents were the most common antifungal agents, as shown in Table 2. The most common antifungal agents were fluconazole (n=4), voriconazole (n=4), itraconazole (n=2), and micafungin (n=2). The most common antifungal agents were fluconazole (n=1), amphotericin B (n=1), amphotericin B-susceptible (n=1), micafungin (n=1), and caspofungin (n=1). The most common antifungal agents were amphotericin B (n=1) and caspofungin (n=1).

Table 3 summarizes the prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in the central India population. The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis was lower in the population of rural areas than in the population of urban areas.

In the case of cryptococcal meningitis, the incidence of meningitis was very high in the population of rural areas, and the incidence was also very high in the population of urban areas. In the Indian sub-region of India, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was higher in the rural population than in the urban areas (Table 4).

The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was high in the Indian sub-region of India.


## Discussion
%) is much higher than the total reported incidence (1.4%) reported from India [6], a country with a high incidence of fungal infection and many endemic diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV [8]. The incidence of fungal infection is usually a very small proportion in the population and is usually related to the incidence of fungal infection. The only difference between these two studies is that in India, the incidence of fungal infection is the same (13.6%) than in India, and the incidence of fungal infection in India is almost the same (11.5%) than in India [6]. The incidence of fungal infection is related to the whole population rather than to the individual disease, and is a true reflection of the individual risk factors, including age, sex, and the geographic location of the study, which are the main causes of fungal infection [5]. In India, it is clear that the incidence of fungal infection is a very low proportion, compared to the incidence in India. This may be because of the different clinical presentation of the diseases and the geographical distribution of the patients. The same reason, which is more likely for India, could explain why there are many patients with fungal infection.

Fungal infections are usually limited to the lungs, sinuses, and brain, although in other studies it was shown that the incidence of fungal infection was also higher in the lungs, sinuses, and brain [9]. In India, in a study on fungal infection in children, there was no difference in the incidence of fungal infection and non-fungal infection between the two groups, and only one of them was found to be more frequent in the second group. This difference in incidence of fungal infection and non-fungal infection could be caused by the fact that the study of C. albicans was done in children aged 6 months to 7 years. The number of children with fungal infection was obviously higher in the second group than in the first group, and this could be the reason why the incidence of fungal infection was higher in children younger than 6 months to 7 years. This could be due to the fact that the first group had a higher number of children with fungal infection than the second group, but this was not reflected in the incidence of fungal infection in the second group. The study of C.
