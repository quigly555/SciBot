## Abstract
Fungal co-infections have been reported in several different medical journals, but the extent and epidemiology of infection in fungi is not well documented.

We report a case of a 52-year-old woman with a history of onychomycosis from a previous visit to our hospital. She had a normal tooth shadow and we found multiple nodules in the visual analysis. A transbronchial lung biopsy was performed and a full ulcerated mesentery was seen on ultrasound abdomen. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from the patient's saliva, and a clinical picture was consistent with cutaneous and mucocutaneous fungi. We performed a biopsy confirming Cryptococcus gattii infection. The patient was treated with fluconazole for onychomycosis, but was completely and permanently disabled from work.

This case illustrates the challenges in diagnosing fungal infection, and how limited resources can be utilized to support the education of the medical profession on the importance of this topic.


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections has increased in recent years, partly due to the increase of immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer, transplant patients, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, patients with chronic diseases, patients receiving surgical intervention, and HIV-infected patients.1-3 The worldwide incidence of fungal infections has been estimated to be over 70% in patients with skin and soft tissue infections.1-4 Patients with superficial mycoses are frequently the first to be diagnosed, because they may be isolated from patients with non-specific symptoms, because they may be at risk of infection, or may be at risk of acquiring immunodeficiency-like symptoms.1,2 These patients may be the first to be diagnosed because the fungal infections are usually not detected until after the first presentation of the infection. Moreover, some species of Candida are difficult to differentiate from other Candida species, because they are not clinically differentiated.1,2,3 For example, Candida albicans is a species with superficial mucosal and visceral infections. Although C. albicans is rarely pathogenic in humans, it may cause life-threatening invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised patients.1,2,4 The incidence of invasive candidiasis has been increasing in the past years.1,2-8 For example, in the United States, the incidence of candidiasis has increased by more than 50% between 1995 and 2007, and by more than 70% between 2007 and 2012.1,2,9 In the United States, the incidence of invasive candidiasis has increased by more than 50% over the past 20 years.1,2,10

Among the Candida species, Candida glabrata is the most common pathogen, accounting for about 10% of all cases of candidemia.


## Methods
cerevisiae isolated from a patient, . cerevisiae was grown at 30 °C for 5 days in YPD medium [12]. For the control, S. cerevisiae was grown in synthetic complete medium [12] at 30 °C. After S. cerevisiae grown in synthetic complete medium was added, the mycelia were collected and washed twice with sterile PBS, followed by ultracentrifugation. The mycelia were resuspended in sterile PBS and plated on YPD plates. The presence of the fungus in the control strain was confirmed by colony counts.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the Fungal Strains
The antifungal activity of the Fungal Strains of S. cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae, and S. bicolor, was assessed using the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the tested compounds. In addition, the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the tested compounds was determined after incubation at 30 °C for 72 h. The MFC was calculated by the following formula:where V_0 is the MIC value of the tested compound and V_1 is the MIC value of the control strain. MICs were determined in accordance with the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines [13] and the results were expressed as the mean of three independent experiments. The fungicidal activity of the tested compounds was evaluated in three independent experiments, and the results were expressed as the mean ± SEM.

2.4. Antifungal Activity of the Fungal Strains of S. bicolor, S. cerevisiae, and S. bicolor,
Antifungal activity of the fungi of S. bicolor, S. bicolor, S. bicolor, and S. bicolor were determined according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines [13] and the results were expressed as the mean ± SEM.

2.5. Antifungal Activity of the Fungal Strains of S. bicolor, S. bicolor, S. bicolor, and S. bicolor,
The antifungal activity of the fungi of S. bicolor, S. bicolor, and S.


## Results
We observed no evidence of co-infection of any specie. We reasoned that the presence of co-infection would be a good indicator for co-infection, given the co-concentration of the pathogens. To assess co-infection in the spine, we used a co-infection assay with a modified P-shaped, 50-50 co-infection. The co-infection assay was performed in duplicate, with the co-infection assay performed with a sterile needle.


## Discussion
A previous study of immunocompetent . albicans patients with suspected meningitis also showed that patients with co-immunoprecipitation had significantly higher survival rates than patients without co-immunoprecipitation [16]. However, the results from our study did not demonstrate an association between the use of co-immunoprecipitation and a higher disease burden (five cases) compared to C. albicans alone. In this study, we performed a C. albicans infection-free survival study with the use of immunosuppressant drugs, such as amphotericin B, and co-immunoprecipitation. The dose and time of immunosuppressant drugs are affected by the use of immunosuppressant antifungals, which depend on the immune status of the patient, such as S. cerevisiae or C. albicans [19]. The use of immunosuppressant drugs such as fluconazole or echinocandins has been associated with a higher mortality and morbidity in patients with C. albicans infection [20, 21]. Therefore, the use of immunosuppressant drugs in the immunocompetent host is an option for therapeutic use of C. albicans infection. In our study, we did not observe a difference in the occurrence of C. albicans infection-free survival between immunosuppressant drugs and immunosuppressant-only groups (P = 0.72).

We also found that immunosuppressant drugs such as fluconazole and amphotericin B had a significant effect on the infection-free survival of C. albicans. Fluconazole was significantly more effective than the other immunosuppressant drugs in inhibiting the growth of C. albicans, and flucytosine was significantly more effective than fluconazole in inhibiting the growth of C. neoformans. These results suggest that immunosuppressant drugs may be more efficacious than immunosuppressant drugs in restricting C. albicans infection.
