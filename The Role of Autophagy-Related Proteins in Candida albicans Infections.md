## Abstract
Our current understanding of fungal cell wall remodeling is derived from the studies of the lysis of carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1 [CN]) by the Caenorhabditis elegans. Caenorhabditis has two main functions: recycling carbon and S-3 to the fungal cell wall, and then removing this to the bacterial cell wall. In this sense, Caenorhabditis has evolved two different CLR types (CAs and EC 4.2.1.1 [CN]/EC 1.1.2.10 [CAs]). In the Caenorhabditis, there are three superfamilies, and these superfamilies share a common functional trait: They both require the removal of carbon from the fungal cell wall, thereby reducing the S-3 content in the cell wall and restoring the integrity of the cell wall to this component.


## Introduction
The classification of ocular fungal pathogens has changed since the first documented case of human papilloma in 1894, when a group of Japanese patients described a dysfunctional cell-mediated candidiasis (1). Since then, more than 1,200 ocular fungal species have been described, and the number of recognized species continues to grow (2). Of the approximately 200 species, only a few are pathogenic to humans, including Candida glabrata (3), Candida tropicalis (4), Candida krusei (5), Candida parapsilosis (6), Candida krusei var. duboisii (7), Candida parapsilosis (8), and Candida glabrata (9).

Candida albicans, a ubiquitous yeast found in the human body, causes candidiasis of the upper and lower skin and mucosal surfaces, with mortality rates of between 40 and 60% (10). The estimated prevalence of candidiasis varies from 10 to 30% depending on the population examined, and C. albicans is the most common species isolated in patients with nephrotic syndrome (11, 12). However, in immunocompromised individuals such as those with cancer or receiving immune suppressive therapy, C.


## Methods
capsulatum was performed as described [11. Briefly, Candida albicans cells were grown to log-phase in LB medium at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8000× g for 10 min, 10 min at 4°C) and washed twice with PBS. Bacteria were treated with 0.5% trypan blue in PBS for 2 h, after which Bacteria were washed three times with PBS. The cell suspension was plated on LB agar and incubated at 37°C. Then, the number of bacteria was determined by colony counting.

Auto-phagosome-mediated infection of Candida albicans with H. capsulatum was performed as described [11]. Briefly, Candida albicans cells were grown to log-phase in LB medium at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8000× g for 10 min, 10 min at 4°C) and washed twice with PBS. Bacteria were treated with 0.5% trypan blue in PBS for 2 h, after which Bacteria were washed three times with PBS. The cell suspension was plated on LB agar and incubated at 37°C. Then, the number of bacteria was determined by colony counting.

## Results
albicans infections, we evaluated the activity of proteins implicated in autophagic events, .g., autophagic-fructose transporters, autophagy-associated proteins, autophagy-associated protein-encoding proteins, autophagy-associated proteins, and their effector proteins on fungal pathogenicity in vivo. We performed in-vitro proteomic analyses of all the selected proteins for study. As shown in Fig 2A, we identified four proteins with activity against C. albicans with the specific primer set used. In addition, three proteins from the effector protein database (Pfam0179, Pfam0428, and Pfam0158) were identified as autophagy-related proteins. We also identified the autophagy-related proteins from other databases such as the nonredundant database (nrdb.org) (see Fig S1 in the supplemental material), which were not included in the proteomic analysis (see Fig S2 in the supplemental material). We also identified two proteins from the effector protein database (Pfam0159, Pfam0480, and Pfam0500) that are expressed during infection, and that were not found in the proteomic analysis. These proteins may have functions in autophagy. The remaining five proteins were not identified in the proteomics analysis.

The fungal pathogenicity and virulence in vitro assays
To analyze the role of autophagy in the virulence of C. albicans, we tested the virulence of all the selected fungi in a mouse model of infection by C. albicans. The virulence was similar to that of the murine model, i.e., mouse was avirulent in terms of mortality and tissue necrosis within 7 days, and that the mice infected with the control strain died by the end of the experiment (Fig 2B). We also compared the virulence of all the selected fungi in a mouse model of infection by C. albicans in the murine model. The murine model was used to evaluate the virulence of all the selected fungi in this model. The mice were infected with a lethal dose of C. albicans (1 × 10^8 CFU/g) and fungal burden was determined at the end of the experiment.


## Discussion
 2008. The role of autophagy in Candida albicans infections was further investigated by showing that autophagy-related proteins are upregulated in the autophagosome of C. albicans and C. tropicalis, respectively (Fukuyama et al., 2008). The autophagy-related proteins of C. albicans and C. tropicalis were upregulated in autophagic-related genes in the presence of autophagosomes of C. albicans and C. tropicalis (Table S1). These results indicated that C. albicans autophagy might be involved in the pathogenicity of Candida species. The autophagy-related proteins of C. albicans and C. tropicalis were upregulated in autophagosome-related genes in the presence of autophagosomes of C. albicans and C. tropicalis (Table S1), which suggests that C. albicans might also be involved in the pathogenicity of C. tropicalis.

According to our results, autophagy was upregulated in C. albicans and C. tropicalis in response to glucose addition. C. albicans is a cosmopolitan yeast with an increased number of genes involved in the metabolism of glucose and ethanol (Kuranda et al., 2011). C. albicans also has the ability to grow at 42°C (Kumar et al., 2009), which is higher than that of C. albicans and C. tropicalis (Figure 3). Therefore, C. albicans might be a good model for understanding the pathogenicity of Candida species.

Protein Kinase Role in Saccharomyces
Protein kinases are proteins with the highest number of phosphorylation sites (Figure 4A) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kretschmer et al., 2008). Protein kinases are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes and in fungal pathogenicity (Malhotra et al., 2013).
