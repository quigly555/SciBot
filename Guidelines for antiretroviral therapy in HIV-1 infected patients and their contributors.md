## Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes is a member of the growing subtype T (Listeria) that has been increasingly recognized for rapid resolution of serious infections in patients with immune deficiencies. This emerging role might be related to the specific host cell receptor presentation in Listeria. In this study, we found that Listeria can engulf L1 intracellular parasites in a dose-dependent manner and efficiently utilizes host-derived immunomodulatory molecules for replication. Indeed, Listeria can be produced by the host at several concentrations, and our data suggest that the L1 intracellular targets may be differentially expressed upon L1 internalization by the host. In addition, we observed that L1 RNAi was induced at high levels upon Listeria infection. Inositol, an important lipid mediator of L1 replication, was found to be induced in infected cells. Thus, we have identified a new receptor type, which may be induced by many different cell types in vivo and in vitro, and will be important not only for parasite transmission but also for host cell survival in the host during Listeria infection.


## Introduction
The genus Isaiascomycetes is comprised of about 200 species, most of them characterized as small, mostly saprobic, yeast-like organisms. These fungi are known as zoospores, and are commonly found on amphibians, reptiles, and insects. This genus is characterized by the production of conidia with germ tubes and aseptate conidia. The zoospores are the main source of animal predators, as well as prey animals. In fact, Isaiascomycetes are responsible for the vast biodiversity of marine invertebrates, and their isolation is believed to be the first step in the evolution of new host associations (O’Donnell and McDonald, 2000).

Isaiascomycetes can be divided into two broad subtypes, the white-rot (L) and black-rot (E). The L type contains the most polymorphic species (white-rot species), while the E type is characterized by the production of aseptate conidia. White-rot species have a greater diversity of known conidia than black-rot species, and their distribution can range from tropical to polar regions (Brown et al., 2000). In the past, white-rot fungi were classified in the order Chaetosclerida (Kussell and Schirmeister, 1936), but recent studies have shown that this classification is incomplete and the fungal kingdom is still highly polyphyletic (Chang et al., 2009; Köhler et al., 2009; Skowy and Derbyshire, 2014). The taxonomic status of the white-rot fungi is currently uncertain, and the majority of the white-rot fungi are classified in the Chaetosclerida subphylum (Brown et al., 2000; Skowy and Derbyshire, 2014).

The white-rot fungi are generally classified as dematiaceous fungi, with a thick, brownish pigment, which are capable of drying in excess of 50% of dry room temperature (Jolly et al., 1996; Suhr et al., 2001).


## Methods
The Institute for Clinical Laboratory Standards (ICL-2008) and the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for microbiological testing for HIV [19], were reviewed to establish the guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in patients with CD4^+ T cell count <100 cells/mm^3 and/or a positive CSF result [20. The ICL-2008 guideline used for HIV-1 infected patients and their donors was revised in the same way, using a revised guideline that incorporated additional clinical factors, including the use of standard antiviral drugs and the use of specific combinations of the antiretroviral agent. The revised guidelines were revised in accordance with the CLSI guidelines for the review of clinical trial protocols. The revised guidelines and the updated guidelines for the review of clinical trial protocols were released in September 2015 [21].

Study design
Clinical trials were established for the following factors: (1) classification into categories with a score of 0, 1, 2, or 3; (2) the clinical outcomes of the patient; (3) the assessment of the clinical outcomes of the patient; and (4) the cost of antiretroviral therapy. Only a single patient was included in the analysis.

Data collection
The research was reviewed by a team of research ethics officers from the ICL-2008, the ICL-2008 guidelines, and the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and then the main data was collected by an investigator of the ICL-2008 guideline.

Data analysis
The main study design was described in the manual of the ICL-2008 and the CLSI guidelines, with each of the three study sub-cultures being conducted in triplicate. The study was conducted by the ICL-2008 guidelines and the CLSI guidelines in parallel. All data were included in the clinical data to identify potential potential sources of bias and to identify potential interference factors, which may have been introduced during the study.

Data collection
The data were recorded and summarized in a standardized data file. The study was conducted by the ICL-2008 guidelines and the CLSI guidelines in parallel. The ICL-2008 guidelines and the CLSI guidelines in parallel were reviewed and agreed to be merged in order to be merged in a single study. The studies were also reviewed by the research ethics officers from the ICL-2008, the CLSI guidelines, and the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.


## Results
The median duration of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected patients was 15 (IQR: 7-25) year.

Fifteen (57%) of the patients had a history of drug abuse. Eight (72%) of the patients had been hospitalized for a previous HIV infection. Of the patients, 6 (63%) had been hospitalized for a prior HIV infection, and 6 (71%) had died.

Eighteen (36%) patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy for TB. Eight (72%) patients had received empiric antibiotic therapy for TB.

Table 3 shows the patients’ age, sex, and clinical features of the patients with and without history of drug abuse.

Table 4 shows the patients’ clinical characteristics.

Eight (72%) patients had history of use of antiretroviral drugs. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected patients was 3.5 (IQR: 1.9-12.0) years.

## Discussion

In the HIV-1 patient cohort, median mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients (Table 2. Mortality was also higher in the pre-ART group, in comparison to the HIV-1 patients. In the HIV-1 patients, median survival was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients (Table 2). The pre-ART group had a significantly higher mortality than the HIV-1 patients. Furthermore, mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. However, mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. This may be due to an increased immune system and low CD4 counts in the HIV-1 patients, resulting in an increased risk for mortality.

In the HIV-1 patients, median survival was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. Survival was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. However, survival was significantly lower in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients.

During the pre-ART group, mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. Mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. This may be due to the difference in ART initiation, the differences in the age at HIV-1 diagnosis, the timing of treatment and the underlying factors. These factors may also influence mortality. Furthermore, there was a higher median time to HIV-1 diagnosis in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. This may be due to the higher median time to HIV-1 diagnosis in the pre-ART group. However, the pre-ART group had a significantly higher mortality than the HIV-1 patients. This may be due to the fact that the pre-ART group had a longer time to HIV-1 diagnosis.

In the pre-ART group, mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. Mortality was significantly higher in the pre-ART group than in the HIV-1 patients. This may be due to the difference in ART initiation, the differences in the age at HIV-1 diagnosis, the timing of treatment and the underlying factors. These factors may also influence mortality.
