## Abstract
killed by the corresponding Alternaria s. The two Alternaria species, which have been reported from the soil of different sites, were shown to be active in the death of Alternaria sp. It was also observed that Alternaria sp. were able to infect A. nidulans and A. betuliens, the most common Alternaria species in the samples of dead and dying Fusarium sp. The Alternaria species, which was also detected in the soil of dead Fusarium sp., and the most common Alternaria species in the samples of dead and dying Fusarium sp. collected in the soil of the same location, were not able to infect A. nidulans, as was the case with the dead Alternaria species. On the contrary, dead Alternaria species had reduced virulence to A. betuliens. In addition, dead Alternaria species were also less virulent than dying Alternaria species. The predominant defense mechanism of dead Alternaria species against the amastigote parasite, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. acutatum, was the polymeric polymeric polymer of the amastigote with the cell wall intact, but with no capsule. The cocultured strain, which contained a capsule, did not contain any capsule formation. The presence of an amastigote capsule alone, in combination with the capsule, preserved the virulence of both Alternaria species. The silage of the capsule was effective in inhibiting the growth of Fusarium. oxysporum, F. betuliens, and F. succiformiae. In addition, the polymeric polymer of the amastigote preserved the virulence of Alternaria isolates. In conclusion, dead Alternaria sp. caused the death of Fusarium sp., whereas the polymeric polymer of the amastigote preserved the virulence of Alternaria isolates.

Dead Alternaria sp. are frequently isolated from the environment, particularly from farms and soil contaminated with Alternaria species. Alternaria sp. are known causal agents of plant litter boxes, anthracnose diseases, anthracnose-infestations, and other fungal diseases, and are often detected in soil and plant debris, which is a risk factor for Acremonium spp. (Toxicrospium spp.


## Introduction
rosettea (3. The diversity of the genera causing keratomycosis, including T. rosettea, T. marneffei, T. wingfieldii, T. rugosa, T. segobiensis, and T. falciformis, has been confirmed by the identification of a total of 11 distinct species in this complex, of which T. rosettea, T. marneffei, T. segobiensis, T. falciformis, and T. rugosa are the most frequently reported species. The majority of T. rosettea and T. marneffei species isolated from keratin lesions are from Asia and Africa, whereas T. marneffei is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (4). The major species involved in keratomycosis, T. marneffei, are most commonly associated with avian origin (3, 4), whereas T. marneffei, which is more common in tropical and subtropical areas, is more commonly found in tropical and subtropical countries (5, 6). T. marneffei is more commonly found in Europe (7), but T. marneffei is also present in Australia and Papua New Guinea (8). The morphology and biofilm formation of T. rosettea and T. marneffei are distinct from that of other oomycetes (9). These taxa form hyphae and asexual spores, which are surrounded by a thick mucilage of thick-walled lamina propria that produces pseudohyphae, and a thick cellulose layer, which produces thick layers of thick-walled, pyriform sclerotium that produce hyphal fragments. Although T. marneffei is phylogenetically closely related to other oomycetes (10, 11), their morphological characteristics have been relatively diverged in time and are similar only in that they form hyphae and a thick mucilage of thick-walled lamina propria that produces a thick, thick-walled, pyriform sclerotium that produces sclerotia that produce dark, circular, sclerotial-like structures.

## Methods
For infections, 24 h prior to infection, 20 µL of FITC-dextran/BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, S. Louis, MO, USA) (1 mg/mL in 0.1% Tween 80) was added to each well, and the plates were allowed to solidify for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, and 1 × 10^6 OLC cells were added to each well. After 2 h, the medium was aspirated, and the medium was then aspirated again. The medium was then aspirated and the wells were again washed with PBS, and the OLCs were then rinsed three times with PBS to remove free OLCs.

For biofilm assays, 1 × 10^6 MDC/mL was seeded on six-well tissue culture treated 24-well plates in RPMI-1640 medium. OLCs were seeded on the seventh day of infection, and 10 µL of 1 × 10^7 OLCs/well were added. After 48 h, biofilms were formed by subculturing the medium on the seventh day of infection, and the number of OLCs per well was counted. For flow cytometry, 1 × 10^6 MDC/mL was seeded onto 24-well tissue culture treated 24-well tissue culture treated plates in RPMI-1640 medium. OLCs were seeded on the seventh day of infection, and the number of OLCs per well was counted.

For RNA-Seq analysis, 1 × 10^6 OLCs/well were seeded on 24-well tissue culture treated plates in RPMI-1640 medium. OLCs were seeded on the seventh day of infection, and the number of OLCs per well was counted.

## Discussion
maydis, . oxysporum, and F. graminearum [39]. However, the fungus-to-plant associations of U. maydis and F. graminearum in the panda-caught-fish ecosystem are unclear. Additionally, the precise mode of reproduction of the two species remains unclear.

The ability to develop sexual reproduction was also demonstrated for the U. maydis and F. graminearum isolates of Ustilago maydis [40]. Ustilago maydis has been used as a model species for mating in the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle [40]. In U. maydis, the panda-caught-fish can undergo a sexual cycle with a hyphal-like structure and the fruiting body is fertilized by the vesicle [39]. Ustilago maydis has been reported as a model for the formation of a natural hyphal-like structure on G. mellonella [40]. The vesicle is then released into the soil and is subsequently fertilized by the vesicle-like structure [39]. In the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle, the fruiting body is also fertilized by the vesicle-like structure [39]. This structure is followed by the formation of a fruiting body [39]. The fruiting body is then fertilized by the vesicle-like structure [39]. In the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle, the fruiting body is then fertilized by the vesicle-like structure [39].

The main differences between the sexual reproduction and the sexual reproduction of the Ustilago-F. graminearum isolates in the two habitats were the different sexual reproduction strategies of the two species. In the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle, the two species have sexual reproduction. In the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle, both species have sexual reproduction. The sexual reproduction is dependent on the presence of a suitable host. In the U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle, the two species have the ability to infect different hosts. The U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle is dependent on the presence of a suitable host. The U. maydis-fungi sexual cycle is dependent on the presence of a suitable host. The sexual reproduction is dependent on the presence of a suitable host.
