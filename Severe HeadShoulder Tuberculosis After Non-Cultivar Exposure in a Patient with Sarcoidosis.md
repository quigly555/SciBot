## Introduction
Fungi are extraordinary organisms that can infect humans. In the past few decades, increasing numbers of cases of fungal infections have been reported worldwide [1,2,3,4,5]. With the increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as the chemotherapy and steroid drugs, as well as the development of immunosuppressive treatments such as organ transplantation, antineoplastic therapy, and organ failure, the incidence of fungal infections is on the rise. [6,7,8,9] It is estimated that 15%-20% of all human diseases are caused by yeasts and less than 1% are caused by molds [7,8].

Yeasts are opportunistic human commensal organisms that can grow and divide in various body fluids. The most common species are Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis [8,9]. However, the incidence of other species is increasing as well. Over the past few years, several new species have been reported that cause different forms of superficial fungal infections, such as Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida kefyr [10,11].

Different fungal species have been associated with different diseases. Candida albicans, Candida kefyr, Candida parapsilosis, Candida kefyr, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida kefyr, and Candida kefyri are frequently found in the environment and responsible for most of the infections [12,13,14,15,16,17,18].


## Methods
The pathogens and bacteria were identified by standard laboratory techniques, and their presence and the size of the biofilm were recorded by the primary pathogen as well as by the Gram-negative bacterial infection by the Gram-positive tes. The microbiological parameters were the same as for the clinical data, including CSF culture, positive blood culture, and Gram-negative CSF.

Sample preparation and microbial detection
Bacterial and fungal culture was performed in Bactec Spin-X - Bactec System, Bactec America, LLC, St. Louis, MO, USA. A sterile filter paper was used to clean the CSF with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, 10 mL of the CSF were fixed in 10% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the samples were incubated in 5% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and stained with India ink to observe the growth of bacteria and fungi. The samples were further analyzed by EZ-IT® (Uvitex^®) and Quantity One (Uvitex^®) systems (Uvitex^®). The samples were processed as described previously [13].

MIC and Tolerance
The MIC of M. tuberculosis in Bactec®-LB broth was determined as the lowest concentration of broth that completely inhibited growth of the organism. The bacterium was cultured in Bactec®-LB broth at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 2×10^4 colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL) and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) to determine the MICs of M. tuberculosis. The MICs of M. tuberculosis were determined using the method of Bradford [14]. The T. marneffei strain ATCC 20509 was used for the inhibition of the pathogenic growth of M. tuberculosis.

Assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of M. tuberculosis MICs
The assay of the MICs was carried out by using the broth dilution method as previously described [15]. The MICs of M. tuberculosis were determined as the lowest concentration of broth that completely inhibited the growth of the organism.


## Results
Selection of the optimal culture conditions
During the culture period, the total amount of the antifungal drugs used was investigated by using a panel of commercial standards. The three main antifungal drugs used were amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole, with MICs of 3.25 µg/ml for amphotericin B, 3.5 µg/ml for fluconazole and 0.5 µg/ml for voriconazole. However, no consistent MIC values were obtained for amphotericin B and fluconazole (Table 1).

Identification of the antifungal drug candidates
A total of 31,330 eugenol derivatives were tested in our study (Table 2).


## Discussion

The patient had been on anti-TNF medications for three year. In addition, there was a history of travel to Thailand.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines (2001) for the management of patients with TBM include: (1) treatment with natamycin and nitazoxanil, with or without amphotericin B; (2) immunomodulation with intravenous immunoglobulin, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (3) immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (4) oral immunotherapy with oral steroids, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (5) oral antifungal therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (6) antiretroviral therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin; (7) immunotherapy with oral steroids, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (8) induction therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (9) intravenous immunoglobulin with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (10) immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (11) oral immunotherapy with oral steroids, with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (12) oral antifungal therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (13) immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (14) oral glucocorticoids with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (15) oral glucocorticoids with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; (16) oral glucocorticoids without immunoglobulin-inhibitor; and (17) oral glucocorticoids with or without immunoglobulin-inhibitor.
