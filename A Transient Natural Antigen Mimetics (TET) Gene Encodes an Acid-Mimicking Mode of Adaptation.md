## Abstract
The novel actinomycete family sodium glutariomycete (SGGS) represents a group of endocytic N-myristoylationally transcribed helixes known to assemble into at least one N-myristoyltransferase protein. SGGS has been identified in ascomycete fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and animal cells, but not in yeast. Sodium glutariomycete has been reported as a target for the antifungal drugs amphotericin B, azole, and growth inhibition. Sodium glutariomycete has also been reported to be a potential target for the antidiabetic agents Lipitor and Lipase. Sodium glutariomycete has also been reported to be a promising candidate for the discovery of novel treatment targets. The aim of this review is to describe the occurrence, structures, and biological activities of sodium glutariomycete isolated from different substrates and the structures of different N-myristoyltransferase-enriched fractions from different fungi and bacteria, and to discuss the possible anticancer and antifungal targets of sodium glutariomycete therapy.


## Introduction
The ability of TNAMs to induce gene expression and enhance the drug susceptibility of Toxoplasma may be related to their ability to engage the adaptive immune system of the hos. Although natural antigenic drugs, such as isoniazid (IM) and carbapenems, have been given priority over TNAMs, they have been administered at high doses to treat patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), as the FDA requires a high dose to achieve safety and efficacy, in addition to long-term use [13].

Toxoplasma has been known for many years as a benign and harmless commensal of the human microbiome [14,15]. In fact, toxoplasmosis is a potentially fatal complication of chronic infections caused by the parasite with high morbidity and mortality [16]. Cytoplasmy is a major cause of illness and death in humans, and hosts are at risk of contracting toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in AIDS patients [17,18]. In general, most cases of cystic fibrosis disease are caused by the parasite, Cytomegalovirus (C.G.V) [19]. C.G.V infection is acquired by the inhalation of infectious conidia [20]. The infection is acquired by the respiratory tract, usually occurs in patients with impaired immunity, or by the skin, mucus, or gastrointestinal tract [21]. In healthy individuals, the infection usually appears as superficial lesions, usually small and rarely chronic, occurring in adults and children, and is usually asymptomatic [22]. However, in immunocompromised patients, C.G.V can cause acute and subacute meningoencephalitis in the central nervous system (CNS) [23]. CNS infection may also lead to encephalitis and focal brain lesions. As a result of C.G.V infection, CNS disease can result in considerable morbidity and mortality. The degree of C.G.V encephalitis depends on the patient, with most patients suffering from CNS disease suffering from non-viral CNS manifestations, and some patients suffering from infections such as tuberculosis or cryptococcosis [24]. In addition, C.G.


## Methods
The TET encodes proteins with a large amount of proteins bound to the polypeptid. The protein was transformed into yeast, and then the oligomers were removed by the addition of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The obtained peptides were separated by electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 24 h. The membrane was then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 5 µg/ml of anti-fungal antibody HRP-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS at room temperature for 30 min. After three washes in TBS, the membrane was incubated with 1 µg/ml of the PGE-conjugated HRP-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was then washed in PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 1 µg/ml of the anti-fungal HRP-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS at room temperature for 30 min. After three washes in TBS, the membrane was incubated with 1 µg/ml of the PGE-conjugated HRP-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was then washed in PBS and incubated with 1 µg/ml of the PGE-conjugated HRP-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was then washed in PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature.

## Results
The TET is found in all eukaryotes and is critical for the normal function of . cerevisiae TET protein. The TET has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cytokinesis, cytokinesis, and cytokine production in various fungi (Table 3). The TET and its receptors are closely related and are involved in different aspects of the response to various stresses, including cell wall perturbation, oxidative stress, temperature-sensitive phenotypes, and oxidative stress-induced cell wall changes (Table 3). In fact, the TET-specific genes have been shown to be highly expressed in response to oxidative stress, and some of these genes have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cytokinesis and cytokine production in various fungi (Table 3). The TET family is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, cytokinesis, and cytokine production in various fungi (Table 3). Interestingly, several genes related to the cell wall stress response, such as the cell wall degrading enzymes, heme-P, and chitin, have been shown to be upregulated in response to stress conditions (Table 3). These data suggest that the TET-specific genes may be involved in the regulation of cytokinesis and cytokinesis in some fungi. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression of key cytokinesins, including the TGF-ß, CCR2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12.

## Discussion
brasiliensis is an oligotrophic yeast, with low carbon-nitrogen balance and a high activity of the G protein-coupled superfamily NADH-dependent de novo biosynthetic pathway [41. In addition, P. brasiliensis also has a large growth inhibition potential against various antibiotics [42-44]. P. brasiliensis contains a wide range of bacterial and fungal strains, including species with different degrees of antimicrobial activity, such as P. brasiliensis E23, P. brasiliensis E24, P. brasiliensis G41, P. brasiliensis E26 and P. brasiliensis G53. In addition, some strains, such as P. lutzii, P. expansum, P. expansum-like strains, P. fischeri and P. vulgaris, are highly virulent to a wide range of hosts, such as humans and horses [45,46]. Therefore, we also studied P. brasiliensis E24 strains and found that P. brasiliensis E24 is highly pathogenic to mice and humans. We also observed that P. brasiliensis E24 is more resistant to many antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, than P. lutzii E24. Therefore, P. brasiliensis E24 may be an interesting model for the treatment of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance in P. lutzii and P. vulgaris, respectively.

P. lutzii and P. vulgaris are the most virulent species in humans, with the latter species causing severe infections in people worldwide [47,48]. The role of P. lutzii E24 in human infections was reported in studies involving patients with P. vulgaris and other Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria [49,50]. Furthermore, P. vulgaris is also an opportunistic infection, causing infection in patients with a variety of bacterial and fungal infections [51]. The role of P. lutzii E24 in human infections was also reported in a study involving patients with P. vulgaris, but not P. vulgaris, and P. vulgaris-related E24 strains, such as P. lutzii E24, P. vulgaris-R265, and P. vulgaris-L13. In addition, P. vulgaris-R265 and P.
