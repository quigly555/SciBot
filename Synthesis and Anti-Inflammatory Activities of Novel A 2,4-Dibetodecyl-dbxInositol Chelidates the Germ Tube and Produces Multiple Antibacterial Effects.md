## Abstract
Oral candidiasis is a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy. The recent discovery of the oral microbiome has provided a unique opportunity to explore therapeutic strategies. A number of recent studies have attempted to identify a group of potential beneficial oral microbiome effects against cancer chemotherapy, and none of these studies has focused on the potential oral microbiome effects against oral cancer. In this review, we first summarize the findings about oral cancer oral microbial effects in healthy and immunocompromised volunteers. We then discuss the mechanisms of oral cancer oral microbiome alterations and mechanisms of oral dysbiotic alterations in healthy volunteers. The aim of this review is to collect recent knowledge about the oral microbiome microbiome microbiome effects in healthy and immunocompromised volunteers to understand how these could be exploited to benefit therapeutic strategies.


## Introduction
[1], [2]

The antimicrobial action of compounds containing cyclic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) was demonstrated in the context of bacterial and fungal pathogenicit. [3]

Chitosan (COS), a peptide antibiotic, was first discovered from the venom of the poisonous spider Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and is widely used as a therapeutic agent in medicine due to its powerful antidiabetic and antimicrobial effects. [4]

The antimicrobial activity of COS against a number of species of bacteria and fungi, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was demonstrated. [5]

COS is an antibacterial and antifungal agent which has an extensive spectrum of activity against fungi and bacteria. [6]

The antibacterial activity of COS against Bacillus cereus, E. faecalis, S. epidermidis, and K. pneumoniae was demonstrated. [7]

Recent studies on the activity of COS against a number of clinically important bacterial and fungal pathogens have highlighted its potential in the treatment of chronic respiratory infections. [8]

Antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated to be a major determinant for the activity of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) C. albicans. [9]

The AMP C. albicans has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities, which include killing a wide range of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. [10], [11] AMPs have been described as non-classical antibiotic molecules and, thus, have a limited number of potential applications. [12], [13] In addition, AMPs have important pharmacological actions, including antimicrobial resistance, apoptosis-mediated cell death, inhibition of transcription, and induction of cell cycle arrest. [14]

In addition, COS has several interesting biological activities against bacteria, including inhibition of cell cycle, macromolecular membrane trafficking, and DNA damage.


## Methods
The reaction was performed in accordance with the standard protocol and the reduction was carried out with .1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The formation of a yellow precipitate was observed after the reduction with 0.1% DMSO. The antimicrobial peptide was then dissolved in water, and a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was added to the solution. After the initial assay, the absorbance was read at 405 nm. The antimicrobial peptide was diluted with water to give a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The control solution was prepared with 1% DMSO and the reaction was carried out in the same way. The antimicrobial peptide was diluted in water to give a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.

The assay was performed in triplicate. The assay solution was prepared in diethyl ether. The solution was incubated at 37°C for 1 h and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the formazan solution was obtained by a phenol-chloroform method. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The negative control was prepared with 0.1% DMSO. The antimicrobial peptide was diluted with water to give a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The control was prepared with 1% DMSO. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. The control was prepared with 1% DMSO. The assay was performed in triplicate. The assays were performed in triplicate.

## Discussion
These antibiotics include the three main antibiotics and the antibacterials, including isoniazid, cefotaxime, and tetracycline, which are all effective in vivo for the treatment of fungal infection. Our results showed that the antibacterials were effective in vitro against all tested bacterial strains, while the antibiotic concentrations were different for different bacteria. For instance, in our experiment, the highest antibiotic concentration was used for the production of A2,4-Dibetodecyl-dbxInositol Chelidates, whereas the lowest antibiotic concentration was used for the production of A2,4-Dibetodecyl-dbxInositol Chelidates. This is because A2,4-Dibetodecyl-dbxInositol Chelidates are synthesized via the biosynthesis of a peptidoglycan by the fatty acid-linked fatty acid-like moiety in bacteria. This acid-like moiety has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of antibiotics [40]. However, the antibiotic concentrations in our experiment were low, thus these antibiotic compounds were not useful for the production of A2,4-Dibetodecyl-dbxInositol Chelidates. Therefore, the use of antibiotics with higher concentrations was considered as good for the production of A2,4-Dibetodecyl-dbxInositol Chelidates.

In order to analyze the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics, a number of commercially available antibiotics were tested in our experiment. These antibiotics include amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and imipenem. These antibiotics are effective against all bacteria tested, while the broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are ineffective. These results are in agreement with the previous study [41]. The antibacterial activity of some antibiotics was also reported in previous studies [40,42,43]. For instance, the antibacterials are the most potent antibiotics, while the broad-spectrum antibiotics are also active. Thus, the use of antibiotics with high MICs could be beneficial for a wide spectrum of bacterial infections.
