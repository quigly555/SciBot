## Abstract
Several lines of evidence demonstrate the beneficial effects of long-chain, high-fructose syngolic fruit suet (FST) and low-fructose syngolic fruit sorveglue (LSU) on the maintenance of oral candidiasis, including oral candidiasis in particular. Studies with humans have demonstrated that long-chain, high-fructose syngolic fruit suet (FCS) effectively treats oral candidiasis in rabbits, rats, and mice.


## Introduction
The genus Enterobacteriaceae, which includes over 40 species, is divided into two subgenera: Enterobacter species, commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections, and Enterobacteriaceae species, which are commonly associated with non-infectious infections (Gianmarco et al. 2015; Laursen & Domsch 2013; Saikkonen et al. 2015). Among the most frequently isolated species are E. coli, E. faecium, and E. poae (Nishiyama et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2015). However, E. coli, E. faecium, and E. poae are generally found in the environment, while E. coli and E. faecium are generally present in humans and may be opportunistic pathogens. In contrast, E. faecium and E. faecium are uncommon in the environment (Gianmarco et al. 2015). E. faecium and E. faecium are mostly recovered in hospitals (Gianmarco et al. 2015).

The genus Enterobacteriaceae has been traditionally classified in the pathogenic family Enterobacteriaceae, although some species have been described as non-pathogenic, e.g., E. coli, E. faecium, and E. poae (Gianmarco et al. 2015; Saikkonen et al. 2015; Saikkonen et al. 2016). Species in the genus E. coli, E. coli, E. faecium, and E.


## Methods
This study was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), a tertiary referral hospital in Taipei City, Taiwan. The NTUH is a tertiary referral hospital with a capacity of 200,000 admissions a year.


## Results
kudriavzevii and . kudriavzevii with a case of juvenile arthritis. The mean ± SD age at onset of arthritis was 37 ± 12 years, and the median age of onset was 42.5 ± 15 years. Of the three P. kudriavzevii isolates, three were previously reported to be present in the juvenile population, including three in a large retrospective study of the juvenile Arthritis Research Program (ROAP) and two in a case of juvenile arthritis. All three P. kudriavzevii isolates were collected in the USA and were isolated from the juvenile and adult populations.

P. kudriavzevii isolates were detected by both the presence and absence of A. fumigatus. The presence of A. fumigatus in P. kudriavzevii isolates was confirmed by culture, by RT-PCR, and by qRT-PCR (Fig 2A and B). The absence of A. fumigatus in all P. kudriavzevii isolates was confirmed by RT-PCR and by qRT-PCR (Fig 2C and D). The P. kudriavzevii isolates were also detected by RT-PCR (Fig 2E, F), but with significantly lower Shannon index, as well as by qRT-PCR (Fig 2G).

Antifungal Susceptibility Test Results for P. kudriavzevii
The antifungal susceptibility test results for P. kudriavzevii isolates for P. kudriavzevii are shown in Table 1. P. kudriavzevii isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole, with MICs of 0.125 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. P. kudriavzevii isolates were also highly susceptible to itraconazole and voriconazole, with MICs of 0.125 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. As for P. kudriavzevii isolates, susceptible P.


## Discussion
In our case, there were no other males in the group of patients and we were unable to provide demographic information for the me. We have also found no relationship between age at presentation and bacterial infections [31]. The majority of male patients in our study were older than our patients, which may explain why males are more likely to have bacterial infections [32, 33]. The relationship between age at presentation and bacterial infections has not been reported in other studies. The causative organisms of bacterial infection in males are viruses and bacteria, which are closely related to each other [34].

The presentation of bacterial infections in males is similar to the presentation of bacterial infections in females. The majority of male patients presented with bacterial infections in the absence of bacterial infection. The majority of males in our study presented with bacterial infections in the presence of bacterial infection. This may be explained by the fact that males have higher levels of IL-17 than females [35].

Among the bacterial infections in males, all of them were opportunistic species. Of the 14 cases of bacterial infection in males, two were found in the respiratory tract, one in the urinary tract and one in the skin. This may be a result of decreased IL-17 production and the increased mortality of the patients.

Interestingly, the mortality of the patients in the group of patients presenting with bacterial infections was significantly higher than the other patients. The results of the study conducted by Kim et al. showed that the proportion of bacterial infections in males is significantly higher than that in females. The majority of patients in our study had positive blood cultures. However, the sensitivity of blood cultures in this study was not comparable to the sensitivity in our study conducted in 2014. This may be due to the fact that we did not have enough patients to study the correlation between the blood cultures and the death.

Previous studies in the past have demonstrated that bacterial infection is a rare cause of death in males [36-38]. The reason for this may be that the infection is not diagnosed early enough, and the patient does not have a significant predisposing factor to bacterial infections.

Our study showed that the mortality of the patients with bacterial infections was significantly higher than the mortality in males. The reasons for this may be that the patients with bacterial infections have lower immune systems and the patients with bacterial infections have higher mortality.

In the present study, the mortality of bacterial infections was significantly higher than that in females.
