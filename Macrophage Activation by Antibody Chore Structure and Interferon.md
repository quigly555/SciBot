## Abstract
The lung has a great diversity of functions, ranging from basic lung function to pathological processes such as lung cancer metastasis. For instance, the more fragile of the two lungs can become during lung cancer progression. The severity of lung disease can affect multiple areas of the body, including the brain, spine, liver, spleen, liver, liver cancer, and other tissues, making it very difficult to treat lung cancer without causing severe pathology. Therefore, the development of new treatment strategies is a priority. In this study, we evaluated the anti-fungal activity of Hydroxyapatite (APX), a natural polyene macrolactam (NMac) against planktonic cells and biofilms in vitro. We further demonstrated that APX treatment induces a strong increase in intracellular ATP levels, resulting in a severe inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content in macrolactams treated with APX, as well as in the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in macrolactams treated with APX. In addition, APX induced a strong increase in mitochondrial mass in a macrolactam-treated cell, which could be responsible for the increased intracellular ATP levels, which could be minimized in the presence of ROS. In addition, the results demonstrated that APX treatment induced a strong increase in intracellular ATP levels, suggesting that APX treatment could reduce the accumulation of ROS. The results of the present study suggest that APX-mediated inhibition of biofilms is a promising strategy to treat lung cancer in humans.


## Introduction
In the case of OMVs, amphotericin B or flucytosine (5FC) was the main agent used, while itraconazole was also used for the treatment of antimonialysis and cryptococcosi. The antimonialysis agent, itraconazole (200 mg daily for 3 weeks), is a strong AMP, and itraconazole is the most active agent. It is used for the treatment of kidney problems and kidney disorders, and it has good outcomes in patients with kidney problems. Itraconazole was reported to have good renal function and good outcomes in patients with kidney problems. It was found to have good renal function, but renal enzyme activities had a low level. Fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin had a high level of activity.

Antimycotic and antipyptotic agents are classified according to their mode of action. Amphotericin B and flucytosine were the main agents used for the treatment of kidney problems and kidney disorders, while itraconazole and posaconazole (200 mg daily for 3 weeks) were used for kidney problems, and itraconazole and posaconazole (200 mg daily for 3 weeks) were used for liver and kidney problems. Antimycotic agents were also used for the treatment of kidney disorders, while itraconazole was used for kidney problems and kidney enzymes. The antimonialysis agent, itraconazole, was the most active agent, and itraconazole (200 mg daily for 3 weeks) was used for kidney problems. Amphotericin B was used for the treatment of renal problems, and itraconazole (200 mg daily for 3 weeks) was used for kidney problems. Itraconazole was used for the treatment of kidney problems. It is used for the treatment of renal diseases. It has good renal function and has good outcomes in patients with kidney problems.


## Methods
Subsequently, macrophages were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, 50 mM Na_2HPO_4, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Na_2HPO_4, .1% NP40, pH 8.0), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) containing 4% SDS, 0.1% NP40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 3% polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.


## Results
was evaluated using the protein extracts and antibody preparation. The antifungal activity was evaluated by following the protein extracts (Table 1). The antibody reaction demonstrated a highly significant activity against C. albicans ATCC 9090 (P<0.001) and C. glabrata ATCC 8288 (P<0.05). However, the antibody reaction was inactive against C. glabrata ATCC 90028 (P<0.05) and C. albicans ATCC 90028 (P<0.05) (Table 1). Therefore, it was concluded that the antifungal activity of the nourseothricin antibody against C. albicans was due to the binding of the antibody to the fungal cell surface.

The immunoprotective activity of the nourseothricin antibody against C. albicans was evaluated using the antibody preparations (Table 2). The antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was evaluated using the protein extracts and antibody preparations. The antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was evaluated using the antibody preparations (Table 2). The antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was evaluated using the antibody preparations (Table 2). The antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was evaluated using the protein extracts and antibody preparations. The antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was evaluated using the protein extracts and antibody preparations.

Results from the experiments were summarized in Table 3. The results indicated that the nourseothricin antibody against C. albicans inhibited C. albicans growth, while the antifungal activity of the antibody reaction against C. albicans was less significant. These results are consistent with those of the previous study, where the antibody reaction against C. albicans was less effective and the antibody reaction was more active than the antibody reaction against C. albicans.

## Discussion
We also used a CF-2-challenged mouse model in order to determine the efficacy of immunotherap. The mice were either immunosupressed with CF-2 or CD25-Bip-GFP, and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into this immunocompetent mice. The Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunocompetent mice and immunosuppressed mice received immunotherapy with CF-2 or CD25-Bip-GFP. The immunocompetent mice were sacrificed for 6 h and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunocompetent mice. The immunosuppressed mice were sacrificed for 8 h and the Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunocompetent mice. The immunosuppressed mice were sacrificed for 24 h and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunocompetent mice. The immunocompetent mice were sacrificed for 48 h and immunosuppressed mice received immunotherapy with CF-2 or CD25-Bip-GFP. The immunosuppressed mice were sacrificed for 72 h and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunocompetent mice. The immunosuppressed mice were sacrificed for 72 h and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP was injected into the immunosuppressed mice.

The results of immunosuppression with CF-2, CD25-Bip-GFP, and Bip-HELP-MID-RSA-GFP are presented in Fig 6.
