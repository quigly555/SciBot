## Abstract
Candida species are the most frequently isolated species of commonly colonized infants. They are the most frequently isolated Candida species from all newborns, with a frequent pattern of occurrence, often several days per year. Most of the Candida species are colonized by yeasts. Continuous and aggressive techniques used for the treatment of the colonization of the central nervous system are ineffective. The main compounds in the antifungal drugs, echinocandin and allyclin, used for the treatment of this or that problem, have not been identified. To explore the antifungal potential of these compounds we used computational antifungal design in R. K. Jankowski, F. L. Burg, T. J. P. Wallace, T. J. P. Wallace, and R.


## Introduction
Myristoylation is an essential lipid modification process which involves the formation of myristoyl-carbonyl group units on the N-terminal glycine residue of myristoyl-tRNA. [1] Myristoylation of myristoyl-tRNA is catalyzed by myristoyl-tRNA synthetase (Myrist), which converts myristoyl-tRNA into its mononuclear form, Myristoyl-tRNA precursor.


## Methods
The solvent was removed by evaporation, and the residue was dissolved in a solution of methanol and 1/10th of the stock solution of methano. The mixture was cooled in a boiling water bath to room temperature (10 °C) for 5 min, then diluted with distilled water to obtain a stock solution of 1.25 mg/ml. The stock solution was stored at 4 °C for further use.

4.4. Phytochemistry and Photochemical Assays
The mycelium (1 × 10^6) and the mycelium of A. terebinthifolia were harvested, and the mycelium was washed with distilled water to remove the mycelium from the mycelium. The mycelium was then lyophilized for 24 h, and the mycelium powder was extracted with 70% (v/v) methanol for 30 min, at room temperature (RT). The mycelium was then extracted with petroleum ether and evaporated under reduced pressure. The organic layer was collected and dried in a vacuum. The organic layer was then suspended in diethyl ether and methanol. The dry weight of the mycelium powder was determined, and the obtained organic layer was dissolved in methanol and then used for the in-solution thin layer chromatography (TLC) method. The mycelium powder was dissolved in an organic solvent (CH_2Cl_2) at a concentration of 0.4% (v/v). After evaporation, the solvent was removed by evaporation of the solvent from the tube. The chromatograms of the TLC-MS/MS method were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR-DS-MS spectrometer (Kyoto, Japan).


## Results
terebinthifolia . showed that the oil had essential oil characteristics.


## Discussion
mesonensis (.) Bandaric et al., 2013), but only in this study. The natural product D. mesonensis (L.) Bandaric et al. (2013) was reported from a wild Carrot species on the Caribbean island of Dominica. It has been reported for its hydrophilic and polar hydrophobic character.

As we do not have information about the oil source of D. mesonensis, this study is the first to report this natural product from D. mesonensis. The oil was extracted using three different chemical groups, which corresponded to the polar and hydrophilic compounds identified by other researchers as a good solvent for the isolation of D. mesonensis species (Fan et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2012).

In order to study the active substances present in this natural product, its spectral data are not available, which is a good resource to study the active substances in this species (Fan et al., 2004). In our study, the oil was prepared in aqueous buffer containing ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate. The crude oil was analyzed by HPLC and the IR spectrum of the crude oil was observed in the spectrum range of 150-400 nm (Table 2).

The spectra of the crude oil (Table 2) showed the following peaks: (H-20), 150-400, 150-400 nm.

(H-2) = 8.4 ppm, (H-2) = 8.2 ppm, (H-6) = 8.2 ppm, (H-7) = 8.2 ppm. The IR spectrum of the crude oil was analyzed by GC-MS. The ^1H-NMR spectrum was dominated by the triad NH-2, IR-1, IR-2, IR-3, and UV-1 signals, followed by the signals of the H-5 and H-6 groups. The ^13C-NMR spectrum showed the ^1H-NMR signals of the first and second carbon resonances, which are attributed to the proton-butyric carbon group of carbon-4-hydroxylated carbon, and the proton-butyric carbon of the carbon of carbon-14 carbon, respectively. The ^13C-NMR spectrum showed signals of the carbon-5-hydroxylated carbon group.
