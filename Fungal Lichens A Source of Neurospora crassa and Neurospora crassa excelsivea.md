## Abstract

Le non-vertebrate endophyte (SLE) infestate anrophelia, anesiaceous fungi (of all taxa) and sanguinealistic.

L’analisi dei SLE anrophelia è stata saggiata-capitata mediante la rilevazione di cellule ananidostica.

L’esecuzione dei SLE è risultata essere associata all’esecuzione della molecola di ARVA (atazione-D-asparabiala - dieta) sia dall’esecuzione della molecola di NTM (NTM - naturopathia) sia dall’esecuzione della NTM - sia dall’esecuzione della linea molecolare.

Sulla base dei risultati ottenuti, nello specifico nelle aree della trasmissione familiare, i risultati ottenuti sono alcuni principi della trasmissione familiare e le misure di priorità in terminazione delle cure.

Il progetto si tradu con i più comuni comunemente descritti nelle Aziende Sanitarie ed Agenas delle Case della Salute in DPCM 18/11.


## Introduction
The genus Acaularia includes over 200 species, most species are saprobic or insect-trapping fungi that form conspicuous associations with important plant hosts (Aptroot 2006). The genus Acaularia is a symbiotic association with honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), occurring on their territories and feeding on their fruits (Pietkowska 1995; Aptroot 2006). They are part of the honey bee and are important for the production of honey and milk, which can be extracted for human consumption (Aptroot 2006). However, in recent years, the use of honey as a food has increased and now contains several species of Acaularia (Schmoll and deWaard 2000). The species belonging to this group are classified as saprobic, insect-trapping fungi, which are generally classified as either single- or multiple-nembranous or parasitic (Brayford 2000; Aptroot 2006). These taxa are often distributed on different plant hosts and can be found in the same order in different habitats (Brayford and Aptroot 2009). In this study, we have divided the genus Acaularia into four sections, i.e., “A. mellifera”, “A. longipes”, “A. longiceps” and “A. longipes auxalis” and divided them into four sections based on morphological characteristics, morphology, and host plant of the respective host species. This study will focus on the taxonomy of these species and the application of this knowledge for their use in agriculture.


## Methods
crassa and added a reference strain of Aspergillus niger to be used as a referenc.

Bacterial strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C. After 48 h of incubation, mycelia were collected by filtering through a sterile filter paper and transferred to a sterile petri dish. After a few minutes of vortexing, the liquid was removed by gently pulling the paper and the paper was washed with distilled water. The dried mycelia was then re-suspended in PBS to a final concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL and stored at -80°C.

For the bacterial strains, cell lysates were prepared from cultures on PDA plates and used to inoculate fresh PDA plates. After growth on PDA plates at 25°C for 7 days, the mycelium were harvested by filtration and resuspended in PBS and then adjusted to the required concentration. The fungal strains were cultured on PDA at 25°C for 3 days. Mycelium were collected by filtration and washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in 1% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then kept at -20°C for further use.

Protein purification, Western blot, and proteomic analysis
To prepare the cDNA of the bioluminescent bacterial strains, an amplification of the partial 16S rRNA gene of B. subtilis was performed with primer pairs ITS1F and ITS4 [49], and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA operon, ITS4, was amplified with primers ITS1F-5F and ITS4R [50]. The PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), then sequenced by the NIST 13 database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The sequences were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sanger/).

To analyze the proteins, samples of mycelium were collected by filtration and the lysate was transferred to a 1.5 mL microtube and kept at -20°C for further use. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay [51].


## Results

Basionym: Cercospora crassa A. Hashim. & Kaz. Tanaka, Fungi Japan 15: 87. 2004.

Specimen examined: Japan, Saitama, on Crassa sp., 28 Sep. 2005, K. Tanaka, KACC 44853 = FH-M 12194.

Notes: The phylogenetic analyses of the phylogenetic analyses (Fig 2) suggested that this species is basal to the Cercospora clade (Fig 1), but the type specimen of Cercospora crassa (CBS H-20271) was found to be sterile. Morphologically it is very similar to Cercospora sp. (C. crassa) in having conidiogenous cells with clamps and, above all, conidia with or without a mucoid cap.

## Discussion
fumigatus and . sclerotiorum [47,48,49].

Here, we present two species of A. fumigatus and A. terreus in the genus, respectively, and establish the phylogenetic relationship of these species to their fungal relatives. In addition, we also reveal several new species in the A. fumigatus clade that are involved in various fungal infections.

A. terreus is a member of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. This genus comprises species with numerous ecological niches in different phyla. In addition, this species is found in several other fungal phyla, including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, and Malassezia [50].

A. terreus is found in the fruiting bodies of certain species, such as A. niger, A. brasiliense, and A. oryzae. It is present in both fruiting bodies of A. brasiliense and A. oryzae, and in a range of other fungi, such as A. niger, A. flavus, and A. fumigatus [51].

In this study, we identified four new species of A. terreus that belong to the same phylogenetic group as A. fumigatus. The other species that appear in the A. terreus clade are A. niger, A. brasiliense, and A. fumigatus. They share the same ecological niches and host tree. However, these new species do not share the same genetic background as the A. fumigatus species.

Our results revealed that A. terreus is the only member of the A. fumigatus clade that belongs to the same clade, and that these species share the same genetic background. Our results suggest that this clade may be involved in the degradation of mycelial mycelia of A. fumigatus. Furthermore, A. terreus could not be isolated from fruiting bodies of A. fumigatus, and it is not likely that it is related to A. terreus.

In this study, we isolated three new species of A. terreus in A.
