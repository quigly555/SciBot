## Abstract
Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a nonneglected etiologic agent of invasive aspergillosis. It rarely causes disease in immunocompromised patients, except in rare circumstances where fever, a lung squamous cell carcinoma, and/or pneumonia and bronchiectasis occur.

We report a case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumoniae pneumonia with a lung squamous cell carcinoma and/or pneumonia and a bronchiectoma and pulmonary disease in a patient who had been treated with steroids for severe asthma and found to have steroid therapy initiated with dexamethasone.

This case highlights the potential for grave complications such as invasive aspergillosis with an early diagnosis. Even with adequate treatment of the organism, the pulmonary disease can progress to invasive aspergillosis with invasive aspergillosis later in life.


## Introduction
In the past two decades, multidrug-resistant (resistant to at least 2) fungal strains have been reported, and severe infection by azole-resistant strains (reviewed in [1]) has become a major threat to public health. Azole drugs are toxic, often showing side-effects that are difficult to treat. Some of the azoles are toxic and have a spectrum of nephrotoxicities. Other drugs have a narrow spectrum of activity and are fungistatic or fungicidal, respectively. The pathogenic species of fungi have developed resistance to at least 2 drugs, thus are often used for prophylactic treatment of patients infected with azole-resistant strains. Although azoles are used as prophylactics against infections caused by azole-resistant strains, they have side-effects that are not easily treatable. There are approximately 700,000 fungal species, which cause about 1.5 million life-threatening infections each year worldwide. The main factors associated with azole resistance are the availability of antifungal agents, which may lead to adverse effects.


## Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal studies were conducted in strict accordance with the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of National Institutes of Health. The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Minnesota and by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.


## Results
We were able to observe a similar pattern of antibody reactivity to the interferon-induced TEM, TEM-based assays, and TEM-based assays (Figure 4. In contrast to the TEM-based assay, the TEM-based assay showed a similar pattern of reactivity to the monoclonal antibody, in that both monoclonal antibodies were positive in the presence of TEM and TEM-based assays. The differences in antibody reactivity to the monoclonal antibody and interferon-induced TEM-based assays were not significant. In contrast, the interferon-induced TEM-based assay showed a similar pattern of antibody reactivity to the monoclonal antibody, in that both monoclonal antibodies were positive in the presence of TEM and TEM-based assays. Taken together, the results indicate that the interferon-induced monoclonal antibody and interferon-stimulated gene expression was elicited by the interferon-induced monoclonal antibody and interferon-stimulated gene expression.

To test the hypothesis that the interferon-induced monoclonal antibody and interferon-stimulated gene expression induced by the interferon-induced monoclonal antibody were the same, we used the respective antibodies against the monoclonal or interferon-stimulated sera of four potential blood donors to assess the reactivity of the antibodies in the sera of patients with different forms of Tumor infection. The reactivity of the monoclonal and interferon-induced antibodies to the monoclonal antibody and interferon-stimulated gene expression was shown by the DAPI staining of the monoclonal antibody and interferon-induced gene expression, which was used to quantify the degree of association of monoclonal or interferon-induced proteins and proteins from the interferon-induced and interferon-stimulated states.

When the antibody was used in combination with the interferon, the reactivity to the monoclonal antibody and interferon-stimulated gene expression was also tested in combination with the interferon.


## Discussion
Transgenic cells treated with the . fumigatus-interferon-stimulated gene expressed the A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene (AFEN1) which is involved in cell surface remodelling, cell wall remodelling and immune responses. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in cells in response to A. fumigatus infection.

The expression of AfEN1 was reduced in the A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene when grown in the presence of glucose, but still it was upregulated during the 3 h of grapevine treatment (Fig 1B). The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. A. niger-interferon-stimulated gene expression was higher than in the grapevine-treated cells (Fig 1B). The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell.

The expression of AfEN1 was decreased when the A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene was expressed in the cell (Fig 1C). The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell. The A. flavus-interferon-stimulated gene could be expressed in the cell.
