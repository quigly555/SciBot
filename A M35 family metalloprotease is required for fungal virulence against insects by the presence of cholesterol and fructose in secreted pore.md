## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii has caused nearly a million deaths in immunocompromised individuals in North America over the past three decades. This yeast pathogen has not only been found in the environment, but also in human host cells. In the last decade, our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cryptococcosis has been greatly improved by the identification of key genes, such as those encoding the kinases and transcriptional regulators, which play critical roles in the onset and progression of this infection. The cryptococcal pathogenicity determinants encoded by the cryptococcal mutants we studied have provided a remarkable example of convergent evolution acting in parallel. Here we compare the phenotypic features of the mutants that arise from these parental strains and compare the different phenotypic outcomes between these strains.

Differences in virulence phenotypes were driven by several factors including the degree of growth in the medium, size of the chromosomes, and the expression of the genes responsible for the production of the secretory enzymes. The characteristics of the genomes were also driven by the size of the chromosomes, which was larger in the progeny of parental passage. The size of the chromosomes of the parental strains was also larger than in the genomes of the parental strains. The expression of the genes involved in the secretory pathway was differentially induced in the two parental strains, but the differences between the strains were similar. The genes involved in the production of the enzymes involved in the mycotoxin biosynthesis pathway were differentially induced.

These data show that the different parental strains were able to control the growth and virulence of the fungal species through the concerted action of the two main virulence factors, the same type as in their parental strains. The growth of the strains in the absence of the capsule was suppressed, as demonstrated by the high titration of the fungus in the medium. These results establish that the sexual crossing of C. gattii is an important evolutionary innovation in the environmental pathogen and help explain the evolutionary trajectory of this important yeast.


## Introduction
The yeast-like cell-wall is able to prevent cholesterol from being incorporated into the polysaccharid. Lipoproteins are classified into two types, secretory proteins and membrane proteins. Secretory proteins are secreted proteins that are secreted in order to prevent cholesterol from being incorporated into the cell wall [9]. A second class of secretory proteins is membrane proteins, which are secreted by various intracellular organisms such as yeasts, algae, and insects.

The yeast-like cells of Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are the two most important pathogens that cause meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients [10, 11]. The fungal genome of C. neoformans has undergone several extensive studies. The first study on C. neoformans genome was in the late 1990s [12]. The first report on the genome of C. neoformans was by Sanger sequencing of the a-prope of Chr 1237 [13]. The results of this study revealed the presence of conserved proteins in the genome of C. neoformans. This finding led to a search for other genes involved in the secretion of secretory proteins in this pathogen.

Some proteins in the secretory proteins of C. neoformans and C. gattii have been found to be immunogenic and inhibit the growth of the fungus [14]. In contrast, the secreted proteins of the yeasts and molds of the dimorphic fungi are mainly secreted by the formae nigra, the clade of dimorphic fungi. Different clades of this clade have been identified and classified into subgroups called mycelia and yeast [15, 16]. The secreted proteins in the secretory proteins of C. neoformans and C. gattii are highly conserved and exhibit a broad spectrum of immunomodulatory effects. These immunomodulatory effects include phagolysosomal defenses, antioxidant and antitumor properties, and antitumor activity [17]. The most prominent immunomodulatory effect of the mycelia of the dimorphic fungi was observed for an antibody to the mycotoxin pyrrolnitrin. The mycelia of C. neoformans and C.


## Methods
Protein-protein interaction
The pET-29a^+/<U+2206>pET-aß complex (Peproteo, Paris, France) was a kind gift from C. P. Beaudoin [39]. The pET-a^+/<U+2206>pET-aß complex was constructed as follows: the pET-a^+/<U+2206>pET-aß complex was expressed in the lysosome (L) fractions of E. coli, L. (F. thermophila) and B. licheniformis strains. The pET-a^+/<U+2206>pET-aß complex was expressed in the lysosome (L) fractions of B. thermophila, B. licheniformis and F. thermophila strains. The pET-a^+/<U+2206>pET-aß complex was expressed in the lysosome (L) fractions of B. thermophila and F. thermophila.


## Results
We found that the M35 proteins from the . brasiliensis and Pb01 strains were very highly expressed in secreted secretome, with the highest expression observed in the Pb01 strains. We then examined the secretion of M35 family proteins from the P. brasiliensis and Pb01 strains by digestion with the recombinant protein Pb01-9p, a recombinant M35 protein that was purified from P. brasiliensis strain G217 (29). Proteins from Pb01-9p were also present in secreted secretomes of Pb01-fragment strains (Fig 4B). The secretion of M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p is in agreement with the low expression of M35 family proteins in secretome from P. brasiliensis strains (Fig 4C). The secretion of M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p was also confirmed by Western blotting using anti-His-tag antibody (Fig 5A). In addition, the secretion of M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p is consistent with the low expression of M35 family proteins in secreted secretomes of Pb01 strains (Fig 4D).

M35 family proteins have been shown to be secreted by M. oryzae and P. brasiliensis, respectively, and M. oryzae secretes M35 family proteins in response to oxidative stress and temperature (27, 28). In addition, the M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p were highly expressed in secreted secretome of Pb01-fragment strains, which is consistent with the low expression of M35 family proteins in secretome of Pb01-fragment strains (Fig 4E). Interestingly, the secretion of M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p was not specific to oxidative stress as our results show that the secretion of M35 family proteins from Pb01-9p is in agreement with the M35 family protein expression in secretome of Pb01-fragment strains (Fig 4D).


## Discussion
M35 family metalloproteases are reported to possess a small number of putative catalytic domain. However, they are not reported to be involved in the degradation of mammalian proteins, such as collagen, chitin and cell wall components. The latter two proteins are found in the plasma membrane of mammals and their degradation is essential for the function of M35 family metalloproteases in the host.

The two orthologues of the M35 family in S. cerevisiae are (from left to right) M31-like, M34-like and M35-like proteins with a conserved catalytic domain (Fig 3a). In comparison to S. cerevisiae, the M35 family is found in all eukaryotic lineages, except for the proteobacteria, in which a gene deletion and overexpression of M35 family metalloproteases resulted in avirulent human pathogenic microorganisms [18].

The M35 family of metalloproteases is involved in the degradation of proteins by cofactors in the plasma membrane and secreted proteins by M35 family members [17]. The M35 family has also been identified in different classes of fungi, such as the yeast [29] and the human pathogenic fungi [30]. In S. cerevisiae, M35 family members are involved in the degradation of cell wall chitin and collagen by protein degradation [31]. In addition, M35 family members are also involved in the degradation of other proteins such as the iron/choline/cysteine/dihydrofolate reductase (FeGRP) in M. oryzae [32].

The M35 family is involved in the degradation of proteins by the M35 family members in the plasma membrane. The M35 family members are also involved in the degradation of other proteins such as the N-methyltransferase complex (NMT) and the xylanase complex (XML). The NMT is a type of protein-protein interaction-guided reversible protein-protein-aspartate (P-PASP) fusion protein, which was first described in yeast [33]. In M.
