## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii infection is characterized by a heterogeneous, multi-organ failure, with a predominance of yeast within phagocytic infiltrate and a slow growth rate. The causative organism is G. mellonella, a zoonotic pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia and meningoencephalitis in humans. The innate immune response is usually monokaryotic, with some species even evolving into multikaryotic lineages. However, a number of species are currently restricted to restricted hosts; the recently discovered Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are the only fungal species that can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans. We report a unique case of cryptococcosis caused by C. gattii in a restricted host population in Thailand. The organism was found to have a highly active latent infection process, capable of inducing tissue necrosis in mice and of infecting rodents with a single or multiple infections.


## Introduction
Pulmonary cryptococcosis, a rare but serious infection, is caused by either Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. This infection is usually acquired by inhalation of fungal cells from the environment. However, an opportunistic infection can also be caused by non-meningeal pathogens, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, and mycetoma, or by certain non-fungal pathogens, such as opportunistic infections of the skin, mucus, or nails (1).

Cryptococcosis is a common lung infection with a prevalence of 10% to 25%. The most common agent is Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality.


## Methods
neoformans were investigated in murine models of systemic candidiasi. Briefly, C. neoformans strains were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and subcultured to OD_600 = 0.5 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in 24-well tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Denmark) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO_2. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The numbers of viable C. neoformans were counted and the number of animals that died was determined.

The effect of AmB on C. neoformans growth in this model of systemic candidiasis was tested by recording the number of viable C. neoformans on each of the following slides. The animals were challenged with C. neoformans on the seventh day of the experiment. These animals were considered as control groups. The number of viable C. neoformans was counted and the number of animals that died was determined.

Fungal burdens and mortality were measured after the experiment was performed. Briefly, five animals from each group were divided into two groups. The animals were challenged with C. neoformans at the seventh day of the experiment. These animals were considered as control groups. The number of viable C. neoformans was counted and the number of animals that died was determined.

## Results
melanogaster and . neoformans, the first pathogen of interest (Fig 5A). D. melanogaster was able to significantly increase survival (p<0.001) compared to C. neoformans (p<0.001) in the presence of Amphotericin B. The effect of D. melanogaster was also significant in the presence of DSC in the presence of Amphotericin B (p<0.05), with no significant differences between the two.

D. melanogaster induced a high level of IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-a in the CSF (Fig 5B). D. melanogaster induced an increase in IL-12 (p<0.001), IL-23 (p<0.001) and TNF-a (p<0.05) in the CSF compared to the C. neoformans-treated control (Fig 5B).

In the neutrophil assay, D. melanogaster caused a significant increase in IL-12 (p<0.05) and IL-23 (p<0.001) in the CSF in the presence of Amphotericin B compared to the C. neoformans-treated control. However, the IL-12 induced effect of D. melanogaster was not significant in the CSF in the presence of Amphotericin B, with no significant difference between the two, with no IL-12 induced by D. melanogaster and the level of IL-23 induced by C. neoformans.

The analysis of TNF-a (Fig 5C) and IL-12 (Fig 5D) in the CSF, neutrophils, and inflammatory cells were conducted using a lectin probe and a chemokine receptor (Fig 5E). D. melanogaster induced a high level of TNF-a (p<0.05) and IL-12 (p<0.001) in the CSF compared to the C. neoformans-treated control, with no significant differences between the two.

TNF-a (Fig 5F) and IL-12 (Fig 5G) in the CSF, neutrophils, and inflammatory cells were measured using a lectin probe and a chemokine receptor (Fig 5H). D. melanogaster induced a high level of TNF-a (p<0.


## Discussion
The MDR MnnA-A protein of the Cryptococcus neoformans cell wall was shown to be a mediator of cell wall integrity, and its orthologs were also identified in the murine cryptococcosis model [17. In addition to MnnA, MnnB, MnnC, MnnD, and MnnE were also identified. Interestingly, in the murine cryptococcosis model, MnnD was also found to be required for the full virulence of the mutant [18]. The interaction of MnnE with the cell wall of C. neoformans can result in the activation of a cascade of cell wall-related phenotypes, including cell wall biosynthesis, cell wall polysaccharide, and cell wall-degrading enzymes [19]. Additionally, the overexpression of MnnE and MnnB led to increased cell wall remodeling in C. neoformans [18]. It is known that in addition to cell wall remodeling, cell wall-related phenotypes are also related to cell morphology and function. The presence of a single cell wall component, the cell wall chitin, plays a role in cell wall integrity and pathogenesis. The cell wall, and especially the cell wall, is a major structure in the fungal cell wall, which protects the fungal cells against stress and oxidative stress [20]. It is reported that the cell wall is one of the most critical components for virulence and differentiation of C. neoformans and its production is directly linked to the development of immunity, cellular immunity, and cellular stress resistance in C. neoformans [21]. It has been reported that the cell wall is involved in the protection against oxidative stress in C. neoformans and its protective functions against a variety of stresses including cell wall stress [22]. In addition to cell wall remodeling, MnnB has been reported to be involved in other aspects of the cell wall, including chitin deposition and cell wall permeability. The MnnB protein was found to be up-regulated in C. neoformans cells after exposure to cell wall stressors including Congo red, NaCl, H_2O_2, and H_2O_2 [23].
