## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is typically a solitary condition with a very small number of cases. However, it is now more frequently seen in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus with a non-fibrotic malignant syndrome.


## Introduction
The genus Hypericum L. contains a diverse group of macro- and microorganisms, including species with a wide host range, which grow on a variety of substrates, and that produce a wide spectrum of compounds including alkaloids, antimicrobial peptides, and cell wall compounds [1]. Some Hypericum species are important components of various crops, such as peppers, apples, citrus, and wheat, and are used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In the last decades, Hypericum species have been isolated from various environmental sources and investigated for their important biological activities. The main Hypericum species isolated from various environments have been studied using culturing, chemical, and molecular methods. The hypericum-specific metabolites of plant origin are mainly hydrolytic, but also anticoagulant, and have potential application in the cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industry. The most studied Hypericum species include Hypericum perforatum L.


## Methods

All isolates were identified and confirmed by PCR and/or sequencin. These strains were subcultured on SDA at 35°C for 48 h (Table 1).

Isolates
The isolates C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were identified by sequencing the fungal DNA using a modified version of the QIAamp DNA polymerase (Qiagen) following standard protocols [48]. The ITS region was amplified from ITS1 of C. albicans using primers ITS5 and ITS4 [49] and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The pCR4-TOPO vector was digested with EcoRV and inserted into the EcoRV-digested pCR4-TOPO vector to generate pCR4-UAS. The remaining primers were modified to contain an N-terminal N-terminal restriction site and a S-terminal elongation factor (EST) fragment, as described in [50].

For the amplification of ITS region, primers ITS3 and ITS4 were used [51]. Amplification of the EST region was performed using primers ITS3 and ITS4, as described in [50]. The amplification of the V4 region was performed using primers V4-5F and V4-6R [51] and the PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced using a MiSeq DNA Sequencer (ABI Prism 3130xl) at the GeneBank^® (GDSB) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) facility.

Bioinformatic analyses
A BLASTn search was performed using the full-length sequence of C. albicans, and a BLASTn search of the full-length sequence of C. dubliniensis was performed against the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) for the identified genes. The E-value was set to 10^-5, and the maximum e-value obtained for each search was set to 200.

Phylogenetic analysis
Two-locus sequences of the C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C.


## Results
In addition, a greater number of Coccidioides species have been reported as pathogenic bacteria in humans [36, 37. Among these species, the majority belong to the Aspergillus species complex [38], which has been shown to be the most virulent in humans [39, 40]. The prevalence of Aspergillus species is decreasing in the United States and in some regions, such as Brazil [41, 42], and in the United Kingdom [43]. However, the prevalence of A. flavus has been increasing in the United States [44]. In the United States, A. flavus is the most common pathogen of humans [45], and in the UK it is the most common pathogen of tropical and temperate climates [46]. The prevalence of A. fumigatus in the United States has been increasing in recent years [47, 48].

A. fumigatus is less common in the United States, but the clinical and epidemiological data are conflicting [49, 50]. The prevalence of A. fumigatus in the United States is estimated to be approximately 0.3% [51]. In the United States, it has been estimated to be approximately 0.2% [52]. The prevalence of A. fumigatus in the United States has been decreasing in recent years [53]. In the United States, the incidence of A. fumigatus in this period was estimated to be approximately 0.5% [53]. In the United Kingdom, it was estimated to be 0.2% [54].

Coccidioides species have been shown to be the main causes of morbidity and mortality in humans [7, 14, 15, 16]. In addition, the prevalence of Coccidioides species has been increasing in the United States [7, 14, 16]. Coccidioides species are known to be associated with infections caused by other fungi such as the yeasts Aspergillus and Penicillium species [7, 15, 14, 16]. The prevalence of Coccidioides species in the United States has been decreasing in recent years [7].

A. fumigatus is more common in the United States than in other countries (Figure 2). However, in the United States, a higher incidence of A.


## Discussion
We have identified and characterized an amoebic pathogen in the C. neoformans clinical isolate H99 that can cause meningoencephalitis.
