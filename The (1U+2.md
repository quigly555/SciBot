## Abstract
Here, we identified and characterized a novel factor, the lysine deaminase (LdA) from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans (Aph) that plays an important role in the binding of phagocytic cells to phagocytic oligosaccharide. In vitro, the enzyme was shown to be active in A. nidulans and to bind to a variety of oligosaccharides, suggesting that it might be a promising antifungal drug target. However, the binding interaction between the A. nidulans LdA was not involved in the fungal viability of cells. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed recombinant strains of both A. nidulans and A. nidulans-type CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and overexpressed them. We found that overexpressing a specific type of LdA gene abolished the binding of phagocytic cells to BDG-loaded oligosaccharides and reduced the binding of BDG-treated cells to oligosaccharides. In vivo experiments revealed that the overexpressing strain showed a decrease in colony forming units (cfu) when cells were treated with BDG-loaded BDUs, whereas the overexpressing strain showed a decrease in colony forming units (cfuF) when cells were treated with BDG-Unloaded BDUs. Collectively, our results suggest that the overexpressing strain is a potent antifungal drug target for future drug discovery and development.

IMPORTANCE While high-throughput sequencing has enabled the discovery of new drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry, few target fungi directly. This may be partly due to the costs involved and the lack of effective and specific antifungal drugs. As a result, there is an immense amount of research investment in developing novel natural drugs and the development of efficient molecular probes that can explore the fungal molecular circuitry. This review focuses on recent advances in natural drug discovery that have led to great hits for fungal pathogens and on the challenges of drug discovery and development.

The fungus Aspergillus nidulans is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis, a leading cause of death worldwide.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause a life-threatening invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in humans. The mortality rate of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with immunocompromised status is as high as 40-50%, and mortality can reach up to 90% upon prolonged neutropenia [1].

## Results
The increased levels of these enzymes in . fumigatus may be related to the activity of the HOG pathway.

Expression of genes associated with fungi in the CAZyme pathway
To investigate the expression of genes associated with fungal pathogenicity, we examined the expression of the fungal pathogenicity-related genes (GO: 0005640) in the CAZyme pathway. The expression of the CAZyme genes was assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) in A. fumigatus and A. terreus. A. terreus and A. fumigatus had the highest levels of fungal pathogenicity genes (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test), while A. fumigatus showed a lower level of fungal pathogenicity genes (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, A. terreus had the lowest expression of the fungal pathogenicity-related genes (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test).

A. terreus was the only fungal pathogen found to have a low level of the fungal pathogenicity-related genes (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) (Table 1). In order to determine whether the expression of the fungal pathogenicity-related genes was associated with the CAZyme pathway, the expression of fungal pathogenicity-related genes was compared with CAZyme expression (Table 1). The results showed that the expression of fungal pathogenicity-related genes was significantly increased in A.


## Discussion
 2001. The genes involved in chitin biosynthesis are highly conserved in fungi and are of diverse functions in different eukaryotes (Krok and Schochaar, 2002). The family of chitinases is also well-known in fungi, including Hsp70 and Ssk1 (Brennan et al., 2000). In the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans, the chitin synthase, chitin synthase 1 and chitin synthase 2, were found to be highly conserved in different eukaryotes (Gao et al., 2008). The cell wall is an important biological structure that contains proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall components (Thanh et al., 2005). The enzyme, chitinase 1, is highly expressed in yeast cells, and it plays an important role in cell wall formation and cell wall degradation (Zhou et al., 2006). The plant cell wall (cwn) contains proteins, lipids, and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall components (Zhou et al., 2008). The number of chitin synthase genes is also increased in fungi, including C. neoformans, N. crassa, and P. marneffei (Lee et al., 2007; Kohn et al., 2008).

The transcription factor Gcn3 is involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall components in fungi (Dandakar et al., 2013). The gene encoding the manganese synthase, ß-1,6-glucan synthase, and chitin synthase was identified in the fungi. The ß-1,6-glucan synthase is a cell wall polymer produced by cell wall synthesis in fungi (Tsukkanen et al., 2005). The ß-1,6-glucan synthase is a cell wall polysaccharide synthase, produced by cell wall synthesis in fungi (Tsukkanen et al., 2005).
