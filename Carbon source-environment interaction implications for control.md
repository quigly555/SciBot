## Abstract
We evaluated the efficacy of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in a Ugandan HIV patient with severe falciparum malaria. The patient had been treated with rituximab and hydrocortisone for 2 months and received daily rest and hydration for 3 months. The patient was in excellent health with signs and symptoms of severe malaria. The patient was started with combination therapy with at least 3 months of rituximab. The patient's condition eventually improved markedly within 6 months.


## Introduction
Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most important rice diseases worldwide and is responsible for 10 million deaths each year (Park et al. 2017). The pathogen causes death by spores and is a major threat to rice production (Bok et al. 2015).


## Methods
., disease and land use, for example, in the evaluation of soil microbial communities) (Lanjandla et al., 2014).

In the present study, the microbes in the soil (lungs) were quantified using a commercial biochemical analyzer, Waters Corporation (Waters Corporation, USA), with a soil concentration of 8 g L^-1. The soil microbial community was selected by the following criteria: (1) the community was characterized by relative abundance, (2) the presence of several distinct morphological features, and (3) the diversity of the microbial communities was evaluated by light microscopy (Olympus BX51, Japan). The concentrations of the different carbon sources were determined by the formula (g L^-1)/g L^-1. The soil microbial community was divided into three classes, “carbon-starved” (c/g) and “natural” (c/g).

The concentrations of the various carbon sources were expressed as relative units per L^-1 of soil, where g L^-1 represents the concentration of each carbon source, c L^-1 represents the soil microbial community composition, and g L^-1 represents the soil microbial community composition as a whole (Lanjandla et al., 2014). The methods were as follows: (1) The amount of each carbon source was estimated by the absorbance of the soil microbial community and the carbon content. (2) The amount of each carbon source was expressed as the percentage of the total concentration of each carbon source.

The soil microbial community composition was divided into three classes, “carbon-starved” (c/g) and “natural” (c/g).

Fungal diversity was calculated using the method of Fang et al. (2011). The microbial community was divided into three classes, “carbon-starved” (c/g) and “natural” (c/g).


## Results
flavus (Seifert et a., 2006).

Among the ten fungal species, we identified four isolates from human brain that were cultured for six days in the absence of a host-pathogen interaction. Five isolates were isolated from blood, but not from the lungs or brains. These isolates were subjected to the same culture conditions as the above isolates (Fig 4A). These isolates were identified as P. indica CBS 219.72, P. indica CBS 140152, and P. indica CBS 613.72, all of which were reported to be sterile in clinical cultures (Seifert et al., 2006). The isolates were identified as P. indica CBS 896.72, P. indica CBS 798.72, and P. indica CBS 120315.

Cloning and sequencing of P. indica
The P. indica CBS 219.72 isolate was sequenced by PCR and the template sequence was confirmed by whole genome sequencing of a fragment of the A. flavus microsomal DNA sequence. The gene, known as PIP2, was amplified from the amplified and sequence-specific primers in both strains. The ORF of PIP2 was 28 bp, with the predicted polyprotein sequence of 83,224 bp, and the predicted protein of 811,297 bp. The PIP2 gene is homologous to the Aspergillus-specific CD206 promoter (Seifert et al., 2006). The PIP2 gene is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 17.5 kDa (He et al., 2004). The PIP2 gene was located on chromosome 1 of the isolate CBS 219.72. The ORF of PIP2 was 28 bp, with the predicted polyprotein sequence of 83,224 bp, and the predicted protein of 811,297 bp. The PIP2 gene was located on chromosome 1 of the isolate CBS 219.72. The PIP2 gene was located on chromosome 1 of the isolate CBS 219.72. The PIP2 gene was also located on chromosome 1 of the isolate CBS 219.72. The PIP2 gene was also located on chromosome 1 of the isolate CBS 219.72. The sequence of PIP2 was successfully amplified from the amplicon of CBS 219.72.


## Discussion
Our results revealed that carbon metabolism was strongly positively correlated with pathogenicity in this stud. Thus, we decided to investigate whether carbon metabolism was negatively correlated with pathogenicity in this study. In contrast, the carbon metabolism in plant-pathogen interactions was positively correlated with virulence in this study. This indicates that pathogenicity was strongly positively associated with carbon metabolism and virulence in this study. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the link between carbon metabolism and pathogenicity in plant-pathogen interactions.

Regulation of virulence genes in plant-pathogen interactions
The roles of genes involved in carbon metabolism and pathogenicity have been extensively studied in other species, and the roles of carbon metabolism in virulence of plant pathogens and their hosts are widespread (Bellamy et al., 2006; Whetz et al., 2010; Anagnoster et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011; Muzadi et al., 2012). We found that plant-pathogenicity genes are significantly up-regulated in response to various carbon sources, including carbon starvation, glucose, ethanol, and glycerol (Figures 2 and 3, Additional files 1, 2, 3, Additional files 2, 3, Additional files 4, Additional file 5, Additional file 6, Additional file 7). The up-regulated genes in response to carbon starvation were closely related to other virulence genes. The up-regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism in response to carbon starvation suggests that carbon metabolism and pathogenicity may have important roles in adaptation to various carbon sources (Figure 3). We also found that genes involved in the glycerol-phosphate kinase (GPCK) pathway (GPPK) pathway were significantly up-regulated in response to carbon starvation. The glycerol-phosphate kinase (GPPK) pathway is regulated by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and glycerol (G6P) (Figure 4). The GPPK pathway is a key enzyme in the production of a variety of metabolites, including sugar, glycerol, and mannitol (Sesiga et al., 2000; Hölz et al., 2006).
