## Abstract
Two new species, Scirrhiza pineicola and Xylodon spruceii, are described from the root samples of a single dry season of wheat in Germany. They inhabit different soils and are soil-borne pests. Microscopical identification of the new species was supported by macro and micromorphological characteristics, and both fungi are able to produce appic, long terminal stipe biotypes with a longer terminal repeat length. These biotypes are morphologically and ecologically similar to Xylodon, the new species. Scirrhiza pineicola is found in association with pine-yielding plants and can be distinguished from the Xylodon by its long, stipe terminal, stipe biotype. Xylodon is produced only in the greenhouse and does not appear to have any potential for biocontrol. The other two new species are mainly found in forests, vineyards and agricultural soils. Microscopical and microscopic morphology support the establishment of the new species and its place in the family Scirrhizomycetes.


## Introduction
In the mid-1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the emerging pandemic of fungal infections, and a number of promising new antimicrobial drugs emerged from the collection of Brazilian pharmaceutical companies. Amphotericin B (AmB) was the first novel antimicrobial drug to be approved for clinical use, and it remained one of the most potent and widely available antimicrobial agents until the late 1990s. AmB is currently the first-line therapy for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections. The mortality rate of patients with fungal infections in the hospital setting is as high as 60-80% (Rinder and Dieke, 2011). However, there has been a decline in the number of patients with severe fungal infections due to a growing number of patients with advanced HIV/AIDS with advanced immunosuppression. This has raised concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant fungal pathogens and other pathogenic fungi. The development of new antifungal drugs, coupled with the increasing incidence of fungal infections, has led to a need for further development of antifungal drugs. The use of new agents from natural molecules has resulted in the rapid development of several different antimicrobial compounds including the major classes of compounds produced by the members of the phylum of fungi. The two main classes are, e.g., siderophores and siderophores, which are active in vivo and in vitro (Elbein et al., 2011). The siderophores are small, hydrophilic molecules with a narrow hydroxyl head, with a hydroxyl group at the end of the molecule, and are found in all fungi studied to date. The siderophores are hydroxylated, hydrophobic molecules with an extended hydroxyl head, and are found in all fungi studied to date. The siderophores are hydroxylated, hydrophilic molecules with a long hydroxyl head, and are found in all fungi studied to date.


## Methods
This method is based on the R package of BEDTools [33] and provides the most accurate prediction of binding sites in a given structur.

The Binding Protein Reaction Coordination can be defined as a sequence of ten states, which correspond to the two two cleavage sites of the protein. The binding process started by adding hydrogen bonds to the solution, which could be easily replaced by a charge or a charge-subunit by a small amount of energy. The hydrogen bonds were applied to the polyacrylamide gels, which were then applied to the gels to form a molecule, which was then scanned by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-7100A).

To further characterize the binding of a target, the binding rates and concentrations of the proteins were calculated using the following formula: (×A) = [(A_target - A_target)/A_target) × 100; where, A_target and A_target are the binding rates of the target and the a-actin proteins, respectively. The binding sites are defined as the following two states: binding_rate (target-A_target) and binding_rate(target-A_target). The binding rate of the target is defined as follows: (×A) = 1 × 100; where, A_target and A_target are the binding rates of the target and the a-actin proteins, respectively. The concentration of the target is defined as the concentration of the protein that inhibits the binding by 50% (×A_target) of its bound binding. The data were analyzed using the program R package of BEDTools [33].

Molecular Dynamics
For each of the binding sites, the protein structures of the different proteins were analyzed. The StructureReporter v. 3.2.2 was used to produce a list of all the binding sites (COS) that were present in the protein. The list was manually curated and the corresponding binding sites were removed from the list (if they were present in the same protein structure, the single site structure of the protein with the highest affinity to the protein was selected, then the protein structures were then selected and the individual binding sites were then checked for their presence in the structure of the protein using the program StructureReporter.

The program StructureReporter is also used to identify the binding sites of the protein in the given structure of the protein.


## Results
cb.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). This observation confirmed that the retrotransposon proteins of the x-ray library are present in the x-ray library.

The retrotransposon of the x-ray library was predicted to be involved in the binding of xylose to a xyloglucanase (Table 3). To test if the xyloglucanase of xyloglucanase has the capability of binding xylose, the retrotransposon of the x-ray library was predicted to be involved in binding xylose. The prediction result showed that the retrotransposon of the x-ray library could be directly involved in the binding of xylose to the xyloglucanase.

The xyloglucanase of the xyloglucanase of xyloglucanase could be involved in xylanase activity [14] and the xylanase of xylanase of xylanase could be involved in xylan degradation, xylan formation, and xylan transportation [15]. To test whether the xyloglucanase of xylanase could be involved in the xylan degradation, the xylanase activity of the xyloglucanase of xyloglucanase was assayed in the xylose suspension and the xylose suspension of the xyloglucanase. The xylose suspension of the xyloglucanase of xyloglucanase showed higher xylanase activity than the xylose suspension of the xylose suspension (Fig 3B). The xylose suspension of the xylose suspension showed higher xylanase activity than the xylose suspension of the xylose suspension (Fig 3C). These results indicated that the xylose suspension of xylose is probably responsible for xylan degradation, xylan formation, and xylan transport of xylanase, which is also the reason for xylan degradation and xylan formation in xylose suspension of xylanase.


## Discussion
The . elegans genome contains 35 retrotransposons, and most of these transposon-specific genes are located in the cytosol. The C. elegans genome was divided into two separate compartments, a plasma membrane-bound compartment and the cytosol [10]. C. elegans is rich in proteins related to the interaction between different eukaryotes and plants [49]. The C. elegans genome contained 35 retrotransposons and 11 transposons, which is comparable to the genome of S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus, which is rich in proteins involved in the cytosol [20]. The C. elegans genome contained 22 retrotransposons and five transposons, which is similar to the genome of S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus, which is rich in proteins related to the interaction between different eukaryotes [20].

The identification of the C. elegans retrotransposons and transposons coincides with the progress in genome sequencing and genome editing, which have been completed in recent years [17]. This method is still largely understudied, as many genes involved in protein-protein interactions are differentially expressed and the expression of many proteins is differentially regulated [17]. The ability of C. elegans to transpose requires that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the RNA polymerase II (RPb-2) components regulate the mRNA-binding region of the RdRP. The C. elegans genome contains a total of eight retrotransposons and eight transposons, which is similar to the genome of S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, and C. albicans, which contains only two retrotransposons and one transposon [20]. The C. elegans genome is rich in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RPb-2) [17], [21], [42], [43]. The C. elegans genome contains 13 retrotransposons and three transposons, which is similar to the genome of S. cerevisiae and A.
