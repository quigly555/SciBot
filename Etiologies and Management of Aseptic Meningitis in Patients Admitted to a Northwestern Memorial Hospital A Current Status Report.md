## Abstract
The initiation of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after TDF initiation is a well-recognized complication of sarcoidosis and other systemic mycoses. We herein report the first case of TDF-induced IRIS in a patient with sarcoidosis and other immunocompromised states without immunodeficiency, who presented with peripheral infiltrates and extrapulmonary mycoses. The patient had suffered from sarcoidosis for 4 years prior to the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple nodules and mycoses consistent with sarcoidosis. He was started on prednisone 600 mg after a negative skin prick test. Upon initial presentation, all symptoms were believed to have been related to an overzealousy of immunostimulants. Due to the high frequency of this IRIS in our hospital, we initiated antifungal therapy with a prednisone daily regimen. He was later diagnosed to have sarcoidosis on the second day of treatment and aspergillosis on the third day of treatment. He had a good response to therapy and was discharged after 1 month. He has a history of steroid-dependent immunodeficiency associated with sarcoidosis, and he continued to have high relapse of this IRIS. He received continuous lipo, prednisone and dexamethasone 600 mg once or twice daily except for a rare case with enlargement of the right upper lobe. He has never had a prior episode of sarcoidosis, and he was not treated for invasive sarcoidosis. Although he had a low-grade fever, the authors' knowledge suggests that this is the only documented case of TDF-induced pulmonary aspergillosis in patients treated with prednisone. He has never been treated for sarcoidosis, and he had an excellent response to steroids.


## Introduction
The basic principles of eukaryotic cell biology are well known in vertebrates, and they have been extensively studied in the model filamentous ascomycete Sordaria cingulata, which is a member of the order Mucorales. The conidiomata is a strictly asexual process that starts by an unicellular budding from the cell wall of the budding conidium. The conidium is the primary organelle in which the cell wall is synthesized. In the dimorphic model fungus Neurospora crassa, cells of the conidium emerge from the hyphal tips and form large, non-semiepathogenic conidia (spp.) that are produced during the vegetative growth of the conidiophore. These spp. may remain on the growing conidium and form spores, which then germinate and grow to complete the vegetative cycle. The S. crassa spp. are characterized by a high tolerance to environmental stresses (e.g., heat, oxidative stress, cold, and heavy metal) and the ability to survive in harsh environments, such as harsh, arid and osmotic environments, by the conidiophore. The spp. produce large, non-semiepathogenic conidia that germinate in response to external environmental signals, such as oxidative and osmotic stresses, and can grow to enormous sizes (reviewed in [1]). They also produce large, non-semiepathogenic conidia that germinate in response to light (reviewed in [2]). The spp. are also able to form long, thick, and dense conidia, which are important for pathogenicity (reviewed in [3]).

Sordariomycetes are heterothallic, obligate biotrophic fungi, which include five subfamilies, namely Dikarya, Blastosythe, Dikarya, Euascomycetes, Eurotium, Gloeosporiotomycetes, and Platyhelminthe (also known as “Dikarya”) [4,5]. These fungi are ubiquitous and present a wide range of lifestyles. Some species are saprophytes, parasites, or mutualists, whereas others are symbionts and pathogens.


## Methods
Fungal strains and culture conditions
C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The C. albicans strains used in this study were C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans SC5314, and C. albicans ATCC 90028. All strains were cultured in liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% bactopeptone) at 30 °C.

Preparation of proteins and transporters
C. albicans strains were grown in YPD broth at 30 °C for 24 h, then centrifuged at 4,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for binding of a-tubulin to C.


## Results
A search of the UCD database for additional references identifies the following: (i) a broad spectrum of pathogens associated with skin, lung, and blood; (ii) the majority of pathogenic microorganisms (including . Typhimurium, S. albidus, and S. suis), (iii) pathogens associated with respiratory disease, (iv) pathogens associated with CNS infections, and (v) pathogens associated with meningitis, a recent World Health Organization (WHO) diagnosis of meningitis, and a patient with a recent history of nosocomial infection and infection in the last 10 years. These pathogens were identified as four or more isolates of S. Typhimurium (one case of S. Typhimurium and two cases of S. suis), S. albidus (one case of S. Typhimurium and one case of S. albidus), and S. Typhimurium (two cases of S. Typhimurium and one case of S. albidus) from an international perspective.

Risk Factors for Lymphadenopathy in Patients Admitted to a Northwestern Memorial Hospital
Risk factors for Lymphadenopathy are the following: (i) the presence of a confirmed diagnosis of meningitis (5-8 cases per year), (ii) the type of infection (S. Typhimurium, S. albidus, and S. suis) and (iii) the presence of a previous bacterial infection or a previous cryptococcosis (5-8 cases per year). Risk factors for Lymphadenopathy are the following: (i) the presence of a confirmed diagnosis of meningitis (5-8 cases per year), (ii) the type of infection (S. Typhimurium, S. albidus, and S. suis) and (iii) the presence of a previous bacterial infection or a previous cryptococcosis (5-8 cases per year).

## Discussion
In addition to the Chinese patients, a number of Korean patients had a history of infectious disease, especially anemia and chronic liver diseas. Given the high incidence of infectious diseases, a literature review was conducted to determine the epidemiology and the therapeutic practices of these patients in Korea. The literature review showed that the most common infectious diseases in Korean patients were bacterial (n = 11), fungal (n = 3) and parasitic (n = 2) infections. Among the pathogens, we observed that most of the Korean patients were infected with Aspergillus spp. (n = 12). This species is one of the most common pathogens of infectious diseases in the Korean population, and it is the major cause of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients (25). A previous study found that the most common infectious diseases in Korean patients were disseminated and infectious diseases (n = 11) and heart failure (n = 8).

Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common pathogen in this group of Korean patients. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that causes disease in immunocompromised patients (26). Cryptococcus neoformans has been found in the United States and Europe, although its distribution has not been reported in Korea. However, this yeast was the most common pathogen in Korea and its isolation in Korean patients was consistent with the results from previous studies in patients admitted to a Korean hospital (27). This yeast is also the most common human pathogen of immunocompromised individuals (28).

Cryptococcus gattii was the second most common species found in Korea. Cryptococcus gattii has been found in patients admitted to a German hospital with HIV and cerebral toxoplasmosis (29). Cryptococcus gattii was the most common yeast found in this study, with an incidence of 14.1% and a mortality rate of 1.4%. The mortality rate of the Korean patients was slightly higher than that in the United States and the lowest among these patients, at 3.6%.

The main reasons for the high mortality of HIV patients were non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, infections with other fungi, and the use of antiretroviral therapy. Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections were seen in two Korean patients, one with a viral infection and the other with a bacterial infection.
