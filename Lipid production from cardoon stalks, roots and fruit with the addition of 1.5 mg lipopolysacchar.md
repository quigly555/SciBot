## Abstract
The present study aimed to analyze the biochemical, genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the two Cryptococcus species isolates from Sistanza region, India. DNA sequence data were obtained from the nucleotide sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the large subunit (LSU) of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were analyzed. Based on 16S rDNA sequence data, the species VGI was clearly distinct from the species VGIU. ITS and LSU sequences showed that VGI species VGI species has a higher total and carbohydrate content than the species VGIU. ITS and LSU species VGI species VSSI species VSSI species was clearly distinct from VGI species VGIU. Our results indicated that the two species VGI species VSSI species and VSSI species were responsible for Cryptococcus spp. Diminucent and dimorphic yeast forms. Dimorphic forms were observed in both species, which may be the reason for the observed morphological differences.


## Introduction
Zika virus, the current primary human zoonotic vector, belongs to the protozoan genus Vibrio L. (the protozoan parasite, V. arrhizus) and is transmitted by the zoonotic protozoan, Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi). Borrelia causes fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, and skin lesions that are either necrotic, necrotizing dermatitis, or aspergilloses [1,2,3].

Zika virus, the current primary human zoonotic vector, belongs to the protozoan genus Zymomonas, which is transmitted by the bite of infected sandflies [4]. The sandfly host, the sandfly host, is an obligate symbiotic fungus, and the parasite causes disease in both free-living sandflies and parasitic sandflies, called zika, which are known as zoonoses. Zika are divided into three species: Z. gambiense, Z. restrictundo and Z. venezuelensis [5].


## Methods
1% (v/v) Tween 80 was performed as previously described (Bolger et a., 2017a). For this study, the preparation of C. albicans SC5314 cells was performed as previously described (Bolger et al., 2017b). The total RNA of C. albicans SC5314 was extracted and treated with DNase (Life Technologies, USA) to remove genomic DNA contamination. The extracted RNA was treated with DNase (Life Technologies, USA) to remove genomic DNA contamination and the RNA was reverse transcribed with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, USA) using an Advantage Plus Multi-Scribe™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies, USA). The synthesized cDNA was diluted with RNase-free water to obtain cDNA concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 ng/µl. The quality of the cDNA was determined with NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, USA) and the mRNA levels were normalized to the mRNA levels in the wild type and the tested cells.

To check the mRNA levels in the wild type and the tested cells, 1 µg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed with an RT-PCR reaction using an oligo-dT primer with the following thermal profile: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The gels were then blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (5%) for 1.5 h at room temperature and then incubated with the primers and M13 forward primer (5'-AGAGTTTGACCTCACGAC-3') and M13 reverse primer (5'-GGACTTCCTTGATTCAAACG-3') for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3× in TBST and then incubated with an anti-fade-rabbit antibody (1:50, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at room temperature for 1 h at room temperature.


## Results
 mg/mL blood inoculu. Candida albicans was also used for the test.

The results of the assay are shown in Table 1. The results demonstrated that the only exception to the negative control was the addition of 0.5 mg/mL of lipopolysaccharide at the end of the experiment (3 h). No lipopolysaccharide production was detected in the test samples from blood, but the amount of lipopolysaccharide produced by the presence of lipopolysaccharide was very similar between the two groups.

2.3. Oral Lactose
The oleaginous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a-linolenic acid and lipolytic acid, respectively. In contrast, the lipopolysaccharide produced by the presence of a-linolenic acid was very similar between the two groups. The oleaginous yeast is an obligate endoplasmic reticulum-resident pathogen, which is not susceptible to the antifungal drugs used to treat fungal infections. Therefore, the oleaginous yeast was tested in this study for its ability to produce lipopolysaccharide. The oleaginous yeast demonstrated high sensitivity to antifungals tested, including fluconazole and voriconazole. All the oleaginous yeast strains tested produced lipopolysaccharide in the medium. These results indicated that the oleaginous yeast could produce lipopolysaccharide.

2.4. Oligoflavine-Based Lipoprotease Activity
A. niger Lactose was the most resistant strain to fluconazole, with a MIC value of 0.125 mg/ml, and voriconazole resistance at the highest concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The oleaginous yeast was also sensitive to fluconazole and voriconazole, as well as to a-linolenic acid and lipolytic acid (Table 2).

2.5. Oligoflavine-Based Lipoprotease Activity
All the oleaginous yeast strains tested showed the highest activity against voriconazole and fluconazole, with MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 1.25 mg/ml.


## Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that the generation of novel proteins by RNAi in the presence of specific conditions has important functions in the evolution of gene expression and cell morphology, and in the resolution of genetic interactions. However, these studies were based on only a small number of individuals. In this study, we present a strategy for generating new RNAi targets using Y. lipolytica in a non-susceptible and invasive strain of the parasitic fungus M. oryzae.

We showed that the primary function of Y. lipolytica RNAi is to prevent the growth of the fungus on rice leaves in the presence of non-susceptible rice plants. The transcriptome analysis showed that the gene was upregulated in the presence of rice leaves, but not on rice leaves. The expression of this gene was downregulated in rice leaves without rice leaves, suggesting that this gene is important for resistance to M. oryzae. Our results showed that the expression of this gene was upregulated in rice leaves and in rice leaves on rice leaves without rice leaves.

In the present study, we also identified the gene as an active transcript that regulates rice-induced genes of the plant response to M. oryzae. The results suggested that the gene could be involved in the pathogenesis of rice-infected rice plants.

In conclusion, we have described a novel gene for Y. lipolytica that was highly expressed in the presence of rice leaves, but not on rice leaves. We have also shown that this gene is involved in the pathogenesis of rice-infected rice plants.
