## Abstract
In this study, we report the use of the fungus Malassezia restricta in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) by using a mixed-culture approach with treatment-banoneur technique and a non-culture method. The growth characteristics of M. restricta treated with Triticum clomatum and its major components were compared with that obtained in the non-culture method. The overall growth, ultrastructural alterations and systemic tolerance of M. restricta were evaluated by histopathological and immunohistochemical staining. Results showed that the combined use of the two techniques resulted in comparable results to that obtained by the non-culture method. M. restricta treated with Triticum clomatum significantly increased the MIC value of the fungus, while its treatment with Triticum clomatum did not improve the MIC of M. restricta. These results suggest that Malassezia restricta is an effective alternative for the management of patients with M. restricta-C. tropicalis infection.

Malassezia restricta is a fungus that is common in the environment, including human, animals and plants. M. restricta is a member of the Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus genera.


## Introduction
(Lm), 201. P.F.S.S.M. Crous et al., 2009; P.F.C. Tulloss et al., 2011; P.G.G.G.E. Johnson et al., 2012). In contrast, the pathogenesis of P.F.C. is still unclear, as many of the published cases have been diagnosed in patients with underlying diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma (Nair et al., 2010; Nimrichter et al., 2011).

In the present case, the outcome of the patient was not better than in the previous case, and the outcome was not related to the severity of the underlying disease. In the present case, the outcome was also related to the severity of the underlying disease, which was not related to the severity of the underlying disease.

Introduction
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is an opportunistic infection, which occurs predominantly in immunosuppressed individuals (Nair et al., 2010; Nimrichter et al., 2011). TBM is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients (Gupta et al., 2010; Sharpton et al., 2010; Wijayawardene et al., 2014). It is estimated that 40% of patients with TBM in the general population develop a TBM, with over 3% of patients with acute meningitis presenting with central venous infarction (Jain et al., 2010). In contrast, approximately 2% of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis do not develop a meningitis due to TBM (Gupta et al., 2010). The development of cryptococcal meningitis is a non-specific clinical manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis, and the patient's immune status and the clinical presentation of cryptococcal meningitis differ in many ways from that in tuberculosis (Gupta et al., 2010; Sharpton et al., 2010). For example, the clinical presentation may be more complex and non-specific, and may be more related to the degree of immunosuppression, clinical manifestations, and the disease process than tuberculosis. Furthermore, the cryptococcal meningitis may be acquired from environmental sources, which may be relevant in the setting of tuberculosis.


## Methods

A/L was a patient in whom he had a history of corticosteroid use (see below), he had previous corticosteroid use in the previous year, and he had not had a history of lung cancer in the past yea.

A/L was classified as a chronic respiratory infection, a systemic infection, a chronic viral infection, a pulmonary infection, or a respiratory failure with no response to therapy.

After successful treatment, a radiologist diagnosed the disease. The radiologist was blinded to the patient’s condition.

The disease was defined as a chronic respiratory infection (CRI) if the radiologist did not know the patient’s condition, was aware of the diagnosis and the presence of pulmonary lesion, and reported the disease to the radiologist.

Prognostic criteria were defined as [i] positive CSF, [ii] positive lung CT scan, and [iii] positive CSF imaging with a negative result.

Patients who were identified to be HIV negative after a diagnosis of CM were classified as ‘human immunodeficiency virus type 2 or HIV positive’ if they were a patient in whom he was not HIV positive, were not receiving antiretroviral therapy, or were on antiretroviral therapy, or were not receiving systemic steroids.

Prognostic criteria were defined as [i] positive CSF, [ii] positive CSF CT scan, and [iii] positive lung CT scan.

Laboratory testing
The sensitivity, specificity, and positive detection of the test were analyzed by the Institute for Medical Research (IMR) protocol (MHRA-2) in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Medicine System of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (MS-MRV-USM-2) [12]. The study was approved by the UMW-2-Ethics Committee (Approval No. I- dated 11/27/2010).

Statistical analysis
All tests were two-tailed, and the results were compared by the Student’s t-test.


## Results
Loss of C. albicans promotes fungal growth
The effect of the culturing regimen on the growth of C. albicans was evaluated by measuring the colony forming units (CFU) using a standard dilution broth microdilution method. As shown in Fig 1, the culturing regimen caused the appearance of an irregular colony, which was not observed on the agar plate, indicating the low viability of the yeast cells. The culturing regimen also resulted in the isolation of the fungus from the culture, but no obvious growth defect was observed on the agar plate.

To further determine the effect of culturing regimen on fungal growth, the growth of C. albicans was measured in the presence of P. pastoris and in the presence of FK506, and the culturing regimen had no effect on the fungal growth. However, the culturing regimen promoted the growth of C. albicans (Fig 1).


## Discussion
However, a 12-month follow-up of the patient with Tiburon and Tiburon alone did not reveal any evidence for either autoimmune disease or autoimmune diseas. Thus, we do not have a definitive explanation for the autoimmune disease.

The current study also shows that cyclophosphamide treatment in conjunction with AMB may increase the risk of infections, such as those caused by C. neoformans. However, there was no difference in risk between cyclophosphamide and AMB, as was also observed in our study. Therefore, the mechanism by which cyclophosphamide increases risk of infections in the human population remains to be determined.

Cyclophosphamide treatment is recommended in patients with acute meningeal or systemic meningeal signs. In a study by Warcup and colleagues, cyclophosphamide treatment increased the risk of infection by C. neoformans by 11% (2/14). The risk of infection by C. neoformans is higher in patients with a history of traumatic injury, such as a mine explosion or a roadside accident. In this case, the patient’s history was complicated by recent trauma, and his condition was stable. This case showed that cyclophosphamide treatment can cause infections in the future.

In our study, patients with asthma and/or immunosuppressive diseases had a higher risk of infection by C. neoformans than those with other diseases (Table 4). The risk of infection was significantly higher in patients with asthma. The risk of infection by C. neoformans was higher in patients with non-malignant diseases, such as leukemia and lymphoma. The risk of infection by C. neoformans was higher in patients with other diseases. It is unclear whether these differences are due to differences in immunologic response, treatment protocol, or the use of AMB or cyclophosphamide therapy.

Cyclophosphamide treatment can be used in combination with AMB in patients with underlying diseases. However, it is not available in our setting. The risk of infection by C. neoformans was higher in patients with immune-suppressive conditions. All patients in our study received AMB in combination with AMB. We found that the risk of infection by C. neoformans was higher in patients with a history of asthma or immunosuppressive conditions, such as those with diabetes mellitus and asthma-associated conditions.
