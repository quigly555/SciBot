## Abstract
We report the first case of deptoriachytrophy of the Acanthamoeba species in South Africa, which is an emerging, Gram-positive fungal pathogen, associated with the consumption of larvae of the tick Pestalotiopsis maysabaensis (Musa aerea) by a female patient (Sabouraudella maysabaensis) and the patient's husband (Musa africana), which was reported to have been induced by exposure to Acanthamoeba cytotoxic T cell (Amb), cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CXCL), and anti-blast growth Nile Red antibodies (NGR) in vitro.

## Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.


## Results
The wheat yield, S_t, was used as the contro. The initial yields were determined by harvesting and pre-harvesting the wheat in the greenhouse. After harvesting, the S_t values for the two wheat varieties were compared. The S_t values were calculated for both the wheat varieties PDM and PDM-02. The highest S_t values were observed for the PDM-02 (0.39) and the PDM-03 (0.39) varieties PDM-02 and PDM-03, respectively. The PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were the most similar to each other in terms of yield and S_t values, while the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were more similar to each other than to each other. The PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were significantly different from each other in terms of S_t values (p<0.05) (Figure 3).

In addition to the S_t values, the S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were also calculated using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and LC-MS (Figure 3). The S_t values of the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were significantly different from each other, especially for the S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties. The S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were significantly different from each other for the chemical changes of the original PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties.

The S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were also calculated using the LC-MS and LC-MS (Figure 3). The S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were significantly different from each other for the chemical changes of the original PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties. The S_t values for the PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties were significantly different from each other for the chemical changes of the original PDM-02 and PDM-03 varieties.

## Discussion
We investigated the effects of transfer of the wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence in a semi-autoclaved plot of cornicultur. The analyses were carried out using two independent replicates with a clear genetic gradient in the wheat cultivar, a fixed number of cultivars and a minimal number of cultivars per plot. It was observed that transfer of the cultivar occurred at a faster rate than the other two crops, indicating that transfer of wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence was not random. It was observed that the transfer of the cultivar occurred at a higher rate than the other two crops, indicating that wheat cultivar transferred to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a higher rate than that of corn cultivar. The results demonstrated that the transfer of wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a faster rate than that of corn cultivar. Furthermore, wheat cultivar transferred to the cultivated potato fence did not have an effect on the fertility of the FFPE population. However, the transfer of wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a faster rate than that of corn cultivar. These results confirmed that wheat cultivar transferred to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a faster rate than that of corn cultivar.

The influence of wheat cultivar on the FFPE population was a strong one, as the wheat cultivar transferred its population to the cultivated potato fence. This population had a higher fertility and was fertile in the wheat cultivar. The difference in the population structure of the populations of the populations of the cultivars and the population of the cultivars with the wheat cultivar was found to be significant (P = 0.005). These results indicate that the transfer of the wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a faster rate than that of corn cultivar. However, the transfer of wheat cultivar to the cultivated potato fence occurred at a faster rate than that of corn cultivar. Therefore, the population of the FFPE population was biased towards the FFPE population, indicating that the population of the cultivars transferred to the potato fence was skewed towards the FFPE population. However, the population of the population transferred to the potato fence with the wheat cultivar was found to be less fertile than the population transferred to the potato fence with the corn cultivar.
