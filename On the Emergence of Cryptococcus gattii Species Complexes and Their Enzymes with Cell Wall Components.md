## Abstract
The presentation of eosinophilia varies significantly among various acute and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD). In some individuals, this pathology may be associated with allergies, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and organ transplantation. The present work describes a rare case of severe eosinophilia in a 35-year-old female who was treated with anti-nocita agents for refractory autoimmune hepatitis. The patient achieved a remarkable resolution after a prolonged course of anti-nocita therapy. The patient has a good immune function, including immune control, and is now doing well. This case highlights the need for a high degree of suspicion for the diagnosis of eosinophilic cases, particularly in the early stages of CLD.


## Introduction
.R.T. Suzuki and colleagues reported that the Cryptococcus gattii complex is composed of four major lineages, namely, the Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus neoformans, and C. deneoformans varieties. As a consequence, most of the available molecular tools are limited for this analysis, because of the ambiguity of their taxonomy. The Cryptococcus gattii complex consists of two closely related species, C. neoformans and C. deneoformans, which are also pathogenic to humans and animals, respectively. The Cryptococcus gattii complex consists of two distinct species, C. neoformans and C. deneoformans, which are phylogenetically distinct. The Cryptococcus gattii complex consists of two distinct species, C. bacillisporus and C. deutorum, which are pathogenic to immunocompromised patients and are endemic in temperate climates. Although the molecular phylogenetic relationships for the Cryptococcus gattii complex are not completely resolved, they are not only phylogenetically distant from the Cryptococcus neoformans and C. deneoformans species complexes, but also from the sibling species C. bacillisporus and C. deutorum, which are endemic to the Mediterranean region. The C. gattii complex consists of three major clades, namely, the C. neoformans and C. deneoformans species complexes (reviewed in [15]). The C. gattii complex is divided into four molecular types, namely C. neoformans, C. deneoformans, C. bacillisporus and C. deutorum [16]. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the molecular phylogenetic relationship of the Cryptococcus gattii complex to the other major molecular types, including C. neoformans and C. deneoformans, using the combined ITS, LSU, tef1 and rpb2 gene regions. The ITS region is the most conserved sequence of all the three molecular types, whereas the rpb2 gene was not studied in this study. In addition, we also investigated the phylogenetic relationships among the molecular types using three nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based phylogenetic analyses.


## Methods
Briefly, the cell wall was removed by immersing the cell suspensions in a solution of .1 M sucrose and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37°C for 1 h. The fungal cell walls were rinsed with distilled water and then placed in a 0.9% NaCl solution. The cell walls were then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and blocked with 0.15% Tween 20. The cell walls were then incubated with a monoclonal antibody against CD80 (1:1000), CD11c (1:1000), CD11b (1:1000), CD4 (1:1000), and CD25 (1:1000), and with a monoclonal antibody against CD11b (1:1000). The cell wall was then stained with anti-CD206 (1:1000) and anti-CD64 (1:1000), and the signals were detected using the fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51), and the fluorescence intensity was quantified by densitometry (DXM 10) using a Bio-Rad CFX manager (Bio-Rad). The Cryptococcus gattii proteins were identified by searching against the NCBI database using the Blastn program (version 2.4.5) and the C. gattii NCBI database with the Blastn program.

The strains isolated from infected and control mice were used for in-house experiments. For this, the strains were grown in liquid YPD at 30°C for 2 days, then harvested and washed in sterile distilled water, and then adjusted to 2 × 10^7 CFU/mL with PBS. The fungal cells were then inoculated into 200 mL of YPD at 30°C, and the number of CFU was determined after 48 h.

The human cell walls were harvested by filtration using a 10 mL syringe with a 27-gauge needle, as previously described (38). The cell wall samples were removed by centrifugation (15,000× g for 10 min), and the supernatant was stored at -20°C. The cell walls were then treated with 0.


## Results
anthracis contains more than 70% cellulase, selenolysis, and protease activities (Welch et a. 2011). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of enzymes that are involved in the degradation of plant cell walls and the synthesis of cellulases. The degradation of plant cell walls occurs by the cellulolytic enzymes cellulases I and II, and cellulases III, IV, and cellulases V (Welch et al. 2011). In addition, fungal cell wall degradation has been shown to occur in the presence of exogenous cellulase and proteases (Welch et al. 2011). Therefore, we analyzed the transcript levels of cellulase genes in the L. braziliensis mutant strain and the <U+0394>dcl1 mutant, which is unable to produce cellulases, in the presence of exogenous cell wall-derived cell wall-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes. The L. braziliensis mutant strain was grown in the presence of exogenous cell wall-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes to assess the expression of cellulases in the presence of exogenous cell wall-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes (Table 2). The results showed that the <U+0394>dcl1 mutant was unable to produce cellulases, even in the presence of exogenous cell wall-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes, indicating that the loss of cellulase activity is likely caused by the loss of cell wall-degrading enzymes in the L. braziliensis mutant strain. The L. braziliensis mutant strain was more sensitive to the exogenous cell wall-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes than the <U+0394>dcl1 mutant.

Transcription of Uncharacterized Genes Is Modulated by the Accumulation of Genes Involved in the Cell Wall, Protein, and Prokaryotic Cell Wall
The transcription of genes involved in cell wall-degrading enzymes and degradation is influenced by the expression of genes involved in the degradation of plant cell walls and the synthesis of cellulases (Welch et al. 2011). To investigate the transcription of genes that are involved in cell wall-degrading enzymes and degradation, we conducted gene expression analysis of the L. braziliensis mutant strain and the <U+0394>dcl1 mutant.


## Discussion
(2011) and the following authors have previously reviewed the genomes of . gattii and C. neoformans strains and reported that the bacterial lineages have significantly different proteomes: Staphylococcus aureus, Eschericha coli, Eschericha coli, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Rhodococcus glutamicus. Their analysis revealed that the genomes of these strains included a large number of genes with functions related to intracellular proteins, such as proteins with diverse substrates and substrates. These genes include genes encoding proteins with diverse chemical structures, such as glycosyl hydrolases, the alcohol dehydrogenase complex, glycosyl hydrolase, and glycosyl hydrolase family members (Chen et al., 2011). Furthermore, some of these genes are essential for cell viability, such as the C. neoformans cell wall ß-glucanase and ß-1,3-glucanase, which are important in maintaining cell wall integrity (Wang et al., 2013). Our analysis of these C. gattii and C. neoformans genomes showed that the C. gattii genome had a large number of genes involved in cell wall metabolism, including cell wall degradation and protein synthesis, and that the C. gattii genome had genes encoding proteins with diverse substrates, including proteins with diverse substrates, such as sugar and fatty acids and fatty acid metabolism, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes and fatty acid synthase and phospholipase, and genes encoding proteins with diverse substrate binding and transfer (Piwich et al., 2011).

The biosynthesis of cell wall components is regulated by various cell wall degrading enzymes and signaling pathways. The cell wall integrity was negatively regulated by the expression of several genes encoding cell wall degrading enzymes (Table S1). Among them, the cell wall-degrading enzymes TCA, peroxiredoxin, and glucan synthase were upregulated by the C. gattii strain and were downregulated by the C. neoformans strain (Table S2). These results suggested that cell wall-degrading enzymes and signaling pathways are involved in the stress response in C. gattii.
