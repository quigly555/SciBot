## Abstract
We compared the physico-chemical and pharmacological effects of voriconazole against Candida albicans. The primary efficacy of voriconazole was investigated. Voriconazole was found to have activity against C. albicans with the in vitro MIC values being 3.5 mg/mL. The secondary efficacy was a result of the in vivo responses to voriconazole. A decrease in the bioavailability of voriconazole by oral suspension was observed. Oral suspension containing 1.2 mg of each dose resulted in a much greater decrease in the systemic bioavailability of voriconazole compared to two doses of each dose. Overall, the results demonstrate that voriconazole is an effective and safe oral medication for treatment of candidiasis.


## Introduction
 1985; Govindappa, 2000; Liti et a., 2009) were isolated from the bark of Pinus corymbifera, Pinus edodes, Pinus lividus, Pinus araiosa, Pinus lividus, Pinus suberosa, Pinus mexicana, and Quercus norvegicus (Liti et al., 2009). Previous work has demonstrated that Pinus and Xenorhabdus are both taxa that belong to the subphylum Venturinellida (Hesseltinellaceae). In addition, in spite of the fact that these species are not included in the genus, they are important wood decay fungi that are known for their ability to produce a range of different compounds, including a range of bioactive compounds with antagonistic activities against different insects and plants (Eriksson and Bromley, 1994; Criscitiello and Morschh√§umann, 1995).

The genus Pinus includes around 500 species, which cause serious economic damage in timber, paper and pulp industry in many countries, including China (Liang et al., 2008). Approximately 80% of Pinus disease occur in tropical forests, with more than 250 species associated with Pinus diseases in temperate forests in the northern and southern hemispheres (Gupta et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2009). The disease symptoms can be visually observed in the early stage, followed by a progressive necrotrophic phase, followed by a necrotrophic phase and finally acute pharyngitis, the disease that occurs most commonly in tropical forests and shrubs, with high mortality and morbidity. The disease symptoms can be clinically indistinguishable from those of acute plant disease, as they mimic those of plant-parasitic fungi (Gupta et al., 2005). Although the disease symptoms can be visually distinguished from that of plant-parasitic fungi, they are not caused by fungal spores, but by the thermally dimorphic fungi.

The phytobiota of Pinus are highly represented among the various forest species in China, especially in the north-western and south-eastern regions of the country. Moreover, the phytopathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes disease in trees, is one of the main opportunistic pathogens, causing serious diseases in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals (Wang et al.

## Discussion

Accordingly, we have investigated the sexual morph and reproductive stages of . nodorum, and the results are in accordance with previous studies (Kaneko et al., 2011). In this study, we identified two hypha-inhabiting fruiting structures in P. nodorum (Fig 3a). These fruiting structures were similar to those of Diliatia and Xenorhabdus, and they were also identified in the phylogenetically distant species Diliatia toruloides and Diliatia aceris (Chi et al., 2007; Faria et al., 2014). A distinct mating-type transition was also observed in the sexual morph of P. nodorum (Fig 3b). Our data showed that P. nodorum has a mating-type transition, and this is in accordance with the same observations of Diliatia toruloides (Chi et al., 2007). The hypha-inhabiting fruiting structures are similar to those of P. phyllostereum, which has a sexual morph in which hyphae are formed from anastomosed hypha (Gao et al., 2015).

In this study, we found that the fruiting structures were similar to those of Diliatia and Xenorhabdus, and they were also identified in the phylogenetically distant species Diliatia toruloides and Diliatia aceris (Chi et al., 2007). These two species are closely related to each other. P. phyllostereum was also found in the same fruiting structures (Fig 3b). The morphology of P. phyllostereum is similar to that of Diliatia toruloides and Diliatia aceris, and it is similar to those of Diliatia and Xenorhabdus (Fig 3c). A similar arrangement of fruiting structures was found in the mating-type transition of P. phyllostereum in a study by Faria et al. (2014).

The current study has shown that P. nodorum, Diliatia, and Xenorhabdus were morphologically and phylogenetically distinct species. These species are closely related to each other, and they may be distinguished from each other based on the phylogenetic analysis.
