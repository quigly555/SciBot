## Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics has become an important global issue, and the search for alternatives is therefore of key importance. In this study, we tested the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic extract of Candida krusei against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that it had a strong antifungal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 1.83 and 6.8 µg/mL.


## Introduction
Fungal keratitis can be classified into the following disorders: keratitis of the nails and nails/nails, keratitis of the face and mouth, and nail or nail infection. [1] In the case of infectious conditions, the epidemiology of the fungal keratitis may be more complex. There have been numerous reports of infections by fungi of the nails and nails (Table 1). In addition, there are cases in which infections occur by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts.


## Methods
The compounds were synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae according to the method described by Wu and Liew, with slight modifications (Table 2.

3.4. Bacterial Strains
Bacteria belonging to the Bacillus genus (Table 2) were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Difco, BD-Becton, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 30 °C for 48 h in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm. Subsequently, the cultures were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The supernatant (5 mL) was transferred to a screw-cap tube and the supernatant was kept at -20 °C for 24 h, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed with sterile PBS and the pellet was re-suspended in sterile PBS. The bacterial concentration was adjusted to 5 × 10^6 CFU/mL. Then, the cell culture was diluted to the turbidity of the test organisms by 10^6 CFU/mL. For the determination of the MICs, a sterile cotton swab was inserted into the bacterial culture and was swabbed on the test organisms.

3.5. Bacterial Strains
Bacteria belonging to the Bacillus genus (Table 2) were cultured on PDA (Difco, BD-Becton, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 30 °C for 24 h in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.


## Results
Identification of the rpb2-encoding gene
In S. cerevisiae, the rpb2 gene encodes the N-terminal signal peptide for protein folding (Rodriguez et al., 2013). We first searched for rpb2 protein sequence in the rpb2-encoding S. cerevisiae genome sequence database and identified a rpb2 gene in S. cerevisiae (Figure 1). The S.


## Discussion
The current state of knowledge regarding this mechanism is limited by the lack of experimental data [16] and the lack of an N-(4-methylthio(methylsulfonyl) R) oligomeric transferase, and thus is not practical to synthesize itraconazole and 1,3,4-glucan-4-one. The best-available experimental data for this fungus are based on screening the enzyme activity of C. neoformans and its ability to synthesize itraconazole and 1,3,4-glucan-4-ones. However, the enzyme activity of the enzyme isolated in this study is consistent with a model that would be applicable to C. neoformans.

The expected amounts of isolated the a-1,3,4-glucan-4-ones in the C. neoformans medium at pH 8.5 and pH 5.2 were 2.0, 1.3, 2.2, 3.0, 4.6, 5.3, and 6.4 µg/mL, respectively. The enzyme activity of the enzyme isolated in this study was in agreement with the literature [16], where it showed an expected activity of 1,3,4-glucan-4-ones with a specific activity of 45% and an expected activity of 1,3,4-glucan-4-ones with a specific activity of 70% and an expected activity of 2,4-glucan-4-ones with a specific activity of 75%. The observed values were 1.3 µg/mL and 2.2 µg/mL, respectively. The activity of the enzyme isolated in this study was in accordance with the literature, where the enzyme activity of C. neoformans was in agreement with the literature [16]. In the same manner, the activity of the enzyme isolated in this study was in agreement with the literature, where the enzyme activity of C. neoformans was in agreement with the literature [16]. The expected amounts of the enzyme isolated in this study were 1.3 µg/mL and 1.6 µg/mL, respectively.

The enzyme isolated in this study was the product of the synthesis of the diterpene dihydroxylation of lanosterol with the lactone ring of the glycosidic linkage, which is known as the cytochrome P450 complex [16].
