## Abstract
We report a case of a 55-year-old HIV-infected female with recurrent fever, mycotic mastitis, and endophthalmitis concurrent with unmasking papilloedial lesions on histopathology. She was a post-menopausal female who regularly denied hormone replacement and corticosteroid use. She was a nonresidentsively diagnosed post-menopausal pregnancy, exogamous pregnancy, and endophthalmitis with marked papilloedema and endophthalmitis followed. She presented with pyrexia, followed by papilloedema and/or endophthalmitis. Histopathology was consistent with papilloedema/mastalgia with pyrexia. She was treated with fluconazole and later had endophthalmitis followed by antifungal therapy. Her skin lesions minimized and she was well.

This case illustrates the complexity of post-menopausal reproductive history and challenges our understanding of endophthalmitis.


## Introduction
The formation of the peptidoglycan via the oxidation of lanosterol rather than glutathione (GlcN) is essential for their antimicrobial activity (Amich 1985. The mechanism of action of the antifungal drug FLZA against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata has been studied (Amich 1985). However, its mechanism of action has been unclear. The compound is able to inhibit the growth of other fungi and has broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Therefore, the mechanism of action of FLZA was suggested. The antifungal activity of FLZA against Candida albicans was reported in the context of its significant antifungal activity against C. albicans (Amich 1985). The present work aimed to further elucidate the mechanism of action of FLZA and its related compounds against C. albicans.

FLZA has been shown to be effective against Candida albicans in vitro and in vivo (Amich 1985). However, the clinical and in vivo data of FLZA against C. albicans are limited. We have taken the opportunity to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antifungal efficacy of FLZA. In this study, we have demonstrated that FLZA is effective in vitro against C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro antifungal activity of FLZA against C. albicans was found to be similar to that of azoles and has been studied in depth. Moreover, we have shown that this compound exhibits potent antifungal activity against the most clinically relevant and extensively studied species of Candida. In vitro antifungal activity by FLZA against the most clinically relevant and extensively studied species of Candida was found to be in the same range as that of azoles. However, the significant differences in the antifungal activity between the two drugs were not substantiated by the data obtained. In vivo antifungal activity by FLZA against C. albicans and C. glabrata was found to be comparable to that of azoles.


## Methods
For antimicrobial activities, the most active agents were defined as compounds with MIC value greater than or equal to .5 µg/ml, except for the sterol profile and the concentration. Sterol profiles were determined by incubating pure cultures of the fungus on Sabouraud-Dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 30 °C. The fungal cultures were harvested, washed with sterile distilled water and stored at -20 °C.

For the antimicrobial activity, the best-performing antimicrobial compounds were defined as those with MIC value greater than or equal to 1 µg/ml. Sterol profiles were determined by incubating pure cultures of the fungus on SDA (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 30 °C. The fungal cultures were harvested, washed with sterile distilled water and stored at -20 °C.

For the antifungal activities, the best-performing antimicrobial compounds were defined as those with MIC value greater than or equal to 1 µg/ml. Sterol profiles were determined by incubating pure cultures of the fungus on SDA (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 30 °C. The fungal cultures were harvested, washed with sterile distilled water and stored at -20 °C.

For the antibacterial activity, the best-performing antimicrobial compounds were defined as those with MIC value greater than or equal to 0.25 µg/ml. Sterol profiles were determined by incubating pure cultures of the fungus on SDA (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) at 30 °C. The fungal cultures were harvested, washed with sterile distilled water and stored at -20 °C.

To evaluate the effects of C. albicans on human colon adenocarcinoma (CAL) sensitivity, a test group of 100 healthy individuals was subjected to an in vivo testing of C. albicans strains (n = 80) and a control group of individuals without C. albicans colonies. All test procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (formerly known as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals), and all animals were handled according to the guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (ALARAC).

## Discussion

The synthesis of pyrrolidine by pyrrolidine kinase (PKC) is critical for the synthesis of pyrrolidine and pyrimidine from pyrimidine to pyrimidine, thus, it is necessary to synthesize the second-line compound. In order to accomplish the synthesis of pyrimidine, a pyrimidine synthase enzyme is required to synthesize the second-line compounds [10].

2.2. Synergistic Effect of the three Pyrimidine Synthesis Facilitators on P. expansum H1
To further enhance the pyrimidine synthesis, a mixture of pyrimidine and pyrimidine was prepared as described in the Materials and Methods section. The pyrimidine mixture was prepared by mixing pyrimidine and pyrimidine together and then the resulting mixture was purified and analyzed by GC-MS. The results are shown in Table 1. The result showed that the combined pyrimidine and pyrimidine prepared combination produced a compound that is very potent and exhibits high efficacy. The combination of pyrimidine and pyrimidine resulted in the synthesis of a compound that is very potent and has significant activity. Compounds 5a-5b of the pyrimidine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway were synthesized and purified in the same order as the previous results. The compound 5c was also prepared and purified in the same order as the previous results. The structure of the compound 5c was verified by the ^1H-NMR and the ^13C-NMR spectra of the compounds and the spectra of compounds 5a-5b were identified.

The pyrimidine and pyrimidine compounds were combined and the corresponding carboxylic group was identified as p-nitrophenyl-3,4,5-trihydroxy-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2,6-trien-3,8-dione (Figure 2). The ^1H-NMR spectrum of the compound 5c showed a signal for the carboxylic group, and the ^13C-NMR spectrum of the compound 5c showed signals for the carboxylic group. The molecular formula of compound 5c was determined and the molecular formula of compound 5c was established.
