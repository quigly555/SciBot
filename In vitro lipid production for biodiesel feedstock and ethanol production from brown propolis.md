## Abstract
The fungal cell wall is a formidable structure that supports a variety of cellular functions. The cell walls of fungi are composed primarily of polysaccharides and participate in maintaining genetic diversity. However, the factors that govern cell wall composition in fungi are still largely unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the roles of several transcription factors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) factors as well as the cell wall polysaccharides themselves in the fungal genome. We found that the number of transcription factors, gene expression levels, and surface composition in the genomes of Fusarium graminearum, the most widely propagated filamentous fungus in the kingdom, were all significantly altered in this fungus. The changes were dependent on different developmental stages of the fungus, and were largely driven by transcription factors.


## Introduction
Therefore, the global demand for oil is not expected to exceed that of petroleum fuel and the price of oil is expected to rise in order to meet the global energy demand.

Low-cost carbon sources such as lignocellulosic biomass and biofuels are attractive carbon sources for biodiesel production. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable biomass that is used in a large number of industrial processes, including the synthesis of aromatic alcohols, lignin and polylignocellulosic biomass (Forgetta et al., 2012). The lignin, polysaccharides and cellulose are the major components of the cellulose matrix, which are used for oil transportation, and thus, lignocellulosic biomass is a promising carbon source for biodiesel production (Forgetta et al., 2012).

Bioethanol is produced from various types of natural gas, such as natural gas from natural gas (Kaur and Manik, 2014), natural propane and gasoline, natural ethyl acetate, and synthetic ethyl acetate, which is produced by steam distillation of petroleum and vegetable oils. Bioethanol is a gasoline product, which is used as a gasoline improver, an ingredient of many gasoline improver, and a gasoline additive in many gasoline additive production systems (Liguori et al., 2006). In the United States, bioethanol is a gasoline improver and an ingredient of several gasoline additive production systems, including the gasoline improver and the gasoline additive additive additive. Bioethanol production from natural gas is expected to increase over the next 10 years from a level of 2.5 million barrels per day by the adoption of the Paris climate agreement and is projected to reach 20 million barrels per day by 2025 (Brown et al., 2009).


## Methods
Feedstocks were produced in the same manner, except that the feedstocks were diluted with distilled water to a concentration of 2% (w/v) and then blended with the Bf1 glucose-distilled water, which was used as a working contro. Then, Bf1 and Bf2 were also tested with Bf1 and Bf2, respectively, in order to determine the fatty acid content. Bf1 and Bf2 were also tested with Bf1 and Bf2, respectively, in order to determine the lipid content.

Biodiesel production for biodiesel feedstocks and ethanol production from brown propolis
Biodiesel feedstocks (bWF) and ethanol were produced using the same media as in the test. Then, Bf1 and Bf2 were also tested with Bf1 and Bf2, respectively, in order to determine the fatty acid content. Bf1 and Bf2 were also tested with Bf1 and Bf2, respectively, in order to determine the lipid content.

The fermentation liquid (vegetable oil) was used for the assays and the final amount of biodiesel was defined as the final amount of biodiesel used. The final biodiesel content was calculated using the following equation:

2% biodiesel (w/v)

3% biodiesel (w/v)

4% biodiesel (w/v)

5% biodiesel (w/v)

The final biodiesel product was defined as a product with a final lipid content of 33% (w/v) and a final biodiesel product was defined as a product with a lipid content of 31% (w/v) and a final biodiesel product was defined as a product with a lipid content of 31% (w/v).


## Results
brasiliensis in the production of lipid by . brasiliensis, crude oil (Pb01) and propolis (Pb05) were pretreated with different lipid extraction procedures (Figure 3). For biodiesel, Pb01 was able to hydrolyze the oil, which is similar to that reported by Nodoye et al. (2008). In the Pb01 oil, the crude oil extract was dissolved in the ethanol extract of the ethanol extract, and the lipid fraction was then extracted with the solvent extraction technique. The crude oil extract was dissolved in the ethanol extract of the ethanol extract of the oil extraction technique, and the lipid fraction was then dissolved in the solvent extraction method. The results showed that Pb01 crude oil extract was significantly more lipid produced than the crude oil extract (Table 1).

Pb01 crude oil extract production in industrial applications
The oil yield of Pb01 crude oil extract was approximately 20% of the crude oil yield, which was higher than that of the commercial product, non-dimethyl alcohol (NAD) (Figure 4). According to the results from the biotechnological evaluation, the oil yield of Pb01 crude oil extract was approximately 20% of the crude oil yield, which was higher than that of the commercial product, non-dimethyl alcohol (NAD) (Figure 4). Based on the results from the biotechnological evaluation, the oil yield of Pb01 crude oil extract was approximately 20% of the crude oil yield, which was higher than that of the commercial product, NAD (Figure 5). Based on the results from the biotechnological evaluation, the oil yield of Pb01 crude oil extract was approximately 20% of the crude oil yield, which was higher than that of the commercial product, NAD (Figure 5).

## Discussion
coli and a different strain of . faecalis resulted in the production of 32.9% and 48.9% of CO_2, respectively (Table 2). The highest yield was obtained in the L-DOPA-based bioreactor with an initial CO_2 concentration of 6.9 g/L. The low yields in the L-DOPA-based bioreactor also reflect the higher bioreactor temperature required in the initial bioreactor. The maximum yield was achieved in the L-DOPA-based bioreactor with an initial CO_2 concentration of 4.3 g/L. The highest yield was achieved in the L-DOPA-based bioreactor with an initial CO_2 concentration of 6.2 g/L. The highest yield was obtained in the L-DOPA-based bioreactor with an initial CO_2 concentration of 5.6 g/L.
