## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the profile of fungal communities and the use of light microscopy in the evaluation of the skin regeneration efficacy of itraconazole. A total of 107 skin regeneration patients aged between 35 and 75 years participated in this study. Dark-UVAR friendly microscopy was performed on skin regeneration products to explore the influence of light on the growth of fungal communities. The results showed that the fungal community of the skin regenerated in all patients was dominated by Aspergillus (17-31%), Candida (7-30%), and Cryptococcus (5.5%). The fungal community of the skin was significantly reduced in patients with older age and higher BMI. Aspergillus spp. communities were found in 57.9% and Cryptococcus spp. communities in 28.1% of the patients. The highest percentage of Aspergillus spp. communities was found in older age and lower BMI, suggesting that older age may influence the growth of fungal communities.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The number of currently available antifungal agents is limited and thus, new antifungal agents are needed. Fungi with well-defined virulence traits are highly diversified and can be classified as those with leishmanicidal, fungicidal, and/or cytotoxic properties, while those with non-leishmanicidal and/or/or/termed non-leishmanicidal properties are referred to as secondary pathogen species. Primary cutaneous fungal infections are often asymptomatic; however, they can be severe disseminated infections, typically in the absence of other clinical indications, and can also occur in immunocompromised patients.

Primary cutaneous fungal infections (PCLI) are associated with high mortality rates and high morbidity rates in both humans and non-human primates. [1-4] Infection with Cryptococcus neoformans occurs by inhalation and is usually found in patients with cystic fibrosis, organ transplantation, or in patients on immunosuppressive treatment. [5-8] In contrast, disseminated cryptococcosis, in which the fungus is present in the lung, is caused by Cryptococcus spp.


## Methods
mazo.com/gp/product/science/gpid/) and exported into Excel. The protein sequences were aligned and the best-fit model of amino acid substitutions was selected by maximum likelihood (ML) and bootstrap values of 100.

The maximum likelihood model was then used to calculate the approximate likelihood (ML) of the best-fit model of amino acid substitutions. The ML analysis was performed using the program RAxML (http://www.raxml.org/) and was run with four incrementally heated simultaneous Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) run for 10 000 000 generations, the first 20 000 generations were discarded as ‘burn-in’. The first 10 000 generations were run with a burn-in setting of 10% and the remaining 20 000 generations were used for phylogenetic analyses. The MCMC analysis was done in the same way but using the ‘sim’ approach. The MCMC chains were run for 10 000 000 generations and the first 20 000 generations were discarded as ‘burn-in‘. The remaining 50 000 generations were used for phylogenetic analyses. The MCMC analyses were run with ‘sim’ as default parameter and were run for 1 million generations. The final tree was generated by the ‘tree.py’ script of the ‘sim’ run. The model was determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3.2 [55].

Gene replacement
The gene replacement method used in this study was implemented in the Trinity method [56]. The best-fit model of amino acid substitution for each amino acid substitution was determined by maximum likelihood (ML) and bootstrap values of 100.

The molecular size
The molecular size of the proteins in this study was calculated from the difference between the mean and the standard deviation of the longest amino acid residues. The homologous gene replacement model was used to calculate the size of the amino acid residues by the distance between the longest amino acid residues and the longest protein residues. The optimal protein size was determined by the formula, where amino acids are the shortest amino acid residues, and the longest protein residues are the longest amino acid residues in the alignment.

The gene copy number
The gene copy number was calculated by dividing the length of the longest protein residues by the length of the longest protein residues. The maximum gene copy number was determined by dividing the length of the longest protein residues by the length of the longest protein residues.


## Results
The pharmacokinetics of tricyclazole in mice
The pharmacokinetics of tricyclazole were measured in mice intravenously at the end of the experiment. The pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 1. The median time of the first dose was 24 h. The plasma concentrations of tricyclazole in the mice were: IC_50 (µg/ml) < 0.2 µg/ml; MIC_80 (µg/ml), 0.8 µg/ml; MIC_50 (µg/ml), 0.4 µg/ml; MIC_50 (µg/ml), 0.2 µg/ml. The mean plasma concentrations of tricyclazole in the mice were: IC_50 (µg/ml) < 0.2 µg/ml; MIC_80 (µg/ml), 0.4 µg/ml; MIC_50 (µg/ml), 0.2 µg/ml.


## Discussion

Signal Transcription Factor (SRE) and its Role in the Stress Response
The recent finding that . albicans <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB is more resistant to phagocytosis by macrophages and macrophages [56] and the high cell mortality observed in patients with this strain suggests that SRE is involved in the stress response to the C. albicans strain, and could be exploited to develop an effective strategy to inhibit the growth of this fungus in the human body.

In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate that, in addition to a decrease in the cell viability, a decrease in the SRE activity was observed in the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strains. A decrease in the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strain's SRE activity was also observed, but it was only detectable when the strain was grown on glucose, indicating that the cell viability is affected by the glucose consumption and not by the ethanol consumption. These data corroborate with the results from a recent study conducted on yeast cell viability, where the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strain was viable on glucose, but when the strain was grown on ethanol, they were viable, albeit less than the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strains. The cell viability of the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strain was also decreased, while the <U+0394>dclA strain was increased in SRE activity, indicating that the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strain is viable. The SRE activity of the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strain was decreased compared to the <U+0394>dclA and <U+0394>dclB strains.
