## Abstract
The Treg cell of pathogens is a dynamic organelle that constantly encounters an expansion of microbicidal molecules. These molecules are often driven by cytotoxic factors that are well established in the innate immune response. Moreover, other cell types have evolved in which the Treg cell has evolved to control the growth and biofilm formation of pathogenic microorganisms. However, the key role of the cytosolic Treg cell in the pathogenesis of many bacterial infections remains unclear.

We found that a dysregulation of the cytosolic Treg cell in the highly virulent strain of Aspergillus fumigatus leads to the rapid decline in respiratory and gastrointestinal tract carriage and is associated with loss of virulence. We observed that the cytosolic Treg cell was also required for virulence attenuation via downregulating IL-12p40. Downregulation of IL-12p40 was dependent on the Treg cell activating a T-cell-mediated pathogenicity-related cytokine, IL-10, as well as the Treg cell’s Fc<U+03B3>-<U+03B3>t to activate a protective immune response against a Candida albicans infection. The role of the Treg cell in infection control was also assessed by measuring the growth and survival of A. fumigatus conidia in the BALB/c mice.

This study revealed that the cytosolic Treg cell in the highly virulent A. fumigatus isolate B10.CC was significantly depleted of cytosolic Treg cells and was also significantly decreased in survival when compared with the BALB/c control group. The absence of Treg cells contributed to the virulence attenuation caused by the bacterium, while the growth inhibition, as well as the downregulation of Fc<U+03B3>t, were necessary for the protective immune response. These data suggest that the Treg cell is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of highly virulent A. fumigatus isolates.

## Introduction
Amino acids are essential precursors in living organisms and are essential for many biochemical reactions (Hoch, 2011). They are both neutral, and in some cases also, co-catalytic substrates for lipids (Bousquet et al., 2006). Their primary functions are: (a) to synthesize fatty acids (FBAS) in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (Bousquet et al., 2006; Boidin and Hunter, 2009), and (b) to assemble lipid precursors, such as ceramide (Cer) and mannitol (Mn) (Cox et al., 2010). Since the first description of the Mn-Mn interaction in the mammalian organism, several Mn-Mn interactions have been described. The best-studied example is the interaction between the Mn-Mn and ceramide-Mn complexes on the surface of the T. cruzi pathogen A. nidulans (Boland et al., 1986). Mn-Mn interactions have been reported in other organisms, e.g., in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sakamoto et al., 1994; de Nadal et al., 1996; Pirba et al., 2001; Pirba et al., 2003; Wang and Li, 2006), in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Wang et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2014), and in the pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (Guan and Xie, 2015). Here, we present an in vitro Mn-Mn interaction involving the lipid CpG motif and the catalytic agent CpGdn from the pathogen C. albicans.


## Methods
For this purpose, a variety of virulent pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans, . krusei, and Aspergillus niger, were considered here. An infected cell line (C. neoformans) was used as a source of infected cells and C. neoformans was used as a source of infected cells. Infected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS at 37°C for 24 h and serially diluted in the medium. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Cell numbers were determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions of cells in the same medium. The number of infected cells was compared with the number of uninfected cells. Infected cells with more than two numbers of infected cells were considered as non-infected cells, and non-infected cells with fewer than three cells were considered as infected cells.

To identify the significant differences in virulence between viruses, we performed a two-tailed Student t-test for multiple comparisons. All experiments were conducted in duplicate, and repeated at least twice.

The antagonistic activity of the drugs was investigated by measuring the inhibitory activity of the drug as described previously [50]. Briefly, each drug was administered to different animals in a single dose and the animals were administered on the same day. The groups of drugs were as follows: benzalkonium chloride (0.5 mg/kg); amphotericin B (0.25 mg/kg); and bafilomycin A (0.25 mg/kg). The vehicle (5 mg/kg) and the non-inoculum (5 mg/kg) were used as the controls. The drug was given with the same volume as the control. The experimental design was as follows: a 0-2-fold difference in virulence of the tested viruses was performed. A group of animals (V) was treated with 0.25 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg of bafilomycin A, while the control group (N) was treated with the non-inoculum of bafilomycin A.


## Results
neoformans va. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans in the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis (Figure 1).

In order to evaluate the impact of phytopathogens on virulence of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans in the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis, we examined the virulence of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans in the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis using the murine model of cryptococcosis. In contrast to the mouse model, the C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans models of systemic cryptococcosis were not shown to cause any deaths, and were able to protect the mice from the fungal infection (Figure 2). In contrast to the murine model, the C. neoformans var. grubii model of systemic cryptococcosis caused no significant mortality, and only a small percentage of the mice survived the infection (Figure 2).

In order to evaluate the effects of phytopathogens on fungal pathogenesis, we analyzed the virulence of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans in the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis using the murine model of cryptococcosis. In contrast to the murine model, the C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans models of systemic cryptococcosis were able to cause no mortality, and were able to protect the mice from the fungal infection (Figure 3).

We also compared the virulence of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans in the murine model of cryptococcosis using the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis. The fungal burden in the mouse model of systemic cryptococcosis was found to be significantly higher than that in the murine model of systemic cryptococcosis (p<0.0001) (Figure 4).


## Discussion
We used a screening approach to determine the quality of data obtained from a prospective prospective cohort study of adult HIV patients in sub-Saharan Africa. We used the resource-based guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Society of Humanities (ASH) to develop a quality-of-life management tool for adult HIV patients in sub-Saharan Africa. This tool was not designed to predict the quality of care in the community; rather, our goal was to identify gaps in quality-of-life management for this cohort of HIV-infected adults.

Several limitations of our approach are highlighted. First, the quality-of-life management tool used in this study was only designed to identify gaps in care delivery. This approach could have identified more primary outcomes, which would have provided more accurate estimates of the quality of care, but we used a programmatic model in which the data were collected from the outpatient clinic and from the regional health centers. This model did not capture the cost-effectiveness of primary care in the community, which is likely to vary substantially from resource to resource. Furthermore, the model did not accurately capture all primary outcomes and it is possible that some of the primary outcomes may be missed. Finally, data on primary outcomes for our cohort were derived from only a small number of patients, which is consistent with previous reports that there is a lack of a systematic evaluation of the impact of primary care in developing countries. This study included data from the provincial health centres, but this did not capture all the primary outcomes and thus, the assessment of the impact of primary care is based on regional data. This study did not examine the impact of primary care in developing countries.

The design of the quality-of-life management tool used in this study was designed to identify gaps in care delivery. We utilized data from the tertiary hospitals and the outpatient clinics in which the study was conducted. We evaluated the impact of primary care in developing countries, including Uganda, as a pilot study.
