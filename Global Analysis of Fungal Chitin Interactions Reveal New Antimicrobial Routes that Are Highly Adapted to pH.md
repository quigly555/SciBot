## Abstract
The recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health and well-being. Whole genome resequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified a small number of genes whose expression has been strongly influenced by environmental stressors. These stress-responsive genes are responsible for their adaptation to stress and for their susceptibility to treatment. For example, stress-responsive genes are expressed in the human red blood cells, which are able to kill them. This resistance can be suppressed by environmental cues. For example, S. cerevisiae cells are able to survive heat stress, which is a direct consequence of overexpression of several stress-responsive genes. In this review, we discuss the differences of S. cerevisiae among pathogenic bacteria and fungi, and the importance of the expression of several genes in resistance to heat and oxidative damage in bacteria and fungi. Finally, we highlight the possible use of S.


## Introduction
Fungal cells are extracellular and intracellular, and they can survive and proliferate at the cell membrane (1, 2). A special compartment, the outer layer, is responsible for the internalization of fungal cells. The outer layer is mainly composed of chitin and glucans, and its extracellular space is mainly composed of proteins and lipids (3). Inside the cell, the cell wall is composed of many different protein components: ß-glucan, chitin, chitosan, mannoproteins, glycoproteins, and chitooligomers, whose synthesis and folding has been reviewed by Dib and colleagues (4). The membrane composition of fungal cells is determined by several factors, such as cell wall composition, cell morphology, cell growth, and lipid composition (5).

The cell wall is composed of two main components: a polysaccharide matrix and a lipid matrix.


## Methods
. Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions
The F. graminearum strain W303 was routinely grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C for 18 h. The mycelium was harvested by centrifugation, washed in sterile distilled water, and frozen at -20°C. Fungal mycelium was ground using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen.

2.2. Preparation of Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions
Cultures of F. graminearum were prepared according to the methods of Reddy et al. [19] with slight modifications. For the preparation of the cultures, the mycelium was thawed, and a 10 mL sample was taken from the top. Then, 1.0 mL of a 0.25% w/w (w/w) methanol solution was added and mixed. Then, 1.0 mL of 0.25% w/w was added and mixed. Then, the mixture was shaken on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) for 16 h, and then it was transferred to a new medium and shaken. The mycelium was crushed using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Then, the solid portion was carefully removed and the mycelium was preserved in liquid nitrogen. The mycelium was collected in two vials, and the suspension was filtered by Miracloth (Merck, Germany) and used for inoculations in sterile sterile distilled water.

2.3. Phytotoxic Activity Testing
Phytotoxic activity of F. graminearum strain W303 was determined using the method of Jackson et al. [20].


## Results
We previously reported that the . cerevisiae S288A strain grew well at pH-sensitive pH, and at pH-plus-plus pH, even at the highest pH tested (1.3), and the S. pombe S288A strain grew robustly at pH-sensitive pH, but was severely attenuated at pH-plus-plus pH (20). The growth and pH-modulatory activity of the S288A strain were both pH-sensitive and pH-responsive (20). To study the potential impact of pH-sensitive pH on the S. pombe chitin degradation pathways, we generated a S288A strain with both pH-sensitive and pH-responsive S. pombe chitin degradation pathway (Fig 1B). After 48 h of growth, chitin and chitin-1-phosphate levels in the S288A strain were approximately 2-fold and 2.5-fold higher than in the wild-type strain, respectively, after 60 h of growth at pH-sensitive pH (Fig 1B). This pH-sensitive chitin-1-phosphate was ~2-fold higher than in the wild-type strain, but not in the S288A strain (Fig 1B). The pH-responsive chitin-1-phosphate, which is a dominant compound in our chitin-1-phosphate pathway, was 2-fold higher in the S288A strain than in the wild-type strain, and this was the highest in the wild-type strain (Fig 1B). As chitin-1-phosphate is an essential component of the cell wall (21), chitin-1-phosphate production in the S288A strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain in all three pH-sensitive conditions (Fig 1B). The chitin-1-phosphate content in the S288A strain was lower than that of the wild-type strain, but the S. pombe chitin-1-phosphate content was ~4-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain, and the S.


## Discussion
This is in contrast to fungi such as . cerevisiae, which is able to metabolize chitin but not chitosan. Nevertheless, it is also possible that yeast species with lower chitin content could produce more chitosan as a result of a lower temperature tolerance. This has been shown to be a risk for fungal pathogens in that fungi have evolved distinct strategies for utilizing chitin, including the use of chitin-inducing compounds such as chitin synthase inhibitors [32].

Fungal species with higher chitin content were found in both in vitro and in vivo chitin concentrations. In both of the studies, yeast species contained higher amounts of chitin than filamentous species. As chitin is thought to be a secondary structure of chitin, a higher chitin concentration should be necessary to maintain chitin levels in the cell [33]. As such, lower chitin concentrations in this study could be explained by a higher chitin content in filamentous species, although we did not have access to this structure in the cell. In fact, chitin is a very important structure in fungi, which is thought to be enriched in secreted proteins [34]. In this study, we found that fungi without chitin also contain chitin and that chitin is enriched in yeasts. This is consistent with previous studies that found fungi lacking chitin also contain chitin [21].

The lower concentrations of chitin observed in vitro may be due to the overall high solubility of the chitin in the cell, which may affect the activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of chitin. In addition to chitin, we also found that there is a higher concentration of chitin in the cell, which could be a result of the low solubility of chitin in this cell. In addition, we found that filamentous fungi were able to metabolize chitin but not chitosan, which is known to be produced by these fungi. This is in contrast to yeast species with a higher chitin content. Yeasts are able to synthesize more chitin than filamentous fungi.
