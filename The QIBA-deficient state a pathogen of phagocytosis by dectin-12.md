## Abstract
Intracellular pathogens can exploit diverse host-imposed barriers to establish infection. Here we describe the interactions between the opportunistic pathogens Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida auris, and the most prevalent species in the human gut, Candida tropicalis. C. albicans occupies the epithelial lining of the urogenital tract and the placental barrier and is the causative agent of candidiasis, while C. glabrata colonizes the intestinal milieu of mammals. Both C. albicans and C. auris are more aggressive toward mammalian cells with an acridine orange infusion, whereas C. tropicalis attacks by growing on human spleen. Yeast two-hybrid analysis identifies several genes that are important for the pathogenicity of these two species. We find that Candida auris is more aggressive toward mammalian cells with a glycerol decarboxylase inhibitor than C. albicans. To understand the host response to C. albicans, we used next-generation sequencing and genetic screens to identify specific regulatory proteins that are important for the antagonism of C. auris with mammalian cells. In contrast to C. albicans, the yeast genome contains a large number of transcription factors that are dispensable for the antagonism of C. auris.


## Introduction
Infections caused by different bacteria can be very different from those caused by the same organism. The main organisms are Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are all capable of infecting different skin and soft tissue infections. A. fumigatus is the most common species, and is often found in association with a variety of substances, including nails and mucus, and is a major cause of infections in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. In addition, A. fumigatus is a frequent cause of pneumonia and meningitis in humans, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis [1].

The main pathogenic agents of S. aureus, A. fumigatus, and C. albicans are yeasts, which can be divided into two groups according to their cell wall structure.


## Methods

.6. Strain Construction
The strain with the phenotypes of the QIBA-deficient state a pathogen of phagocytosis was constructed by the use of the pBluescript II vector, which contained the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively. The XhoI-HindIII fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers XhoI-HindIII-F and XhoI-HindIII-R, and cloned into pBluescript II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The HindIII-HindIII fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers HindIII-HindIII-F and HindIII-HindIII-R, and cloned into pBluescript II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The XhoI-HindIII-R and XhoI-HindIII-R fragments were sequenced by XhoI-HindIII-R and XhoI-HindIII-R, respectively, to ensure the correct insertion of the correct mutation in the XhoI-HindIII fragment, respectively.

2.7. A. fumigatus Transformation
The A. fumigatus strain Af293 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The A. fumigatus conidia were obtained by growing the conidia in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 7 days. The mycelia were harvested by filtration through sterile Miracloth (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the mycelia were washed twice with sterile distilled water. The mycelia were ground with liquid nitrogen. The mycelia were resuspended in sterile distilled water and mixed with sterile pestle and mortar. The mixture was then homogenized in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a 200 µL C-18 rotor (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) by homogenization with a motor pump and a needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant was used as the template for the transformation of the A. fumigatus strain Af293. The A.


## Results

The human PBMC and BMDM are phagocytosed by a human pathogen
PBMC from phagocytosed . neoformans JEC21 and BMDM were used to assess the pathogenicity of the QIBA-deficient strain on BMDMs. The QIBA-deficient strain was also phagocytosed by BMDMs from PBMC from JEC21 and BMDM from BMDMs from JEC22. The QIBA-deficient strain exhibited higher virulence than the wild-type strain (Figure 2A). These data indicate that QIBA-deficient cells are more efficient in killing C. neoformans than wild-type cells.

The pathogenicity of QIBA-deficient cells was also tested in the BALB/c mice model of invasive aspergillosis. The QIBA-deficient strain was able to cause infection in both the BALB/c and BALB/c mouse models, as shown by the significantly reduced number of CFU recovered from the lungs from the BALB/c mice compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2B). The QIBA-deficient strain also presented a significantly reduced virulence in the murine model of invasive aspergillosis (Figure 2C).

To further investigate the role of QIBA in host immune responses, BMDMs were cultured from BALB/c mice and PBMC isolated from the BALB/c mice. The BMDM infected with the QIBA-deficient strain had significantly lower numbers of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-12p40 in the spleen and liver compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2D). Moreover, the QIBA-deficient strain produced significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the spleen and liver compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the QIBA-deficient strain has a more virulent phenotype in the mouse model of invasive aspergillosis.

The QIBA-deficient strain is more resistant to pulmonary infection
We next investigated the ability of QIBA-deficient cells to produce IFN-<U+03B3>, IL-12p40, and IL-17 in the lungs of BALB/c mice.


## Discussion
In addition, the QIBA-deficient state was associated with a reduced proliferation of phagocytized macrophages and neutrophils (12. Furthermore, it was also associated with increased release of the eicosanoidins Aß and ß from phagocytes and the reduced release of the mycobacterial antigen antigen titre. In addition, the QIBA-deficient state was associated with a decreased proliferation of macrophages and neutrophils (12). Taken together, these results demonstrate that QIBA regulates macrophage and neutrophil death in response to phagocytosis and that this is in accordance with findings of other studies showing that the QIBA is associated with the development of a phagocytic-like inflammatory response to phagocytosis (6, 32, 45, 46).

The QIBA-deficient state in vivo results in increased inflammatory responses to phagocytosis by neutrophils and to phagocytosis by macrophages (6, 12, 44). Furthermore, QIBA-deficient patients showed enhanced phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages, a finding that is in agreement with the finding of Guo et al. (12). Moreover, the findings of the current study indicate that QIBA is required for the development of phagocytosis and subsequent macrophage death. These results provide a new direction for future research in the search for the mechanism of QIBA-mediated phagocytosis in vivo.

A significant part of the inflammation induced by phagocytosis by macrophages is mediated by the phagocytic enzymes secreted by macrophages (14). The phagocytic pathway is a class of proteinases that are secreted by macrophages as well as those that are secreted by macrophages, as well as the metabolites produced by macrophages (14, 14). The phagocytosis of phagocytes is a crucial process in the formation of macrophages, which have the ability to migrate to the site of infection (14). The phagocytic pathway is also activated by the mycobacterial antigen titre of macrophages (14, 30, 47).
