## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that has spread globally in recent years. Biological control measures against C. gattii include the use of fungicides that are currently employed. Although many environmental factors are considered to be protective, the mechanisms that promote resistance to this pathogen remain largely unknown.

We used in vitro and in vivo models of C. gattii to better understand the pathogenic traits of the fungal pathogen and to identify effective antifungal compounds. We identified antifungal compounds that act synergistically with amphotericin B to control the growth of C. gattii in combination with fluconazole, with the addition of an Escherichia coli growth inhibitory strain background. We found that the synergistic activity of amphotericin B combined with fluconazole was independent from the activity of antifungal drugs, whereas the additive action of fluconazole on the pathogen was synergistic. Fluconazole synergistically inhibits the growth of C. gattii in mice. Furthermore, the synergistic activity of amphotericin B plus antifungal drugs resulted in a lower mortality rate in Galleria mellonella larvae infected with C. gattii than that of fluconazole-treated larvae.

These studies demonstrate that the antifungal action of antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B against C. gattii is synergistic in the dose range of amphotericin B, while the synergistic action of fluconazole is significantly less effective compared with amphotericin alone. These results provide the basis for future studies to identify alternative therapeutic strategies for this fungal pathogen.


## Introduction
 2014. Considering the large number of synthetic drugs used in clinical therapy, such as monoclonal (methoxypyrole), polylamine, clozapine, ethambutol, voriconazole, succinic acid, chloramphenicol, cypermethanil, and cystatin, new therapeutic options are being explored for cancer treatment (Maddavi et al., 2009; Poon et al., 2009; Rustici and Sobrado, 2009; Rustici et al., 2010). The increasing availability of chemicals, and the ability of natural products to exhibit several pharmacological properties, have led to several attempts in the past decades to discover new molecules with biological activities (Puerta et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2006).

Among these, many natural products with antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antiulcer, antihypertensive, and anti-tumour activities have been evaluated as potential treatments for several diseases, such as bacterial and fungal infections (Hagarasu et al., 2002; Taberlet, 2004; Martinez and Barreto, 2008; Sanchez et al., 2009; García-Jiménez et al., 2010; Torres et al., 2012).

One such compound, ruthenium-silica (RSS), a constituent of thyme, is a natural product from the Pseudallescheria boydii. R. boydii is a soil-borne fungus found in tropical and subtropical countries and is widely distributed in the world. R. boydii is characterized by an a-erythrocytochrome-dependent sterol demethylase and an aneuploidy, which are present in the genome of P. boydii. Previous studies have shown that R. boydii exhibits a strong selective pressure towards heterothallic strains, which are usually more sensitive to inhibitors than other strains (Hogan et al., 2002; Bagher et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2013). In addition to the aneuploidy, R.


## Methods

Introduction: The microorganisms and chemicals used in breast cancer care are often employed for short term biological reasons in the field of healt. A recent study demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in breast cancer care significantly increases the likelihood of prolonged drug toxicity. These antibiotics have been shown to be effective in broadening the tolerance and sensitivity of the cancer cell line for the inhibition of drug resistance. As a result, they are used in this type of cancer care, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer of different ages. However, the main effect of antibiotics on drug resistance is yet to be demonstrated.

Methods: The study was performed on 687 HIV/AIDS patients with the diagnosis of metastatic malignancies. Data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 6.01 software.

Background: The population of HIV/AIDS patients admitted to the Department of Human and Health Sciences at the Department of Biomedical Science of Jadavpur University Hospital, is large and reflects the high prevalence of HIV in India. The study was conducted in a similar way to the other studies, which were performed at the Department of Clinical Medicine of Jadavpur University Hospital.

Methods: The study included patients with clinical symptoms, with hematological diagnosis, and with the diagnosis of cancer. Patients with metastatic malignancies, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and prostate cancer of different ages were included in the study. The diagnosis of cancer was made using the hematological criteria, followed by the histopathology, and the histopathology.

Background: The study was performed in a clinical phase, and excluded HIV/AIDS patients with metastatic malignancies. The study was performed in a tertiary institution, and included patients from the Department of Pathology and Microbiology of the Department of Medical Sciences, Jadavpur University Hospital, India.

Methods: The study included patients with non-infectious malignancies and non-pulmonary malignancies.


## Results
fumigatus genes in human breast and blood (Li et a., 2014). As shown in Figure 1A, the A. fumigatus gene set showed a consistent transcriptional profile of expression, with high expression of genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions, and low expression of genes involved in fungal pathogens. The A. fumigatus gene set also displayed high expression of genes involved in the fungal pathogenicity (Table 1).

A. fumigatus Genes Involved in Stress Response
To test the importance of stress response in A. fumigatus’s function, we tested whether genes encoding stress-responsive proteins (resistance genes) were present in the A. fumigatus genome. As shown in Figure 1B, the A. fumigatus gene set contained a number of genes involved in stress response, including a number of genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative stress response (Figure 1C). We observed that a number of genes involved in stress response were also found in the A. fumigatus genome (Table 2). These included those encoding antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPI), glutathione peroxidase (GPI), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are involved in the synthesis of glutathione for glutathione-dependent reactions, as well as several genes involved in oxidative stress response, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPI), glutathione peroxide reductase (GPO), as well as heat shock protein (HSP).

A. fumigatus Genes Involved in Stress Response
As shown in Figure 1A, the A. fumigatus genome also contained several genes encoding stress-responsive proteins. The most prominent of these genes was the HSP gene, which is involved in response to stress response (Wang et al., 2009). HSP is a stress-responsive transcription factor involved in several stress-response processes including oxidative stress response (Wang et al., 2009) and pathogenicity (Martinez et al., 2004). HSP genes play an important role in pathogenicity and stress response in other organisms (Banks et al., 2002). The HSP gene encoding a putative HSP was also found in the A. fumigatus genome (Table 2). We also found a number of genes encoding proteins involved in stress response (Table 2).


## Discussion
A central challenge in the prevention and treatment of cryptococcosis is its ability to evade host defense mechanisms, including cell-mediated immune responses. Previous studies have shown that C. neoformans can evade host immune responses by possessing a high degree of intracellular survival, with an optimal cell size of about 10 kDa (Chao et al., 2013). In this study, we showed that the cell wall of C. neoformans is highly complex, with several layers of structure, and that the cell wall is highly dynamic, and that cell wall remodeling is a major factor in the cell wall remodeling process in C. neoformans. We found that the cell wall is highly dynamic and that the cell wall is highly unfolded in response to host cell stress, including cell wall perturbation, cell wall disruption, and cell wall fragmentation.
