## Abstract
A total of 164 specimens were collected from various locations throughout Nepal for the purpose of this study. The specimens were mostly collected during monsoon and snowmands. Their storage consisted of various plant and animal species, with a notable amount of dust. Dark fungi were more abundant than light-adapted fungi. Molecular identification of fungi was done using the sequencing of internal transcribed spacer region 1 and internal sequencing of the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb1). The most frequent clinical signs were headache, fever, gait disturbance, appetiteing, sweating, and cornice swelling. The highest incidence of fungal infections was seen in winter, with the majority of infections in patients with AIDS. No obvious immune-deficiency condition was found to be associated with involvement of these patients in the study. All the specimens were stored at -20°C and stored for 2 weeks before transfer to healthy animals. The study included 108 patients (82.3%).


## Introduction
The Cryptococcus species are closely related to the closely related pathogenic Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii genome. The Cryptococcus species are distributed worldwide, including North America, the Netherlands, Australia, and South America. The global distribution of the Cryptococcus species has been shown to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus bacillisporus are widespread in soil and bird droppings, and are found in the environment in healthy individuals. Human infections with Cryptococcus species are usually asymptomatic and can be eradicated by antifungal treatment. However, in immunocompromised patients, the immune response against Cryptococcus can be compromised.

Cryptococcus species are divided into four molecular types: VNI, VNII, and VNB. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are divided into three molecular types: VNI, VNII, and VNIII. Cryptococcus species differ from other pathogenic fungi in that they produce a characteristic capsule that is associated with their cell wall (VNIII). This capsule can be recognized by a host’s cell wall and is secreted by various host cells. During the infection, the host's immune system becomes activated to recognize the pathogen and the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of the microbe. This recognition is followed by the production of the infectious propagules that can spread to the surrounding environment and cause disease. The infectious propagules can be recognized by phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and are transported into the phagolysosome by the extracellular matrix (ECM). The Cryptococcus species are usually cleared from the CSF before dissemination to other tissues.

During infection, Cryptococcus species can invade the host by different routes. These include inhalation and direct pathogen invasion through the respiratory tract and the gastro-intestinal tract, and can cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients (reviewed in Krajaejun et al. [19]).


## Methods
gattii-infected mic. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and were cared for in accordance with the principles of the Animal Welfare Act and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #P07-1-16). Informed consent was obtained from all of the animals or their surrogates prior to the experiment.

Data Analysis
Mice numbers were determined by matching the number of the wild-type, WT and C. gattii isolates with the number of isolates of the isolate of each mouse strain, which were later used to determine the total number of animals (the number of animals per group in the experiments). A total of 23 mice per group were used in the present study.

Data Analysis
All of the animals used in the experiments were at the point of death and the animals that survived to the end of the experiment were excluded from the study. The animals that were sacrificed during the experiment were considered dead, and the time points were recorded. For each animal, a random number generator was used to find the animal with the highest mortality. This random number generator was then used to calculate the mortality rate of each animal and to determine the average number of animals for each animal.

For statistical analysis, the animals were identified as a group of animals at the point of death and the animals that survived to the end of the experiment were excluded from the study.

Data Analysis
The survival rate for each animal was calculated for each of the group, as described in Figure 1. The survival rate for the control group was calculated as described in Figure 2. The survival rate for the infected group was calculated as described in Figure 3.

Data Analysis
In the survival rate for the infected group, the number of animals per group was calculated for each animal and the number of animals per group in the experiment. The number of animals per group in the experiment were compared with the numbers of animals in the control group.

Data Analysis
The age of the animals at the point of death was determined by counting the number of animals per group in the experiment. The age of the animals at the point of death was defined as the age of the animals at the point of death in the experiment.


## Results
fumigatus
To identify putative pathogen-host interaction sites, the fungal-host-host interaction motifs (PHA) were individually identified by BLAST searches of the . neoformans H99 genome database using the H99 pheromone receptor, the pheromone receptor-like kinase PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase (PRK), and the uncharacterized protein (UPS) (Figure 3).

Using the H99 pheromone receptor, BLAST searches of the C. neoformans H99 genome database using the PRK-like kinase PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase (PRK) and the uncharacterized protein (UPS) identified a total of 171 PHA motifs (Table 1). The number of PHA motifs per PIK-like kinase, uncharacterized protein, and pheromone receptor-like kinase was significantly higher in A. fumigatus compared to A. parasiticus (P < 0.0001; Figure 3).

The PHA motifs were also identified by BLAST searches of the C. neoformans H99 pheromone receptor, the PRK, and the uncharacterized protein. A total of 36 PHA motifs were identified in the C. neoformans H99 pheromone receptor (Figure 3). The number of PHA motifs per PIK-like kinase, uncharacterized protein, and pheromone receptor-like kinase was significantly higher in A. fumigatus compared to A. parasiticus (P < 0.0001; Figure 3).

The A. fumigatus PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase PIK-like kinase (PRK) was not identified by BLAST searches, and the number of PIK motifs per PIK-like kinase, uncharacterized protein, and pheromone receptor-like kinase was significantly higher in A. fumigatus compared to A. parasiticus (P < 0.0001; Figure 3).


## Discussion
We used the CnT promoter and the human coding gene, GATL1 to examine the expression of the human-coding gene, which encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in the production of intracellular metabolite. The expression of GATL1 was significantly upregulated in the CnT promoter and upregulated in the GATL1 promoter region. The GATL1 promoter was replaced with the human-encoded gene, GATL2, and the GATL2 promoter was replaced with the gene, GATL4, which encodes a serine-threonine-alanine-arginine-protein-transferase that is involved in the synthesis of intracellular proteins. The expression of GATL4 was increased in the GATL1 promoter. The GATL1 promoter region was replaced with the gene GATL4. The expression of GATL4 was decreased in the CnT promoter and the GATL1 promoter. The GATL4 promoter was replaced with the gene, GATL5, which encodes a tyrosine-to-tertRNA-based transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of intracellular metabolites (11). The CnT promoter region was replaced with the gene GATL5. The GATL5 promoter was replaced with the gene, GATL6, which encodes a tyrosine-to-tertRNA-based transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of intracellular metabolites (12). The expression of the CnT gene was increased in infected mice. The CnT gene encodes a protein that is required for the synthesis of intracellular metabolites (13). In C. neoformans, the CnT gene encodes a novel gene with several genes involved in the production of intracellular metabolites, including the product of the CnT gene, CnT-1. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the production of intracellular metabolites in CnT, we used the CnT promoter and the GATL1 promoter regions to examine the expression of CnT-1. The expression of CnT-1 was increased in infected mice. The expression of CnT-1 was decreased in infected mice.
