## Abstract
We investigated the role of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway and the MAPK pathway in the pathogenicity of the dermatophyte A. fumigatus, A. nidulans or dermatophytes. We found that A. nidulans cells expressing cAMP, but not the mCerPA-like cyclooxygenase (mCy), were more susceptible to the antifungal drug fluconazole than those expressing only mCy. Deletion of the cAMP pathway alone or in combination with two or more drugs impaired the ability of A. nidulans cells to kill germlings and to invade injured skin cells in vitro. These findings suggest that the pathway is essential for virulence of A. nidulans or A. nidulans or dermatophytes. Furthermore, loss of both the cAMP pathway and the mCy pathway alone did not affect the susceptibility of these cells to fluconazole or the fungicidal drug itraconazole. These findings suggest that A. nidulans or A.


## Introduction
Microbial pathogens are able to cause infections in humans, animals, plants and other microorganisms.1-6 Infections caused by pathogenic fungi are usually caused by dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Coccidioides immitis. However, some dimorphic fungi, such as Blastomyces lusitaniae and Coccidioides brasiliensis, are also dimorphic.7-9

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with high mortality rates.1,10 Inhalational exposure to Histoplasma wax, a dimorphic mold, is the most common type.10-12 Inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells occurs most frequently in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS.1,11 This infection is often asymptomatic and it does not affect the patient's general condition or any predisposing factors.

Treatment of IFIs is difficult in the Indian setting, owing to a lack of effective antifungal drugs.13,14 The current therapeutic options are limited, with very limited indications for treatment. This is especially true in the case of severe immunodeficiency, such as nephrotic syndrome and organ transplantation.14,15 This problem has caused a lot of clinical trials for less efficacious and/or toxic drugs. Therefore, there is a pressing need to find a more effective, economical and environmentally safe treatment.


## Methods

Antimicrobial activity of . fumigatus monoclonal antibody against C. albicans and C. glabrata

The antimicrobial activity of the monoclonal antibodies against C. albicans and C. glabrata was tested by the assay of the inhibition of growth by the monoclonal antibody Mab_12B12 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in the presence of a stock solution of amphotericin B, fluconazole, or itraconazole at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C in order to obtain the cell-free supernatant. The assay was performed according to the method of [55], with modifications. After the incubation, the tested antifungal drugs were added to the wells of a sterile 96-well microtitre plates and the plates were incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 24 h. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured using a micro-ampillary column (Amicon, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The blank was diluted in RPMI-1640 medium (without antifungal drugs) and then added to the wells of a well with the medium to a new plate. The inoculum was prepared by spreading a loopful of a 100-µL aliquot of the fungal suspension on the plate and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone, measured with a plate reader (Multiskan III, Inc., Finland). The inhibition zones were defined as the mean of the zones of the control and the growth control wells.

## Results
Thioglycosides were tested in a variety of biological fluids such as blood, liver, urine, urine and feces, while the insect gut and immune system were teste. The results are summarized in Table 3. The results indicate that the selected thioglycosides had better antifungal activity than the antimicrobial agents.

3.3. Antibiotic Activity
The antimicrobial activity of the selected thioglycosides was tested against the Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Table 4 shows the MIC_50 values of the selected thioglycosides against the Gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria. The MIC_50 values for all thioglycosides are summarized in Table 5. All thioglycosides were less active than amphotericin B, ceftazidime, posaconazole, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole-susceptible azole drug, fluconazole-susceptible penicillin-susceptible penicillin-resistant penicillin-susceptible penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-susceptible penicillin-susceptible penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant penicillin-resistant (Table 5).

3.4. Antibiotic Activity
The selected thioglycosides were tested in vitro against the Gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC_50 values of the selected thioglycosides are summarized in Table 6.


## Discussion
In this study, we have developed a novel assay to detect differentially abundant phytotoxins and to identify the expression of antifungal-like factors. This novel assay has two main advantages: (1) it is easy to perform in an industrial scale and (2) it provides a reliable method for evaluating the antifungal activity of different phytotoxins.

The current assay is based on the combination of a yeast extract and an extract containing alkaloids such as linalool and linalyl acetate. The preparation of the extract from the yeast extract is essentially performed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding final product, and a small amount of acetone is added to the extract to give the yeast extract. The activity of the test was compared with the other tested species of Trichosporon and the crude extract. The results showed that the crude extract had a significant activity (MIC = 25 µg/mL) against P. expansum, a fungal pathogen. Similar results were reported by Koster et al. [26] who used the yeast extract of P. expansum to assess the antifungal activity of Candida species. As the activity of the crude extract is based on the activity of the purified enzyme, the enzyme concentration was determined to be 25 µg/mL.

The activity of the crude extract against P. expansum was determined by the method of biodiesel analysis and the IC_50 value of the crude extract was determined.
