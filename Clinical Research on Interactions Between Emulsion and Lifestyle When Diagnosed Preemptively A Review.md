## Abstract
Luminal susceptibility to azole antifungals causes an increasing number of life-threatening life-threatening fungal infections. The development of multi-drug resistant strains of fungi makes the effective antifungals difficult to manage. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand that promise a different approach to azole resistance. Azole antifungals are potent natural products that can be found as natural or sub-culture extracts. The present study was designed to test the in vitro activity of a semi-selective naphthoquinol and itraconazole (HA) extracts against different defined fungal isolates and a comparison of the antifungal activity of these extracts with standard antifungals. The study was also conducted to evaluate the antifungal activity of ixotericin B (ITR) and itraconazole (HA) extracts against Cryptococcus gattii. Furthermore, the results were compared to those obtained with the standard antifungals. The results showed that the naphthoquinol and itraconazole extracts showed a significant synergistic activity towards C. gattii. The itraconazole extract was more potent than the sub-inhibitory concentrations of the sub-azole extracts when it was submitted to hydrogen peroxide (HU) for prolonged periods, and itraconazole was a more effective drug.


## Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 6.4 million incident cases and 9.1 million incident deaths in 2014-2015 (1, 2). Of particular concern is the high mortality associated with CM in low and middle-income countries (MCLCFS) (3). Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies CM as a neglected disease, and it is considered that it is a neglected disease, deserving of priority among other neglected diseases (4). The most important etiological agents of CM are two distinct groups of fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The latter is characterized by the production of a polysaccharide capsule, and it is the major cause of meningitis in HIV-negative patients (4). The development of AIDS has increased the incidence of cryptococcal infections, with the number of AIDS-related cases increasing by approximately 300,000 per year globally (5). The first case of CM in Africa was reported in 1993 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the Borno Tones area, and a third case were reported in 2007 in the southern Indian subcontinent (6). Since then, the incidence of cryptococcal infections has increased in several parts of the world, including the Americas (7, 8), and cases in Africa are increasingly reported in the last two decades (9). In 2014, there were approximately 7,100 new cases in the United States (10) and approximately 1,200 in the European Union (11) and in 2019 in the United States of America (12) cases. In Uganda, CM is the most common cause of adult meningitis in men and children, with an estimated 223,100 new cases and 5,600 deaths (13). As a result of HIV treatment, CM is still a major cause of death in young patients in resource-limited settings (14). Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the major causes of mortality in HIV-positive patients in Africa and has been estimated to kill 1.8 million people globally (15).


## Methods
Fungal strain and culture
The M. musculus isolate H99 was obtained from the Herbarium of the Institute of Botany, University of Bangkok, Thailand. The fungus was maintained in 5% glycerol at -80°C.

For inoculation, the M. musculus isolate H99 was inoculated in chemically defined medium (DMEM) (Kapa Boshi, Thailand) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO_2 atmosphere. The cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in sterile distilled water.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
M. musculus ATCC 6258 (M. musculus ATCC 6258) was inoculated in liquid medium (DMEM) and incubated at 37°C with agitation (200 rpm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 10 min, and then washed twice with distilled water. The cells were suspended in 10% DMEM and adjusted to the required concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The cells were further incubated at 37°C with agitation for 48 h. The viability of the cells was determined by counting the number of viable cells per milliliter of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL.


## Results
braziliensis
In the current study, the introduction of a specific combination of medications, including fluconazole, voriconazole, or mycophenolate, decreased the probability of . braziliensis infection by 95% and 75%, respectively. However, the efficacy of fluconazole in reducing L. braziliensis infection was higher than that of voriconazole, and a significant difference was observed when the combination was combined with fluconazole (Table 2). The efficacy of fluconazole in reducing L. braziliensis infection was higher than that of voriconazole and when the combination was combined with fluconazole, the efficacy of fluconazole was higher than that of mycophenolate. The efficacy of fluconazole in reducing L. braziliensis infection was higher than that of voriconazole and when the combination was combined with fluconazole, the efficacy of fluconazole was higher than that of mycophenolate.

Comparison of Clinical Characteristics between the Combination of Fluconazole and Mycophenolate in Patients with L. braziliensis
In the current study, the combination of fluconazole and mycophenolate with the combination of fluconazole was associated with a significantly higher incidence of invasive infection in patients with L. braziliensis (Table 3). In this study, the incidence of invasive L. braziliensis infection was higher than that of mycophenolate (Table 3). The incidence of invasive L. braziliensis infection was lower than that of fluconazole (Table 3).

Comparison of L. braziliensis Infection by the Combination of Fluconazole with Mycophenolate and Fluconazole in Patients with L. braziliensis
A total of 793 patients were included in this study. The study was conducted on a first-line, low-dose regimen of fluconazole (1.5-2 mg/kg/day), voriconazole (1.25-2 mg/kg/day), or mycophenolate (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day). The median duration of fluconazole treatment in the current study was 2.7 (range, 1.


## Discussion

The clinical manifestations of inflammation in various inflammatory diseases were common, and not only in the primary inflammatory insult, but also in inflammatory type I, type II, and type II. The lesions in our case included multiple organ dysfunction, such as the infiltration of the lymphatic system, the vasculature, and the heart and lung lesions. The most common organs affected in the primary inflammatory insult were the liver and spleen, which had the most common findings, such as the liver, lymph nodes, and kidneys. The other organs of the inflammatory condition included the brain, lungs, and heart. A high index of suspicion in these organs would be needed to exclude the disease, and the use of a nephrologic evaluation is warranted to rule out the infection and to establish the diagnosis.

In our patient, the patient's severe fever and headache were not relieved by corticosteroids. However, the chronic inflammation and the lack of improvement with anticoagulation did not completely abate. This is not surprising, as corticosteroids have been shown to be able to alleviate the inflammation in the inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic sclerosis and chronic granulomatous disease), and their use has been associated with an increase in the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (i.e., Crohn’s disease and inflammatory bowel disease) [18-20]. Moreover, corticosteroids have been found to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [21]. This may also be the case in our case, as the patient did not have any comorbidities at the time of diagnosis.

The patient's immunocompromised status was not ruled out by any of the symptoms. This may be related to the multiple organ dysfunction and the lack of response of the patients to corticosteroids. However, this is unlikely, since the patients were immunocompromised in their past lives. This may have resulted in the patient's inability to mount an immune response to the corticosteroid, which resulted in the necrosis of the liver and the development of inflammatory bowel disease, and the improvement of the systemic lymphadenopathy.

The patient’s history of the previous life in Taiwan was not recorded on the patient’s medical records. The patient’s family had a history of a long-term relationship, and the patient’s mother had no information about the previous relationship.
