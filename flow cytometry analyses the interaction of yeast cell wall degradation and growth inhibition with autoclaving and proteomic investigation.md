## Abstract
Since the first description of a heterotrophic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be able to adapt to low oxygen environments, and this has been an important factor in the success of the fungus in its life cycle as it has been able to survive the oxidative stress imposed by certain microorganisms. In this study, the adaptation of the Cryptococcus neoformans e2a strain to oxygen deprivation was investigated. The growth of the e2a strain was suppressed when the glucose concentration of 0.7 mol g-1 was increased. In addition, the transcription level of the gene encoding the glyoxylate cycle was increased in response to glucose concentration. The expression levels of several genes involved in the response to glucose were up-regulated. The expression levels of several proteins were also up-regulated. The intracellular survival of the e2a strain was also evaluated. The e2a strain was sensitive to the azole and ketoconazole drugs, and was able to survive in the presence of certain amino acids. The transcription level of the gene encoding the interleukin-1ß biosynthetic enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of the leucine rich staining protein, was increased in response to the glucose concentration of 0.7 mol g-1. The expression levels of several genes involved in the metabolism of the fungus were also increased. The intracellular survival of the e2a strain was also evaluated.


## Introduction
The genus Paracoccidioides is comprised of thermally dimorphic fungi, which are found in the tropics, subtropics, and temperate regions of the world [1-4]. Currently, there are approximately 100 species of fungi in Paracoccidioides [5]. Currently, the genus Paracoccidioides is divided into five sections, namely Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Paracoccidioides lutris, Paracoccidioides venezuelensis, and Paracoccidioides lutris complex [6]. The section Paracoccidioides lutris is characterized by the yeast-to-mycelium transition and the production of conidia; while the other sections are characterized by the presence of phoretic fruiting bodies and mycelium in the culture. The sections Paracoccidioides aeanica, Paracoccidioides spp., and Paracoccidioides eucalyptorum are classified in the Paracoccidioides spp. complex, and the sections Pristionchus spp. and Paracoccidioides spp. are classified in the Pristionchus complex.

The genus Paracoccidioides is divided into two subtypes, namely the a-, ß-, and ß-paracoccidioides [7]. A- and ß-paracoccidioides are the most prevalent of the a- and ß-paracoccidioides [8]. ß-paracoccidioides and P. brasiliensis are the most prevalent a- and ß-paracoccidioides [9-11]. Phoretic fruiting bodies are formed by three to four conidia of each type, which are produced in groups. The conidia can be round, globose, ellipsoid, or oblong, and the germ slits are very short and can range from 1 to 18 µm in diameter [12]. In the absence of an effective sexual process, the conidia are produced from germ tubes, which are formed by a- and ß-cells, and form chains.


## Methods

Enzyme assays
The activity of the protease proteins, including their subunits, was determined according to the method of Cheng and Chong [18] with modification. The enzyme-free supernatant of a yeast cell suspension was used to determine the supernatant and the enzymatic activities of the protease proteins as described previously [18]. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method [19]. The enzymatic activities were expressed as µg protein per milligram of enzyme (10^8) per min.

Analytical methods
The determination of the amount of ergosterol and ergosterol from grapefruit juice was performed as described by Zhang et al. [20].


## Results
neoformans on the cell wall of . cerevisiae. We have previously observed that autoclaving reduces the cell wall surface protein and antifungal activity of the cell wall degrading enzymes CAAX1, CAAX2 and CAAX3 but does not promote the secretion of extracellular matrix antifungal compounds [40].

In contrast, autoclaving did not affect the secreted fungal cell wall proteins CAAX1 or CAAX2, or filamentous growth in the presence of C. neoformans. As shown in Fig 6, the inhibitory effect of CAAX1 or CAAX2 on C. neoformans growth was much more pronounced in the presence of the fungal cells than in the absence of C. neoformans.

The antifungal activity of CAAX1 and CAAX2 in the candida growth model of cryptococcal meningitis
In order to assess the antifungal activity of CAAX1 and CAAX2 in candida candidiasis, we conducted a model in which C. neoformans and C. albicans were inoculated into the cultures of C. albicans-infected patients. We observed that C. neoformans was not able to cause any growth defect on C. albicans culture plates in any of the three assays. Moreover, the growth defect was not due to the growth defect in the presence of C. neoformans in the culture. C. neoformans was able to induce the growth defect in all three assays, and all three assays showed a growth defect in the presence of C. neoformans (Fig 7). The growth defect in the presence of C. neoformans was not due to the growth defect in the absence of C. neoformans (Fig 7).

We have previously reported that C. neoformans is able to induce autophagic cell death, which in turn leads to the cell death of autophagic cells [41]. In this study, we have observed that C. neoformans induces autophagic cell death in the host, which in turn leads to the cell death of autophagic cells [41]. To determine whether C.


## Discussion
col. Although the specific PKA signaling pathway in E. coli is unknown, it is likely that the PKA-specific autoclaving pathway in E. coli is activated by LPS and proteolysis of cell wall-degrading enzymes, leading to the degradation of lysine and release of H_2O_2 to generate heat and toxic H_2O_2 [48]. In addition, the direct involvement of Tdh1 and Tdh2 in this pathway was also demonstrated in several other yeast species, such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Metschnikowia fischeri [49,50]. In this study, we have demonstrated that the PKA signaling pathway is activated by both autoclaving and proteolysis of LPS and proteolysis of cell wall-degrading enzymes, resulting in the release of H_2O_2 and rapid and stable pH stress.

In this study, we demonstrated that autoclaving is required for the release of H_2O_2, but not proteolysis. Because autoclaving can cause oxidative stress in cells, we hypothesized that the PKA signaling pathway plays a crucial role in H_2O_2 detoxification. We demonstrated that autoclaving of LPS and proteolysis of cell wall-degrading enzymes is required for the release of H_2O_2. Additionally, the release of H_2O_2 from PKA and Tdh1 and Tdh2 is correlated with autoclaving. We conclude that PKA signaling pathway is activated by autoclaving and proteolysis, but not by autoclaving and autoclaving alone.

Our results showed that autoclaving is a critical role for autoclaving of LPS and proteolysis of cell wall-degrading enzymes in E. coli. However, the autoclaving by autoclaved LPS and proteolysis of cell wall-degrading enzymes by autoclaved proteolysis and autoclaved proteolysis was not as significant as that in the autoclaved proteolysis. It is possible that the autoclaving of autoclaved LPS and proteolysis is not sufficient for autoclaved proteolysis.
