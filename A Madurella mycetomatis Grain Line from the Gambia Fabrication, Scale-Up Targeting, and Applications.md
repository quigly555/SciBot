## Abstract
Trichosporon asahii is a common infectious disease affecting about 1.6 million people annually. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of two different Trichosporon spp. strain (T. asahii and T. flavus) on human immune responses against Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii) using the microbeads of natural and clinical samples. Microbiological assays were conducted to confirm the results and compare them with control strains. The effects of T. asahii strain on human innate immune cells was evaluated by the secretion of monocytes and macrophages, respectively. A murine acute infection with C. gattii showed an increased activation of macrophages, as demonstrated by the increase of the CD11b+ cells of CD11b+ T cells and the inhibition of cytokine production by monocytes. These data suggest that T. asahii T-cell responses to C. gattii are mainly influenced by macrophages. The inhibition of these cells by T. asahii strain may be related to the activation of inflammatory cells and the development of the immune reaction against the fungus. This results in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and activation of the inflammatory cells. These results suggest that T. asahii strain has an immunoregulatory role and its ability to induce macrophage activation may be related to the development of inflammatory diseases.


## Introduction
Lung transplantation can be achieved with the use of a variety of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents. Since the late 1980s, a variety of medical devices including inhalers, nasogastenoscopes, pacemakers, and other devices have been used in the management of the respiratory and urinary tract infections [1-3].

The use of immunosuppressive agents is commonly associated with poor clinical outcomes and the death of patients. Although the use of immunosuppressive agents is widespread in the past few decades, the frequency of infections due to respiratory and urinary tract pathogens has remained relatively stable in the last decades. This suggests that respiratory and urinary tract infections are not the only entities associated with which immunosuppressive agents can be used in the management of these diseases [4-8].

The use of drugs in the management of respiratory and urinary tract infections is largely due to the combination of immunosuppressive and antimicrobial agents. Most of the drugs in the arsenal of current antibiotics are active inhibitors of ergosterol, and the latter is known to inhibit the growth and activity of bacteria and fungi [9,10].

The use of other drugs for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections is also due to the fact that the skin and intestinal tract are the most susceptible places to be affected in patients. It is therefore critical that we develop new agents that will provide the best treatment for the disease of patients.

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive review of the drug applications, safety, and toxicity in the management of the respiratory and urinary tract infections in which the therapeutic agents are combined.


## Methods
The mycelium was then transferred to a 250 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and incubated at 25 °C for 24 . Mycelium was extracted with two volumes of an anaerobic mixture and extracted with the same volume of an anaerobic mixture. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was neutralized by adding diethyl ether. The precipitate was then centrifuged at 10,000× g for 30 min, washed with 70% ethanol and dried with a cotton-ester to a constant weight. The precipitate was dissolved in an equal volume of diethyl ether and stored at -20 °C until use.

In order to further examine the effect of diethyl ether on the pycnidia, the pycnidia suspension was prepared by growing the mycelium in a liquid NGY broth for 24 h at 25 °C. The mycelium was then transferred to a liquid NGY broth and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. The mycelium was then transferred to a 250 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. The mycelium was then centrifuged at 10,000× g for 30 min and washed with 70% ethanol to a constant weight. The precipitate was dissolved in an equal volume of diethyl ether and stored at -20 °C until use.

The most important steps in the pycnidia preparation are the addition of diethyl ether to the fungal biomass and the extraction of aqueous phase. The final pycnidia concentration was estimated by a Neubauer chamber (Omron Bio-One, Tewksbury, UK) using a 0.5% NaOH solution and a pressure of 0.4 bar. The final pycnidia concentration was estimated by a Guava chamber (Guava, Ghent, Belgium) using a 0.5% CaCl_2 solution and a pressure of 0.5 bar. The final pycnidia concentration was estimated by a Guava chamber (Guava, Ghent, Belgium) using a 0.5% KCl solution and a pressure of 0.5 bar.

Materials examined: Greece, from the Gambian rubber, 2011, M. Manenis (holotype CBS H-22429, culture ex-type CBS 14-22429 = M38). USA, Maryland, from a black bromeliad on the floor of a tree, 2012, M. Manenis, culture CBS 14-22430 = M38.

Notes: The species Madurella mycetomatis was recently described from a dead tree, which is in direct conflict with the description of other species in this species. The type specimen of this species (CBS 14-22430) was previously identified as a new species of M. mycetomatis, M. wilsonii, M. wilsonii (W.A. Desm.) Desm., M. vesuvianis, M. wilsonii (W.A. Desm.)
