## Abstract
Currently, there is no affordable, unbiased, and specific method for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. Using a combination of imaging, diagnosis, and therapy, we demonstrate the utility of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in severe cryptococcal meningitis in a cohort of HIV-infected infants.

Using a combination of imaging, diagnosis, and treatment, we demonstrate the utility of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in severe cryptococcal meningitis in a cohort of HIV-infected infants. Using a single imaging approach, we demonstrate a clinically relevant advantage of using a central composite diagnostic panel (CDP) for CrAg testing in contrast to conventional panel-based paradigms in the clinical setting.

Clinical significance and the potential clinical impact on the prognosis of cryptococcal meningitis in the setting of advanced immunodeficiency disorders are made as the primary goals of this study.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella was proposed by von Recklinghausen (1913) with the inclusion of Verona (1915), Malopascutella (1919) and Pseudotsuga (1921) as generic synonyms. Verona, the type species, was described from a soil-dwelling pyrenocarp species occurring in pine-dominated areas around the Mediterranean Sea. According to Veronaâ€™s traditional circumscription, Mycosphaerella and Pseudotsuga are related to Pseudotsuga cepacia (Reveringhausen 1915). Both species are found in the soil, and their association with the soil-living pyrenocarp Pseudotsuga is supported by DNA sequence data (van de Veerdonk et al. 2009). Pseudotsuga is associated with human skin disease, and the synonym of Pseudosphaeria, which is not human-associated.


## Methods
Species identification was based on the morphological characteristics of the isolated and described basidiomycete.

The antietellina of the genus Antietellina was studied in the study of the species complex of the genus Antietellina by Chang and Zhu, and by Yuan and Zhu, 2015. The molecular structure of the antietellina was established by molecular docking. The sequence of the docking-based method was obtained by combining the sequences of the four proteins with the amino acid sequence of the antietellina from the corresponding species complex. The docking program consisted of five steps, i.e., a sequence alignment, a molecular docking, docking station, and a transformation step.

The docking station was used to obtain the protein structures of the antietellina of the genus Antietellina. The docking station was used to obtain the protein structures of the species complex of the genus Antietellina. The transformed protein structure was established by docking with the docking station of the classical docking method. The docking station was used to obtain the protein structures of the species complex of the genus Antietellina. The transformed protein structure was established by docking with the docking station of the classical docking method. The transformation step was performed by using a large sequence alignment obtained from the corresponding protein structure of the antietellina from the corresponding species complex. The docking station was used to obtain the protein structures of the antietellina of the genus Antietellina.

The phylogenetic analysis of the phylogenetic structure of the genus Antietellina was performed by the neighbor-joining method using the Maximum-Likelihood method. The phylogenetic structure of the species of Antietellina was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA 6 software. The molecular docking and molecular docking station were used to identify the molecular structure of the molecular related proteins of the species of Antietellina. The phylogenetic analysis of the species complex of the genus Antietellina was performed by the neighbor-joining method using the Maximum-likelihood method. The molecular docking and molecular docking station were used to determine the molecular related proteins of the species complex of the genus Antietellina. The molecular docking and molecular docking station were used to determine the molecular related proteins of the species complex of the genus Antietellina.


## Results
In agreement, the alkaline- and persic-nutrined bark of the Heterologues of the genus Antietellina was alkaline-stable (Fig 1, Fig S2) and consisted of rhizines with olivaceous-brown stellate, typical for the genus Antietellina (Fig S3.

The morphological characteristics of the Antietellina actinatoides species complex are consistent with those reported for the Rhodotorula spp. (Huekler and O'Donnell, 1997; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 1998; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 1999; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2001; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2002; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2003; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2008; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2009; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2011; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2012; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2013; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2014; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2016; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2018; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2018; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2019; O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2019; and O'Donnell and O'Donnell, 2019; for the genus Antietellina, see Table S1 in the supplemental material). In contrast, the species complex of the genus Antietellina consists of a wide variety of alkaline-stable species, including the Heterologues of the genus Antietellina, but also the Actinores of the genus Antietellina (see Table S1). The Actinores of the genus Antietellina has a wide variety of alkaline-stable species, including the Heterologues of the genus Antietellina (see Table S1).

In contrast to the diversity of species of the genus Antietellina, the molecular diversity of the Heterologues of the genus Antietellina was similar to that reported for the Heterologues of the genus Antietellina (Table 1).


## Discussion

Fungal diversity in the leaves of the two species
In order to compare the saprotrophs of the two species, the ratio of different genera in the tree species was use. The ratio of genera in the leaves of the two species was compared to those of the other tree species. The results show that the ratio of genera in the leaves of the two species is higher than that of the other species.

As the ratio of genera in the leaves of the two species is higher than that of the other tree species, the diversity in the bark is higher than that of the other tree species. However, the diversity is less than that of the other tree species.

As the ratio of genera in the leaves of the two species is higher than that of the other tree species, the diversity in the bark is higher than that of the other tree species.
