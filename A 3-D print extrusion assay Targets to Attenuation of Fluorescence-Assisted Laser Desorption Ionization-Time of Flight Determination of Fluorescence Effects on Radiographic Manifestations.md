## Abstract
The clinical presentations of invasive aspergillosis (IA) varied in the developed countries and mainly involved the central nervous system and lungs, with few details on the local and systemic factors affecting the development and progression of IA.

A total of 126 patients with clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to seriously ill aspergillosis (IA) admitted to the Medical University of China's Hospital 1 during the 3 months of the prospective Multicenter Interventional Trials of Aspergillus (IFI) trial.

One hundred and forty patients were eligible, and 64 cases were randomly selected and followed up for the following 6 months.

Twenty-one patients (11.1%) had aspergillosis, 14 cases had pulmonary aspergillosis, two cases had pulmonary cryptococcosis, and one case had polymyositis pneumonia. The pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in 11 cases (4.5%). The systemic factor affecting the pulmonary aspergillosis was HIV (HIV-1 IA), and the most important were inflammation (HIV-1 IA = 6.4% vs HIV-1 IA = 2.8%). The primary mycobacterial pneumonia was the most common (34.2%) in the developing countries, followed by aspergillosis (11.3%) in tuberculosis (3.8%) and pneumonia (5.2%).

The pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in two cases (4.5%) in our hospital and one case (6.8%) in Huizhou Medical University Hospital. Aspergillus flavus was the most common aspergillosis-producing isolate followed by Aspergillus niger (Bacillus niger), Candida rugosa (Candida albicans), and Candida parapsilosis (Candida tropicalis). The pulmonary aspergillosis was the most common infection seen in patients with severe immunodeficiency, such as transplant recipients, patients on immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous fungus that causes the life-threatening disease invasive aspergillosis (IA) (1). It is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (2-5). IA is a common, life-threatening disease in neutropenic patients with long-term neutropenia, with a high mortality rate even in intensive care units (ICU). In the context of transplantation, IA is common in patients who are immunosuppressed due to HIV infection or chemotherapy (6). The survival of patients with IA is greatly improved when immunoglobulin-dependent therapies such as corticosteroids and antifungals are administered to them (7). In addition, the number of ICU patients suffering from IA is increasing and the mortality rate is increasing. As a result, a large number of patients with severe IA are placed on immunosuppressive regimens (8). Antifungal treatment has been a relatively popular approach to improving the survival of patients suffering from IA. However, there has been a recent surge in the use of immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of IA. Antifungal agents, including polyenes, flucytosine (5-FC) and cyclophosphamide, have shown efficacy against several fungal species but have not completely addressed the problem of drug-resistant pathogens (9, 10).

The polyene amphotericin B (AmB) and the flucytosine have demonstrated promising results against a variety of fungi (11). These antifungal agents, which are widely used as topical and/or systemic antifungal agents, can be administered orally or intravenously (12). Both have limitations in oral availability and may be combined in formulations that are more readily administered. Therefore, the development of a combination of antifungal agents is a critical clinical consideration.

AmB is a broad-spectrum, antimycotic drug that targets the fungal cell membrane and is active against all major Candida species (12). In addition to the planktonic forms, AmB also targets the cell wall and can induce apoptosis of cells (12). AmB is an amphipathic compound that is covalently attached to the nitrogen-containing outer layer of the cell membrane.


## Methods
% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the RNA samples were blocked with 10% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with antibodies against specific molecules (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the RNA samples were incubated with antibodies against the capsular polysaccharide polysaccharide polysaccharide-X (1:1000 in PBS-T) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 in PBS-T) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the RNA samples were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) conjugated antibody (1:2000 in PBS-T) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 in PBS-T) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the RNA samples were developed with SYPRO-red CM5 dye (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and then destained with 30% (v/v) methanol for 10 min at 100% (v/v). The samples were then run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The spots were excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The bands were excised and re-stained with silver staining solution (0.8% w/v silver ion). The band was excised and re-stained with silver staining solution (0.4% w/v silver ion) and the protein spots were examined by gel electrophoresis at room temperature.


## Results
coli
Since fluorescence is a useful tool for producing high-throughput films, we wanted to identify the target of the laser irradiation that drives the laser bea. Since the laser beam is directed towards the target, we analyzed the effect of the laser irradiation on the growth of E. coli and the use of the DAPI-Sephadex® and Q-dye microdispersions for these studies was performed. This method of imaging was also used to compare the effect of the laser on the effect of the DAPI-Sephadex® and Q-dye microdispersions. In all experiments, the irradiation-induced growth of E. coli was significantly suppressed by the DAPI-Sephadex® and Q-dye microdispersions (Fig 4).


## Discussion
fumigatus [10. We have here demonstrated that a laser pulse pulse of 1.5 V and the fluorescence intensity of A. fumigatus are both dependent on the amount of the laser pulse and that the laser pulse is independent of the initial chemical stimulus. These results suggest that the laser pulse can be used to image A. fumigatus conidia. In addition, the laser pulse at 1.5 V was independent of the initial stimulus, which was a simple addition to the laser pulse and was therefore not a chemical stimulus. The laser pulse at 1.5 V was independent of the initial stimulus, which was the final chemical stimulus, and was therefore the inducer. These results suggest that the laser pulse at 1.5 V can be used to image conidia of A. fumigatus.

In contrast to the laser pulse at 1.5 V, the laser pulse at 1.5 V was independent of the initial stimulus, which was a simple addition to the laser pulse and was therefore not a chemical stimulus. The laser pulse at 1.5 V was independent of the initial stimulus, which was the inducer. These results suggest that the laser pulse at 1.5 V can be used to image conidia of A. fumigatus.

While we have previously demonstrated that the laser pulse at 1.5 V is independent of the initial stimulus, this was the first time that the laser pulse at 1.5 V was dependent on the initial stimulus, and it was therefore the inducer. The results of this study showed that the laser pulse at 1.5 V was independent of the initial stimulus and was therefore the inducer. This is in contrast to the laser pulse at 1.5 V where the laser pulse at 1.5 V was dependent on the initial stimulus, and this suggests that the laser pulse at 1.5 V can be used to image conidia of A. fumigatus.

In contrast to our previous study, our results also show that the laser pulse at 1.5 V is independent of the initial stimulus, which is a simple addition to the laser pulse and was therefore independent of the initial stimulus. This is in contrast to the laser pulse at 1.5 V where the laser pulse at 1.
