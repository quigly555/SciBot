## Abstract
In this study, we established an in vitro assay that is capable of detecting down-stream variations in the quality of the effective dose of Amphotericin B against the target pathogen. This method was applied to confirm its performance against the clinical isolate of Cryptococcus gattii. The assay was performed at a concentration of 0.2-32 mg/mL and monitored over a 24-hours period by analysing the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values. The obtained results were compared with those reported for the pharmaceutical or clinical isolate of C. neoformans. The in vitro assay was performed as previously reported for the C. neoformans clinical strain (v2) and the C. gattii clinical strain (v.1). The assay was performed at a time-course analysis of the growth pattern of the fungus under different light conditions. The results were compared with those obtained for the reference drug, the reference drug only (v2). The in vitro assay was used to confirm the performance of the standard in vitro assay against the standard in a clinical isolate of C. neoformans. The results obtained were comparable to those obtained in the reference drug, the reference drug only (v2) and a small concentration of amphotericin B (v2) were more effective than the standard in vitro assay against C. neoformans.


## Introduction

## Methods
The high sensitivity and specificity of the method were checked by the analysis of the data in the experimental dat. The results were expressed as percentage of positive results with each assay [16].

3.3. Meningitis Susceptibility Testing
The Meningitis phenotype was evaluated according to the definition of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [17]. The CSLSI is a two-state clinical scoring system based on the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Stu I. The criterion used for Meningitis is the presence of marked, weak, or absent (that is, marked, weak-absence or absent) areas of visible redness or monotony on the surface of the cells. The absence of marked, weak, or absent areas of visible redness is a sign of Meningitis, and this is considered as a sign of Meningitis-related morbidity [18]. The minimum score is the minimum score required for admission into the hospital, and the maximum score is the maximum score required to enter the hospital for admission into the hospital. The Meningitis score ranges from 0 (no Meningitis) to 6, and the scores are taken as indicating the minimum score required to enter the hospital for admission. The CSLSI recommends the following tests: India ink staining and/or microscopy, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and India ink staining for differential interference contrast. The standard laboratory culture of the sample was used for the diagnosis of Meningitis. The samples were tested on the basis of clinical results and results of the microbiology and immunology. The test was performed by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of Meningitis. Meningitis was defined as a single blood-FACS and/or a blood-Lung blood culture test.

3.4. Microbiology
The culture of the blood culture was performed using a standard admission test, in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) [19]. A negative blood-FACS was considered a positive result. A positive blood-Lung culture was considered a positive result. The culture was performed by using a positive blood-FACS and/or a positive blood-Sommerner culture test.

## Results
pylori leads to lymphadenopathy and lymphadenopath. Therefore, we next assessed the cytokine response of lymphocytes during H. pylori infection. Three days after the initial infection, the viability of lymphocytes in the lymphopenic compartment was measured. The expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD11d, CD11e, CD11f, CD11g, CD11h, CD11i, CD11j, CD11k, CD11m, CD11n, CD11o, CD11p, and CD11q was significantly decreased in the lymphopenic compartment (Fig 7). Interestingly, a significant increase in the expression of CD11d, CD11c, CD11d, CD11e, CD11f, CD11g, CD11h, CD11i, CD11k, CD11m, CD11n, CD11o, CD11p, and CD11q was observed in the lymphopenic compartment (Fig 7).


## Discussion
neoformans infected macaques and macrophages was assessed by measuring serum fungal burden (Fungi-related antigen) and cell surface antigen (CM antigen) level. The serum fungal burden in this study was significantly higher in the lung and bronchial tissues compared to the lymphatic tissues, which was the most basal state in the control group, but significantly decreased in the lymphatic tissues of infected mice. The Fungi-related antigen serum level was significantly lower in the lung and bronchial tissues than in the lymphatic tissues of the infected mice. The observed differences in the fungal burden in lymphatic tissues of C. neoformans infected mice were not due to any preexisting immunological differences between the lymphatic tissues and lungs of C. neoformans infected mice.

In the lungs, the mice infected with C. neoformans had significantly higher fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than the mice infected with C. gattii (P = 0.028) and S. commune (P = 0.0006). However, the lymphatic tissues of mice infected with S. commune had significantly lower fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs (P = 0.0006).

In the lung, the mice infected with C. gattii had significantly higher fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs of infected mice. The lungs of infected mice had significantly lower fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs of infected mice (P = 0.0006). In addition, the lungs of infected mice had significantly lower fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs of infected mice (P = 0.0006). The difference in the lymphatic tissues between the lungs and the lungs of infected mice was not due to any preexisting differences in the immune response between the lungs and the lungs of the infected mice.

In the bronchial tissues, the lungs of C. neoformans infected mice had significantly lower fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs of infected mice. The lungs of infected mice had significantly lower fungal burdens in the lymphatic tissues than in the lungs of infected mice (P = 0.0006).

The results of the immunological studies with C. neoformans infected macaques suggest that the immune response against C.
