## Abstract
The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-Candida activities of essential oils from the leaves of Corus spongiosus (Corbus spongiosus, Camellia sinensis, Corus vulgaris, and Corus ascospongiosus of Cyperaceae) and their related medicinal products against three clinical strains of candidiasis.

The essential oils of Cyperaceae (C. sinensis, C. ascospongiosus, and C.

The presence of CD15+ V<U+03D5>V<U+03D6> lymphocytes was not observed in this study, although CD15+ V<U+03D5>V<U+03D6> lymphocytes were found in the hematopoietic trac. This finding was consistent with the finding of CD15+ V<U+03D5>V<U+03D6> lymphocytes in the kidney and liver tissues.

## Methods
The V5 cells were generated by . gattii infection of the epithelial cell line T-cell line JEC21, which is the primary source of T-cell line-mediated immune response in non-infected peripheral blood (Pritchard et al., 2010). Briefly, 10^7 cells of the V5 cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 medium for 48 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed in 10% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with primary antibody conjugated with anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Pharmingen, MO, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and mounted on a glass slide with 10% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and imaged using an Olympus BX41 microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and a UPlanView Pro Imaging System (Universal Imaging, Hayward, CA, USA).

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were conducted in a specific pathogen-free facility at Duke University Medical Center and were approved by the Duke University Medical Research Ethics Committee (Approval No. A-07-003/11/17).

Histology
The glioma, glioma, and glioma cells were cultured in YPD liquid medium at 37°C overnight and harvested by centrifugation (8000×g, 5 min, 4°C) and fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as previously described (Chang et al., 2015). The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature.


## Results
. Identification of the Genome-Wide Strain of the Propolis Bacterial Load
In the present study, the original BIOF is present in the BIOF that is successfully submitted to sequencing. The BIOF of the wild BIOF was submitted to the Genome-Wide Strain (GUS) algorithm [14] and was used as the reference for the construct described here. The BIOF was submitted to the Protein Expression Omnibus (PEO) [15] using a curated collection of 16S rRNA gene sequences and a BIOF database. The PEO database includes a number of functional categories, including ribosomal protein binding, protein-protein interactions, and protein fate (http://www.proteomics.org/). The PEO database includes 32 enzymes for BIOF-mediated processes (Table 1), including enzymes involved in the degradation of protein and nucleic acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and cell membrane biogenesis (Table 2). The GUS algorithm was used to predict the BIOF protein functions and determine the predicted fold changes. The GUS algorithm predicted a minimum of 2 fold changes in the protein profiles, with most of the higher-order categories showing a consistent pattern of expression across the two biological replicates.

2.2. Proteomic Analysis of the BIOF
To identify the protein proteins involved in the degradation of the BIOF, the GUS algorithm was used to predict the predicted protein fold changes (Table 3). The GUS algorithm predicted a minimum of 1.


## Discussion
neoformans had a protective role in the patient’s successful treatment with the anti-tumor drug fluconazol. In our patient, however, the anti-tumor drug fluconazole did not protect him from ventricular Bulldo and ventricular cesarean section. We also observed that the patient had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing with C. neoformans infection. In contrast, in the case of C. gattii, a CD4+ T cell immunodeficiency was identified in the patient and the co-infection was considered to be secondary to a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing. Therefore, we speculate that the mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing could have been the cause of the ventricular cesarean section and the mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing. This hypothesis is further supported by the following observations. First, the patient had a CD4+ T cell immunodeficiency which was identified in the patient and the co-infection was considered to be secondary to a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing. Second, the patient had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing and was treated with fluconazole. Third, the patient had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing and was treated with fluconazole. The patient also had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing and was treated with fluconazole. However, the patient had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing with the patient and was treated with fluconazole. The patient also had a mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing with the patient and was treated with fluconazole.

A second possible explanation for the mixed CD4+ T cell/CD8+ T cell co-existing is the release of IL-13p70 in the blood and other tissue.
