## Abstract
The L-amino acids were found to be more potent against . neoformans than were the essential oils. The essential oils were more potent against S. Typhimurium and S. Typhimurium than the essential oils.


## Introduction
 F.
The trichophyton species Trichophyton violaceum (Lacc.) Fr. were the most active among the genera of the genus. These fungi were associated with various plant species, including several species of the genera Phyllix, Chrysosperma, Chrysosperma and Zingiberia. Some of them, such as Trichophyton flavescens and Trichophyton tonsurans, showed to be active in causing leaf spot and leaf curl diseases on various plant hosts. Other Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton aureus, Trichophyton spp. and Trichophyton tonsurans, were found to be active in different plant hosts. However, some of these species were not found in the majority of leaf spots on leaves of Phyllix, Chrysosperma, Zingiberia and/or Chrysosperma spp. On the other hand, some species of Trichophyton spp. were found in some important leaf spots of Phyllix, Chrysosperma, Zingiberia, or Chrysosperma spp.

The taxonomy of the genus Trichophyton has been based on morphological characteristics, including the phoretic, trichophyton-shaped conidia that are produced on the surface of the conidiophore, and the presence of the hyphal apparatus. Most species are found in the genera Candida, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. dubliniensis, C. duboisii, C. krusei and C. duboisiae, to name a few. In the past few years, a few species of the genus Trichophyton were found to cause leaf spots on different leafy hosts. For example, Botrytis cinerea (syn. C. albicans), C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. krusei and C. krusei, were reported as the most frequent genera of leaf spots on leaves of Phyllix, Chrysosperma, and Zingiberia.


## Methods
brasiliensis and on the antifungal activity of the tested fungal isolates, a standard set of tests was applie. Fungal cultures were grown in nutrient broth and then transferred to the microtitre plates. Plates were incubated at 35°C for 72 h. Fungal colonies were counted after 72 h, and the percentage inhibition of growth was calculated as the ratio between the diameter of fungal colony and the diameter of colony-forming units.

Fungal colonization was defined as a colony forming unit (CFU) on which fungal growth was inhibited by the tested fungal isolate. In addition, the percentage inhibition of fungal growth was calculated as the ratio between the diameter of colony-forming units and the diameter of colony-forming units.

The inhibition of growth of P. brasiliensis and P. brasiliensis by the tested fungal isolates was expressed as a percentage of inhibition of fungal growth in the tested fungal isolates.

## Results
DNA-DNA extraction with Ni^2+-NTA was performed on the three strains. The results showed that a high number of reads were obtained from the three strains, which was further confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). The DNA was extracted with Ni^2+-NTA on the four samples, and the results showed that a high amount of reads were obtained from the four strains (Figure 1).

The absorbance values of Ni^2+-NTA on the different strains were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that the Ni^2+-NTA successfully extracted the greenish-greenish green fluorescence signal in all the samples (Figure 2).

The Ni^2+-NTA was also performed on the four strains. The results showed that a high amount of reads were obtained from the four strains, which was further confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown).

## Discussion
We have shown that there is a large difference between the two species in the degree of phylogenetic analysis of genes in A. fumigatus and A. parasiticus. We observed that the two species are much closer to each other, with both showing high similarity in the degree of phylogenetic analysis. This is in contrast to other fungi, such as C. neoformans [23], which show low similarity in the degree of phylogenetic analysis.

Genome-wide BLAST searches of the NCBI and LSU databases for the gene families involved in the filamentous fungus A. parasiticus, showed that genes in the two species are highly similar in terms of the degree of phylogenetic analysis, whereas genes in A. fumigatus are highly divergent. This may be due to the fact that in A. fumigatus, the number of genes is smaller than in A. parasiticus, which is also a dimorphic fungus. A. parasiticus, on the other hand, is a dimorphic fungus with a heterodimeric cell cycle that results in a shorter cell cycle [24]. The size of the heterodimeric cell is a critical parameter for determining the evolutionary rates of evolution, which is critical for evolution of species. In this study, we found that gene family expansion is more frequent in A. fumigatus than in A. parasiticus, and that this is also true for genes related to the growth and development of the three species. Although the number of genes in the two species is smaller, the genes involved in the pathogenicity of these species are much smaller. This indicates that the two species are able to adapt to each other's environments.

We have observed that genes related to cell wall synthesis are significantly expanded in A. fumigatus, whereas genes related to cell wall biogenesis are significantly expanded in A. parasiticus.
