## Abstract
The VITAL trial (https://bitbucket.org/vital/vital-trial) aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of the new HIV toolkit, the VGII. The aim of this study is to contribute to the public-sector demand for a detailed clinical safety evaluation of newly prescribed drugs by making presentations to stakeholders on a rotating sheet at participating sites in South Africa.

A total of 2,139 newly prescribed HIV drugs were newly prescribed by the VITAL trial: ß-triazoles, posaconazole, caspofungin and rifampicin. Clinical trial results were recorded.

The VGII contains 6,384 pharmacological evaluations, in 35 countries, including the United States, with a global coverage of 31.2%. The estimated number of adverse events due to amphotericin B (1,101 drugs) and flucytosine (769) per 100 000 population by 2060(-) is higher than the reported 2,139 evaluations (2,139).

The systematic review of safety aspects of newly prescribed drugs found that the most important adverse events were headache (79%), nausea (22%), vomiting (19%), nausea/vomiting (7%) and gastroenteritis (6%). There was a positive association between amphotericin B (84%), flucytosine (75%) and high blood lymphocyte count (73%).

We found a moderate probability of adverse events due to amphotericin B, particularly among newly prescribed drugs. Further investigation into the causative factor of these adverse events in newly prescribed drugs is warranted, especially in the developing countries.


## Introduction
For example, macrophages activated by TNFa expression are activated by increased IL-1ß and IL-17A production, and increased IL-12 and IL-18 production in the phagolysosome of T cells [11. In contrast, IL-1ß and IL-18 were not found in the plasma of macrophages activated by Toll-R<U+03B3>-stimulated IL-1ß and IL-18 production.

In addition to TNFa, other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, IL-22, and IL-22, have been reported to be expressed in macrophages as well as in Th1 cells. IL-1ß and IL-22 have been associated with the development of Th1 immunity [12,13]. Both cytokines are produced by activated macrophages and can activate macrophages to produce IFN-<U+03B3> inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and IL-12, which are important for host defense against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites [14]. IL-1 and IL-22 have been also found in the phagolysosome of macrophages as well as in the phagolysosome of Th1 cells [15]. Th1 cells produce IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-10, which are important for the induction of Th1 responses [16]. However, the roles of macrophage inflammatory responses in macrophage phagocytosis and its interaction with macrophages have not been investigated.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed on both cells and tissues. TLR2 recognizes ß-glucans on the surface of B- and T cells, and TLR4 recognizes the interkingdom ß-1,3-glucan [17,18]. TLR2 also recognizes ß-glucans on the surface of Th1 cells and Th17 cells [19]. However, there are some drawbacks to this approach. Although the mechanism of TLR signaling is not fully understood, the majority of studies have shown that TLR2 has a negative impact on phagocytosis, and it could interact with host cells by altering their physiology [20,21,22,23].


## Methods
A detailed description of the materials and methods used for the preparation of the extracts and extracts from plant materials has been published elsewhere (Liu et al. 2013, 2015).

2.1. Preparation of Ethanol Extracts
The standard of prepared extract was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Academy of Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and was used in the study of the effects of tree growth on the growth of fungi on tree growth (Naw et al. 2010). The standard is composed of the dried and powdered extract of the tobacco root, and is usually used for the preparation of the standard in the procedures of plant biochemistry and cell cycle.

2.2. Testing of the Effect of Tree Growth on the Effects of Tree Growth on the Fruit
To test the effects of tree growth on the effects of tree growth on the effects of tree growth on the fruit, the leaf and root diameters of the tree were measured. The leaf diameters of the root-sporocidal fruits were measured in the two-tree plots of a commercial plantation in Beijing (Table 1).


## Results
Identification of the new gene family
The new P-type lectin is thought to be present in several other fungal species and in ascomycetes [22]. The P-type lectin has been implicated in host cell interactions [9], [10], [11].

The new P-type lectin is not present in the N. crassa genome

## Discussion
We present the case of a patient with AIDS with no signs of HIV. The patient had a history of IV drug use. He had been in a good condition since his initial admission to the hospital, but his HIV diagnosis was negative. His ART history and history of receiving antiretroviral therapy were positive, and the patient was on a good prognosis.

Although HIV is a well-recognized risk factor for opportunistic infection, it is not yet widely known what immune system is involved in this condition. In HIV-infected individuals, it has been reported that most of the patients with AIDS present with a subclinical, or transient, initial immune response to viral infections [27]. This early immune response is associated with lower mortality in the absence of opportunistic infections [28].
