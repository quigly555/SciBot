## Abstract
The discovery of new antimicrobial drugs has been driven by the discovery of multidrug-resistant strains, the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms, and the increasing use of synthetic drugs.


## Introduction

Among the opportunistic fungi, Candida albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathoge. It is capable of causing serious fungal infections, such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida glabrata, in addition to superficial and deep mucosal infections, such as oral candidiasis, candidemia and candidemia-associated candidemia (Cos et al., 2015).

Considering that Candida albicans is considered the most common fungal pathogen, it is necessary to identify new antifungal drug targets. Currently, the most common target used in the control of Candida infections in patients with immunodeficiency is the azole drug, fluconazole, which is widely used in the treatment of candidiasis. However, the lack of effective antifungal drugs increases the need for development of new antifungal drugs. For instance, we used the antimycotic azoles echinocandins (caspofungin or miconazole) and itraconazole (iconazole) as drugs for the treatment of candidiasis in AIDS patients (Cos et al., 2015).

It has been shown that in non-albicans Candida species, the cell wall is the major barrier against many of the most common pathogenic fungi, such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (Morales-Chari et al., 2004; Pfaller et al., 2006; Schenk and Diekema, 2011). It is known that the cell wall can be disrupted by numerous mechanisms, such as physical, biochemical and mechanical damage. The metal can either be degraded, preserved or converted to its non-catalytic form in the presence of oxygen. In the latter case, the toxic ROS are generated during the degradation process. Therefore, the degradation of the ligand-binding site (LBS) can be considered as a major mode of the generation of toxic ROS and can be considered as an antifungal target (see below).


## Methods
The protocol for the use of infected hosts was approved by the Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals and ethical review was carried out according to the guideline. Inoculated hosts were divided into three groups according to the groups that received antibiotics. In each group, the antibiotics were given at the concentration of 100 mg/ml and used in the following combinations: cyclosporine (100 mg/ml), tricyclazole (100 mg/ml), and nystatin (100 mg/ml). All the host samples were incubated for 5 days at 37°C and no growth of bacteria was observed. The positive result of the antibiotic treatments was considered as positive for growth of bacteria. The viability of the bacterial strains was determined by the E-test method using the BacT/ALERT reagent and the bacterial growth in the medium was determined by the viability of the bacteria by the viability of the host. The experiments were repeated three times.

Anti-caspase-1 (CCS-1) Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of CCS-1 was determined by the method of Wang and Li [9] using two single- and two-compartmental plates. Inoculated hosts were divided into three groups according to the groups that received the different antibiotics. Inoculated hosts were divided into three groups according to the groups that received the antibacterial drugs. Inoculated hosts were treated with the following combinations of the antibiotics: cyclosporine (100 mg/ml), CCS-1 (100 mg/ml), and CCS-2 (100 mg/ml). Inoculated hosts were incubated for 2 days at 37°C and no growth of bacteria was observed. The antifungal activity of the bacteria was determined by the E-test method using the BacT/ALERT reagent and the bacterial growth in the medium was determined by the viability of the bacteria by the viability of the host. The experiments were repeated three times.

Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of CCS-1 was determined by the method of Kim and Li [9] using two single- and two-compartmental plates. Inoculated hosts were divided into three groups according to the groups that received the different antibiotics.


## Results

There were 49 virulence factors that were differentially regulated in both HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells (Supplementary Table S5. The most significant virulence factors were fungal virulence factors that were significantly regulated in both HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells (Table 4). The most significant virulence factors were cell wall and membrane permeabilization. The most significant virulence factors in HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells were cell wall, membrane permeabilization, and cell wall/membrane permeabilization. The most significant virulence factors in HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells were cell wall, membrane permeabilization, and cell membrane permeabilization. The most significant virulence factors in HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells were cell wall, membrane permeabilization, and cell membrane permeabilization. The most significant virulence factors in HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells were cell wall, membrane permeabilization, and cell membrane permeabilization.

The P4-like protein, VORF, was significantly regulated in both HbR<U+0394> and B<U+0394>EV<U+0394> cells (Table 4).

## Discussion

Our study also revealed that . asperelloides has a greater capacity to cause T. asperelloides-related infections in non-HIV infected patients. Interestingly, the T. asperelloides isolates were highly resistant to azole drugs (MIC = 1,000 µg/mL), and the MICs of fluconazole and itraconazole were 2,000 µg/mL (Table 3). In addition, the susceptibility of T. asperelloides was highly susceptible to fluconazole, and the MICs of itraconazole and itraconazole were 2,000 µg/mL (Table 3).

In a clinical setting, patients with T. asperelloides infections are often treated with fluconazole or amphotericin B, which may result in substantial morbidity and mortality [3]. Therefore, the treatment of T. asperelloides-related infections is highly dependent on the patient's immune status, including inflammatory disease, immune reconstitution, and drug resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that T. asperelloides has the ability to cause lethal T. asperelloides-related infections in non-HIV patients. This is particularly interesting given that non-HIV patients with T. asperelloides infections have the highest incidence of T. asperelloides-related infections in the general population [1]. In addition, patients with fungal infections may have lower susceptibility to azole drugs. For example, the most frequently used antifungal for the treatment of invasive mycoses is fluconazole. Although the mechanisms by which T. asperelloides increases the susceptibility of this fungus to azole drugs remain unknown, the reports that T. asperelloides increased the susceptibility of T. asperelloides to fluconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B in non-HIV patients support the hypothesis that T. asperelloides is more resistant to azole drugs than azole-resistant strains [2].

Our study also found that T. asperelloides isolates in the non-HIV population were significantly more resistant to azole drugs, especially fluconazole and itraconazole.
