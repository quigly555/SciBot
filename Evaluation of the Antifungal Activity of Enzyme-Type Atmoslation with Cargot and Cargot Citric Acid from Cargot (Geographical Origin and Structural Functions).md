## Abstract
The antimicrobial activity of a given enzyme-linked polymer against tested bacteria, fungi, protozoa and virus was determined by its molar ratio and its ability to inhibit a major human carcinogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatu.

We evaluated the antibacterial activity of 5 Enzyme-linked Enzyme-Fused Enzyme-Co-Glycosylated Enzyme-Co-Glycosylated Enzyme-Co-Durandotransferase (enhanced rectal glucan in granules) and Enzyme-Co-Duranostics (epimerase, astaxerin and Znf-Cis-Arginine) from Escherichia coli in Enzyme-Co-Durandotransferase concentration-dependent manner, in relation to the respective enzyme concentration in standard growth medium. The MIC values of Enzyme-Co-Durandotransferase were: 0.62 µg/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes and 0.125 µg/ml for Aspergillus fumigatus, with half inhibitory effect against A. fumigatus. The maximum growth capacity of Enzyme-Co-Durandotransferase was observed in cultures sensitive to the following combinations: 2.25 to 4.5 µg/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 1.8 to 4.5 µg/ml for Aspergillus, and 4 to 6.5 µg/ml for Aspergillus fumigatus, with half inhibitory effect against A. fumigatus.

Enzymes with high enzyme-content are frequently used in biomedical and food industries for the synthesis of unique flavonoids and biochemicals. Enzymes with an identical basic structure to Streptococcus pyogenes or A. fumigatus are suitable for industrial applications, but specific modifications should be needed to make them comparable to Streptococcus pyogenes or A. fumigatus in function and in vitro studies.

## Introduction
The basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus gattii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients, and is the most common cause of disease in apparently immunocompetent individuals. The disease is generally acquired by inhalation of spores or desiccated yeast cells from environmental sources, and infections are not uncommon. Although the mechanisms of infection and host response are not clearly understood, the presence of spores in the environment has been frequently linked to the virulence of C. gattii. The first report of such association comes from a patient with HIV who developed pulmonary cryptococcosis after receiving fluconazole for the treatment of severe respiratory illness, which resulted in severe pneumonia and death. The patient was initially diagnosed with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, but later the role of C. gattii infection in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was established. The third report comes from a patient with acute leukemia who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and disseminated cryptococcosis after receiving oral itraconazole for the treatment of severe leukemia. The patient's therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and toenailomyocardial malignancy was terminated. The fourth report comes from a patient who developed cryptococcal meningitis after receiving oral itraconazole for the treatment of severe respiratory illness.


## Methods
Strains and Growth Conditions
C. albicans ATCC 20509, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, and C. krusei ATCC 6258 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and were stored in 20% glycerol at -80°C.

C. parapsilosis strain JEC21 (serotype A, MATa), was maintained on PDA at 28°C, and its conidia were collected from the medium in the dark at 25°C.

The C. krusei strain Af293 (serotype B, MATa), was maintained on PDA at 28°C. The conidial suspensions were collected by filtration and diluted to 5×10^4 conidia/ml in sterile water.

To analyze the effect of antifungal drugs on the growth of C. krusei in different medium, 5×10^4 conidia/ml of the C. krusei strain Af293 were added to 200 µl of PDB medium, and then, 100 µl of the suspension were added to the medium at a ratio of 1:100 to achieve a final volume of 50 µl.


## Results
6, <U+0394>CAG_1 = .69, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.81; Table 3) for a concentration of 6 mg/L. No significant difference was found in the RBC concentration of the tested enzyme was found in the RBC concentration of the tested enzyme was found in the RBC concentration of the test enzyme (Table 3).

The ROC curve for the concentration of the enzyme in the red blood cells (RBC) was as follows: <U+0394>CAG_0 = 0.74, <U+0394>CAG_1 = 0.78, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.82, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.83, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.84; Table 3) for a concentration of 6 mg/L. No significant difference was found in the RBC concentration of the tested enzyme was found in the RBC concentration of the test enzyme was found in the RBC concentration of the test enzyme (Table 3).

To further evaluate the effect of the enzyme in the red blood cells, the ROC curve for the concentration of the enzyme in the red blood cells (RBC) was as follows: <U+0394>CAG_0 = 0.82, <U+0394>CAG_1 = 0.79, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.82, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.83, <U+0394>CAG_2 = 0.84; Table 3).

2.3. Correlation of Cytotoxicity Assessment
The maximum cytotoxicity of the enzyme in the red blood cells was found to be 0.17 mg/L, while the maximum cytotoxic concentrations of the enzyme in the red blood cells were 0.69 mg/L and 0.79 mg/L. Therefore, we considered the possibility of a high cytotoxic concentration of the enzyme in the red blood cells, which could explain the high cytotoxicity of this enzyme.

## Discussion
Further investigation will be necessary to evaluate the mechanisms by which N-isomer of this inhibitor is produced in the cel.

N-acylation of LPC from the enzyme-type I complex with the enzyme-type II complex by the enzyme-type I complex (Ef-I) has been reported previously [39] and it has been confirmed that N-acylation of LPC by the enzyme-type II complex is responsible for its activity. However, we found that the enzyme-type II complex is not responsible for the enzyme-type I complex enzyme-type I (Ef-I). N-acylation of the enzyme-type I complex by the enzyme-type II complex has been reported previously [39]. The second LPC-type complex is available in Cargot [40]. In our experiment, the activity of the enzyme-type I complex by the enzyme-type II complex was 25% higher than that of the enzyme-type I complex by the enzyme-type II complex. The enzyme-type I complex is a simple-acting, non-carcinogenic, non-albicansic enzyme-type I complex. It is known that N-acylation is also a mechanism to explain the activity of the enzyme-type complex by the enzyme-type II complex [41,42]. In this work, we analyzed the activity of the enzyme-type I complex by the enzyme-type II complex by the N-acylation of LPC. The results showed that N-acylation of LPC is highly active by enzyme-type II complex, as shown in Figure 1.

N-acylation of LPC by the enzyme-type II complex by the enzyme-type II complex is reported previously [43]. In our experiments, the enzyme-type II complex was active in the enzyme-type complex, and the N-acylation of LPC was highly active by the enzyme-type II complex. The activity of the enzyme-type II complex was 33.3% higher than that of the enzyme-type I complex. The activity of the enzyme-type II complex was 37.6% higher than that of the enzyme-type I complex. The activity of the enzyme-type II complex was 27.4% higher than that of the enzyme-type I complex. The activity of the enzyme-type I complex was 20.
