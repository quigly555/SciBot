## Abstract

Liguria inglese, è una delle pienamento inappropriata e la riduzione dei costi e della diffusione delle reazioni biotechnologically relevant, che è una popolazione più efficiente di ognuna delle caratteristiche idonee e delle reazioni industrially relevant e Strategie di Prevenzione e coordinamento dei servizi agricole e degli ambienti climatic.

L’acqua è una crescente attenzione, a causa delle maggiori outcomes delle attività di ristorazione e della salute della popolazione a favore della pratica, dai risultati, dei costi e dell’utilizzo delle reazioni biotechnologiche. È quindi interessante bisogni di salute che hanno una frequenza delle reazioni effettuate e di rilevare la popolazione anziana e i costi delle reazioni di ristorazione e della salute delle popolazioni.

La promozione di una fitta reazionamento all’interno delle attività di ristorazione e della salute delle reazioni derivanti dall’acqua è, infine, una collaborazione multidisciplinare e multidisciplinare per la promozione di una reazione integrata su reazioni economici e politiche necessarie.

La reazione della promozione della salute, della sorveglianza igienico-sanitaria e della ristorazione collettiva attraverso l’istituzione di acqua e propri Piani Nazionari sul Corregiano delle reazioni alimentari, si attesta una strategia obbligatoria dall’OMS.


## Introduction
The genus Pseudomonas is a well-known species in the family Pseudomonas, which are distinguished based on the color of the ascospores, the size of the ascospores, and the presence or absence of a sexual life stage. Pseudomonas sp. is a plant pathogen that causes black mold disease on over 200 different plant species and causes economic losses of up to 50% [1]. Pseudomonas fijiensis is an ascomycete that is considered as the “super-pathogen”, and the first plant pathogenic isolate isolated from Pseudomonas sp. was reported in the year 1955 [2]. The pathogenicity of P. fijiensis is attributed to its ability to form appressoria that may penetrate plant epidermis and invade host cell [3]. The penetration of the host cell by P. fijiensis is a major source of infection and spread in nature. In this respect, P. fijiensis is known to be a potential biocontrol agent [4]. However, the molecular basis of the interaction between P. fijiensis and host plant remains unclear.

Recent studies have shown that the interaction between Pseudomonas sp. and its host plant is likely to be highly specific. For instance, in Pseudomonas syringae, the interaction between Pseudomonas sp. and its host can be as broad as the phoretic host, being bacteriophage-borne pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, unlike Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium insidiosum is not capable of pathogenesis [5]. In contrast, P.


## Methods

Lipid content of the isolate was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and the results were confirmed by measuring the oil-accent intensit.

Fungal strains used in this study were isolated from clinical samples of patients with Chronic Fatty Acid (CFA) and Mycosis (ME) and Clinical Fatty Acid Content (CFACT) on the basis of the results of the fermentation culture.

The identification of these fungal strains was based on morphological characteristics, growth on PDA and on PDA supplemented with 10% glycerol, and susceptibility to antifungal drugs.

Identification of Fungal Mutant
The identification of fungal mutants was performed by PCR screening of the amplicon library using primers specific to the Fungal Mutant Index (MIPI) gene from the Fungal Genome Database (http://fungidb.org/index.php) and the PCR profile of the fungus and bacteria were performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then sequenced using ABI Prism BigDye terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequencing results were analysed with the SeqMan Pro v.7.0.0 software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).

Sequence Analysis and Analysis
Sequences of the eight isolates were obtained from NCBI GenBank using the BioEdit program (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioproject/bioedit.html). Sequences of the MIPI gene were assembled using the SMART online tool (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. The MIPI sequences were aligned using ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) with default parameters. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.


## Results
pastoris
In the current . pastoris PGEU and PGEU2 reference microplates, only the PGEU1 model had a significant change of the PGEU2 (P < 0.05) model as compared to the PGEU1 (Table 2). The PGEU1 model had an increase of 1.9 and 1.9-fold in number of inducible genes compared to the PGEU1 model, respectively (Table 2). The increase of 1.7 and 1.9-fold in the PGEU1 model was associated with a small increase of 1.5-fold in the number of inducible genes, respectively (Table 2).

The PGEU2 model also had an increase of 0.9 and 0.9-fold in the number of inducible genes compared to the PGEU1 model, respectively (Table 2).

To evaluate the importance of PGEU2 in the process of PGEU production by P. pastoris, the PGEU1 and PGEU2 reference microplates were coated with fungal polysaccharide, and the PGEU1 and PGEU2 microplates were prepared with fungal cell wall-perturbing-fluorescein isothiocyanin (FITC) as a control. The results indicated that the fungal cell wall-perturbing-fluorescein isothiocyanin (FITC) is more efficient than the cell wall-perturbing-fluorescein isothiocyanin (FCIT) (P < 0.05) model. The PGEU1 model had an increase of 2.3 and 1.3-fold in number of inducible genes compared to the PGEU2 model, respectively (Table 2).

The PGEU2 model had an increase of 0.9 and 0.9-fold in the number of inducible genes compared to the PGEU1 model, respectively (Table 2).

The PGEU1 and PGEU2 models had an increase of 1.7 and 1.6-fold in number of inducible genes compared to the PGEU1 model, respectively (Table 2).

The PGEU1 model had an increase of 0.9 and 1.


## Discussion
The hydrothermal vent system was characterized by the presence of microbial communities comprising a significant proportion of different microorganisms (Figure 1) that exhibited similar or higher relative abundances of the three biofuels (Figure 2. However, as the hydrothermal vent system is an extremely sensitive and time-consuming control system, the results obtained could be used as a model for other control systems (e.g., control of microbial communities by simulation or prediction in a batch method [57]) and for biofuels production (e.g., biofuel conversion by bioaerobic microorganisms).

In the present study, we characterized the microbial communities of different types of biofuels substrates and hydrothermal vent biofuels (Figure 3A, 3B, and 3C) in a hydrothermal vent system of the Sudan Biomass Power Conversion Plant (SBIPRP) in Sudan. The total microbial community was represented by 58.7% (Figure 3B) and 62.2% (Figure 3C) of the total community of the biofuels, respectively (Figure 2). The richness and diversity of the microbial community were similar for the three biofuels (Figure 3B) and hydrothermal vent system (Figure 3C) in comparison with the total community of the three biofuels (Figure 2). The microbial community of the three biofuels were dominated by the phylotypes BSI (Agaricomycetes), ITS (Ascomycota), and LSU (Sordariales). The differences in the phylotypes between the biofuels and the hydrothermal vent system may be due to the different thermal conditions in the two hydrothermal vent systems.

The highest abundance of the phylotypes BSI (Ascomycota) and ITS (Ascomycota) phylotypes were detected in the biofuels (Figure 3A) and hydrothermal vent system (Figure 3C). The phylotypes of the three biofuels were dominated by the phylotypes BSI (Ascomycota), ITS (Ascomycota) and LSU (Sordariales).
