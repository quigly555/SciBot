## Abstract
We report a case of a 71-year-old man with a history of anorexia with a concurrent hypothyreosis and a history of corticosteroid use for the last 5 years. The patient presented with a past history of inappropriate hyperglycemia-a condition of digestion and growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-for the past 1 year. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus-for the past 2 years. The patient had a past medical history that included a diabetes card. Cultures were consistent with a Mycosphaerella wienenschaftii infection. The patient's CSF culture was negative with positive scintigraphy for Mucoromyces. The patient's symptoms were non-specific and were easily controlled by anti-fungal therapy. Our case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing Mycosphaerella wienenschaftii in a systemic setting and the difficulties in monitoring fungal infection in a non-infectious setting.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a major fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a disease that is particularly prevalent in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV positive patients, organ transplant recipients, and cancer patients [1,2].


## Methods
 from the plant collection of the Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, University of Melsung, South Kore. The DNA extract was subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses using the MEGA 6.0 software and the results are shown in Table 1.

To analyze the patterns of introns for the putative intron presence in Thymaca spp., a DNA extract was taken from the thymacoccava, Thymaca spp., from the plant collection of the Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, University of Melsung, South Korea. The DNA extract was subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses using the MEGA 6.0 software and the results are shown in Table 1.

## Results
Among the genes we identified, we found two genes that are highly conserved in both the siderophore biosynthesis pathway and the biosynthesis of polyketide synthase (PKS) (Table S7) (Table S8. PKS is a gene that is known to be essential in the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and it is also involved in the synthesis of nonribosomal peptides and enzymes for degradation of fungal cell wall polysaccharides, including cellulose, chitin, and chitin deacetylase (7, 8, 17-19). The first step in the biosynthesis of pKS in S. cerevisiae was the production of nonribosomal peptides (NRPS), which is a marker for the pathogenic fungi (20). In addition, pKS and PKS-like sequences have been found in a number of fungi (22, 23, 24). The PKS gene cluster identified in the S. cerevisiae genome encodes a high-throughput region that contains the first two major transmembrane domains, the WD40 domain and the WD28 domain, and contains four transmembrane regions that are conserved in all fungi (Table S8). This region is encoded by a gene with a predicted C-terminal region (Fig S5), and is very similar to that of the WD28 domain in other fungi (23). The predicted C-terminal region was also found in the genome of S. cerevisiae, with the exception that the PKS gene cluster in S. cerevisiae is located in the WD28 domain.

Next, we used the highly-throughput sequencing of the S. cerevisiae genome to identify the genes encoding proteins with putative functions that were expressed in the mpr4<U+0394> strain. In addition, we analyzed the expression profile of mpr4<U+0394> gene in the mpr4<U+0394> siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster (Table S9).


## Discussion
albican.

The airway mucosa of patients with mucormycosis is highly immunocompromised, with a high burden of HIV-infected individuals and a high incidence of malignancies. In the context of mucormycosis, C. albicans is the most common yeast associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is commonly found in the mucosal surfaces of humans (30, 31). Human mucormycosis has a high prevalence in individuals with a history of exposure to mucormycosis (32). It is likely that Tc/LnTN1 could be a downstream factor for the immune response to C. albicans. However, we have not addressed the role of Tc/LnTN1 in the innate immune response to C. albicans. To date, few studies have addressed the role of Tc/LnTN1 in the innate immune response to fungal pathogens. The activation of the T cell response to Candida albicans is mediated by Tc/LnTN1 (32).

Previous studies have reported that Tc/LnTN1 could promote the development of mucormycosis by directly regulating the expression of immunoregulatory genes in the lungs (32). In a murine mucormycosis model, Tc/LnTN1 could inhibit the expression of a secreted protein, IFN-<U+03B3>, and inhibit the activity of a receptor, IPR-1, in the lungs (33). IFN-<U+03B3> is a key cytokine for the innate immune response in mucormycosis and has been reported to be critical for the development of mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients (34). In this study, we found that Tc/LnTN1 could be a downstream factor for the immune response to C. albicans.
