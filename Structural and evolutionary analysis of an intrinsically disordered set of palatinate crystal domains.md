## Abstract
The title compound (systematic name: 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methoxy-2-oxo-5-methyl-1,2,3-dihydroxy-2-methoxy) is a potent and structurally-related phenol derivative that was isolated from Terpinus fusus Lam. The structure was elucidated by spectroscopic studies that showed a H2O2-reducing (HS) and Anaerobacter sp. (serotype A) interacting with hygromycin, and by comparison with the literature. The fundamental principles of this new structure were established on the basis of data from studies carried out in nature, and have provided the basis for the detailed analysis of the spectral compositions of the isolated compounds. A. fususus and their hygromycin-sensitive related (HH) heterologous heteroglans were isolated from a single strain and were characterized by massive 1.5-dipolarization mass spectrometry (DMA).


## Introduction
albicans cell wall protein (Cwc1), which was recently discovered as an unconventional carbohydrate in . albicans cells [9].

The Cwc1 family members are highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms and have been classified into at least 12 groups (group I, II, III, and IV), according to the phylogenetic tree [9]. However, the Cwc1 family members in fungi are not conserved in any of these groups and thus are not considered disordered. In fact, they are classified into different subfamilies, based on the number of amino acid residues in the N-terminal glycine residue. The Cwc1-Cwc2 and Cwc3-Cwc4 are not only important for fungal growth, but are also important for cell differentiation, suggesting that they may be involved in a wide range of physiological processes in fungi, including cell wall biogenesis and cell growth [10]. Furthermore, the Cwc1 and Cwc3-Cwc4 protein interact independently to modulate gene expression in vitro and in vivo in the presence of cell wall stress agents [11], suggesting that Cwc1, Cwc2, and Cwc3 may act synergistically to affect Cwc2-Cwc3 cell differentiation.

Fungal Cwc1 proteins have been previously identified [9], [12], [13]. Fungal Cwc1 proteins share structural and functional similarities with Cwc2, suggesting that they may act synergistically to regulate Cwc1 protein expression and cell differentiation. The Cwc1-Cwc2-Cwc3 protein complex is composed of three major subunits (Cwc1, Cwc2) [9]. Cwc1 proteins have different functions in fungi, which include binding to Cdc20, Cdc20-related genes (S3), p21-related genes (RgC1 and RgC2), and Cdc19/20 [9], [12], [13], [14]. Cwc1 proteins were first identified as interacting with Cdc20 and are involved in cell wall remodelling and cell growth [12]. They also interact with cell surface sensors Cdc1 and Cdc20, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and cell differentiation.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains were routinely cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) at 30°C. Strains were routinely streaked onto yeast-extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium and cultured at 30°C on solid YPD medium.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (H99a) was used as the wild-type strain for gene deletion and complementation. Strains were routinely cultured in liquid YPD medium at 30°C and used as wild-type in experiments.

For P. chrysosporium infection, WT and mutant strains were cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. For P. chrysosporium infection, WT and mutant strains were cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. For P. chrysosporium complementation, WT and mutant strains were cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD medium.

For S. cerevisiae, P. chrysosporium strains were cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. For P. chrysosporium and P. chrysosporium complementation, WT and mutant strains were cultured at 30°C in liquid YPD medium.

## Results
marneffei, we combined our dataset (Supplementary Fig S1) with those from other fungal species and deposited them into a new set of monophyletic groups [17], [19. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the best tree with the best bootstrap support values (Supplementary Table S3). The first four monophyletic groups are shown in Fig 1, which are also the most informative.

The first group (Group I) contains a highly conserved group of monometallic structures (Fig 1). These monometallic structures have a wide range of sizes and are not well defined. The monometallic structures of the tetramolecular groups are remarkably stable and are usually conserved among different fungi. The tetramolecular groups (Group II) and tetramolecular groups (Group III) are usually found in the domains of the fungal species with the exception of the plant fungi and the red alga Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The tetramolecular group II is the most distantly related group, being found in only 10 of the 13 fungal species of the fungal order, whereas the other 10 species share a single monometallic structure. The monometallic structure of the monometallic structures is usually well-defined, as observed in the tetramolecular group II. The monometallic structures of the tetramolecular groups have a wide range of sizes and are not well-defined. The tetramolecular group II, like the monometallic structure of the tetramolecular groups, is not well-defined. The monometallic structures of the tetramolecular groups are usually conserved among different fungi. The monometallic structures of the tetramolecular groups are usually well-defined, as observed in the tetramolecular groups II and III. The monometallic structure of the monometallic structures is usually well-defined, as observed in the tetramolecular groups II and III.

For the five monometallic structures in Group III, the highest conservation was found among the six tetramolecular groups. The monometallic structures of the monometallic structures are generally well-defined, as observed in the monometallic structures of the tetramolecular groups II and III.
