## Abstract
The cell cycle is a dynamic process in eukaryotic cells. It is controlled by a series of interspecific regulatory networks that work together to regulate specific aspects of the physiology of the cells/organelles/fibria/genomes/endosymbionts/endosymbionts. Adaptation is encoded in the endomembrane of genomes by these networks. The endomembrane has evolved primarily to deliver nutrients to the cell and to specialized organelles/fibria/genomes. In contrast, endomembrane mediated transport is also used by symbiotic fungi and by bacteria, but it is not strictly symbiotic.


## Introduction
Phagocytosis is a multistep process by which a microorganism secretes a vast toxic arsenal of biologically active compounds to kill its host cells. Among the diverse metabolites secreted by microorganisms, proteins, lipids, and lipoproteins are known to be the most potent targets for phagocytosis. Some of these substances have been shown to interact with protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules and inhibit phagocytosis of other cells (e.g., alveolar macrophage cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) (1-3). For example, administration of urea is highly effective in decreasing the in vitro phagocytosis of neutrophils (4), but no study has investigated the effects of amikacin and amikacin on the phagocytosis of macrophages in vivo.

Amikacin is a natural antibiotic originally isolated by Purkinje (5) and later used to treat bacterial infections and cancer (6, 7). It is an amikacin derivative derived from the natural peptide N-acetyl-d-gluconate (N-acetyl-d-gluconate) and first showed antifungal activity in vitro (8). A second amikacin derivative, N-acetyl-d-gluconate (N-acetyl-gluconate), was also tested for its antifungal activity and was found to have high activity in vitro and in vivo against Cryptococcus neoformans (9). However, several authors questioned the mechanism of action of N-acetyl-d-gluconate, and questioned whether N-acetyl-d-gluconate is a selective antagonist of C. neoformans.


## Methods
The Central Statistical Office (COSI) has estimated the prevalence of Cryptococcus in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh as > 5% in 2015 and > 20% in 2016, and has published estimates of the prevalence of Cryptococcus in the region for the period 2016-201. The study was conducted with three groups of six adults (n = 6) from a rural area of Nagorno-Karabakh, a city of about 600 km^2 in Nagorno-Karabakh region, the capital city of Nagorno-Karabakh, the capital city of neighboring republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. We enrolled them from January 1, 2015 to November 30, 2017 and the prevalence was calculated for each of the groups.

Study design
The study was conducted using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC/FRTC) methodology [29] and is a cross-sectional study, and all data were collected on all patients. This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Medical Sciences of Nagorno-Karabakh (approval number: CEA/2013/14) and the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

For this study, we defined as cryptococcal meningitis (data not shown). We defined as non-cryptococcal meningitis as those with a clinical diagnosis of Cryptococcus using cryptococcal antigen (CAS) test [30], or meningitis caused by a single cryptococcal antigen reaction (MSR) [31]. For this study, we defined as non-cryptococcal meningitis as those with no detectable cryptococcal antigen reaction after antifungal therapy (ART) [32]. We defined as non-cryptococcal meningitis with a clinical diagnosis of Cryptococcus using Cryptococcus neoformans antigen (CNV) test [23]. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed with the following clinical diagnoses: Cryptococcus meningitis (data not shown).

Isolates
A total of 16 Cryptococcus isolates (Table 1) were recovered from patients with positive CSF cryptococcal antigen tests.


## Results
The most common clinical manifestations are the fever and neurological signs, and cryptococcal meningitis and brain cryptococcoma. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis among rural people in Russia was estimated to be approximately 50% (22).

Cryptococcus infection in rural populations in Russia is closely related to the incidence of HIV infection in Russia. Although HIV infection is generally considered to be the most common HIV-related infection, most of the HIV-infected population in Russia do not have an HIV-infection history. The incidence of HIV infection among HIV-positive rural population in Russia was estimated to be over 50% (23).

Cryptococcus infection in rural populations in Russia is associated with decreased frequency of acute myeloid leukemia and low mortality rate. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia in Russia is estimated to be 0.5% (24). The mortality rate of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in Russia is estimated to be 5% (25). The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia in rural population in Russia is estimated to be 2% (26).

Cryptococcus infection in rural populations in Russia is associated with increased frequency of cryptococcal meningitis, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute neuro-immunity. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and acute neuro-immunity is estimated to be 2% (27). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and acute neuro-immunity is estimated to be 0.5% (28). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in rural populations in Russia is estimated to be 3% (29). The incidence of acute neuro-immunity in Russia is estimated to be 0.3% (30). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in rural populations in Russia is estimated to be 0.3% (31).

Cryptococcus infection in rural populations in Russia is associated with increased frequency of neuro-immunity. The incidence of neuro-immunity is estimated to be 0.5% (32). The incidence of neuro-immunity in rural populations in Russia is estimated to be 0.6% (33). The incidence of neuro-immunity in rural populations in Russia is estimated to be 0.6% (34).


## Discussion
 2006; Asano and Hasegawa, 2014. According to our results, the prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. among rural population in Nagorno-Karabakh (at 6.32%, range: 0.76-17.76) was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013).

On the other hand, the prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. in rural population was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013). The prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. among urban population was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013). The prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. among urban population was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013). The prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. among rural population in Nagorno-Karabakh (at 6.31%, range: 0.98-17.76) was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013).

Cryptococcus spp. was also detected in the respiratory samples of the infected people in Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast (Nagano et al., 2014).

Based on the results of the current study, the prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. in rural population was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013). The prevalence of Cryptococcus spp. in urban population was in accordance with previous studies (Fukatsuka et al., 2006; Besnan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2009; Raghukumar et al., 2013). The prevalence of Cryptococcus spp.
