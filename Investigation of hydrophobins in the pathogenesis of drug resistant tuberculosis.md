## Abstract
In this study, we investigated the influence of several compounds in the interaction of Candida glabrata with its clinical isolates. In comparison with the non-Candida albicans isolates, the C. glabrata strains exhibited a significant effect on the action of the compounds when tested in a broth with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) or minimal cytotoxicity (MCV) assays. Moreover, the results obtained in this study suggest that the fungi can use these compounds in the interaction to enhance the efficacy of antifungal drugs.

## Introduction
The first reported hydrophobin was reported from a woman with penicilliosis treated with the antibacterial drug flucytosine (Henne et a. 2015). This hydrophobin was identified as the phospholipase C family member (PLC) (Patterson and Diez 2016). However, the biochemical characterization of PLC in tuberculosis is still unknown. PLC is a heterotetramer consisting of two subunits, a- and ß-palmitoyl-xylases. The a-palmitoyl-xylases are membrane-bound, and the ß-palmitoyl-xylases are membrane-bound. The membrane-bound PLC are non-proliferative. There are three key components in the a-palmitoyl-xylases: the hydrophobic component, the hydrophilic component and the hydrophobic component (Patterson and Diez 2016). The first two components are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are involved in the cleavage of the cytoplasmic membrane by endosomal sorting system. The hydrophobic component is transported to the Golgi complex and then enters the nucleus. The hydrophobic component is degraded by endocytosis and Golgi-endosomal sorting complex (GST). The hydrophobic component is secreted from the Golgi and internalized and processed by endocytosis and Golgi-endosome sorting complex (GST). Finally, a hydrophilic component is incorporated into the endoplasmic reticulum and is cleaved by endocytosis and Golgi-endosome sorting complex (GST).

PLC is a family of membrane-bound proteins. All members of PLC have at least one known cytoplasmic domain (C1) and are involved in the transport of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The functional role of PLC in the ER is currently unknown. Studies have shown that the role of PLC in the ER has been induced by several different drugs, including anti-phospholipid and anti-phospholipid drugs, including bisulphinic acid (BSA), quinolones and cytochalasin D (CPD).


## Methods
Mycobacterial cultures were grown on the Sabouraud dextrose (SD) agar medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) at 37 °. For CFU analysis, mycobacterial cultures were grown on the Sabouraud dextrose medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) at 37 °C. All the fungal cultures were cultivated in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 150 mL of the same medium. The mycobacterial culture was inoculated on the bottom of the flasks and the culture conditions were the same as for the wild type. Mycobacterial growth was calculated as the total fungal mycelial volume. Mycobacterial growth was calculated as the total mycelial mass of the mycobacterial culture compared with that of the wild type. The number of CFU/mL was calculated from the number of CFU/mL in the growth control flask. The hyphal density (H) and the growth control flask were calculated according to the formula: H = (S/W^2) × (T/W^2) [64].


## Results
 2015. In this study, the Aph1 and Apr1 hydrophobins were identified as involved in the resistance to fluconazole (table S1), which is a fluconazole-tolerant pathogen, in patients with tuberculous meningitis (Table 2). The Aph1 hydrophobins were identified as involved in the resistance to fluconazole, whereas the Apr1 hydrophobins were identified as involved in the resistance to fluconazole, which is a fluconazole-tolerant pathogen (Table 2). In this study, the Aph1 hydrophobins were identified as involved in the resistance to fluconazole, whereas the Apr1 hydrophobins were identified as involved in the resistance to fluconazole, which is a fluconazole-tolerant pathogen (Table 2).

The resistance of the A. fumigatus isolates to fluconazole is associated with the resistance to azoles, including fluconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole, and fluconazole, as well as with the formation of secondary metabolites, such as amphotericin B, in the presence of fluconazole, as indicated by the accumulation of terpenoids and diamide hydroxyl esters in the medium (Table 3). In this study, the A. fumigatus isolates were identified as resistant to fluconazole, as indicated by the accumulation of terpenoids and diamide hydroxyl esters in the medium (Table 3).

## Discussion
It is believed that they can promote resistance against azole-resistant isolates in the same way as azole-susceptible isolates (37, 38. The active sites of hydrophobins in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans are predicted to be the hydrophobic residues of the N-terminal C-terminal regions of their hydrophobic mannans (39). However, the C-terminal hydrophobic mannans of C. neoformans are highly dynamic, requiring hydrophobic solvent to interact with to other proteins, and they are only accessible in the cytoplasm (40). In addition to hydrophobins, several other proteins are involved in cell wall synthesis, including the glycosyltransferase enzyme complex, protein and nucleic acid binding protein, and transmembrane vesicle (TMV) (41). The glycosyltransferase complex is responsible for the transfer of GPI-anchored glycoproteins and is required for the cell wall synthesis. TMV is produced by T cells, but in vitro studies showed that T cell-produced TMV is the most abundant protein in infected lungs (42). TMV is present in the cytoplasm of T cell-infected mice and is expressed in all tissues, including the brain, brain, lung, lymph nodes, and other organs (43). The glycosyltransferase complex is important for the synthesis of non-lipoprotein proteins and lipoprotein N-glycosylation (44). It also plays an important role in glycosylation of the cell wall and is required for the development of cell wall-degrading enzymes. TMV is expressed in the lung, but not in the brain, lung, and brain tissue (45). The glycosyltransferase complex is involved in the cell wall synthesis, and it is important for the cell wall synthesis and remodeling of the cell wall by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (46).

The protein N-terminal region of hydrophobins has been shown to be involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and differentiation of fungal pathogens. This is the first time that N-terminal hydrophobins are involved in fungal pathogenesis. A hydrophobin-like gene has been identified in both the lung and brain tissue (47, 48).
