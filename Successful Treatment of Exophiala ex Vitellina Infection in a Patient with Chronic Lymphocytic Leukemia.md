## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. The most common invasive fungal infections are caused by Candida species, which are ubiquitous pathogenic fungi. The incidence of non-Candida spp. candidemia cases is rising, and is increasing year by year, with Candida auris becoming increasingly common in our society. We have to face the critical burden of resistance, which increases among opportunistic pathogens, and it is very difficult to treat. Candida species are extremely difficult to diagnose, and there is a huge heterogeneity in their presentation. The identification of the causative pathogen should take a specialist scientific interest, and one must have a basic understanding of the host and the risk factors for candidemia. The treatment of candidemia will be addressed more fully in the future. Drug toxicity and the difficulty of drug interaction with the immune response are important factors. In addition, the different degrees of drug tolerance, the therapeutic efficacy and the impact of antifungal therapy and the mode of actions of antifungal treatment remain to be defined. The study on drug tolerance, drug-human interactions and the mechanisms of drug tolerance will provide a significant insight in the future.


## Introduction
Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The disease is caused by the protozoan of the genus Leishmania that is transmitted by sand flies, primarily by blood-feeding sand fly vectors (Nishiyama et al., 2009; Mendoza et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018). Leishmania spp. are obligate blood-feeding sand fly vectors of human and animal origin (de Hoog et al., 1998; Mendoza et al., 2015). The parasite life cycle consists of two distinct stages, the dikaryotic stage in which the life cycle relies on sand fly-to-sap fly (Kirk et al., 2005) and the life-cycle in which the life cycle relies on sand fly to sand fly (de Hoog et al., 1998). Leishmania spp.


## Methods
Strains and media
The yeast strain (YC_144) used in this study was Y. lipolytica NCTC2569. The strains used in this study were Y. lipolytica cb-4a, Y. lipolytica cb-4a, and Y. lipolytica cb-4b (Table 1). All yeast strains were cultured on yeast-extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium at 37°C. For RNA isolation, a single colony was inoculated into 2 ml of YPD broth and incubated at 30°C. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For the RNA isolation, 1 µg of RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then purified using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).


## Results
In the second patient (ICL), the survival rate was 80% and the median CD4 count was 15 cells/µL (IQR: 11-17 cells/µL. The median CD4 count was 2 cells/µL (IQR: 0-9 cells/µL). The patient with leukemia had an advanced stage of lymphoma and he was receiving chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma at the time of the patient's death (Fig 1A).

In the patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, the survival rate was 90% and the median CD4 count was 35 cells/µL (IQR: 35-80 cells/µL) (Fig 1B). In the patients with chemotherapy-induced leukemia, the survival rate was 80% and the median CD4 count was 15 cells/µL (IQR: 11-17 cells/µL) (Fig 1B). The patient with chemotherapy-induced leukemia had a chronic lymphoma and was receiving chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma at the time of the patient's death (Fig 1C).

In the patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, the survival rate was 80% and the median CD4 count was 20 cells/µL (IQR: 8-17 cells/µL) (Fig 1D). In the patients with chemotherapy-induced leukemia, the survival rate was 80% and the median CD4 count was 20 cells/µL (IQR: 8-17 cells/µL) (Fig 1D).

In the patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, the survival rate was 90% and the median CD4 count was 35 cells/µL (IQR: 35-80 cells/µL) (Fig 2A). In the patients with chemotherapy-induced leukemia, the survival rate was 80% and the median CD4 count was 15 cells/µL (IQR: 11-17 cells/µL) (Fig 2A).


## Discussion
Thirty patients were treated with these drugs (Table 1. Thirty of these patients received Amphotericin B, and 50 patients received Fluconazole (Table 2). The treatment of these patients was successful. The patient with lymphocytic leukemia developed a septic shock with hemopoietic stenosis. No hemopoietic stenosis was observed in this patient.

Pancreatic lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed in 29 patients, and 36 patients were treated with Amphotericin B for a variety of lymphocytic lymphocytic diseases (Table 2). Forty patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole, and 50 patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Flucytosine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Table 3).

The treatment of lymphocytic leukemia in HIV/AIDS patients was successful in 20 patients. Twenty-one patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole and 12 patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Flucytosine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Table 3). Twenty-one patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Flucytosine, and 23 patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole for lymphocytic leukemia (Table 4).

The treatment of lymphocytic leukemia in HIV/AIDS patients was successful in 25 patients. Twenty-one patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole, and 30 patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Flucytosine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Table 5).

The treatment of lymphocytic leukemia in HIV/AIDS patients was successful in 10 patients. Thirty patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole plus Flucytosine for a variety of lymphocytic diseases (Table 2). Twenty-five patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole plus Flucytosine for a variety of lymphocytic diseases (Table 3).

The treatment of lymphocytic leukemia in HIV/AIDS patients was successful in 19 patients. Thirty-one patients were treated with Amphotericin B plus Fluconazole plus Flucytosine for a variety of lymphocytic diseases (Table 3).
