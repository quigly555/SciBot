## Abstract
The importance of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced by conventional adjuvant-assisted immunotherapy have been well studied. However, the mechanisms of antibody regulation have remained largely undetermined. In this study, we show that the soluble CD4+ T-cell subsets, which are important for the control of fungal burdens and the resolution of inflammation, were induced by dendritic cell (DC) adjuvant treatment with fluconazole at low doses. In addition, we show that the Th17+-derived cytokines, such as IL-22 and TGFß, could be produced by DC-treated mice. These adjuvant-induced DC-mediated IL-22- and TGFß-mediated antifungal effects were suppressed by oral administration of fluconazole. Furthermore, the release of the cytokines, such as CCL2, could be controlled by the oral administration of fluconazole. Moreover, the T-cell subsets could be induced by DC-administration of fluconazole, with or without adjuvant-assisted immunotherapy. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the soluble CD4+ T-cell subsets can be manipulated by adjuvant of adjuvant-assisted immunotherapy, and the oral administration of fluconazole could be a useful adjuvant to control the fungal burdens and reduce inflammation in the oral cavity.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease that affects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The disease is associated with a low survival rate and a high morbidity. Approximately one million cases of cryptococcosis occur annually in the world, with over 620,000 deaths (1). The disease is caused by two species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, which are both soil-borne and can be found in soil. The cryptococcal species can be readily isolated from the environment and clinical cases have been reported in humans (2). The environmental reservoirs are bird droppings, soil, and decaying vegetation. These reservoirs are used as reservoirs for the development of various drug resistance strains. The infection cycle of C. neoformans starts when a fungal cell types such as C. neoformans or C. gattii invade the lung. The infection of the lung is thought to be initiated by inhalation of airborne spores or desiccated yeast cells.

C. neoformans and C. gattii invade the lungs by the respiratory system, and after this initial infection, the pathogen can disseminate to the central nervous system (3). After inhalation, the fungus may change its morphology from yeast to hyphal and to infect cells. Eventually, a pathogen cell can disseminate from lungs to the central nervous system (4). Therefore, both Cryptococcus species are pathogenic to the mammalian host. C. neoformans and C. gattii are able to infect both the mammalian host and other cells of the host, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils (5). The infection of both species by the phagocytes is mainly influenced by the activation of macrophages and neutrophils (6, 7). Macrophages play a pivotal role in the early immune response, but it is not clear how the phagocytes are involved in the infection process. The interaction between phagocytes and Cryptococcus has been reported in several publications. This interaction was reported to be mediated by macrophages.


## Methods
Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential impact of Vitis vinifera on the fungal virulence of this pathogen, the model-based approach of Pielou et a. (2017) was applied to examine the impact of Vitis vinifera on the fungal virulence of this pathogen in different conditions, such as: (1) Candida albicans (Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus pyogenes) and (2) Aspergillus fumigatus (Candida dubliniensis and Toxoplasma gondii) and (3) Aspergillus niger (Aspergillus niger). The results showed that the C. albicans and Aspergillus niger were significantly different from the C. dubliniensis, but the Aspergillus niger was significantly different from Aspergillus niger. In this analysis, the effect of Vitis vinifera on fungal virulence of this pathogen was evaluated in all fungal species tested. For C. albicans, the fungal virulence of this pathogen was evaluated only in the Candida genus, but in C. dubliniensis, it was evaluated in all the Candida species. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effect of Vitis vinifera on the fungal virulence of this pathogen, the fungal strains were also compared in the presence and absence of Vitis vinifera. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of Vitis vinifera on the fungal virulence of this pathogen, the fungal strains were also compared in the presence and absence of Vitis vinifera. In this analysis, the fungal strains were compared in the presence and absence of Vitis vinifera. In this analysis, the fungal strains were compared in the presence and absence of Vitis vinifera.

A concatenated data set was produced in which all the fungal species were compared. Additionally, a number of fungal species were also compared. For Cryptococcus neoformans, four fungal species were compared in the presence and absence of Vitis vinifera, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus niger.


## Results
Sequence variation and SNP-based analyses
A total of 2735 ITS sequence variants (including SNP variants) were generated for the 21 samples collected from the United States of America (Table 1). For each sample, two ITS polymorphic variants were generated: ITS1 was generated for three samples collected from California, USA, and ITS2 for the same sample collected from the United States. All samples were collected in April 2006 (i.e., before the first sampling event) and were from the United States. Both ITS1 and ITS2 sequences were used for the analyses of each sample. This dataset consisted of 31,349 and 25,877 sequences, respectively.


## Discussion

In this study, the antifungal efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B was evaluated in mice infected with . fumigatus var. flava. The results are shown in Table 2. Fluconazole and amphotericin B showed better antifungal efficacy than amphotericin B alone, with the median survival time of mice treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B of 2.5 days and the median survival time of mice treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B of 3 days. The survival rates of animals treated with amphotericin B were also lower than those of those of animals treated with fluconazole alone. The survival rate of animals treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B was 50% higher than that of animals treated with fluconazole alone. The antifungal efficacy of amphotericin B was 80%.

The best antifungal efficacy was seen for amphotericin B alone, with median survival time of mice treated with amphotericin B of 2 days. The survival rate of mice treated with amphotericin B was 100% higher than that of the control. The survival rate of mice treated with fluconazole was 100% higher than that of the controls. The survival rate of animals treated with fluconazole was 80%.

The highest mortality of the A. fumigatus infections was in the Vitis vinifera infection group, with a median survival time of 4 days. In this study, the highest mortality was observed in the Vitis vinifera infection group. The best antifungal efficacy of amphotericin B was found in the A. fumigatus group. The median survival time of mice infected with amphotericin B was 2.5 days.

The Vitis vinifera infection group was the highest mortality group in this study. The median survival time of mice infected with amphotericin B was 4.5 days.

The A. fumigatus group was the lowest mortality group in this study. The survival rate of mice infected with amphotericin B was 69% higher than that of mice infected with fluconazole alone. The median survival time of mice infected with amphotericin B was 3.5 days.

The survival rates of mice infected with amphotericin B were 88% higher than that of mice infected with fluconazole alone.
