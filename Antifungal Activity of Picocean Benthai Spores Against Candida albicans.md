## Abstract
A total of 17 yeast isolates were collected from various substrates (Plant, Leaf, Seed, Leaf base, Glucosin, and Glucosin-1-ols) and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates (ZrPersson, Sabouraud Dextrose Agar plates). Strains were identified by a simple matrix assisted by qPCR, and the ability of the isolates to grow on various media was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The strains were identified by the following criteria: morphology, ITS rDNA, and the MIC. All yeasts were grown on varying media and media efficiencies, and the standardized minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied from 1 to 2 mg/mL. The best growth rate was observed for Candida albicans (MIC = 1 mg/mL) and for Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC = 1 mg/mL). The most promising growth conditions were observed for Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL), Trichosporon asahii (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL), and Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL). The highest MIC value was recorded for Candida krusei (0.5 mg/mL), followed by Trichosporon asahii (0.5 mg/mL) and Candida dubliniensis (0.5 mg/mL). Moreover, the best growth conditions were also recorded for Aspergillus niger (0.5 mg/mL), Trichosporon asahii (0.5 mg/mL), and Aspergillus fumigatus (0.5 mg/mL). The results of the present study indicated that yeasts from the soil can be considered as an interesting microbial source of novel compounds for the development of new therapeutics against fungal infections.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have become an increasing problem with the increase in the number of patients with impaired immunity (e.g., with prolonged neutrophil recovery) and immunodepression due to chemotherapy, steroids, immunosuppressive medications, and autoimmune diseases [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) can be classified into those caused by Candida species, Aspergillus species, and Cryptococcus species. Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common fungal infection. Approximately 30%-60% of patients with IFIs are asymptomatic. However, invasive candidiasis (IC) may occur in patients with immunodepressive disease and in patients with hematological malignancies, those with end-stage renal impairment, patients with rheumatologic conditions, and patients with AIDS. Therefore, patients with candidemia or aspergillosis should be monitored closely and hospitalized for asymptomatic infection. IFIs are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immunity [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Infection by Candida species is caused by Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. However, the number of cases of candidemia and aspergillosis is decreasing. Currently, the most common species involved are Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. Additionally, the yeast Cryptococcus species, which are the most common cause of candidemia and aspergillosis, are emerging as important pathogens [18,19,20,21]. The emergence of infections caused by Cryptococcus species, and their subsequent dissemination into the bloodstream and the intestine, as well as the reduction in the number of immunocompetent individuals, underscore the need for new, efficient and effective antifungal therapy [22,23,24,25,26].

Antifungal drugs that target ergosterol biosynthesis pathway have been intensively investigated and have shown considerable efficacy in the treatment of IFIs. Amphotericin B (AmB), the most used class of antifungal, inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis and has demonstrated to be effective against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [27,28,29].


## Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine at Imperial College, China (CEUA/AC/12/13) and the laboratory ethics committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine of the University of Agricultural Sciences of China, approved the protocol on September 11, 201.

2.2. Antifungal Activity of Picocean Benthai Spores Against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis
Picocean Benthai spores were obtained from the fungal colonies in the presence of 10% glucose, 0.5% KCl, 1.5% K_2HPO_4, 0.5% KH_2PO_4, 1.5% MgSO_4·7H_2O, and 1% agar. The fungi were cultivated on the Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) at 37°C for 48 h. The inoculated fungus were then inoculated on the Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SD) (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) at 37°C for 24 h. The spore suspensions were diluted in sterile distilled water and spread on SDA, SDA-agar, and SDA-seminated agar. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The results of the colony-forming units (CFU) were determined as the number of viable spores per gram of dry weight of the supernatant. The fungal growth was recorded every 24 h. The test was conducted in triplicate.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of Picocean Benthai Spores Against Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis
The antifungal activity of Picocean Benthai spores against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis were conducted in the presence of 10% glucose, 0.5% KCl, 1.5% K_2HPO_4, 1.


## Results
albicans and . glabrata growth, we examined the activity of Picocean Benthai spores against C. albicans and C. glabrata by growing them on plates containing a medium containing 25 µg/ml of Picocean B. fragilis. Both strains were able to grow well on the plates containing 25 µg/ml of Picocean B. fragilis, except for C. albicans, where Picocean B. fragilis was able to inhibit C. albicans growth at concentrations of 25 µg/ml, which were also found to be sufficient to inhibit the growth of C. glabrata at concentrations of 25 µg/ml (Fig 3). This is consistent with the results of previous studies of Picocean B. fragilis-treated C. albicans cells in which growth inhibition was found to be the most efficient method of killing Candida cells [32].

Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata have a Th17 Heterozygosity Index
To determine whether Picocean B. fragilis-treated C. albicans and C. glabrata are tolerant to Picocean B. fragilis and Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata, we monitored growth of C. albicans and C. glabrata on plates containing 25 µg/ml of Picocean B. fragilis and 25 µg/ml of Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata. The growth of both C. albicans and C. glabrata were inhibited by Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata (Fig 4). The growth of both C. albicans and C. glabrata were also inhibited by Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata (Fig 4).

In order to evaluate the effect of Picocean B. fragilis-Treated Candida glabrata on C. albicans and C. glabrata growth, we monitored growth of C. albicans on plates containing 25 µg/ml of Picocean B.
