## Abstract
The African Dikarya consists of three major phyla: the Actinomycete phyla, the Basidiomycete phyla and the Chytridiomycete phyla. Their phylogenetic relationship was established by extensive sampling across the continent and the resulting genetic diversity was further confirmed by qPCR. This expanded our understanding of the diversity and diversity found within the Dikarya whereas our results limited us to the generic yeast strains and the filamentous fungi.


## Introduction
The genus Acanthamoeba contains over 200 species [1]. Although the number of species in the genus Acanthamoeba continues to grow, there still remain approximately 300 species with a worldwide distribution. Some of them are pathogenic to humans, others are opportunistic pathogens, and others are opportunistic pathogens [2]. Acanthamoeba is among the most destructive of the genera in the genus Acanthamoeba. Acanthamoeba infections are acquired by inhalation of conidia. In humans, aflatoxicosis is a common opportunistic fungal infection, often in the form of skin infection, mucocutaneous and disseminated infections, and in the case of AIDS, can cause severe skin lesions. Other than aspergillosis and cryptococcosis, acanthamoeba infections are relatively uncommon. However, acanthamoeba infections have been recognized as a worldwide threat to animal and plant life [3].

Some species of Acanthamoeba are known to cause localized and disseminated infections, such as those caused by Acanthamoeba gila do Macaque, Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba pseudogii, Acanthamoeba dermatitidis, and Acanthamoeba nematophagous, which cause severe infections in animals and plants [4,5]. Other species may cause disseminated infections, such as Acanthamoeba restrepiensis, Acanthamoeba pyrenophthalmae, Acanthamoeba dermatitidis, Acanthamoeba conophthalmae, Acanthamoeba purpurata, and Acanthamoeba nematophagous [4,5,6].


## Methods
Furthermore, the presence of organisms was confirmed using Microsatellite Bd and Microsatellite R from the Bacillus subtilis isolate (. cerevisiae) and Candida albicans isolate (C. albicans) (Table 2). The check for P. brasiliensis (Pb18), P. kefyrii (Pb01), and P. oleracea (Pb05) was performed using the P. brasiliensis 16S rRNA gene as a query sequence in the PDB.

Screening of antibiotics and reagents for interaction with Gram-positive bacteria
Approximately 200 ml of 1 L of LB broth (1.0% w/v) was added to a 100 ml flask and mixed vigorously for 10 min. This mixture was then poured into a sterile polystyrene 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the antimicrobial substances were removed with 0.5% dimethyl sulphoxide. The plate was then poured and sealed with aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. After that, the plate was carefully washed with sterile 0.85% NaCl. The antimicrobial substances were aspirated, and the growth of the bacteria was checked using trypan blue dye stain.

For identification of other antimicrobial compounds, bacterial culture was cultured in PDB at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the liquid culture was transferred to a chemically defined liquid culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The supernatant (100 ml) was then discarded. The bacterial culture was then inoculated into 250 ml liquid culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The growth of the bacteria was confirmed using trypan blue stain stain.

For identification of antimicrobial compounds, the bacterial culture was cultured in SAB at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the liquid culture was transferred to a chemically defined liquid culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatant (100 ml) was discarded. The bacteria was then inoculated into 250 ml liquid culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St.


## Results
The single isolate (.3×10^-6 CFU/mL) of bacterial origin of substrate 2 was identified as Candida sp. (CSP), which was not identified in the sequencing of the first read. CSP was identified as the most common pathogenic bacteria, and C. neoformans was isolated as a second most common pathogenic organism. CSP was not present in any of the other commercial strains, and the isolates were not identified as pathogenic.

3.3. Tandem Repeated Repeats in the RT-PCR Sequence of the HU-F4 Substrate 1 Protease
The amplicon sequencing was used to determine the relative abundance of each of the four bacterial phyla in the three samples. Substrate 2 contained the most abundant bacteria, followed by the three most common bacterial phyla (Table 2). At the bacterial level, the microbial community of substrate 2 was dominated by the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes, followed by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (Table 2). However, a higher proportion of Firmicutes was found in the two substrate 2 samples than in the substrate 1 samples, which may be due to the fact that the substrate 2 samples are not fit for the different bacterial populations of substrate 1.

3.4. Gene Expression Profiles of the HU-F4 Substrate 1 Protease
In addition to the sequence data, we constructed a microarray-based transcriptome analysis of substrate 1 and substrate 2 using the Illumina technology to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the two substrate samples. The expression profile of the HU-F4 substrate 1 protein in substrate 2 was compared with that of the control strain by RT-PCR. We found that all the strains were differentially expressed at least one fold. The results are presented in Table 3.

The highest expression level was found in the two substrate 2 samples, with the highest expression level observed in the substrate 1 samples.


## Discussion
coli and other bacteria revealed that the results of the structural analysis were in line with the hypothesis that bacterial origin of substrates has been a major factor in the recent evolution of sub-domains [15.

Substrate 1 of the 16S rRNA gene was found to be one of the most conserved sub-domains in eukaryotic sequences. In this study, we found that the eukaryotic sub-domains of the 16S rRNA gene were highly conserved. Substrate 1 was highly conserved in the eukaryotic sub-domains of the 16S rRNA gene, which was also the case in the bacterial sub-domains of the 16S rRNA gene in the other bacteria. Substrate 1 of the 16S rRNA gene was found to be different in the presence of 3, 4, and 5 carbon sources. Substrate 1 of the 16S rRNA gene was found to be highly conserved in the presence of 3, 4, and 5 carbon sources.
