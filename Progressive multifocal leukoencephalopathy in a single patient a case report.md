## Abstract
A simple, yet powerful, feature of the prokaryotic metazoan is its ability to transform itself into versatile symbionts with multiple genomes. The genome of Metarhizium antarctica (MT) is a very compact organism that can form symbiotic associations with many diverse invertebrates and other fungi. The genome of Metarhizium hominis (MT) is composed of 12,344 and 16,344 bp, respectively. Despite the fact that most analyses of M. antarctica have focused on Metarhizium genome architecture, recent studies have revealed that Metarhizium MTs are more diverse and have a diversity of features, including gene content, size, chromatin, and introns. In this review, we discuss the various features of the genomes of Metarhizium antarctica, including the gene content, size, chromatin, and introns, as well as the phylogenetic distribution and diversity of these features. These features are of particular interest for the way they contribute to disease transmission. Furthermore, we discuss the evolutionary relationships among these features, and the evolutionary strategies that led to the evolution of these features in Metarhizium MTs.


## Introduction
Nocardiosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating nephritis of the subpleural effusion or lesion and represents the most common site of cardiomyopathy in the USA. The symptoms can mimic myelosuppression, hepatosplenomegaly, and other neurologic symptoms, and may include an exaggerated inflammatory reaction such as myelosuppression, hepatosplenomegaly, and vasculitis. Nocardiosis can also occur in patients with other immunologic abnormalities, such as AIDS, and in patients with other rare diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The incidence of Nocardia varies from 2% to 18% of all clinical presentations in the USA and European countries [1,2].

Nocardiosis is a common, subclinical entity, and occurs in both early-onset nocardiosis and late-onset nocardiosis. In RA patients, an initial presentation of Nocardia is observed, with an early manifestation characterized by the clinical manifestations of sub-thromboembolic disease, cystic fibrosis, and acute renal failure (ADF) or myocardial infarction (MI). Diagnosis is based on imaging characteristics, and the clinical manifestations of the disease can be indistinguishable from that of the RA. Some imaging abnormalities may suggest neoplasia and/or myocarditis. MRI and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most common and accurate diagnostic tools for Nocardia. The MRI findings may be rapid, mononuclear or multiple, depending on the nature of the abnormality. In RA, MRI may be used to rule out myocarditis or other non-infectious lesions [3,4]. Other criteria for Nocardia diagnosis include: (i) a history of RA; (ii) a history of at least one neoplasm in RA patients and/or at least at least 3 episodes of myocarditis during the past 6 years; (iii) atypical patterns of radionuclide (RAD) analysis; (iv) atypical patterns of radionuclide and radiological imaging; (v) withdrawal between radionuclide and myocarditis in patients with RA; and (vi) myocarditis in patients with/without myocarditis.


## Methods
The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in his first episode of acute myeloid leukemia, and was treated with corticosteroids and heparin in order to recover from the injur. All patients received treatment for recurrent leukoencephalopathy. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made by the presence of cysts on histological examination of the surface of the lesion (n = 6) and the presence of myeloid layer around the lesion.

The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with steroids. The patient was treated with potassium permanganate solution. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with steroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with steroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with corticosteroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with steroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with corticosteroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with steroids. The surgical cure was achieved with the end of treatment with corticosteroids.

In another case, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in a single patient was confirmed by the histological examination of the surface of the lesion (n = 6).

Data collection and analysis
All patients were treated for acute myeloid leukemia according to the procedure proposed by the Declaration of Helsinki. The inclusion criteria for the inclusion criteria were: (1) patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. (2) a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia by diagnostic histological examination. (3) treatment with steroids. (4) treatment with potassium permanganate solution. (5) treatment with corticosteroids. (6) treatment with corticosteroids.

The most frequently used steroids were i.e. TMS, acetazolamide, nystatin, voriconazole, voriconazole, trimethoprim-2-sulfamethoxazole, 3-flucytosine, 1-thrombin, and ziram. All the most commonly used TMS and nystatin were taken into account.


## Results
%) of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (MML. The disease severity and prognosis of the 651 patients are presented in Table 1. There was no significant difference in disease severity between patients who had the most severe disease (patients who had the most severe disease) and those who had the least severe disease (Table 1).

The results of clinical examination and the diagnostic results are presented in Table 2. Of the 651 patients with MML, 1,526 (22.2%) were diagnosed with disseminated invasive leukaemia (GIs) and 2,818 (6.8%) were diagnosed with disseminated tubercular carcinoma (TPC). All the patients had high levels of serum albumin and were sensitive to several antifungal agents. The patient was cured after relapse of candidiasis. The disease severity and prognosis of the 651 patients are presented in Table 3. In contrast, the disease severity and prognosis of the 572 patients with MML are presented in Table 4.

Treatment
The CD4+ T lymphocyte count was not significantly different between the groups of patients with MML (Fig 2). There were no significant differences in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between the groups of patients with MML and those without MML (Fig 3). In contrast, the CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in the 651 patients with MML and those without MML (Fig 4). In patients with MML, there was a high number of patients with stable disease, but only one patient with disseminated tubercular carcinoma and two patients with tuberculosis. The disease severity and prognosis of the 572 patients with MML are presented in Table 5.

Safety
The patient was a healthy male with normal BMI (26.0, 30.0). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit at 7 days after the admission. The patient’s CD4+ T lymphocyte count was not significantly different between the groups of patients with MML (Fig 2). The disease severity and prognosis of the 572 patients with MML are presented in Table 6.

The patient’s CD4+ T lymphocyte count was not significantly different between the groups of patients with MML and those without MML (Fig 2).


## Discussion
 2010)

Despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy in our patient, we found significant differences in the clinical and laboratory presentations and sign. Among the patients with leukoencephalopathy, the most common presentation was a mild facial hypopatric foci, which appeared different from the clinical presentation. Other clinical and laboratory presentations included fever, altered mental status, hemoptysis, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although none of these clinical features were associated with leukoencephalopathy, there were multiple differential diagnoses including neoplastic/inflammatory disease, infectious diseases, and malignancy. These diagnoses included osteoarthritis, cryptococcosis, pulmonary fungal infection, autoimmune disease, and neoplasia.

In a previous study, Leukoencephalopathy was found in two patients (Wesland et al., 2010) and the diagnosis was made by PCR in one patient. However, in our patient, a positive PCR result was obtained, which led us to believe that the patient had a malignant tumor. In a study by Lyon et al., 2017, a patient with leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed and treated with dexamethasone and voriconazole for 15 days. Unfortunately, the patient had a history of mild fever, hemoptysis, and weight loss. However, his condition improved after he was treated with dexamethasone. Although there is no treatment for this patient, dexamethasone could be used as an alternative to treat this patient.

In our patient, the diagnosis was made by PCR in the patient's patient's patient with leukoencephalopathy. However, our patient had a history of severe fevers with a slow improvement in his symptoms after treatment with dexamethasone and voriconazole. Although we did not test this patient for leukocytosis, there were multiple clinical and laboratory differential diagnoses including lymphadenopathy, acute myelocytic leukemia, pericardial effusion, renal tubular cell carcinoma, pericardial effusion, and fungal infection. These differential diagnoses included multiple sclerosis, spinal cord abscess, neurological complications, and parasitic infections.

In conclusion, leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in our patient in this patient with a strong history of fever, fever, and weight loss.
