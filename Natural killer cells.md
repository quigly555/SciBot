## Abstract
Mannitol is an important sugar-free form of “blue of neck” in many cereals. It is produced as a by-product and is well known for its health benefits. However, the major factors associated with blue of neck shelf-life are currently underestimated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of various physical and chemical factors on the blue of neck sugar production.

We conducted a convenience study to assess the influence of various physical and chemical factors on the blue of neck sugar production.


## Introduction
KITs are mainly classified into six subtypes: necrotrophils, eosinophils, lysovaginal, and granulocyte. The most important components of necrotrophic KITs are apoptotic bodies such as neutrophils and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Kumaran et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2014). In addition, some other groups such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) are also included in the group (Cui et al., 2014). The DST is a group of lymphocytes that comprise 20-60% of the cells of the lymphatic blood group (Bennett and Wright, 2015). DSTs are classified into 2 groups according to their function: one is a cell-contact-dependent cytotoxic KIT and the other is a cell-contact-independent KIT. KITs are mainly constituted by innate and adaptive T lymphocytes, and are classified as the type 1 or the type 2 immune cells (Walsh et al., 2006; Gautam et al., 2013). KITs are classified as the type 2 immune cells, and can differentiate into the class of type 1 and the class of type 2 immune cells (Fernández-Álvarez et al., 2010). KITs are also classified as the type 3 immune cells and can differentiate into the class of type 3 immune cells (Fernández-Álvarez et al., 2010). KITs are divided into the two types: kataginis and phagocytes. Phagocytes are mainly composed of peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages, but also immunodeficient macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) (Chen et al., 2011). The phagocytes are subdivided into the class 1 and the class 2 categories. Class I KITs are mainly found in the phagocytes, and they are classified as Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th3 cells, and Th4 cells (Chen et al., 2011).


## Methods
Mice
Wild type (WT) mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (NR-N-L-01-03). All mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in the Animal Facilities at the National Laboratory Animal Center of the Department of Food and Drug Administration (Monroe, NE, USA). All animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions.

## Results
These data indicate that the fungus was able to overcome the host-induced cytotoxic effects of RHC-b and FLC-.

2.2. Expression Pattern of MHC Class I and II Proteins
We have previously demonstrated that MHC-II can be efficiently expressed in host cells through the transcriptional machinery (Tramer and de Gruyter, 1998; Schmöller et al., 2006; Oz, 2011). Therefore, we investigated whether MHC-II expression was regulated in a RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell line during infection. Macrophage-like cells were grown overnight in the presence of 10 µg/ml FLC (for the yeast) and the macrophage-like cells were incubated with 1% FLC for 24 h. The viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages was measured 24 h after infection by immunofluorescence in the peritoneal macrophage (PAM) channel (Fig 3A). The yeast was found to be highly expressed in macrophages (Fig 3B) and macrophages were found to be enriched in the peritoneal macrophage (Fig 3C). Interestingly, yeast cells were found to be enriched in the peritoneal macrophage (Fig 3D). These data suggest that the macrophage-like cells were also enriched in the peritoneal macrophage during fungal infection.

We have also shown that MHC-II expression was induced in macrophages through the MHC-binding domain (HAL) and the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The MHC-II gene has been reported to be expressed in a number of secreted MHC-II-like proteins (Schmöller et al., 2006; Oz, 2011). The GPCR domain is a common feature of the MHC-II-like proteins (Schmöller et al., 2006). The GPCR domain of MHC-II is composed of two conserved domains, a C-terminal histidine (H1) and a C-terminal histidine (H2) domain (Zimmerman et al., 1993).


## Discussion
The largest clade of the Proteobacteria contains four clades representing species of the order Alcaligenes and a single Alcaligenes clade (Figure 1). These results demonstrate that Alcaligenes are well-supported phylogenetically in the genomes of fungi and that they are a well-supported clade in fungi.
