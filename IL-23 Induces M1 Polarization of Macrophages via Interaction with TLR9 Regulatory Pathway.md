## Abstract
Candida albicans is a common human fungal pathogen and causes several superficial infections. The immune response of healthy human tissues to this fungus is broad and includes the production of type 2 helper T cells, the release of cytokines, and the induction of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, immune cells are the first to respond to C. albicans infection. In this review, we summarize the immunological and cellular responses of C. albicans to different media, the roles of macrophages and immune cells, and the mechanisms of immune response to this fungal pathogen.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast-like fungus that colonizes the lungs of individuals with impaired immunity, and causes disease known as pulmonary cryptococcosis.


## Methods
brasiliensi. The experiment was performed as previously described [11] using the Pb01 strain. TLR9, a human TLR9 marker, was included as a negative control. The P. brasiliensis yeast cells were grown in LB media (20 g L^-1) with 0.01% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm). The cells were lysed with sterile water in a bead beater (Biolab, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 5 min at 3,000 rpm and cell debris was removed with centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and washed twice with ice-cold sterile H_2O. The pellet was suspended in 1 mL of ice-cold H_2O to precipitate P. brasiliensis yeast cells. The precipitate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then washed with ice-cold H_2O to remove the excess of P. brasiliensis yeast cells. The P. brasiliensis yeast cells were suspended in 1 mL of H_2O to precipitate Pb01 yeast cells. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was collected and washed twice with ice-cold H_2O. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold H_2O and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold H_2O. The suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and washed twice with ice-cold H_2O. The suspension was then resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold H_2O. The P. brasiliensis yeast cells were suspended in 1 mL of H_2O to precipitate Pb01 yeast cells. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold H_2O and the supernatant was collected and washed twice with ice-cold H_2O.


## Results
Interestingly, the cells were highly efficient in phagocytosis of CD11b^-/- macrophages, and the cells appeared to be highly polarized toward CD11b^-/- macrophage. To examine the polarized characteristics of these macrophages, we used the heat-killed, non-pathogenic fungus C. neoformans. The cell was heat-killed by H_2O_2 and then exposed to H_2O_2 for 1 h. As shown in Fig 4, the cells showed polarized behavior toward macrophages, and the cells were capable of killing C. neoformans by approximately 100-fold (Fig 4A).

To further explore the polarized nature of the macrophage population, we evaluated the influence of M0 macrophages on the phagocytosis of C. neoformans by heat-killed, non-pathogenic C. neoformans. The cells were heat-killed by H_2O_2 and then exposed to H_2O_2 for 1 h. As shown in Fig 4B, the cells showed polarized behavior toward C. neoformans. These results indicate that M0 macrophages affect the polarization of C. neoformans toward C. neoformans.

M0 macrophages alter the histology of C. neoformans
The results of the phagocytosis assays were also evaluated using the CD11b^-/- macrophage population. M1 macrophages were used to investigate the phagocytic status of C. neoformans. The cell was heat-killed by H_2O_2 for 1 h, and then exposed to H_2O_2 for 2 h. The cells were heat-killed by H_2O_2 and then exposed to H_2O_2 for 2 h. The cells were then exposed to H_2O_2 for 1 h and the cell was subjected to imaging. We found that M0 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, altered the morphology of the C. neoformans colony by approximately 50% compared with those of the wild type or the M1 macrophage population.


## Discussion
While direct inoculation of A. fumigatus into mice failed to yield viable A. fumigatus, we found that this immunocompetent mouse model was an effective immunotherapeutic method for A. fumigatus infections.
