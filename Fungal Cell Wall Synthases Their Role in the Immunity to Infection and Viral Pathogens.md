## Abstract
Cryptococcosis is the second most common fungal infection of humans after lung infection. It is caused by yeasts from the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Cryptococcus gattii has received much attention due to its fondness for humans and low mortalities associated with it. However, the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the disease remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cryptococcosis-macrophage interaction following exposure to planktonic cells from wild-type mice.

Thirty-three C. gattii isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Their relationship to other fungi and to their interaction with human cells were evaluated.

Host-derived DNA fragments were recovered from 10 planktonic cells and seven non-polarized planktonic cells. Replicate DNA fragments were subjected to reverse transcription. DNA from substrates, DNA within DNA casks, DNA between DNA casks and DNA between casks were also sequenced. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of species within the fungal phyla as well as the association with human diseases. In vitro interactions with human cells were also evaluated.

Ten species were present in 10 cell extracts, and the association with human diseases was highlighted. All of the host-derived DNA fragments were subjected to reverse transcription and the relative abundance of these species was determined. The comparison of their relative abundance indicated that fungi are a likely source of host-derived DNA and that the fungi are significantly associated with human diseases.

Our study showed the first evidence of the association between fungi and human diseases. The findings also highlighted the relevance of human and plant pathogens and their host invasion to affect the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction. The study provided a useful tool for the studies on Cryptococcus and Cryptococcus-fungal interactions.

## Introduction

. albicans cell wall contains a complex protein complex comprising of adhesins, polysaccharides, proteins, enzymes, and other cell wall components. In the abovementioned pathogenic fungi, the cell wall is the first target of the C. albicans immune system, which is of critical importance, as it prevents the pathogen from attaching to host tissues and exposing them to host immune mechanisms. The cell wall is a major component of the hyphal cell wall and is the first component of the pathogen cell. The cell wall is important in the pathogen pathogenesis, which includes the interaction with host cells, and also in the host immune response. Recent studies revealed that the cell wall is also involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), atherosclerosis, diabetes, and many more [19, 20]. The cell wall is a complex and complex organelle. The fungal cell wall contains a variety of cell wall components including cellulose, chitin, ß-glucan, chitosan, and other cell wall components. The cellulose, chitin, and chitin are important virulence factors in fungi and are known to interact with host cell receptors. The chitin, a-glucan, and ß-glucan, are synthesized and released during cell wall synthesis, and the ß-glucan and chitin are produced during the interaction with host cells and associated with cell wall synthesis. The carbohydrate polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), and chitin are the most abundant cell wall components and are important for the virulence of C. albicans [19, 21]. The cell wall contains proteins that are involved in cell wall biogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and cell wall remodeling.

The cell wall is important for the integrity of cell morphology and integrity of fungal cell wall. Cell wall is composed of a-1, 3- and 5-linked chitin and ß-1, 3-glucan chains. In the human body, ~150 chitin chains are present, of which <50% are GXM, ß-1, 3- and 5-linked glucan chains.

Strain KPM (Sci. Instit. of Pathology, Paris, France) was originally isolated from the blood of patients with pulmonary infection (Table 1). KPM was isolated from blood samples from an autopsy registered in autopsy reports and was also used in the recent study of KPM in this study (Table 2). It was cultured from frozen cell culture slurry with RPMI-1640 medium at 37°C and maintained at -80°C. KPM was also used in the current study (Table 2).

## Results
neoforman. We observed that the hCAII gene was highly conserved among the eight different eukaryotes studied (Figure 4A,B). One of the most notable differences was that hCAII genes were located on chromosome 12 in a group of fungi with decreased number of spp (C. neoformans) (Figure 4C). A total of eight cda genes were found in the genomes of seven fungal species (Table S4). One of these genes is named cda2 and contains a putative zinc finger domain (ZF) at the N-terminus. The other two genes, cda3 and cda4, are related to the transcriptional regulation of cda1 and cda2. Based on the protein sequence of cda2 and cda4, we hypothesize that these two genes could be involved in regulating the virulence of C. neoformans.

The cda2 gene was shown to be induced by the cda1 gene [21], [24]. To investigate the role of cda2 in cda1 gene regulation, we constructed hCAII genes in H99 and KN99a (Figure 4D). The cda2 and cda3 genes were both predicted to be expressed in the hCAII gene promoter (Figure 4E), but the expression levels were not highly conserved among the eight different eukaryotes (Figure 4E). The cda3 gene was not detected in the hCAII gene promoter in the cda2 and cda3 genes (Figure 4E), suggesting that the cda3 gene is not essential for the hCAII gene regulation in C. neoformans.

Although the cda1 gene is expressed in the nucleus, it is not required for cda2 gene regulation [21]. To test the role of cda2 in cda1 gene regulation in C. neoformans, we constructed hCAII genes in H99 and KN99a (Figure 4F). The hCAII genes were both predicted to be expressed in the nucleus (Figure 4F), but the expression levels were not highly conserved among the eight different eukaryotes (Figure 4F).


## Discussion
Our results showed that chitin synthase and ß-glucan synthase were highly expressed in all pathogenic bacteria, and ß-glucan synthase was highly expressed in the bacterial grou.

The expression of chitin synthase in the yeasts and fungi was significantly different, and the fungal group had higher levels of ß-glucan synthase and chitin synthase compared to bacterial cell walls. The expression of chitin synthase in the yeasts and fungi was significantly higher than that in the bacterial group, which could be attributed to the higher genetic differentiation of the yeasts and fungi compared to bacteria. In the case of bacteria, it was reported that the adaptation of the yeasts and fungi to stressful conditions was largely dependent on the cell wall structure of the yeasts (14, 45). The yeast cells that are exposed to stress condition showed higher chitin and ß-glucan synthase activities than those that were exposed to the stressors, which were dependent on the cell wall structure of the bacteria (13).

The expression of cell wall synthase was significantly higher in the yeasts and fungi compared to that in the bacterial group. The cell wall synthesis in yeast cells was significantly higher than that in the bacteria. The cell wall synthesis in yeast cells was also higher than that in the bacterial group, which could be due to the stress conditions and cell wall structure of the bacteria. The expression of cell wall synthase was significantly higher in the yeasts and fungi compared to the bacterial group.

Chitin is a structural component that is used by numerous bacteria for synthesis of cell wall chitin. The chitin synthase plays an important role in the cell wall remodeling processes, and the expression of cell wall synthase and chitin synthase genes was higher in the yeasts than in the bacteria. The cell wall chitin synthase and cell wall synthase genes were higher in the bacteria than in the yeasts. The expression of cell wall synthase and cell wall synthase genes was higher in the yeasts than in the bacteria.

The cell wall polysaccharides are cell wall components that play an important role in the survival of the host cell and are known to be critical for maintaining cell integrity (16).
