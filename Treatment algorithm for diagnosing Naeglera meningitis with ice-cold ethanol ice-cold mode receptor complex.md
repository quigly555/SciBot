## Abstract
Bacterial infections caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are important public health problems. The results of this study indicate that the culture filtrate of S. pyogenes was able to significantly increase the abundance of S. aureus in the susceptible S. pyogenes (S. cerevisiae) group compared with S. pyogenes group (S. japonicus). The effect of incubation temperature in the presence or absence of Bacteroides acetogenosus was significantly higher in the presence (P = 0.008) or absence (P = 0.002) of Bacteroides lactonectin, S. cerevisiae lactonectin-9, and S. japonicus. The two bacteria can be considered as one organism, but their differences in abundance and the presence of Bacteroides lactonectin and S. japonicus in the susceptible group were significant (P = 0.008 and P = 0.024, respectively). In addition, in the susceptible S. aureus group, the levels of Bacteroides lactonectin 9, S.


## Introduction
In addition, in addition to the serum assay, ESCR + mice have also been administered with a delayed-release tablet, usually 4-8 h after administration of the ESCR + test, which is a modified 1 h QT (5-7 tp tablets) and contains a glass partitioning glass, a glass partitioning lid, and a glass plate [6. The ESCR + mice and the ESSC + mice are now treated with ice-cold ethanol ice-cold mode-crushing (Ach) and freeze-drying (Ach) techniques that can be performed in either direction, with the freeze-thaw and Ach method being the most commonly used methods for Naeglera meningitis diagnosis [7]. The Ach method has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both meningitis and non-neurotoxoplasmosis.


## Methods
The protocol was followed for all the conditions tested (cold, ethanol, ice-cold mode receptor complex, and variable therapy volume. This protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospital of Biostatistics of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, and in the case of the treatment of Naeglera meningitis, the ethics committees of the University Hospital of Biostatistics of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Laboratory Service of Brazil and with the approval of the ethics committees of the University Hospital of Biostatistics of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul.

Ethics statement
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Animal Rights of the International Animal Welfare Act and the Brazilian National Council for Medical Research (CONM). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Biostatistics of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University Hospital of Biostatistics of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul.

Mice
Male C57BL/6 (Charles River) mice (6-8 weeks of age) were obtained from the Animal Center of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (Mato Grosso do San Martino, Mato Grosso do Norte, Brazil). The mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled room with controlled temperature of 30 ± 1°C. All mice received three intraperitoneal injections of 0.125 mg/kg of dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) twice a day for 4 days in a total volume of 100 µL/mouse. The animals were weighed and humanely euthanized using CO_2 when they displayed distress or distress during the experiment.

Parasites
Female BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks of age) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (Mato Grosso do San Martino, Mato Grosso do Norte, Brazil). The mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled room with controlled temperature of 30 ± 1°C.


## Results

Naeglera meningitis is characterized by normal body temperature, normal immune response and a high temperature of 37°C (Table 2. The patient shows normal body temperature of 38°C and normal immune response, but a high temperature of 37°C and hypoxia. The patient presents with mild headache and fever. The patient is a 58 year old white male with a male to female ratio of 1:1. He has a male to female ratio of 1:2 and a male to female ratio of 1:1. The patient’s weight is 35 kg and he is obese. The patient’s symptoms include headache, vomiting, weight loss, and weight loss. The patient’s symptoms are fever, vomiting, weight loss, and weight loss. He is not in a neurological condition. He is a 62 year old white male with a male to female ratio of 1:1. He has a male to female ratio of 1:2 and a male to female ratio of 1:1. The patient’s cough is 92%, his eyes are open, his tongue is full, his chest is filled with fluid, and his tongue is filled with fluid. The patient’s diarrhea is 49% (n=32) and his diarrhea is 22% (n=32) in the blood. The patient’s weight is 39 kg and he is obese. The patient’s headache is 52% (n=14) and his headache is 45% (n=14) in the blood. The patient’s fever is 65% (n=17) and his fever is 30% (n=17) in the blood. The patient’s cough is 26% (n=14) and his cough is 33% (n=14) in the blood. The patient’s diarrhea is 29% (n=14) and his diarrhea is 33% (n=14) in the blood. The patient’s weight is 44 kg and he is obese. The patient’s kidney is filled with fluid and he has diarrhea. The patient’s cough is 13% (n=7) and his cough is 33% (n=7) in the blood. The patient’s weight is 20 kg and he is obese.


## Discussion
In our study, patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with ice-cold ethanol in order to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal therap. However, no significant difference in the efficacy of antifungal therapy was observed when the ice-cold ethanol mode receptor complex was added to the therapy, indicating that the antifungal therapy was ineffective when the antifungal therapy was administered in the first instance.

It is also important to recognize that the mechanism of action of antifungal drugs is a combination of inhibition of fungal growth and inhibition of bacterial growth, which can be controlled by the combination of drugs. In this study, there was a dose-dependent relationship between the antifungal treatment and the effectiveness of antifungal therapy, which is in accordance with the findings of previous studies on fungal infections in the past.

The results of the current study are in accordance with the findings of previous studies. In this study, the antifungal therapy resulted in significant increases in the antifungal concentration in the blood of the patients, which was in accordance with the results of the previous studies. The results of the current study are in accordance with the results of the previous studies. The results of the previous studies are in accordance with the results of the previous studies.

There are some limitations in the current study. The in vitro antifungal therapy was evaluated in vitro, and the antifungal therapy resulted in significant increases in the antifungal concentration in the blood. The results of the current study are in accordance with the results of the previous studies. There are some limitations in the current study. The in vitro antifungal therapy was evaluated in vitro, and the antifungal therapy resulted in significant increases in the antifungal concentration in the blood.
