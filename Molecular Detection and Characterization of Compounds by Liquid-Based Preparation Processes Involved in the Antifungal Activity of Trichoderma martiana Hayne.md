## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast of the genus Cryptococcus. The disease is most common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy, and solid organ transplant patients and those with haematological malignancies. While most cases of C. neoformans infection have been reported in immunocompromised patients, C. gattii and C. neoformans also occur in immunocompetent individuals [1,2]. Both species cause disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals.


## Methods
(2000. Briefly, the fresh soil was treated with 0.5 M HCl (w/v) to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the pellets were suspended in 500 µl of 0.5 M HCl (w/v) in a 100 µl tube. The extraction was carried out in a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 200 rpm for 3 h. Then the solvent was removed by evaporation, and the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of sterile distilled water, and the final pellets were suspended in 200 µl of sterile distilled water. The crude extract was diluted to 1 mg/ml in water, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C for 72 h. The final concentration of the crude extract was adjusted to 1 mg/ml.

Antifungal Activity of Tryptophan Isolate of Trichoderma salina
The antifungal activity of this isolate of Trichoderma salina was tested in a 96-well plate. The compound was prepared by the addition of 1.5% (w/v) of Tryptophan. The mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. Then, the absorbance was measured at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450, Japan). The stock solution of Tryptophan was prepared by dissolving the solvent solution in water. The test mixture was shaken at 200 rpm at 37 °C for 4 h. The absorbance was measured at 590 nm. The stock solution of Tryptophan was prepared by dissolving the solvent solution in water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted by 1% (w/v) of the stock solution, and the dilution was adjusted to 1.0 mg/ml in water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted with distilled water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted with distilled water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted with distilled water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted with distilled water. The test solution of Tryptophan was diluted with distilled water.


## Results
based on the absorption spectra and molecular ion masses of the derivative. In this study, the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 was screened for anti-tuberculosis activity. In this study, the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 and the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 were tested for their activity against Candida spp. in aqueous solution. The results showed that the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 and the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 demonstrated a strong anti-tuberculosis activity against C. albicans and C. glabrata (Table 2). These results suggest that the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 may be suitable for the development of new antibiotics, particularly in combination with other antimicrobials.

Antifungal Activity of the T. martiana Hayne Compound against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida spp.
In addition to testing the antifungal activity of the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 against C. neoformans and C. glabrata, the antifungal activity of the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 against Cryptococcus neoformans was also investigated. The MIC values of the compounds for the MIC of the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 against C. neoformans and C. glabrata were determined. The MIC values of the compounds against C. neoformans and C. glabrata were determined in a broth microdilution assay. The results showed that the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 was more active than the T. martiana Hayne derivative M1 against the tested strains. The MIC values of the compounds against C. neoformans and C. glabrata were also determined in a broth microdilution assay. The results showed that the MIC values of the compounds against C. neoformans and C. glabrata were also determined in a broth microdilution assay.

Inhibition of Candida spp. Infection
The MIC values of the T. martiana Hayne derivatives M1 and M1 were determined in a broth microdilution assay. The results showed that the T.


## Discussion
Taeko [28], which showed specificity towards the antifungal activity of the compound [28. In addition, the antifungal activity of the compound against C. albicans and C. neoformans was observed [28, 29].

Antifungal Activity of Compounds Involved in the Antifungal Activity of Phyllosticta suberianum

In the present study, compounds from the genus Phyllosticta were screened for their activity against C. albicans, which is a human fungal pathogen [30]. In addition, it was found that compounds from this genus could be investigated as antifungal agents. In the present study, the compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity against C. albicans by screening the IC_50 values against three antifungal agents (MIC_50, MIC_90, and MIC_90) with IC_50 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.05 µg/mL.

As shown in Figure 3, the compounds were selected as the inhibitors for the antifungal activity against C. albicans. In the present study, the compounds (5a-4a) were selected as the inhibitors for the antifungal activity against C. albicans. It was found that compounds 5a-4a were the most active compounds, inhibiting the growth of C. albicans. 5a-4a showed inhibition at MIC of 0.04 µg/mL. It was reported that the MIC_90 value ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 µg/mL for compound 5a, which showed the highest antifungal activity against C. albicans. However, the IC_50 value was not varied in different compounds, which is in agreement with the results of the screening.

In addition, compounds 5a-4a were selected as the inhibitors for the antifungal activity against C. neoformans. It was found that compounds 5a-4a could be considered as antifungal agents against C. neoformans, because of their low MIC values.

As shown in Figure 4, the IC_50 values were 0.06 to 0.05 µg/mL for compounds 5a-4a, which showed the highest antifungal activity against C. neoformans.
