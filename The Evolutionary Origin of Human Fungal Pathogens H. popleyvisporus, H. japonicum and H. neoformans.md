## Abstract
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites of insects. Their primary role is to carry out infections of the intestinal tract, such as cutaneous, intestinal, lung, kidney, and lungs. However, an expanded repertoire of microsporidian-specific antibiotics has recently been discovered for their use in agriculture. Microsporidia of the human gut are of special importance, as the major pathogens of the human gut are members of the Brugia spp. As part of a broader survey of the gut microbiota, we aim to understand the role of microsporidian species in the delivery of antimicrobial substances to the human intestine and in the control of the human pathogen P. aeruginosa. Our study shows that P. aeruginosa is capable of utilizing the antibacterial activities of its major gut microbe, Pseudomonas putida, and that the bacterium is also able to survive and replicate within the host during infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that P. aeruginosa is able to establish latent infection in the intestine of its infected host, which might be an important factor in the persistence of infection after the endosymbiosis of the gut symbionts. We conclude that P. aeruginosa is a very obligate intracellular parasite that can readily enter host tissues during infection. However, our knowledge of the bacterial microbiome of the gut is limited, and the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the host may have important implications for the outcome of infection after gut colonization.


## Introduction
In recent years, many fungal pathogens have been classified in more than one category, which has been interpreted as a taxonomically diverse taxonomic group, .g., Aspergillus niger and Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Histoplasma capsulatum, Penicillium marneffei, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Zhao et al., 2007; Takeda et al., 2007; Vélvez et al., 2012). However, the taxonomic concept of specific lineages or species remains uncertain.

Among the more than 50 fungal pathogens classified under the International Code of Nomenclature (ICN), the taxonomic status of fungi has been widely debated over the past two decades (Bicanic and Jaklitsch, 2012). Many authors have observed that the generic concept of specific lineages has been used in the past to delimit species, as well as to redefine the classification of species. More recently, numerous genera of fungi have been classified based on their characteristics, such as melanin pigments, capsular polysaccharides, chlamydospores, hyphae, amyloid spores, or hyphal fragments (Ng and Hsp, 2008; Takeda et al., 2008; Bulgarelli, 2011; Zerebel et al., 2012; Takeda et al., 2012; Gelardi et al., 2013).

The classification of fungi is complicated by the fact that there are still many fungi in different taxonomic groups. The classification of many fungi by generic concepts is often confusing as well as imprecise. As a result, issues related to the classification of fungal pathogens are increasingly being recognized. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel for the Red List of Protected Areas (IPRD) (http://www.iupd.


## Methods
popleyvisporus (A_p.fungi-human-pathogen is a unique virulent species and the system used for this study. We firstly identified the microorganisms that have previously been found to infect human infected with human pathogenic fungi [25], which is usually a difficult task due to the high amount of fungi that are present in the environment. In this study we used two different microorganisms species to differentiate the species from the species from the environment. The most abundant microorganism, A_p.fungi, was isolated from human infected respiratory tract (RI) of H. popleyvisporus and A_p.fungi from H. japonicum. In terms of pathogenicity tests, we determined that H. popleyvisporus, H. japonicum and H. neoformans are the most virulent species in H. popleyvisporus and H. popleycesporus, respectively. All four of these strains were recovered from H. popleyvisporus and H. poplecesporus.

The pathogenicity tests were performed with the following six groups: (1) the pathogen-free control, (2) the pathogen-uninfected control, (3) the pathogen-uninfected control group and (4) the pathogen-infected control group. All the groups were subjected to the same test method. The pathogen-uninfected group consisted of the fungus H. popleyvisporus, H. japonicum and H. poplecesporus.

Strain CBS138 (a.k.a. H. popleyceum) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar slants at 37°C. The strains were cultured in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) broth at 28°C for 4-6 days and subcultured on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar at 28°C for 24-48 h. To prepare the spore suspension, 1 mL of an appropriate volume of medium were added to the conical flask, then it was shaken at 200 rpm at 37°C for 24 h.


## Results
The evolution of human pathogenicity systems was first examined by calculating the relative frequency of small and large gene sets with and without nucleotide sequence variation (NVs. The NVs were measured by calculating the ratio of the total number of genes that were shared by all isolates of each species (n = 32). The results showed that H. popleyvisporus and H. neoformans have higher NVs than other species, but H. popleyvisporus and H. japonicum have lower NVs than other species. The results were compared to the estimated mean of the mean number of nucleotide differences in the small and large gene sets for each species, and the NVs were used to calculate the ratio of the total number of genes that were shared by all isolates of each species (n = 32). The results showed that H. popleyvisporus has higher NVs than other species, but H. japonicum has lower NVs than other species.

The H. popleyvisporus pathogenicity gene set is composed of genes that are part of the core fungal HMG domain (Figure 1). This domain has been shown to be important for pathogenicity in other fungi [7], [14]. The H. popleyvisporus pathogenicity genes have been shown to be highly enriched in the transcription factors (TGFs) [7] (Figure 1). The higher number of TGFs and their distribution in H. popleyvisporus pathogenicity genes indicates that the H. popleyvisporus pathogenicity genes are likely to have different functions, or to be involved in other cellular processes.

The H. popleyces pathogenicity genes are grouped into four major subfamilies (Figure 2). All four H. popleyces pathogenicity genes are found in the NHEJ-encoding family, which is the most highly conserved of the four genes. The NHEJ-encoding gene family has been shown to be the most highly conserved among fungal HMG-domain proteins [8], [10], [14]. The H.


## Discussion
popleyvisporus and . neoformans suggested that they are closely related species within the same clade. The two H. popleyvisporus and H. neoformans species are similar in their gene content and sequence and in their overall morphology (Fig 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1), suggesting that they are closely related.

The H. popleyvisporus species differs from H. japonicum by its single cystidioid-like hyphal system and the larger, conidial-like hyphal filaments (Fig 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1). The species has three distinct septa in its conidiophores, one in the conidiophore and another in the septum, and the conidiogenous cells in both septum and conidiophores are long, branched and fibrous. The conidiogenous cells are branched, branched and fibrous, with a short and elongated neck that is extended to accommodate the cell wall. The hyphae are smooth, branched and fibrous, with a few cysts present on either side of the conidiophore and conidiogenous cells are long and branched. The conidial cells are dark brown, branched and fibrous, and have a single cyst on either side of the conidiophore and conidiogenous cells are long, branched and fibrous. The conidial forms are round to irregular, and the conidia are cylindrical, with two to three conidiogenous cells on each side of the conidiogenous cells. The conidial forms are smooth, branched and fibrous, with a single cyst present on either side of the conidiogenous cells. The conidial forms are round to irregular, and the conidial cells are branched, fibrous and fibrous, with a single cyst present on either side of the conidiogenous cells. The conidial forms are cylindrical, with one cyst present on either side of the conidiogenous cells.

The sequences of H. popleyvisporus and H. neoformans were identical to those of the previously published ITS sequences of H. japonicum and H. popleyces (Lincón et al.
