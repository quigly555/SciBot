## Abstract
Carbonic anhydrase (CA) plays a central role in the formation of multicellular life. In this study, we generated a conditional cep3 null mutant and demonstrated its ability to generate persistent conidial cells in vitro. The CA phenotype was associated with lower cell size, a decreased thickness of the conidial wall, and reduced uptake of the cell iron homeostasis protein Slt2 by slt2 mutants.


## Introduction
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus found in a wide range of environments including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts, and can cause serious invasive infections in healthy individuals. C. albicans is also a member of the most common opportunistic respiratory opportunistic group, including: neutropenic, immunosuppressed patients (e.g., those with hematologic malignancies, organ transplants, or AIDS), patients with hematologic neoplasms, and patients on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (1-3). Systemic, life-threatening, infections can also be acquired when C. albicans is tolerated. In the acute setting, C. albicans can cause respiratory disease, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and invasive pulmonary infections (2, 3). The most common non-life-threatening clinical manifestation of invasive candidiasis is disseminated candidiasis, and mortality rates can reach 90% (4-6). However, the clinical manifestations of disseminated candidiasis, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the high mortality rate (75%), are not well understood.

A number of risk factors are associated with the development of respiratory diseases, including infectious diseases, diabetes mellitus, metabolic disorders, and immunosuppressive agents (7-10). They include chronic inflammation of the respiratory epithelia, hematologic diseases, and, in some patients, gastrointestinal diseases (11, 12). These factors may drive the progression of some patients, particularly those with indwelling disorders, to invasive candidiasis and disseminated candidiasis (13, 14).

Candidiasis is associated with various diseases, including candidiasis, and patients with candidiasis are at increased risk for infections (15-18). In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and pathogenic features of patients with respiratory diseases, including candidiasis, as compared with those with other common opportunistic fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, which can be considered a life-threatening disease in hospitalized patients (19-21).

We investigated the prevalence of Candida in the respiratory tracts of patients with candidiasis and candidiasis, using a retrospective, multicenter, and retrospective study of patients with and without other invasive fungal infections.


## Methods
ED: In this case report we used Case Definition and Definitions (CDF) criteria (Additional file 2). The five criteria we used to define the Meningitis group were: 1) A positive blood culture for Cryptococcus (bacteria not found in the CSF) and 2) blood culture showing two or more organisms present on the blood smear. The PIC of the hospital (hospitality) department was compared between the patients with and without the suspected Meningitis. We counted the number of cases of the suspected Meningitis in the hospital population, not considering patients with histologically proven Meningitis. The Meningitis group included patients with a positive blood culture (bacteria not present in the CSF) and no blood culture showing any organism. The number of patients who developed Meningitis were calculated based on the study number (n = 928) and the number of patients who developed Meningitis within 3 days of the onset of the infection (n = 1,227) or within 7 days after the diagnosis of Meningitis (n = 1,248) were counted as the same number of patients.

Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Cape Town (No. S-514/2014). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients.

Data collection
The patients and their family members who were considered the mediators of Meningitis were included in the study. Informed written consent was obtained from the patients. The study was conducted with the approval of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Cape Town (No. A-021/2014).

Definitions
The term “diagnosis” was used to indicate the clinical course of the disease and the parameters of Meningitis that were considered relevant in a clinical trial were considered to be relevant for the diagnosis. In this study, the definition of “diagnosis” was defined as follows: a positive blood culture for Cryptococcus (bacteria not present in the CSF) and 2) blood culture showing two or more organisms present on the blood smear. In case of a positive blood culture for Cryptococcus, the number of organisms in the CSF was counted as the same number of organisms in the CSF.


## Results

RESULTS: (1) There were 1,721 patients in the cohor. The median age was 56 years (range, 14-85 years). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, co-morbidity, or comorbidities between patients with and without CRAG. Patients were excluded from the analysis due to the low number of participants, time of ART initiation, and baseline CD4^+ T-cell count.

CONCLUSION: Patients with CRAG have a low risk of disseminated cryptococcal infection but are not morbidly and appropriately immunosuppressed, which suggests that they may not have a high risk of disseminated cryptococcosis.
