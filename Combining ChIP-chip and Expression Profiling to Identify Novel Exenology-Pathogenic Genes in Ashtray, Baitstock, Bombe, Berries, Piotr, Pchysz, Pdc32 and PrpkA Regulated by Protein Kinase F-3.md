## Abstract
The appearance of Cryptococcus gattii in the Australianaimed cat from 1999, with the description of itself in the annals of scientific discovery, frustrated many bird and mammal folk belief. Nowadays, the concept of the "outbreak", the elusive species, has been re-emerging in the literature. It is suggested that this may be a result of genetic alteration, of evolution, of genetics or some other such process, but of its own volition it seems to us that C. gattii has evolved to escape the mammalian body in order to acquire the extraordinary physical and chemical strength necessary to invade host tissues and establish a lethal infection in the host. The order of C. gattii has evolved from the bipedal eukaryotic ancestors and their antiphagocytic sub-families have the potential to be expanded upon. C. gattii may, therefore, evolve a new order, a new order containing the 'outbreak' species, possessing the extra- and extra-virulence of the 'outbreak' species, and possessing the extra- and extra-pathogenic forms of this new order. Some aspects of this scenario are supported by recent data. In this paper, we review the available evidence, and discussion the hypotheses and observations concerning the possibility of a new order in C. gattii.


## Introduction
The genus Erythrogloeum, typified by E. fijiensis, was recently revised based on morphological and molecular data. It is a monotypic family, and the species was originally described by Otto Kozak in 1843 from the Cape Peninsula of South Africa as Erythrogloeum fijiensis. Erythrogloeum was introduced to accommodate species that were isolated from bird droppings, trees, and shrubs of native trees. Kozak was able to recover 30 eucalypt and ten species from Erythrogloeum, including E. fijiensis, in a single specimen (1917), which was subsequently transferred to the genus Erythrogloeum in 1873. The taxonomic status of Erythrogloeum has been maintained for over 50 years, and the most recent eucalypt records (1953 and 1961) were published by Kwon-Chung (1954). Erythrogloeum is characterised by the production of true apothecia, conidia with long, thin, hyphae, and stellate pyramids, with phialides that are usually hyaline and globose, with a perforated outer shell (Kwon-Chung, 1953, 1963, 1965; Cairns and Eisman, 1985; Gerdes and Goddard, 1987; Goddard et al., 1989; Kozak, 1994; Eisman et al., 2000). The apothecia are black-green in appearance, and the conidia are globose. The apothecia are densely covered with pseudothecial glands, and the hyphae are germ-free. The hyphae are thick-walled, and the perforation is done through a thin veil, which is composed of two thin layers of hyphae.


## Methods
oleaginosum (2. We used a combination of BLASTP searches against the RepBase website (http://www.genscript.com/RepBase/index.html) with a query sequence of T. oleaginosum (L1) as an outgroup. We used the ability of candidate genes to change over time, as described previously [31], to identify novel orthologous genes. We also considered the presence of candidate genes in fungi in order to identify candidate genes conserved in Ashtray Ashtray fungi. We used the protein kinase assay (Pka) method to identify protein kinases and to identify putative kinases in fungi using a protein kinase-encoding gene list. We selected genes with at least one PFK in the PFK database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pkn/pkn.html) that had been identified in our previous study [32]. We defined a PFK as a PFK family with PFK coding sequence, which was defined by the PFK family members in fungi. We used the PFK family member to annotate putative kinases using BLASTP searches against the RepBase website (http://www.genscript.com/RepBase/index.html) with a query sequence of T. oleaginosum as an outgroup. We also considered the presence of candidate kinases in fungi in order to identify candidate kinases conserved in Ashtray Ashtray fungi.

## Results
ChIP-chip analysis showed that an unknown number of genes were expressed as early as 2 h after infection in Baitstock and Berries (Fig 2A), while an unknown number of genes were expressed more than a third of the time after infection in both Baitstock and Berries (Fig 2B. We found that only a small proportion of genes that were expressed as early as 2 h after infection were expressed as late as 3 h after infection in both Baitstock and Berries. This finding suggests that the virulence of A. fumigatus is influenced by protein kinase F-3, as well as by the expression of genes that are known to be affected by protein kinase F-3 (Fig 2C and D). We next characterized the expression profiles of genes that were differentially expressed during infection by protein kinase F-3 (Fig 2E), as well as by ChIP-chip analysis using the ratio of relative expression of expressed protein (PR) to total protein (Fig 2E). In the case of chitin synthase (CS), all proteins that are known to be activated by protein kinase F-3 are expressed as early as 2 h after infection, and expression of CS-specific genes (CS-specific genes in Fig 2E) increased in response to infection (Fig 2F).

ChIP-chip analysis of the expression profiles of CS-specific genes showed that transcripts with the highest expression in response to infection in Baitstock and Berries were expressed as late as 2 h after infection in both Baitstock and Berries (Fig 2G). The expression profiles of the CS-specific genes were similar between the two Baitstocks and Berries (Fig 2G).

To confirm the expression profiles of CS-specific genes during infection in Baitstock and Berries, we performed ChIP-chip analysis using the protein kinase F-3 protein (ChIP-chip = ChIP-chip = ChIP-chip-chip-chip = ChIP-chip-chip-chip) as well as the expression profiles of genes that are known to be upregulated during infection in Baitstock and Berries (Fig 2H).


## Discussion
cinerea that encodes a protein kinase (PKS) involved in metabolic adaptation to nitrogen starvatio. PKSs are required for many processes, including cell division and cell death, and are activated by many nitrogen-requiring enzymes, including enzymes for carbon utilization and cell growth [46]. In Ashtray, PKSs are present in more than one strain and are most common in two strains. PKSs are found in numerous fungal species. For instance, in C. neoformans, two PKSs, PKS2 and PKS4, were found in the genome of B. cinerea. In B. cinerea, only three PKSs, PKS1, PKS3, and PKS5, were identified in the genome of B. cinerea, suggesting that these three PKSs might be a common feature of the fungal kingdom. The genome of B. cinerea contains 14 PKSs, including PKS1, PKS3, PKS4, and PKS6, and this strain also contains one PKS4 and two PKS6 PKSs (Figure 4). PKS1 and PKS3 are important for the cell wall integrity of fungi, and PKS4 and PKS6 are essential for the growth of C. albicans, M. oryzae, and P. expansum. PKS2 and PKS5 are present in only one strain and are involved in the regulation of PKS genes in many fungal species [46]. The PKS genes in Ashtray, Baitstock, Bombe, and Pdc32 belong to the Blastocladiomycota (Blasto) family of putative PKSs. Blasto is an invasive fungus, and the ability to form a heterodimeric cell wall is required to survive and establish infection [47]. In the Ashtray strain, the PKS2 gene was upregulated in the presence of multiple nitrogen sources and was regulated by both PKSs and protein kinase F-3. This gene cluster is highly similar to the gene cluster in C. neoformans. PKS2 is required for full virulence in both C. albicans and M. oryzae, as well as in other plant pathogens [47].
