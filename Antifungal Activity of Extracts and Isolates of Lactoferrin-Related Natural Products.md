## Abstract
Infection with the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans can lead to superficial and life-threatening systemic infection, leading to life-threatening systemic or subcutaneous candidiasis.


## Introduction
The genus B. cinerea is an important plant pathogen and a major cause of systemic and localized plant infections in developing countries. B. cinerea has a worldwide distribution, infecting a wide range of plant hosts, including some of the most important crops such as wheat, barley, cassava, rape, sugarbeet, and pepper (Lombard et al., 2012; Delattes et al., 2014; Delattes and Inoue, 2015; Maza-Camacho et al., 2017). B. cinerea has been classified as a Plant-Associated Chemotaxonomic Unit (PAU) based on the presence of cyp51 (the enzyme cytochrome P450 subunits 1 and 2), cyp51ß (the enzyme cytochrome P450 subunits 1 and 2) and pax A (the enzyme cytochrome P450 subunits 1 and 2) (Inoue et al., 2015; Delattes and Inoue, 2015; Liu et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the database revealed that B. cinerea was split into two groups, namely the oomycetes and phytopathogenic fungi. Phylogenetic analysis of the database identified five oomycetes, B. cinerea, B. cinerea-phylum O, B. cinerea-phylum L and B. cinerea-phylum S (Lombard et al., 2012; Delattes et al., 2014).

B. cinerea is asexual-hyphomycetous fungus that produces white-rot grey mold in various hosts and cause plant diseases in both in vitro and in vivo hosts (Maza-Camacho et al., 2017). Phylogenetic analysis by phylogenetic analysis has identified five oomycetes in B. cinerea, namely B. cinerea-phylum O, B.cinerea-phylum L and B.cinerea-phylum S, and the phytopathogenic and phytopathogenic oomycetes, O. cylindrosides and O. alternata.


## Methods
cerevisiae (. cerevisiae) were harvested and washed with distilled water. The mycelium and mycelium were then separately digested with methanol at room temperature for 24 h and the extracts and solubils were extracted with methanol at room temperature for 24 h. The extract and solubils were subjected to HPLC-MS/MS analysis on a C-18 column (2.1 × 250 mm, 2.6 µm; C18 Mycelia, Bio-Rad) and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure (100°C). The samples were then diluted 1:10 with methanol, dried, and the MALDI profile was obtained using a PD-MS/MS method.

2.5. Antifungal Activity of Extracts and Isolates of Lactoferrin-Related Natural Products
The antifungal activities of Lactoferrin-related natural products of the phytochemistry of the dried mycelium and mycelium of S. cerevisiae were determined using an in-house system for the determination of the antifungal activities of the extracts and isolates of Lactoferrin-related natural products of the agarose, mycelium, and mycelium of S. cerevisiae [1]. The mycelium and mycelium were separated on 200 g of agar per 10 ml of sterile distilled water, respectively. The extracts and isolates of S. cerevisiae were also separated on 200 g of agar per 20 ml of sterile distilled water. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h and the antifungal activity of the extracts and isolates was determined.

2.6. Antifungal Activity of Extracts and Isolates of Lactoferrin-Related Natural Products
The antifungal activities of the extracts and isolates of S. cerevisiae were determined using a CLSI M38-A CLSI M27-A reference method [1]. The extracts and isolates of S. cerevisiae were also separated on 200 g of agar per 10 ml of sterile distilled water, respectively. The extracts and isolates of S. cerevisiae were also separated on 200 g of agar per 10 ml of sterile distilled water, respectively.


## Results
This may be due to their sensitivity, toxicity, and safety profile (Table 3.

In addition, the contents of the extracts and isoflavins are very similar to the standard agent (Table 3). The extracts are rich in flavonoids, esters, and flavonoids. Among the isoflavins, the ethylene derivative-derived flavonoids oleanolic and oleanolic acid are the most abundant, while the ethyl derivative-derived flavonoids oleanolic and oleanolic acid are less abundant. As shown in Table 3, the flavonoids, oleanolic acid, and ethylene derivative-derived flavonoids are mostly identified in fungi, although the most abundant flavonoids were not found in other eukaryotes. The flavonoids were more abundant in fungi, while the isoflavins were less abundant in fungi.

Fungal Extracts Are Less Antifungal and More Susceptible to Fungicides
In addition, the antifungal activity of the extracts and isoflavins is less evident than that of the standard agent. The antifungal activity of the extracts and isoflavins was evaluated against the A. fumigatus strain ATCC 20231 and the A. niger strain ATCC 20231. The extracts and isoflavins were found to be less effective at inhibiting A. fumigatus growth in the presence of FK506, FK506-2, and FK506-3 (Table 4). The antifungal activity of the extracts and isoflavins was also less evident than that of the standard agent.

The main adverse effects of the extracts and isoflavins are presented in Table 5. The first one is the accumulation of the fungus in the oral rinse. The second is the accumulation of the fungus in the nasal rinse. The third one is the significant weight loss. The fourth one is the significant weight loss. The fifth one is the significant weight loss. The sixth one is the significant weight loss. The seventh one is the significant weight loss. The eighth one is the significant weight loss.


## Discussion
arundinacea extract and its extracts was based on the benzyl alcohols (1-3:1:1:2:1:2) and was carried out on aqueous media (wt/water) for 30 minute. The extraction yield of L. arundinacea was 0.5% (wt/water) and the yield was approximately 18%. The crude extracts (1-3:1:1:2:1:2) were identified as L. arundinacea, L. arundinacea, L. luteus, L. officinalis and L. thigmata.

The results of chemical analyses showed that the crude extracts were of the ethyl acetate class and ethyl esters. This is because the ethyl esters are present in nature. It is believed that this is the main active constituents in the extracts and that the ethyl esters are produced by microbial strains.

The result of molecular modeling analysis showed that the crude extract was a mixture of both ethyl and phenolic acids (Figure 3). The result showed that the mixture was composed of phenolic and phenolic acids. These two substances have been considered as the main constituents of the plant extracts. The chemical analysis was performed on the crude extract with maximum similarity to that of natural products [3]. The results showed that the ethyl esters were obtained from the ethyl acetate.

The ethyl esters are an important part in the plant extracts and are reported as the main constituent of the extract [3]. The phenolic and esteric constituents are related to the production of secondary metabolites [4]. The results showed that the ethyl esters were obtained from the ethyl acetate.

The crude extracts showed high molecular weight and chemical structures (Figure 4).

The molecular weight of the crude extracts was determined by GC/MS. The GC/MS results showed that the crude extracts were of the n-hexane group, and the N-hexane groups have been found in the crude extracts. The molecular weight of the crude extracts was determined to be 35 kDa. The molecular weight of the crude extracts was 17.2 kDa.

The ^1H NMR spectrum of the crude extracts showed two methyl and hydroxyl groups in the N- and C-group, respectively, which is very similar to the N- and C-groups of the alcohols in the crude extracts.
