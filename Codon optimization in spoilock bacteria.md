## Abstract
Although the number of opportunistic pathogens has increased, opportunistic diseases caused by opportunistic bacteria and fungi remain a major threat to global health. A significant aspect is the increase in infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains, including multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, in particular multidrug-resistant (MDR- MLR- and MRSA-related) bacteria. Innovative drugs that could treat these infections are urgently needed. However, these are still in developmental stages and many scientists are deeply interested in the possibility of developing anti-bacterial agents. In this perspective, current and prospective anti-bacterial agents are primarily focused on bacterial pathogens, while an increasing number of anti-fungal agents are focused on the organism's natural host. In this perspective, the objective of this review is to summarise the most promising new anti-bacterial agents that promise a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics and to explore the best strategies to develop anti-infections of bacterial origin.


## Introduction
The genus Arthrinium contains a total of approximately 140 species, of which only three are pathogenic to humans, namely Arthrinium citrinum, Arthrinium citri-cinerea and Arthrinium novo-citrinum [1]. Apart from these species, only one species, Arthrinium phaeodidyma, has been recorded as pathogenic to humans, as it infects humans during occupational activities, such as cleaning and cooking, and subsequently disseminates to the central nervous system [2,3]. In recent years, a number of other Arthrinium species have also been reported as potential human pathogens, such as Arthrinium globosa, Arthrinium minutisporum and Arthrinium mucilaginosa [4,5,6].

The genus Arthrinium is composed of a range of obligate intracellular pathogenic species, which are mostly ubiquitous saprophytes in soil and poorly known in plants. The species Arthrinium citri-cinerea is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes severe infections of the central nervous system and brain in immunocompromised hosts [7]. It is a leading cause of diarrhoea, and has been reported to cause a large proportion of cutaneous and nail infections in the United States and in Europe [8,9]. However, it has also been reported to cause superficial and deep mycosis, keratitis and onychomycosis in immunocompromised patients [8,10]. The species in the genus Arthrinium are pathogenic to humans and are associated with severe infections that include cutaneous, subcutaneous and nail infections [11]. In recent years, the number of reports of human infections caused by Arthrinium citri-cinerea has risen in the medical community [6]. The genus Arthrinium is traditionally classified in the order Urticomyces and is considered a source of serious infections of the skin, nails and urinary tract mucosal membranes [5,6,12].


## Methods
For the analysis of novel ribosomal repeats, we aligned the sequences of these repetitive sequences against the NCBI RefSeq database using the BLAST program [56.

Phylogenetic tree construction
In order to construct a phylogenetic tree of the spoilock bacterial strains, we analyzed the sequences of three families of species: QM94, QM94, and QM95. These sequences were used to build a phylogenetic tree of QM94, QM94, and QM95 in order to identify possible new species in QM95. The tree was constructed using four gene clusters of QM95. The gene clusters were used to construct a DNA map of QM95 and to build a phylogenetic tree of QM95.

Microorganisms and cell culture
Bacteria were cultivated in BHI-agar (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C in the presence and absence of 10 mM HEPES (final concentration 10 mM). The growth rate of QM95 was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm at a wavelength of 620 nm (OD600) [57]. The assay was performed with QM95 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Transcriptome sequencing
RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The RNA integrity of QM95 was determined by a C_6 RNA polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA concentration and quality was measured using a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA quality and quantity were evaluated using a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RNA integrity was further assessed by using an Agilent 2100 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

The RNA content of QM95 was compared to the RNA content of QM95.


## Results
A total of 3.9 mg of HOPS were incubated with 24 µg of the HOPS fragment at a time of 1 h. Figure 3 shows that a single peak was observed in the number of viable cells (in the mean of 25.6±3.5% of viable cells), whereas in the cell counts in the untreated control were 7.7±4.6% and 6.2±1.4% for both samples, respectively. However, the reduction in the number of viable cells was significantly higher when the HOPS fragment was incubated with 24 µg of HOPS in the PbTb-GFP-mAb (p<0.001).

We further evaluated the effect of a pyridoxine-terminally labeled HOPS fragment on the growth of spoilock bacteria. The effect of a pyridoxine-terminally labeled HOPS fragment on the growth of the spoilock bacterial cell was investigated by the addition of 1.5 mM of a pyridoxine-terminally labeled HOPS fragment in the PbTb-GFP-mAb for 24 h. As shown in Figure 4, the growth of the spoilock bacterial cell was significantly inhibited when the HOPS fragment was added to the PbTb-GFP-mAb after 24 h of incubation. However, the presence of a pyridoxine-terminally labeled HOPS fragment in the PbTb-GFP-mAb restored the growth of the spoilock bacteria when the HOPS fragment was added to the PbTb-GFP-mAb at a concentration of 1 µM (Figure 4).
