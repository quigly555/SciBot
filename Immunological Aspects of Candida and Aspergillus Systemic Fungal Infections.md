## Abstract
The yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is an important fungal model for the study of cellular regulation, virulence and pathogenesis, as well as for studying protein signaling mechanisms. To support its lifestyle, R. mucilaginosa has evolved different strategies for transcriptional control, regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis and other cellular processes. The genome sequence of R. mucilaginosa is currently the largest known for Rhodotorula, being a member of the Pucciniomycotina subphylum. R. mucilaginosa is found in the roots and aerial hyphae of many species, but genomic information is sparse. R. mucilaginosa is also heterothallic, having two progeny progenitors, four unisexual females and two fertile wild type strains, and two mating-type strains, which are functionally similar to R. mucilaginosa wild type. We sequenced and annotated the R. mucilaginosa transcriptomes with up to 5' spanning multiple motifs to obtain a comprehensive picture of the genome. The comparison of the transcriptomes of the two wild type strains indicated that the two R. mucilaginosa strains have similar protein expression patterns, produced similar, and even close to, the same amounts of mycelium, and had similar numbers of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Genes encoding the components of polysaccharide hydrolysis and ergosterol biosynthesis were co-localized with the R. mucilaginosa genes. The R. mucilaginosa transcriptome was highly similar to the R. mucilaginosa genome with more than 40,000 predicted genes and many more genes were differentially expressed in the two wild type strains compared. Our study not only provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity in the R. mucilaginosa wild type, but also provides a valuable resource for further studies of this heterothallic yeast.


## Introduction
. albicans is the most common fungal pathogen of the mucosal membranes of humans and animals [15]. This pathogen is found in diverse ecological niches, such as in the air, soil, water, and even inside the respiratory tract. C. albicans can survive in a wide range of environmental conditions, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, and deep-tissue environments [15,16,17]. In the respiratory tract, C. albicans can be found in the alveoli of patients with chronic respiratory disease [18]. C. albicans can be found in a wide range of habitats, including animals, plants, and humans. It has been suggested that C. albicans is the most common pathogen of mucosal-associated airway disease in animals and plants [19]. Although C. albicans is commonly found in the upper airway, its relative abundance is extremely limited [20,21]. The reason for this is not yet clear.

In a study of mice infected with C. albicans, C. albicans was isolated from 11 individuals and the mortality rate was found to be greater than that of C. albicans bloodstream infection [22]. Previous studies have shown that C. albicans is able to thrive within the gut, with an ability to proliferate in the liver and colon [22]. The pathogenicity of C. albicans is dependent on the macrophage (Mß) phenotype, which is associated with its phagocytosis by macrophages [22]. Macrophages have a role in phagocytosis of macrophages, which are capable of destroying C. albicans cells [22,23].

Recent studies of C. albicans infection, its physiology, and treatment have focused on studies in vitro, and in vivo models [24,25]. This study examined the ability of C. albicans to establish a persistent infection inside the phagosome of macrophages, and to induce phagosome maturation. In macrophages, macrophages are activated by macrophage-derived cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), IL-12, and transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), which are important for phagosome maturation and recruitment.


## Methods
The aspergillosis was diagnosed by the presence of a black, but visible, epithelium, which was observed in aspergillosis lesion. Then the fungal cell culture supernatants were collected and the cells were used for RNA extraction. The aspergillosis was diagnosed by positive F. graminearum cultures, which were positive for F. graminearum, and negative F. graminearum cultures. The fungal cell culture supernatants were collected and the cells were used for RNA extraction. The aspergillosis was diagnosed by positive F. albicans cultures, which were negative for F. albicans.

Transmission electron microscopy
Microscopy was performed as described previously [17]. A series of macroscopic changes were observed in Candida as described previously [18], [19].

Microscopy was performed as described previously [17], [20]. The yeasts were observed in a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.4 Oil DIC objective and a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.4 Oil DIC objective. In order to observe the cell wall structure, a minimum of 10 µm were cut from the edge of the glass slide and then were observed under the light microscope.

Tissue processing
For RNA extraction, the aspergillosis was diagnosed by positive F. graminearum cultures, which were positive for F. graminearum, and negative F. graminearum cultures. The aspergillosis was diagnosed by positive aspergillosis cultures, which were negative for F. graminearum, and positive for F. albicans. The aspergillosis was diagnosed by positive aspergillosis cultures, which were negative for F. graminearum, and positive for F. albicans.


## Results
Of the 128,000 fungal ITS sequences, 8,778 (95%) were positive for fungi and 8,428 (94%) were positive for fungi with a false discovery rate (FDR. The mean number of fungal species per animal was 2,528 (1,906/128,428) for fungal ITS sequences. The lowest fungal species richness (species richness = 0.007) was observed in the CNS of patients with fungal infection (p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed between fungal species richness and FDR for fungal species of the CNS.

The ITS phylogeny of fungal ITS sequences was resolved using the Neighbor-joining method (Figure 1). The ITS phylogeny of fungal ITS sequences was identical in all cases. The phylogeny of fungal ITS sequences showed the same topology with the topologies of the topologies of the Bayesian and ML trees (Figure 1). Both Bayesian and ML trees were similar with a few notable differences. The ML tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Mycosphaerellaceae clade with high support (Figure 1). The ML tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Mycosphaerellaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 1). The ML tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Tremellaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 1). The ML tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 1).

In order to determine the phylogenetic position of fungi in fungal systems, we used the neighbor-joining algorithm (Figure 2). The FJAM tree (Figure 2) placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 2). The FJAM tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 2). The ML tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 2). The FJAM tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 2). The FJAM tree placed Aspergillus spp. in the Dissoconiaceae clade with moderate support (Figure 2).


## Discussion
albicans as a reference, and the results are presented in Table . Candida isolates from the clinical trials for candidemia were submitted to a standard laboratory assay. The results showed a broad range of Candida species, with 95% being susceptible to fluconazole, and most of the Candida isolates from clinical trials were resistant to fluconazole. The sensitivity of Candida was high at 97.2%, which was almost two times higher than that of C. glabrata and C. krusei. A similar sensitivity was also reported by Nogueira et al. (2013) for C. albicans. They reported the sensitivity of C. albicans at 97.7% for fluconazole and 97.6% for amphotericin B, and C. glabrata at 98.3% for fluconazole and 99.2% for amphotericin B, respectively.

In the present study, the isolates were sensitive to fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively, which was similar to those reported by another group (Nogueira et al., 2013). However, a similar result was observed for the resistant isolates, C. glabrata and C. krusei, in the present study, which was found to be susceptible to amphotericin B and fluconazole at 97.5% and 98.3% respectively. The sensitivity of the C. glabrata isolates to fluconazole and amphotericin B was higher than that of C. albicans and C. krusei, which was similar to what was reported by Ho et al. (2013) for C. albicans. The sensitivity of C. albicans was also higher than that of C. krusei, which was higher than that of C. pneumoniae, which was susceptible to fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. The sensitivity of the C. krusei isolates to fluconazole and amphotericin B was higher than that of C. pneumoniae, which was susceptible to fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively.

The C. albicans and C. krusei isolates were the most resistant species, with 98.8% and 98.6% sensitivity respectively, which was higher than that of C.
