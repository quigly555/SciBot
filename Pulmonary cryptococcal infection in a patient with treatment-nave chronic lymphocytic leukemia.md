## Abstract
Although its therapeutic aims are similar to those of plants, the fact that some dermatoses appear to be regarded as diseases of the skin is a matter of concern. Aspergillus species are known opportunistic pathogens, and the skin has been reported to be the target of a wide variety of fungicidal substances. The skin of some dermatoses is considered to possess a wide range of potential pathogenic and therapeutic effects. In this review, we attempt to discuss the role of Aspergillus species in the skin as well as the risk factors for skin infections, as well as their underlying mechanisms, as well as the current availability of new data on this important and frequently growing issue.


## Introduction
The European College of Radiology (ECR) and Mycology (CM) has recently carried out a revision of its Guidelines for Clinical Practice (CCRP) for the Infection and Immunity of Microorganisms (microorganisms) (Zhang et al., 2012), which aims to provide guidelines for all forms of clinical microbiology, immunology, and infectious disease (HCIs) in the European Union. This revision was based on the consensus of all involved and is ongoing.

In the revision, the three main revisions were:

a) The revision of the Guidelines for Clinical Practice (CLP) was based on the consensus of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Working Group III and the European Committee on Infectious Diseases (EC-49) (Kapoor et al., 2014). The revision of CLSI to ensure consistency with the CLSI and CLSI Working Group III consensus procedures (Branio et al., 2011; Kock et al., 2015) is ongoing. The revisions of the Guidelines for Clinical Practice (CLP) were based on the consensus of the European Committee on Infectious Diseases and the consensus of the International Committee on Microorganisms Antigen (IC-37). The revisions of the IC-37 Guidelines (Kapoor et al., 2014) are ongoing. The revision of the Guidelines for Clinical Practice (CLP) is based on the consensus of the IC-37 Guidelines and the IC-37 Working Group III consensus procedures.


## Methods
The protocol for the patient was approved by the College of Medicine Ethics Committee, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the patient's final written consent was obtaine.

2.2. Study Area and Study Participants
The research was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Kampala, Uganda, and was approved by the University of KwaZulu-Natal Institutional Review Board (IRB) and University of Pretoria University Ethics Committee (AWC). HIV-infected patients were recruited from tertiary institutions in Uganda and the United States. HIV-infected patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2011 and December 2016. All patients had confirmed positive cultures of Cryptococcus, or both Cryptococcus and other strains. All HIV-infected patients were also matched with those who were not HIV-infected, and the Matching Committee on HIV-1 Among HIV-infected Patients (CCIH) approved the matching trial. All HIV-infected patients were followed until discharge from hospital. All patients had no history of CNS infections and no signs of CNS infection.

2.3. Definitions
Patients with CM, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell count >200 cells/µL (C-CPD) were defined as those with =200 cells/mL. Patients with a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell count >200 cells/µL were defined as those with <200 cells/mL. The criteria for HIV-infected patients with CM were those with a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell count >200 cells/µL, and were not considered to have CNS infection. The criteria for patients with CNS infection included: (1) clinical symptoms consistent with CNS infection; (2) clinical features consistent with CNS infection; (3) clinical manifestations consistent with CNS infection; (4) CNS involvement consistent with CNS infection, and (5) positive CNS antibody titres consistent with CNS infection.

2.4. Definitions
The clinical manifestations were defined as respiratory symptoms consistent with CNS infection, chest radiograph abnormalities consistent with CNS infection, hyperventilation and/or hypotension consistent with CNS infection, altered mental status consistent with CNS infection, and altered sensory system (sNS) response consistent with CNS infection.


## Results
A 12-week survival study of a survival of CNV patients was performe. After 30 days, all patients were followed up for a further 48-h observation period. The first mortality was observed in 1 patient with CD4 cell counts below 50 cells/µL and 30 days after infection, whereas in the other patient the CD4 count was below 50 cells/µL. The second mortality was observed in 2 patients with CD4 cell counts below 50 cells/µL and 30 days after infection, and in the last patient in the group with CD4 cell counts below 50 cells/µL. In addition, the survival data of 1 patient with CD4 cell counts below 50 cells/µL and 30 days after infection were consistent with those of the survival studies of the remaining patients.

Neutrophil depletion and neutrophil-mediated neutrophil influx in CNV patients
The initial neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans, followed by a gradual increase in neutrophil influx (Figure 3A). The first neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection (Figure 3B). The first neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3C). The second neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3D). The third neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3E).

In the first 30 days after infection, the first neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3F). The second neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3G). The fourth neutrophil depletion was observed in the first 30 days after infection with C. neoformans (Figure 3H).

A 12-week survival study of a survival of CNV patients was conducted. After 30 days, 1 patient was followed up for a further 48-h observation period.


## Discussion
C. neoformans is a deadly fungus, which can be found in the lungs and is found in systemic infections, including leukemia [10]. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased in recent years due to the increase in immunocompromised patients [11]. The pathogenesis of cryptococcal infection is considered to be a very rare infection, with only few cases of cryptococcal meningitis have been reported [2, 3, 4]. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is estimated to be 0.5%-2.0% of cases in the United States [3].

Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of cryptococcal meningitis in humans. This fungus is an encapsulated yeast, and is present in diverse biological and environmental niches, including immunocompromised individuals, patients with AIDS, patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and patients with hematologic malignancies [3]. C. neoformans infection in humans is much more common than that in the environment [2].
