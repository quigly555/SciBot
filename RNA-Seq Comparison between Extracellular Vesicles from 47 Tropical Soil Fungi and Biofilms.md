## Abstract
Globally, fungi cause more than 600,000 deaths per year and contribute to the global burden of fungal infections. The prevalence of azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in recently colonized patients with transplanted transplanted or chronic hemodialysis, is increasing. A polyphasic approach to diagnose Aspergillus infections using molecular techniques, such as microbiology or molecular genetics, is lacking in literature. Here we describe a diagnostic approach using molecular and genetic tools that enables early and accurate differentiation between Aspergillus infections and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy.

Using molecular and genetic tools, we identify a novel diagnostic approach that enables early and accurate differentiation between Aspergillus infections and prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy.

Results obtained from clinical and veterinary samples, and from hospital discharge records, are reviewed and discussed to provide a basis for future clinical application of our approach.

## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with various predisposing factors, including various age groups, chronic immunodeficiency conditions, organ transplantation, trauma, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs (1, 2). Invasive candidiasis (IFI) is a common fungal infection and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with various predisposing factors, including various infectious and noninfectious conditions (3). The most common antifungal agents used to treat IFIs are azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. However, the emergence of new fungal species is a growing problem as more species are recognized, thus increasing the clinical threat of IFIs. The development of new antifungals is also challenging as more species have been reported recently (4).

The antifungal drug regimens used to treat fungal infections are highly susceptible to drug resistance, which poses a serious public health threat. The main risk factors for drug resistance are drug-resistant pathogens, low susceptibility to echinocandins, as well as the use of antifungal agents that cause resistance to antifungal agents (5). The most common resistance mechanisms are multidrug resistant (MDR) infections, such as Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Aspergillus spp. (6), which are rarely encountered in the clinic, and fungal infections (7). As an example, in the case of Candida glabrata, the resistance to echinocandins is rarely reported (8). The development of new antifungals is therefore a challenge for the development of new antifungal therapies.

The polyene amphotericin B (AmB) is an amphipathic lipid complex consisting of three subclasses, amphipathic lipopeptides (AmB_1-AmB_6), amphipathic lipid complexes (AmB_2-AmB_6), and lipopeptides with different structures (AmB_3-AmB_7). AmB_1 is a nonselectable fluorophore active against both C. albicans and C.


## Methods

Fungi Isolation and Characterization
Samples of the soil were collected from three different sites in the south of Singapore and processed as described in previous studies (21. Fresh soil was collected from four soil samples (two samples from the south and one from the north) collected from three different sites in the south of Singapore, and processed as described in previous studies (21, 22). Fresh soil was collected from two soil samples (one from the north and one from the south) collected from three different sites in the south of Singapore, and processed as described in previous studies (21).

Fresh soil was collected from two soil samples (one from the north and one from the south) collected from three different sites in the south of Singapore, and processed as described in previous studies (21, 22).

Plant and soil preparation
The fresh soil samples were collected from three different sites in the south of Singapore. Fresh soil samples were collected from one site (Nr. 55.29, S. 81.53, S. 82.57, S. 84.33) and two sites (Nr. 55.48, S. 82.48, S. 82.59, S. 84.39, S. 85.33) in the south of Singapore, and processed as described in previous studies (21, 22).

Isolation of fibrinogen
Fibrinogen was extracted from fresh soil samples using a rotary evaporation method with slight modifications (23). Fresh soil samples were collected from three different sites (Nr. 55.27, S. 82.37, S. 82.49, S. 84.49, S. 86.14, S. 86.19, S. 86.22, S. 87.54, S. 88.39, S. 89.42, S. 90.44, S. 96.14, S. 97.43, S. 98.15, S. 99.92, S. 99.84, S. 101.90, S. 103.35, S. 108.29, S. 109.27, S. 111.29, S. 111.48, S. 112.79, S. 112.88, S. 112.91, S. 115.


## Results
In total, 69 proteomic changes were observed with the proteomics software in total, suggesting that extracellular vesicles from different fungal species are differentially abundan. The average number of differentially abundant extracellular vesicles was significantly different (p < 0.05), suggesting that extracellular vesicles from different fungal species were differentially abundant. The proteomic analysis also revealed that extracellular vesicles from the T. reesei isolate were significantly enriched for peptides. In total, 17 peptides were found to be present in extracellular vesicles from the T. reesei isolate and were found to be differentially abundant (Table 2). This suggests that the T. reesei extracellular vesicles could be up-regulated during the host interaction. To further analyze the proteome of extracellular vesicles from T. reesei, the proteomes of T. reesei were analyzed using the BLASTP algorithm [25] and are shown in Fig 4a, b. In total, 55 proteins were detected as being present in extracellular vesicles from the T. reesei isolate and were enriched for peptides. These proteins were in part implicated in the T. reesei proteome, including the HxN-like (a putative protein) and the Rps family (a hypothetical protein), as well as the CDN-like (a putative protein). The proteomic analysis revealed that the proteomes of T. reesei extracellular vesicles were highly enriched for peptides (Fig 4c), suggesting that extracellular vesicles from T. reesei were enriched for peptides. A total of 36 proteins were detected as being present in extracellular vesicles from the T. reesei isolate and were found to be differentially abundant (Table 2). These proteins were in part implicated in the T. reesei proteome, including the Rps family (a hypothetical protein), and the CDN-like (a putative protein).

## Discussion
The extracellular vesicles were clustered together on a scale of 1 to 10^2 Âµm in size, with the highest number of globular vesicles found in the extracellular vesicles from the Biofilm (Fig 2. The extracellular vesicles were also observed in extracellular vesicles of the other species of Diversities (Fig 2), but in the extracellular vesicles were absent the globular vesicles of the other species. The fact that the extracellular vesicles were not observed in extracellular vesicles from other species (Fig 2) makes sense as they are often found in extracellular vesicles from other species (such as C. trifida).

The extracellular vesicles were detected in the extracellular vesicles of the four species of Diversities (Fig 2). All four species of Diversities were isolated from the extracellular vesicles of the extracellular vesicles of other species (Fig 2). The extracellular vesicles from the other species of Diversities were not observed in extracellular vesicles of the extracellular vesicles of the other species of Diversities. The extracellular vesicles of the other species were found in extracellular vesicles from other species (Fig 2). The extracellular vesicles of the other species of Diversities were found in extracellular vesicles from the extracellular vesicles of the other species of Diversities. The extracellular vesicles of the other species were found in extracellular vesicles from extracellular vesicles from the extracellular vesicles of the other species of Diversities. The extracellular vesicles of the other species were found in extracellular vesicles from other species (Fig 2). The extracellular vesicles of the other species were found in extracellular vesicles from extracellular vesicles from other species (Fig 2). Extracellular vesicles were found in extracellular vesicles from extracellular vesicles from other species (Fig 2).
