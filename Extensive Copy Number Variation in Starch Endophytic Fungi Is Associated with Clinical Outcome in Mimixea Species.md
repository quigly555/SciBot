## Abstract
The periodic table of the calmodulin (CaM)-polysaccharide capsule is a well-recognized component of eukaryotic pathogens and has been proposed as a biomarker of organism-wide disease. However, CaM-polysaccharide is only one of several structurally diverse CaM isoforms, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. CaM-Polysaccharides (CaM-PsdN) have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and fungi.

In this study, we demonstrated the presence of two structurally and most frequently-occurring CaM-Polys Mag-PsdN in a rat model of human urinary tract infection.

This is the first report to report that a CaM-Polysaccharide is present in the human urine tract tract, which may be a biomarker for human urine tract infection.


## Introduction
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cells that are released from cells of any organism, but they can also be found in living cells, especially in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1). Although the majority of research work has focused on the role of EVs in cell-to-cell interactions, it is still unclear why some organisms are more sensitive to environmental changes. While the role of EVs has been described in a number of models, their true role in the cell-environment and the cell-specific functions of these cells remain largely unknown.

The role of EVs in the human body has been described, but there are several notable exceptions. Most studies have focused on peripheral tissues, including the lungs, colon, and skin, that are infected by pathogens. Many studies have found that cells of the skin are particularly sensitive to heat, low oxygen availability, and high temperature (2-4). Infected cells in the lungs are likely to have EVs that have evolved to resist oxidative stress, but the mechanisms by which these cells respond are still unknown (5). In addition, the host immune system has evolved mechanisms to defend against pathogens, which are believed to be mediated by EVs (6). Finally, it has been reported that certain immune cells, such as macrophages, are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and that these cells may have evolved mechanisms to cope with that stress (7).

Our understanding of the role of EVs in the innate immune response to environmental changes is incomplete.


## Methods
. Sample Collection and Processing
The sample collection was performed at the Faculty of Tropicalology and Public Health (TUNES) Teaching Hospital, Changsha, China. The sample collection of samples was performed under the Ministry of Public Health (MOS) protocol for the processing of samples of animals (MOS Protocol # 906-2017). The sampling and processing of samples was performed according to the previously reported guidelines of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, no. 123 [25], European Directive 2010/63/EU).

2.2. Sample Collection and Processing
The samples were collected from 11 animals, including three animals that exhibited the typical signs of a mock-infection, including male, female, and rat. The animals were weighed after euthanasia and then maintained in a temperature-controlled room at 25 °C with ambient air condition.


## Results
DEGs from 34 out of 36 species were identified, and those from all 36 species were identifie. The DEGs for the 36 species were assigned to a gene order based on the protein data sets with the gene annotations in the GenBank database. The gene order of the 36 species was shown to be highly divergent among the four sequenced Mimixea species. A comparison of the gene order of the 36 species revealed the presence of several syntenic blocks of gene order in the 36 Mimixea species. The syntenic blocks were separated by a single topology within a node, where each node had a well-defined domain (Figure 5A). In the 36 Mimixea species, the topology of the syntenic blocks was well defined with a well-defined topology (Figure 5A). To understand how the gene order of the 36 species differed among the four sequenced Mimixea species, we analyzed the DEGs of the 36 species in four functional categories: “protein folding, translation, and protein fate” (Figure 5B). The most common functional category was “protein folding, transport, and modification of small molecules, motility, and carbon metabolism” (Figure 5B).

The most common functional category was “complex carbohydrate metabolism” (Figure 5B). Most of the gene order was identical in the 36 Mimixea species. In contrast, genes encoding the other core functional categories were different in all the 36 Mimixea species. Genes encoding the protein kinases and other transcription factors were less common than those involved in the gene ontology (GO) categories. We found that genes encoding the dehydrogenase, oxidation-reduction process, transmembrane transport, and DNA-binding protein categories were different between the 36 Mimixea species. The most common GO terms were “protein folding, transport, and modification of small molecules, motility, and carbon metabolism” and “complex carbohydrate metabolism”.

We compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 36 Mimixea species (Figure 6) to compare their evolution within and between Mimixea species.


## Discussion
The primary source of stress is the immune response to pathogen infections and it is a highly-regarded and associated trait in the species, but also in Mimixea species with different lifestyle. However, in most Mimixea species with pathogenicity, the level of stress is low and can be easily overcome by incorporating other types of stress (reviewed by [60]). The commonest source of stress is direct contact with host plants and to some extent is linked to fungal communities.

We hypothesized that exposure to Starch could trigger the immune response and inhibit the pathogenicity of Mimixea. To test this, we measured the production of anti-fungal compounds by the combined treatment with Starch and Starch-L-DOPA. We found that exposure to Starch and Starch-L-DOPA increased the production of anti-fungal compounds, including anti-HIV, anti-paraproteobacterial peptide, and anti-NEM-resistant isolate (Figure 3). These anti-fungal compounds were detected in the Mimixea ecosystem, and we expect these compounds will be detected in the Mimixea ecosystem in the future.

Starch-induced immune response to pathogens is a well-described trait for Mimixea species [61], and it is a common feature for Mimixea species with different lifestyles. In Mimixea, this is known as the Starch-induced immunity (SIR) trait. Starch is a ubiquitous component of plant tissues and host tissues, and is a key factor in plant responses to pathogens [62]. Starch can be released by the host plants and can be secreted into the environment, and this could also trigger the immune response [63]. However, in Mimixea, it is not known whether the Starch-induced immune response is induced by a certain specific type of stress, or whether the responses are initiated by different stressors. It is possible that the responses are initiated by different types of stressors, and that the stressors might be selected for, or that the response is associated with different species of the genus Mimixea. Future studies will be required to define the types of stressors that trigger the Mimixea immune response and how the response is associated with the species of Mimixea.
