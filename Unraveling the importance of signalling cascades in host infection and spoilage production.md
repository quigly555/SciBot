## Abstract
The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii is a deadly fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals and animals. Current antifungal drugs are suboptimal given the limited efficacy of systemic therapy and the emergence of drug resistance. The present study aimed to identify antifungal drug-resistance mechanisms in C. gattii.

Antifungal drug susceptibility assays were performed against 136 drug-susceptible and 100 drug-resistant isolates of C. gattii. The susceptibility of strains resistant to ten tested antifungal drugs was determined by rRNA-seq. The pools of resistance genes were first performed with the TaqMan assay. Genes encoding known virulence factors and amino acid transporters were identified and expressed genially. Secondary structure-activity tests were performed to determine which transporters were effective in causing resistance.

Nine transporters were selected from the drug-susceptible and 100 drug-resistant strains by homology-domain, and two transporters were selected from the drug-resistant strain by homology-domain knockdown. The drug resistance genes of the ten transporters were identified by using the RPLH and VITEK2 reverse transcription methods. The expressed genes of all of the ten transporters were also identified by the ISHAM-based pathway analysis.

These findings provide insight into the genetic resistance profiles of the C. gattii genome and will facilitate the development of improved antifungal drugs against C. gattii. The identification of the transporters will facilitate the identification of all currently used antifungal drugs and the identification of additional drug-susceptible strains.

## Introduction
In recent years, the incidence of fungal infections has increased significantly.


## Methods
KY-15-6. The “Four-year “Study of Pathogens” was carried out in a veterinary microbiology laboratory in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal.

The “Four-year “Study of Pathogens” is a prospective study of the “Invasive Candida” study conducted by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Microbial Diseases (NIDM) and other research institutions at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. It has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal (No. KY-15-6). This study was carried out in accordance with the “Invasive Candida” guidelines. All the relevant information about the study including demographic and clinical data, clinical characteristics, microbiological data and infectious disease classification were recorded. The “Invasive Candida” protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal.

The “Invasive Candida” study is also classified as “Shallow Endpoint” (Shake-Fluorization) in this study.


## Results
The function of Cdc5 is well established in mammalian, murine, and human pathogen. Our goal was to identify and characterize the signaling pathways involved in host infection.

Cdc5 plays key roles in the virulence of S. cerevisiae and M. oryzae
The fungus is known to be a pathogen in humans, but its pathogenicity has been controversial [28, 29]. Our experiments were designed to determine the roles of Cdc5 in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae, M. oryzae, and M. oryzae. The role of Cdc5 in pathogenicity was examined by assessing the virulence of these three strains using the murine inhalation model. A reduction in virulence of the three strains was observed at the protein level (Figure 6A). A more pronounced reduction in virulence was observed at the cellular level, however, with the three strains showing a weaker virulence than either of the murine strains (Figure 6A). The ability of these strains to form biofilms was further evaluated by the ability to establish biofilms in the presence of a combination of macrophage-like killing agents (e.g. BCS, CFW, and eosinophilic detergents) and by the ability to establish biofilms in the presence of C. albicans. The effect of a combination of macrophage-like killing agents on the virulence of these strains was evaluated by the ability to establish biofilms and on the ability to establish biofilms in the presence of BCS, CFW, and eosinophilic detergents. The three strains demonstrated a better ability to establish biofilms than either of the murine strains (Figure 6B). These data suggest that the ability of the Cdc5-dependent factors to influence the virulence of S. cerevisiae, M. oryzae, or M. oryzae is dependent on the Cdc5-dependent factors.

The virulence of all three strains was evaluated in a model of systemic infection. All three strains showed a weaker virulence than either of the murine strains (Figure 6C).


## Discussion
The data revealed that the phagocyte responses to phagosome were impaired when Hsp90 was removed from the mediu. We did not observe differences in the phagocyte responses to pathogens within the same phagosome as the phagosome containing a saprophyte yeast (Supplementary Fig 5). This is consistent with the hypothesis that saprophyte yeasts secrete molecules that are able to kill pathogen. However, the data did not provide further insights into the mechanisms of action of Hsp90. We used the yeast S. cerevisiae to screen the S. cerevisiae response to the phagocyte. We did not observe significant differences in the responses of the phagocyte to the pathogen within the same phagosome (Supplementary Fig 6), which may be due to the fact that S. cerevisiae is a yeast that produces many proteins that are important in phagocyte recognition. In fact, the response of the phagocyte to the pathogen was stronger than the response of S. cerevisiae to the pathogen, but the phagocyte response was stronger than the response of S. cerevisiae to S. pombe (Supplementary Fig 7). The data also revealed that the phagocyte response to S. cerevisiae is highly dependent on the presence of Hsp90 and not the presence of other proteins. This suggests that the response of the phagocyte to the pathogen is similar to that of S. cerevisiae, which explains the differences in the phagocyte responses observed in this study. We also confirmed that Hsp90 can interact with the fungus Hsp70, and this was further confirmed by the in vivo system used (Fig 3).

Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms of action of Hsp90 and how it regulates the phagocyte to the pathogen. We also need to assess the influence of Hsp90 on other signaling pathways. We have shown that Hsp90 plays an important role in pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that Hsp90 can regulate pathogenicity in a phagocyte-independent manner, by downregulating Hsp90 expression.
