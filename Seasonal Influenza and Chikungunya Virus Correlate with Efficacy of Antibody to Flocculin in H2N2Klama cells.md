## Abstract
The immune response to Helicobacter pylori involves a number of conserved T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 receptors, which are expressed on the surface of lamina propria gastrica (a lamina-anchored opportunistic infection) and on the inside of lamina propria. The role of these receptors in H. pylori pathogenicity has been well-described in bacteria, where Th17 cytokines are induced when activated upon lysis of host cells. In this review, we focus on the role of IL-18 receptors, as well as their ligand class, T helper, in H. pylori.


## Introduction
The genus Hymenaea includes over 200 species, most of them monotypic. The genus has been traditionally classified as anamorphic, containing more than 40 species (Hawksworth, 1952). Morphologically, Hymenaea is a phylloplane, belonging to the family Hydnaceae (Eriksson and Hawksworth, 1962; Hawksworth, 1956; Wingfield and Hawksworth, 1970; Wingfield, 1972; Hawksworth, 1974). The genus is found on the floccose, basidiospores, erect, cylindrical, and corky basidiospores with short, thick, and vivid branches. Hymenaea is characterized by long, thick, and vivid brown stromata, consisting of at least six interconnected chains. The stromata are dark brown, septate, and generally muriform in shape. The basidiospores are ovoid to ellipsoidal, occasionally oblong, with verticillasters on either side. The stromata are often aseptate, with two to four longitudinal ridges in each direction. The basidiospores are ellipsoid, spiny, and occasionally subinous with a rough septate stroma. Hymenaea is divided into three genera, Hymenaea, Coryneum and Coryneum.


## Methods
Parasites
C. glabrata sensu stricto (ATCC 9001, C. glabrata) was maintained as described [12] in our previous study [13]. A C.


## Results
As shown in Fig 4, r had no significant effect on T cell proliferatio. However, l had a significant effect on T-cell proliferation. The effect of r on T-cell proliferation was significant in a dose dependent manner (Fig 4). Interestingly, r increased the reduction in the number of T cells in the lung but not in the brain, while l had no effect. These data suggest that r could increase the number of T cells in the lung but not in the brain. The effect of r on pulmonary T-cell proliferation was significant in a dose dependent manner (Fig 4). The effects of l on T-cell proliferation were significant in a dose dependent manner (Fig 4).

Chironin and L-threonine Decrease T-cell Phenotype in M. tuberculosis

We next investigated whether R and L could affect the ability of the T cells to mount a successful infection. M. tuberculosis is a highly virulent form of the human pathogen, and the immune response in this infection is considered to be well established. However, the primary infection of the lung is not expected to produce any significant differences in the T cells, as is often the case for tuberculosis (28). We therefore assessed the ability of r to affect T-cell phenotypes.

M. tuberculosis, like other human pathogenic fungi, contains a high degree of complexity with a wide range of bacterial virulence factors. For example, it is a highly virulent form of Cryptococcus neoformans, and is closely related to the type of clinical infection that causes the avian bronchopneumonia (BBO). However, we observed no significant differences in the fungal phenotypes of the two strains. We therefore investigated the effect of L and r on the T cell phenotypes in a dose dependent manner. We observed that L and r had no effect on T-cell phenotypes (Fig 5).

In addition to the disease associated phenotypes, we also observed differences in T-cell proliferation. L and r had no effect on T-cell proliferation. However, r significantly reduced T-cell proliferation in the lungs of infected mice. The effect of l on T-cell proliferation was significant in a dose dependent manner (Fig 5). The effects of r on T-cell proliferation were significant in a dose dependent manner (Fig 5).


## Discussion
In addition to phagocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are also likely to provide a specialized niche for pathogenic microorganisms, including bacterial and fungal pathogen. In addition to phagocytes, phagocytes play a role in innate immunity. They are also important for the survival of the host immune response [22], [23], [24], [27], [48], [49]. In our previous study, we demonstrated that macrophages from L. major infection induced by S. pneumoniae were phagocytosed by macrophages in a phagocytosis-independent manner (Figure 1B). These results indicated that macrophages from L. major infection induce significant phagocytosis by macrophages in vitro. Interestingly, macrophages from S. pneumoniae were phagocytosed by macrophages from different strains. In addition to L. major, L. donovani infection induces phagocytosis of L. donovani by macrophages in vitro [15]. In this study, we demonstrated that the phagocytosis of L. donovani by macrophages from S. pneumoniae was dependent on the presence of antigen on the phagosome, which was not the case in L. major infection.

The lncRNAs encoding lncRNAs were confirmed to be involved in the innate immune response to L. donovani infection in vitro (Figure 2B). The results indicated that L. donovani infection induced the expression of lncRNAs in macrophages. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that L. donovani infection was not able to induce the expression of lncRNAs, as we did not investigate the expression of lncRNAs in macrophages from S. pneumoniae-infected mice. In addition, it has been reported that L. donovani infection induces the expression of lncRNAs in macrophages [16].

In this study, we found that L. major infection induced the expression of lncRNAs by macrophages in vitro. The results indicated that L. major infection induced the expression of lncRNAs in macrophages, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. In addition, we also verified the ability of macrophages from S.
