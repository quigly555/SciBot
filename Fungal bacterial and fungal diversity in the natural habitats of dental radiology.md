## Abstract
Sugar refinery washing water (SRWW) contains abundant levels of carbon sources and low levels of evolutionary carbon sources, making it a good candidate for bioremediation of atmospheric CO2. However, the harvesting of these resources would have dire consequences for human activities and ecosystems, including fish populations. To help understand the effects of SRWW carbon limitation, we have performed a detailed analysis of the effects of CaCl2 on fish populations. CaCl2 effects on fish populations were dominated by the effects on largemouth bass (Lepisordar hilipina) and white water (Ostibacter crescens), the two most abundant marine bacteria in the water and fish sampled. We found that CaCl2 inhibits growth of both largemouth and seagrasporeal fish in a dose-dependent manner. We found that the CaCl2-dependent inhibition of largemouth fish occurred at much higher levels than the dose-dependent inhibition of seagrasporeal fish.


## Introduction
The genus Acanthamoeba contains a wide range of non-parasitic species, mainly saprobic, but also opportunistic, such as the ubiquitous, amoebic fungus A. castellanii, and the ubiquitous, opportunistic and amoeboid fungus C. dubliniensis [1]. These genera have an amoebic lifestyle, with the common feature of budding filamentous hyphae with characteristic sclerotia. However, A. castellanii has a special feature of being amoeboid and was recently considered as such a unique member of the Acanthamoeba genus [2]. These amoeboid amoebae are internal to the external hyphae and present with a thick capsule [3].


## Methods
Sample collection and processing
Freshly collected samples were collected at three different locations: (i) Nakhon Phan Thieu National Park, Thailand; (ii) Nakhon Phan Thieu National Park, Thailand; (iii) Nakhon Phan Thieu National Park, Thailand.


## Results
A total of 58,624 sequences were obtained (Table 1. The relative abundance of identified genera varied greatly among the sampled sites and across the province. The most abundant genera (in terms of relative abundance) were Stenotrophomonas, Hanseniaspora, Exophiala, and Hannaella. The remaining genera (n = 10, 0.1%) were unidentified, which is typical for bacterial genera. Stenotrophomonas was the most abundant genus in all sites, followed by Hanseniaspora in most sites (Table 1).

A total of 18,939 sequences (1,459 sequences per site) were retrieved in the phylum Ascomycota, which comprises more than half of the total Ascomycota sequences in the United States (1,464 sequences per site). Among the Ascomycota sequences, only 838 (16%) were known to be exclusive to the United States. Of the Ascomycota sequences, 13,861 sequences (5,252 sequences per site) were obtained in the five dental radiology sites in the United States. The average sequence length of the Ascomycota sequences was 39.5 bp, which was larger than the average sequence length of sequences in Aspergillus (28.1 bp) (Table 1). The average sequence length of the Ascomycota sequences in the five sites was more than 100 bp. The average sequence length of the Ascomycota sequences in the five sites was higher than that of sequences in the healthy dental radiology site (Table 1).

A total of 4,084 unique DALD sequences were obtained from the dental radiology site in the United States (1,686 sequences per site). Most DALD sequences (n = 5,624) were obtained in the United States. The average sequence length of the DALD sequences was 12.5 bp. There was an average of 34.1 sequences per site in the United States. The average sequence length of DALD sequences in the United States was more than 100 bp. The average sequence length of DALD sequences in the five sites was 5.3 bp.


## Discussion
In a study of 3,560 patients with oral candidiasis, 3,183 had fungal fungal co-infection, and the fungal loads ranged from 1 to 27 CFU/cm^.2 In that study, 6,506 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 34 CFU/cm^2, and the fungal loads ranged from 5 to 15 CFU/cm^2.3 In a study of an 8,438-patients with oral candidiasis, 5,906 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a patient with a fungal load of 31 CFU/cm^2.4 In that study, 6,859 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 25 CFU/cm^2.5 In that study, 6,101 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 20 CFU/cm^2.6 In a study of a 6,300-patient cohort of a 12-year-old boy, 5,639 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a patient with a fungal load of 35 CFU/cm^2.7 In that study, 6,185 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 30 CFU/cm^2.8 In that study, 6,146 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 35 CFU/cm^2.9 In a study of an 8,000-patient cohort of a 12-year-old boy, 3,306 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 26 CFU/cm^2.10 In that study, 5,094 fungal isolates were found in the primary nasal cavity of a 12-year-old boy with a fungal load of 30 CFU/cm^2.
