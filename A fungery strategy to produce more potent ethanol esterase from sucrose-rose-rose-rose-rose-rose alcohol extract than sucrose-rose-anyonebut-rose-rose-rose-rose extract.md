## Abstract
The genomes of many plant fungal pathogens encode many proteins involved in interactions with the environment. They also encode enzymes that are used to digest plant defence products and play important roles in fungal pathogen dispersal. Here we investigate the genomic distribution of the main polysaccharide components of the fungal cell wall protein matrix, the polysaccharide glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored polysaccharide arylation products and the polysaccharide polysaccharides known to be involved in the interaction with the pathogen. Our results provide the first insights into the polysaccharide arylation proteins and their functional roles.


## Introduction
Malassezia is a major fungal pathogen of humans, and is the most common cause of fungal skin disease. It is estimated that over a billion people worldwide are affected by this pathogen, and it is the causative agent of skin diseases such as athlete’s foot, pox, eye, ear, scalp, and nails. In endemic regions like Malassezia-dominated Mediterranean areas, the prevalence of skin diseases is on the rise. According to the World Health Organization, skin diseases in Malassezia are responsible for more than 1.5 million cases of cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and mucosal infections in the world annually. Moreover, some patients have resistance to various antifungal drugs and other infections. Furthermore, skin diseases in endemic regions may be more common than in endemic areas due to delayed treatment or skin lesions that are poorly controlled.

The human body’s innate immunity is characterized by a response of the innate immune system to the infection by phagocytes and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the host to defend against infection (1). Several studies have shown that the antimicrobial peptides (AMP) produced by phagocytes facilitate the phagocytosis of the infectious agent (2-6), as well as the formation of a protective matrix (7-9). AMPs are basic leukocytes that are collectively recognized by the immune system. In addition to the typical cells known as phagocytes, a diverse group of microorganisms are capable of interacting with the immune system, which are referred to as phagolysosomes (10,11). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the role of phagocytes and AMPs in the innate immune response to Malassezia. We focus on the role of phagocytes in the innate immune response to Malassezia and the role of phagolysosome-mediated immunity.


## Methods
One of the two methods is the solid as opposed to the solid as the solvent, and therefore, more potent lignin esterases are produce. In this strategy, the water-soluble extract is used in the column, while the solvent is used in the column. In this method, the solvent is used in the column instead of the solvent. In this strategy, the column is filled with carbon, and the solvent is added. In this strategy, the column is filled with methanol, and the solvent is added. In this strategy, the column is filled with water. The solid is the main source of ethanol esterases. In this strategy, the solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with carbon, and the side is filled with water. The column is filled with petroleum ether, and the side is filled with water. The column is filled with ethanol, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The column is filled with ethanol, and the side is filled with water. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The column is filled with ethanol, and the side is filled with water. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The column is filled with ethyl ether, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with water. The column is filled with EtOAc. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with EtOAc. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with EtOAc. The column is filled with EtOAc, and the side is filled with water. The solvent is applied at the side, and the side is filled with petroleum ether. The column is filled with EtOAc.

The method to obtain the ethanol esterases from sucrose-peptone-anyonebut-rose-sacrose-broth extract was used to obtain the most potent lignin esterases from sucrose-peptone-anyonebut-rose-sacrose-broth extract. In this method, the water-soluble extract is used in the column, while the solvent is used in the column. In this method, the solvent is used in the column, while the solvent is used in the column.

Effect of ethanol esterase on the fermentation of a maltotrophic sugar-containing maize crop
A similar effect was observed on the ethanol esterase activities of three different maltotrophic sugar-containing maize crop varieties. The yield of ethanol esterase in sugar-containing maize crop varieties was lower than that of the other two sugar-containing maize varieties. The yield of ethanol esterase in sugar-containing maize varieties was significantly lower than that of the other two sugar-containing maize varieties (Table 1). The yield of ethanol esterase in sucrose-containing maize varieties was significantly lower than that of the other two sugar-containing maize varieties (Table 1). The yield of ethanol esterase in sucrose-containing maize varieties was not significantly different from that of the other two sugar-containing maize varieties (Table 1). The ethanol esterase activity of ethanol esterase activity in maize was not significantly different from that of the other two sugar-containing maize varieties (Table 1).

Effect of the glycerol-tolerant yeast Cryptococcus neoformans on the ethanol esterase activity of sucrose-containing maize crop varieties
We tested the fermentation of a sucrose-containing maize crop using the same ethanol esterase system used in this study. The ethanol esterase activity of the ethanol esterase system in this system was higher than that of the glucose-containing system. The ethanol esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was higher than that of the ethanol esterase system in this study. The ethanol esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was higher than that of the ethanol esterase system in this study. The ethanol esterase activity of the ethanol esterase system in this study was lower than that of the glucose-containing system. The ethanol esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was lower than that of the ethanol esterase system in this study. The ethanol esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was higher than that of the ethanol esterase system in this study. The glucose esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was higher than that of the glucose esterase system in this study. The ethanol esterase activity of the glucose-containing system was higher than that of the glucose esterase system in this study.


## Discussion
maltitolum (Nakamura et a., 2005) and water-alkal-6-en-1-one-aldehyde (water-alkal-6-en-1-one-aldehyde) extract of S. maltitolum (Nakamura et al., 2006).

Our results showed that sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has better antifungal activity than that of water-isoprenoid (water-isoprenoid) extract of S. maltitolum (Nakamura et al., 2006). Furthermore, sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has been reported to be an antimicrobial agent (Cao et al., 2014). Our results also showed that water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has a high inhibitory effect on C. albicans. A previous study also showed that sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum had a better antifungal activity than water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum (Cao et al., 2014). Although sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has been reported to have a bactericidal effect (Cao et al., 2014), we found that the sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has a bactericidal effect. This could be due to its antioxidant activity.

The antifungal activity of water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum was comparable to that of sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum. This could be due to its biodegradability and solubility in water. It is important to note that sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has a lower MIC against Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC = 1.0 mg/ml), whereas water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has a MIC of > 1.0 mg/ml. The authors of the study also found that sucrose-yeast extract from S. maltitolum has a higher MIC against Candida albicans. It has been reported that the MIC value of water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum was > 1.0 mg/ml and that water extract from S. maltitolum has a better antifungal activity than water-yeast extract from S. maltitolum (Cao et al.
