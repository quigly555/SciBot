## Abstract
The development of multidrug-resistant bacteria with potent antimicrobial activity has become a growing concern in the last years. The present study aimed to investigate the activity of a fluoroquinolone compound against three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the order Streptococcus, using a checkerboard microdilution assay. The total activity of the compound against the bacteria was determined using a checkerboard microdilution assay with MIC values ranging between 0.0725 and 3.75 µg/mL. The results showed that the compound had a moderate activity against all the microorganisms tested. The MIC values of the compound were lowest for the antibiotic sertraline for treatment of bacterial infections, at 250 µg/mL, and highest for sertraline for treatment of fungal infections. The MIC values for fluoroquinolone were lowest for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, at 0.125 to 3.25 µg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 0.09 to 0.19 µg/mL for S. aureus, 0.12 to 0.18 µg/mL for S. aureus, and 0.5 to 0.6 µg/mL for S. pneumoniae. The synergistic activity was observed for fluoroquinolone, lamivudine, and metronidazole, with a synergistic activity of 27.8 to 89.2% for lamivudine, and 53.4 to 79.5% for etroneolium. The synergistic action of the compound against S. aureus was confirmed using two different sets of assays material, which confirmed the activity of the compound. The results suggested that the compounds are potential agents for development of new antifungal therapeutics.


## Introduction
A fatal outcome was observed in the KIDS patients who died of invasive aspergillosis (11. The KIDS case was found in a small hospital in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In this case, the mortality rate of aspergillosis was reported to be 17.6% (10).

The main pathogenic agents of the aspergillosis are the mold Aspergillus fumigatus and the yeast Candida albicans, which have different mechanisms of pathogenesis. Although the A. fumigatus is a major cause of invasive aspergillosis, the yeast and mucormycete Candida glabrata are the most important pathogens in the infection of the kidney and the liver (12,13). Both species produce toxic metabolites, which have been linked to toxicity of certain medications (14). Among these metabolites, a- and -2-mannan are the most toxic and inhibit the growth of both species. Mannans inhibit both growth and morphogenesis, and inhibit a- and -2-mannan biosynthesis and a-lipid synthesis (15,16). The inhibition of a- and -2-mannan biosynthesis leads to cell membrane disruption, which leads to leakage of cellular contents, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (17). The oxidative stress response is the key mechanism of damage and damage response mechanism of the cytoplasmic membrane. The oxidative stress response is a key regulator of the cellular response to oxidative stress and has been well studied (18). The protein kinase A (PKA) is a heterotrimeric protein that activates the Pkc1-Cys2 pathway in response to oxidative stress (19). The Pkc1-Pkr1-Cys2 pathway is involved in the oxidative stress response and is conserved among other eukaryotes (20,21). The Pkc1-Pkr1-Cys2 pathway is activated in response to various environmental stresses, such as hydrogen peroxide, high temperature, heat, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress (22).

The fungal cell wall is highly plastic and contains a high number of different chemical components (23). Some of these components are reported to be important to control fungal growth and development (24,25).


## Methods
[17] was employed to determine the antifungal drug susceptibility in the blood samples of patients with septic meningiti. The isolates were obtained from a collection of blood samples from patients with septic meningitis as described in the Clinical and Laboratory section of the second edition of CLSI M27-A3 [18]. The blood samples were obtained from the liver, kidney and spleen of patients with septic meningitis. The antifungal drug susceptibility was determined by the broth dilution method [19] with reference to the CLSI M27-A3 guideline.

Patients with septic meningitis were divided into four groups: 1) septic meningitis + 100 IU of amphotericin B; 2) septic meningitis + 100 IU of fluconazole; 3) septic meningitis + 100 IU of flucytosine; 4) septic meningitis + 100 IU of nystatin; and 5) septic meningitis + 100 IU of fluconazole.


## Results
The anti-CD11c and anti-CD4 antibody responses in the lungs of children with acute pulmonary infection were suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in both the anti-CD11c and anti-CD4 antibody groups (Table 2. The anti-CD11c and anti-CD4 antibodies were significantly higher in the anti-CD11c group in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2A). The anti-CD11c group was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2B). The anti-CD11c group was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2C). The anti-CD4 antibody response was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2D). The anti-CD11c antibody response was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2E). The anti-CD11c antibody response was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2F). The anti-CD11c antibody response was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2G). The anti-CD11c antibody response was suppressed by anti-CD11c or anti-CD4 antibodies in the acute pulmonary infection group (Fig 2H).

The results of immunohistochemistry and PCR assays were consistent with the culture results (Fig 3). The results of culture assays were consistent with the culture results (Fig 4). The results of serum biochemical tests were consistent with the culture results (Fig 5). The results of immunohistochemistry and PCR assays were consistent with the culture results (Fig 6). The results of culture assays were consistent with the culture results (Fig 7).

In the present study, the pathogenic H. capsulatum strain CBS 212.31 was identified in the BALF of mice. The presence of H. capsulatum strain CBS 212.31 in BALF of mice was in line with previous studies that have identified H. capsulatum in lung tissue of mice, humans, and other animals [31,32].

The pathogenic H. capsulatum strain CBS 212.31 was isolated from the BALF of mice. This is the first report of H. capsulatum in the lung of a human. The clinical strain of H. capsulatum was isolated from the BALF of mice. The clinical isolate was reported in 1989 by Chen et al. [33]. The clinical isolate was also isolated from the BALF of mice. In this study, the pathogenic strain of H. capsulatum was isolated from the BALF of mice. The clinical isolate was reported in 1989 by Chen et al. [33].
