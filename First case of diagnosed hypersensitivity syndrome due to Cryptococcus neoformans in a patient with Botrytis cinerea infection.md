## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. This disease is typically caused by the encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, with a high rate of mortality. In particular, it causes severe pneumonia with a high mortality rate. The aim of this study was to report a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient who was immunocompromised for life and had persistent effusion of capsid on immunosuppressive therapy. The patient presented with a four-day history of coughing, malaise, intermittent sweating and tachycardia of the ventricular system. On hospital admission, the patient was treated with intravenous Cryptococcus antifungal drug and the patient improved. On day 14, the patient presented to the hospital again with recurrent/seizureful coughing, malaise and intermittent sweating. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. After several investigations, the patient expired due to severe pneumonia.

In immunocompromised patients, cryptococcosis is a life-threatening condition. This case suggests that additional diagnostic procedures and institution of antifungal treatment are warranted in order to prevent fatal outcome.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have become a major problem in recent years. These infections are life-threatening in immunocompromised patients and in the intensive care units. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are mainly caused by Candida species. In the past two decades, the incidence of IFIs has increased, mainly in patients with weakened immune systems, organ transplant recipients, patients with haematological disorders, patients with nephrotic syndrome and patients with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Among the opportunistic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans have emerged as the most common species responsible for IFIs. Invasive candidiasis (IC) is one of the major opportunistic fungal infections. About 1 million cases are reported annually worldwide. A. fumigatus, C. neoformans, and C. albicans cause most of the infections and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Invasive candidiasis is generally associated with immunocompromised patients, mainly patients undergoing chemotherapy or receiving haematological stem cell transplantation. The major risk factors for this type of candidiasis include: (1) the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics; (2) amphotericin B; (3) the use of corticosteroids; (4) azole antifungal drugs; (5) the use of ciclopirox (1) or cicloprid (6) compounds. Although C. albicans is not as prevalent as A. fumigatus, its frequency increases with the duration of antifungal treatment. C. albicans is often found in patients with low levels of CD4 counts, especially in the bloodstream and disseminated infections. It is the second most common species isolated from patients with disseminated candidiasis (CD4 count < 200 cells/µL; mean = 47% of the cases), and it is associated with more morbidity and mortality than other Candida species (1, 7-9).

The number of cases of invasive candidiasis in the immunocompromised patient has increased recently. The situation has changed, but the underlying cause remains the same (10).


## Methods
For these patients, blood culture results were not used and if present, their laboratory results were considered “confirmed.

In cases of acute or common viral infection, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was taken to determine whether the patient had disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient was considered infected when a single colony of Cryptococcus was present on CSF (Table 1).

Laboratory findings
The results of the tests of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the ELISA were recorded in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. The results of the tests of the two ELISA were recorded in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. The results of the two tests were compared to the results of the standard fluconazole antibiotic for Cryptococcus neoformans (FLC-100). The results of the two tests were compared to the results of the standard antibiotic alone.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of Candida infection was considered when the patient showed symptomatic infection, and was classified as “bacteriological”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of severe Candida infection was considered when the patient was classified as “severe”.

Laboratory findings
The identification of Candida albicans was considered when the patient was classified as “definite”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of H. influenzae type B was considered when the patient was classified as “unspecified”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was considered when the patient was classified as “unknown”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of Mycobacterium leukotriatum was considered when the patient was categorized as “unknown”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of dermatitis was considered when the patient was categorized as “unknown”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of fungal infection was considered when the patient was categorized as “unknown”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was considered when the patient was classified as “unknown”.

Laboratory findings
The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis was considered when the patient was categorized as “unspecified”.


## Results
The patient was a female patient with AIDS who was admitted with a suspected HIV infection and clinical symptoms were typical of patients with advanced HIV infectio. He developed symptoms of advanced HIV infection, fever, and weight loss at the time of admission.

The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patient and the patient with advanced HIV infection are shown in Table 1. In the patient with advanced HIV infection, the majority of the patients had liver disease, and the patient with liver disease had normal CD4 counts (Table 1). The most common cause of advanced HIV infection in patients with advanced HIV infection was non-AIDS, but the overall incidence of non-AIDS patients was 38.6% (9/16). Other causes of non-AIDS were unspecified, non-seizure, viral infection, and cryptococcal meningitis. In the patient with advanced HIV infection, liver disease was suspected (23/39). In the patient with non-AIDS, the most common cause of non-AIDS was unknown infection (25/40). The patient with non-AIDS had a previous liver transplant, which did not result in liver disease. The patient with non-AIDS had liver disease (23/40).

In the patient with advanced HIV infection, the most common cause of non-AIDS was unknown infection (19/40). In the patient with non-AIDS, liver disease was suspected (22/40). In the patient with HIV infection, other causes of non-AIDS were unspecified, non-seizure, viral infection, and cryptococcal meningitis.

The patient with liver disease had a previous liver transplant, which did not result in liver disease. The patient with HIV infection had liver disease (22/40). The patient with non-AIDS had liver disease (22/40).

Treatment of patients with advanced HIV infection
Fourteen patients (36%) had normal CD4 counts and normal CD4 counts at admission, and no patients had advanced HIV infection, which was diagnosed in six patients (23%) with non-AIDS (Table 1).

The patient with HIV infection was negative for any immunosuppressive drug. The patient with non-AIDS was on antiretroviral therapy and had no previous renal disease.


## Discussion
In this case, the patient had initially had a fever and severe headache with visual disturbances and had a tetanus-based inoculu. As the infection progressed, the patient's consciousness improved and the symptoms of fungal meningitis became more severe. The patient was treated with amphotericin B, and as a result of a diagnosis of Cryptococcus, the patient's symptoms improved and the tetanus-based inoculum was administered. As the patient continued to experience the symptoms of Cryptococcus, his symptoms became increasingly severe. The patient's condition improved and a tetanus-based inoculum was administered. The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit for treatment of Cryptococcus meningitis. The patient's condition deteriorated and the tetanus-based inoculum was discharged. The patient was discharged from the hospital and started receiving antifungal therapy. The patient was discharged from the hospital, and the patient was diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis.

The clinical manifestations of Cryptococcus infection were most severe in the case of the patient with cerebral abscess. It is believed that this patient had pulmonary Cryptococcus infection, and he had pulmonary Cryptococcus infection in the absence of symptoms. The patient had a normal serum cryptococcal antigen test, and the patient's serum cryptococcal antigen level was normal. As the patient's serum cryptococcal antigen was positive, the patient was suspected to have Cryptococcus infection. The patient's serum cryptococcal antigen was positive, and the patient's serum cryptococcal antigen level was normal. The patient had received a fluconazole-based treatment for Cryptococcus meningitis for a week, and then fluconazole-based treatment was started for Cryptococcus meningitis. The patient was discharged from the hospital and was diagnosed with Cryptococcus meningitis. The patient was discharged from the hospital and was treated with amphotericin B, and the patient's symptoms resolved.

The clinical manifestations of Cryptococcus infection were more severe in the case of the patient with cerebral abscess. The patient had a slow fever, severe headache, and a mild mental status. The patient had a normal serum C-reactive protein level, and the patient's serum C-reactive protein level was normal. The patient had received a fluconazole-based treatment for Cryptococcus meningitis, and the patient's symptoms resolved.
