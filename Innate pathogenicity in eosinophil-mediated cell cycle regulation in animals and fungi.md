## Abstract
Sucrose is one of the major plant carbohydrates expressed in planta, particularly in planta. However, the mechanisms by which sugar levels are sensed and regulated in planta are not fully understood. In the present study, the ability of a high-throughput quantitative PCR assay to quantify the levels of sugar, sucrose and other compounds in planta was compared to control. The results showed that while fructose was quantitatively increased in planta, the corresponding sucrose concentrations were decreased in planta. In addition, sucrose was increased in planta only under conditions of prolonged drought. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the levels of sucrose and other compounds in planta under different conditions of different plant disease management strategies, and we propose that it may provide a useful and fast way to monitor and monitor the impacts of different sugar concentration changes in planta.


## Introduction
 2005; Satoh et a., 2006). Moreover, there has been an increase in resistance of fungi to multiple antifungal agents and the emergence of drug-resistant strains (Kong et al., 2005; Su et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012).

The ability to sense and adapt to changes in the environment and to respond to extracellular signals is crucial for the pathogenicity of fungi. As a facultative intracellular pathogen, fungi are able to sense and adapt to a variety of environmental stresses, such as oxidative, osmotic, cold, solar UV, nutrient starvation, alkaline, and high temperature stress (Li et al., 2012). In addition, they can also respond to extracellular signal-mediated stresses, such as heat stress, oxidative, and osmotic stresses (Samparan et al., 2005; Okeke et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017).

The ability to sense and adapt to different stress signals is important for the virulence of fungi. For example, we have demonstrated that in C. albicans the response to the high temperature shock, caused by temperature induction, involves the response to high-temperature shock, which is associated with the phosphorylation of the adaptor kinase calcineurin (Kozich et al., 2007). In C. neoformans, the response to osmotic stress is mediated by the calcineurin signaling pathway, which is composed of two subunits, the Rim101 and the Rim101-Ccz1 proteins (Kozich et al., 2007). The transcription factor Cuf1 is critical for the response to osmotic stress and is regulated by cnaA and cnbR (Fernandez et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2011). The cnaA protein binds to a conserved Cuf1 promoter sequence and activates cnbR, which activates cnaA, which activates the cnbR transcription factor (Fernandez et al., 2010).

In addition, the cnaA and cnbR genes were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated after osmotic shock, indicating that the cnaA and cnbR genes are important for the response to osmotic shock (Samparan et al., 2005).


## Methods
Plant material
The seeds of Japaka were collected from May to June in the coastal waters of coastal areas of Central Java, Java, Indonesia. The seeds were dried in a soil-soil mixture (2.


## Results
. Isolation and Characterization of the Essential Oil of P. triticina
P. triticina was isolated from different hosts including various plant species and from a variety of microorganisms and substrates (Table 1). The essential oil of P. triticina was obtained from various sources, including soybean, cabbage, maize, wheat, and wheat seed (Table 1). The color of the essential oil was violet (Table 1). The petroleum ether extract of P. triticina was a pure petroleum ether with an effective concentration of 8.1% in its dry weight (Table 1). The crude oil of P. triticina was very active against the various fungi, but only moderate activity was observed against C. neoformans (Table 1). The crude oil of P. triticina was very well tolerated by the user, especially with prolonged use (Table 1).

## Discussion
The cyclins are small structures that are formed by a pathway that includes the cell cycle genes, siderophore synthase and a-a-a-ß-glucan synthas. A-a-ß-glucan is the precursor of a-a-a-ß-glucan and the cell cycle genes, respectively, are present in the cell wall and membrane of fungi [48]. In addition, the cell cycle genes are produced in the fungus by a cascade of transcription factors, such as HapX and HapB, which are also present in the fungal cell [48]. The fungal cell cycle genes are induced by the HapB pathway in plant-pathogenic fungi such as U. maydis, C. neoformans and Neurospora crassa [48, 49]. In addition, the HapA pathway is involved in the cell wall biogenesis [50].

The mammalian cell cycle gene cyclin-1 is present in the cell wall and cell membrane of the oomycete pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, the causal agent of human fungal infection [51]. Cyclins are the second and last cell cycle genes in the human pathogenic fungus C. albicans. The cyclin-1 gene is expressed by most human pathogenic fungi including Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans [51]. Cyclin-1 is a DNA-binding protein with a homology of the yeast cyclin B [52]. Cyclins are also present in the cell membrane of a wide range of fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Histoplasma capsulatum [53]. The cyclin-1 gene is most commonly expressed in the cell wall of the human fungal pathogens C. neoformans and C. albicans and is regulated by a HapX-dependent pathway [53, 54]. In addition, cyclins are found in the cell walls of C. neoformans and C. albicans [53, 54].
