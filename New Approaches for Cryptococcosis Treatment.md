## Abstract
We report a case of coagulopathy occurring in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who presented with multiple joint arthroscopy appointments due to rheumatoid arthritis antifungal therapy. This case illustrates the potential for coagulopathy to be reported in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis and fungal meningitis, where the patient presented with multiple courses of symptoms, including myalgia, psoriasis, and arthralgia. The antifungal therapy was initiated and his clinical response improved.


## Introduction
Human pathogens can cause both superficial and deep seated infections, characterized by high morbidity and mortality. The surgical need for antifungal therapy has been increasing in recent years. However, the use of antifungals has led to a growing number of infections in immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, the development of drug resistance and the emergence of fungal infections, such as fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans, make antifungal treatment of fungal infections urgent. The current drugs used for systemic antifungal treatment are limited in both spectrum and duration, and may lead to a range of fungal infections that may not be adequately treated.

Toxic drugs, such as azoles, amphotericin B, and flucytosine, are often used to treat fungal infections [1]. However, the emergence of drug resistant strains is a growing problem that requires urgent global attention. Drug resistance is a major threat to the treatment of fungal infections, and is considered to be a major health threat in clinical settings. Recent trends in drug development and clinical development are impressive, with development of many new classes of antifungal agents as well as several acquisitions of existing classes of antifungals in recent years [2-5].

Auranofin (Auranofin), a broad spectrum lipopeptide, is a component of the innate immune system and has demonstrated antifungal effects in a wide range of fungal species, including Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis [6]. Auranofin is a ternary complex containing a polysaccharide of D-glucan, a glucosamine, and a minor glucosamine [7].


## Methods

We carried out a retrospective study on the clinical outcome of HIV-1 infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis, in which there were no data on gender, age or underlying condition of patient. Patient-to-patient HIV-1 infection rates were calculated for each patient by using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and the proportions of cases and controls were calculated.

Incidence rates were calculated for each category of cryptococcal meningitis as follows: [a] case [a] case: prevalence [b] prevalence: incidence rate (%) [c] denominator [d] denominator: denominator with denominator: denominator.

Data were extracted from electronic medical records (EMR) and enrolled patients from the hospital. Inclusion criteria were: HIV-1 viral meningitis (HSV) and Cryptococcal meningitis.


## Results
The respiratory illness caused by Pneumocystis pneumoniae is controlled by a host immune system that protects against the respiratory and cardiovascular disease. For treatment, the most effective method is to use a broad spectrum of antibiotics [5]. It is important to note that the majority of the cases of pneumocystis pneumoniae are caused by pneumococcal meningitis, which has been associated with pneumonia in patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumoniae infection.

In order to determine the efficacy of different agents used to treat Pneumocystis pneumoniae, the efficacy of seven different antimicrobial agents was assessed. All the agents were effective at the concentrations used in the study. For instance, fluconazole was effective at concentrations >10 mg/mL, but not at concentrations >10 mg/mL. For the azithromycin, it was not effective, but the mean MIC was less than the reference drugs azithromycin (0.06 µg/ml) and ceftazidime (0.25 µg/ml), respectively.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Results
The results of the susceptibility tests are shown in Table 4. Among the seven antimicrobial agents tested, amphotericin B was most effective against Pneumocystis pneumoniae (MIC = 64 µg/ml). For the ceftazidime, the MIC values were >32 µg/ml, and >128 µg/ml.

The MIC value for the azithromycin was >256 µg/ml, but >128 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).

The MIC value for the azithromycin was >128 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).

The MIC value for ceftazidime was >256 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).

The MIC value for the azithromycin was >256 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).

The MIC value for amphotericin B was >256 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).

The MIC value for ceftazidime was >256 µg/ml for fluconazole (Table 4).


## Discussion
In the case of cryptococcosis, a second stage of treatment includes the use of IV fluids and fungicid. While IV fluids are not recommended, the use of IV fungicides can be performed. In this case, the ICU continues to have the resources to perform follow-up testing.

The first stage of treatment is intravenous amphotericin B (ID: 400 mg orally or oral). ID: 400 mg orally is the equivalent of IV fluids. A dose of ID: 400 mg orally is 20-50 times higher than ID: 400 mg orally. The IV fluids and ID: 400 mg orally are combined. There are two IV fluids for IV fluid management in this patient. The IV fluids of this patient are the same as those of IV fluids in the case of cryptococcosis (P65).

The second stage of treatment is oral fluconazole. ID: 200 mg orally. ID: 200 mg orally is a combination of oral and IV fluids, ID: 200 mg orally is a combination of oral and IV fluids.

The IV fluids of this patient are the same as those of IV fluids in the case of cryptococcosis (P65).

The IV fluids of this patient are the same as those of IV fluids in the case of Cryptococcus neoformans (P65).
