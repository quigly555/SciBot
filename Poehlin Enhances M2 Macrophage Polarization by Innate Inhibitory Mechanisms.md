## Abstract
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the phytochemical, antimicrobial, and anti-HIV activity of the Mentha suaveolens Hrv (Me) (from the bark of Mentha suaveolens) against Cryptococcus spp. and Stachybotrys chartarum, two common house-tree pathogens, and the control agents of Bordetella pertussis. The Me showed significant antibacterial activity against both strains and also inhibited the growth of the two pathogens at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 2 and 8 µg/mL, respectively. The activity of the antimicrobial drugs was also evaluated by checkerboard assay. The results showed that the Me was more effective against Cryptococcus spp. than Stachybotrys than that of the control agents. The antibacterial activity of the Me was demonstrated by the reduction of bacterial populations in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected mice. The anti-cryptococcal activity results from the inhibition of Mg2+ efflux pumps. Therefore, the Me is a good drug for cryptococcosis treatment, and an interesting alternative for the treatment of candidiasis and other fungal infections, owing to its lower MIC values and complete lack of toxicity.


## Introduction
Innate effector mechanisms are involved in the control of the polarization of the macrophag. Innate effector mechanisms are activated by the turgor pressure, which induces eosinophils to release their contents into the cell, leading to macrophage polarization. Thus, macrophages are considered as the primary cells that produce eosinophils and eosinophil-derived particles (Egs) during activation of innate immunity. Thus, the immune response of the host induces the expression of Innate Effector Mechanisms in order to control the macrophage polarization during the early phase of the infection.

The opsonization of macrophages by a soluble eosinophil triggers the expression of Innate Effector Mechanisms [13]. The first step of the eosinophil-induced opsonization is the fusion with macrophages, which occurs as a result of the establishment of epithelial cell-cell contact [14]. The eosinophil-induced opsonization triggers the release of its cargo, macrophages, from the phagosome, to a new, more opsonized environment within the macrophage [15]. The macrophage is now able to produce the charged microssels, which are internalized and processed by the opsonophil [16]. The opsonized macrophages are then internalized by the opsonophil, which is transported into the draining lymph node and processed into mature macrophage. The newly internalized cells then undergo opsonophil maturation [17]. Macrophages, in the absence of the soluble eosinophil, are unable to differentiate into the functional macrophage.

Macrophage polarization is highly dependent on the presence of other microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Microbial opsonization has been studied extensively in both animal and plant organs. The major opsonic component of the macrophage is produced by the endolysosomal enzymes, which consist of protein kinases, phosphatases, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The enzymes are secreted into the endolysosomal compartment of macrophages and are processed by opsonophil, which then undergoes a transformation into a mature macrophage [18].


## Methods
[18], was used to evaluate the effect of the lipophilicity of . albicans on the C. albicans lipolytica morphology by flow cytometry. C. albicans lipolytic activity was evaluated using the Griess method using cell wall-permeable substrate substrate M2 medium, which consists of a M2 medium containing 1% glucose, 1% peptone, 0.3% (NH_4)_2SO_4, and 0.1% Tween 80.

The effects of the drugs on the C. albicans lipolytica morphology were evaluated using the Griess method using medium containing 2% glucose, 1% peptone, 0.3% (NH_4)_2SO_4, 0.1% Tween 80.

The effects of the drugs on the R. irregularis growth on the C. albicans lipolytica morphology by flow cytometry
R. irregularis was cultured in liquid M2 medium at 37°C for 5 days. After the cells were detached from M2 medium by centrifugation, the cell-free supernatant was collected and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/mL. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The cell-free supernatant was collected and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/mL. A 1 mL aliquot of the cell-free supernatant was added to 10 mL of a 1% (wt/vol) glutargin solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The solution was then removed, and the cell-free supernatant was collected and the cell-free supernatant was removed again. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed again. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed again. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed again. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed again.


## Results
albicans and . glabrata was difficult to assess. Therefore, we generated C. albicans-induced M1 macrophages and stimulated them with mAbs that selectively bind the C. albicans extracellular surface. M1 macrophages were then stimulated with mAbs that stimulate C. albicans extracellular surface or in combination with mAbs that target the M2 macrophage surface.

Inhibition of C. albicans M1 Macrophage Polarization by C. albicans-Associated M1 Macrophage M2 Macrophage M2 Macrophage Polarization
M2 macrophages and M1 macrophages have been shown to be polarized to the M1/M2 phase [19-21]. To assess the degree of M2 polarization we examined the mAb-induced polarization of C. albicans-induced M2 macrophages and M1 macrophages to the M2 or M1 macrophage polarization phenotypes. In this experiment, C. albicans-induced M2 macrophages and M1 macrophages polarization was blocked by mAbs that specifically bind C. albicans extracellular surface. M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages polarization was blocked by mAbs that specifically bind C. albicans extracellular surface.

M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages were stimulated with M1 macrophage-injected mAb-1, M2 macrophage-injected mAb-2, or mAb-2-induced mAb-1 mAb (Figure 7A). Inhibition of C. albicans-induced M1 macrophage polarization was blocked by mAbs that specifically bind C. albicans extracellular surface (Figure 7A).

Inhibition of C. albicans M1 Macrophage Polarization by C. glabrata-Associated M1 Macrophage M2 Macrophage Polarization
We next sought to determine whether C. glabrata-associated M1 macrophage polarization contributes to M2 macrophage polarization. C. glabrata induced macrophage polarization was blocked by mAb-1, mAb-2, or mAb-2-induced mAb-1 mAb (Figure 7B).


## Discussion
albicans responds to . albicans, we used passive phagocytosis to induce macrophages to kill C. albicans. As expected, mice injected with FK506 showed a decrease in phagocytosis of C. albicans, but not phagocytosis of C. neoformans, as expected. However, mice injected with FK506 did not kill C. albicans, suggesting that phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages is an independent process. In contrast, we used passive phagocytosis to induce macrophages to kill C. neoformans, and phagocytosis of C. albicans was efficient (Figure 8). Although it is not yet clear whether phagocytosis occurs via a transmembrane domain (TMD) or a cytosolic domain (CTD) (20,21), C. albicans has been shown to have both a transmembrane and a cytosolic domain (CTD) that are important for intracellular proliferation, proliferation, and differentiation (22,23). The majority of studies to date have focused on phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages (23,24). Here, we showed that, in contrast to phagocytosis of C. albicans, macrophages injected with FK506 could kill C. albicans, but not C. neoformans, via both transmembrane and a cytosolic domain (Figure 8).

Inhibition of phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages resulted in a reduction in the phagosome maturation of C. albicans and, at the same time, impaired phagocytosis of C. neoformans, consistent with previous results (24). In contrast, mice injected with FK506 did not inhibit phagocytosis of C. albicans, and phagocytosis of C. neoformans was efficient (Figure 8). We hypothesized that, given that C. albicans is a viable human pathogen, macrophages injected with FK506 could kill C. albicans, and that the phagosome membrane could be damaged and protease degradation would be impaired.
