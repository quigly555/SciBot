## Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis (HIVE) is a well-known complication in patients with HIV-related diseases. The frequency of HIV encephalitis has been rising in recent years. HIV encephalitis is different in men and women from both countries. HIV encephalitis is often treated with immunosuppressants, in part or in whole group immunosuppressants, in part group immunosuppressants such as terbinafine/pyrazinil or polyenes, and in part group immunosuppressants such as flucytosine. In this article, we review HIV encephalitis and the risks of acquiring it during treatment. Some of the possible etiologies of HIV encephalitis and the role of antiretroviral therapy in HIV encephalitis will be highlighted. We also discuss the development of a new approach to HIV encephalitis treatment with emphasis on the use of intensive chemotherapy.


## Introduction
In particular, they ask whether there is any business model or business use for the paper and whether there is any commercial use for the pape. However, the authors state that there is, in fact, a commercial application for the paper and the paper is a way to show that there is a commercial application. Given that there is no commercial application, the authors conclude that there is not a commercial application for the paper. However, the authors also state that there is a commercial application, and call for additional evidence to support this conclusion. The authors present several alternative perspectives to the paper that they present in the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion.

The authors state that their approach is novel and unique. They present multiple alternative perspectives that they present in the Introduction, Introduction, and Discussion. They state that their approach may be a novel and unique approach to provide analysis that is different from other analyses they have done. They present evidence for their approach and argue that their approach is useful for practitioners. The discussion states that their approach may be a novel and unique approach to the analysis. The authors present several other perspectives that they present in the Discussion. They state that their approach may be useful for practitioners. The evidence presented in the Introduction and Discussion may be sufficient to support their approach. The argument that the paper presents a novel and unique approach to analysis may be sufficient to support their approach. The evidence presented in the Introduction and Introduction may not be sufficient to support their approach.

## Methods
2.1. Microorganism and Growth Conditions
The E. coli strain that was previously isolated from a blood sample of a patient (Bara et al. 2009) was used as the food source for the current study. E. coli strain PROMPT (ODEC Collection No. 1, P.A. No. 184885) was used as the recipient strain for the infection experiments. The C. albicans strain (CALB1) was used as the recipient strain for the growth experiments.

2.2. Molecular Dynamics of PROMPT
The PROMPT structure was determined by the D-E-R alignment method (Ronquist and Hunter 2000) using a multispecies database of E. coli, C. albicans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. albicans, C. guilliermondii, and C. tropicalis. The alignment was used to determine the structures of the PROMPT structure of C. albicans using a PDB structure search program (http://www.pdb.org/). The searches were performed using the program MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al. 2015). The following parameters were used: tryptophan (T), methionine (M), chitosan (C), methylglyoxal (MGY), and oxidation (E) at the positions 5, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0.6, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.

Type species: Chuppia sp.

Chuppia yunnanensis Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde

Materials examined: China, Heilongjiang Province, Heilongjiang University, Heilongjiang University Hospital, on leaves of Eucalyptus sp., 19 Oct. 2013, P.W. Cui, KUS-F17823, culture CBS 143897 = CPC 15796 = CBS 136975. - USA, Illinois, Illinois County, New York, St. Louis County, New York, St. Louis, on leaves of Eucalyptus sp., 9 Jan. 2015, D. Foster, culture CBS 143898 = CPC 15423 = CBS 143899 = CPC 15424.

Notes: The name Chuppia yunnanensis is based on the species occurring on Eucalyptus sp. However, due to the type species, the name was used for a Japanese species, Chuppia yunnanensis, which is a different species. The phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequence data were carried out using the combined ITS and nrDNA sequences.

Type species: Chuppia yunnanensis Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde

Notes: The genus Chuppia was recently transferred from the genus Chuppia to the new genus Chuppiaceae based on its morphological characters. Phylogenetically, the species is closely related to Chuppia yunnanensis and Chuppelia yunnanensis. However, the two species are distinct from each other in the phylogenetic analysis and therefore, no further collections are required to resolve their taxonomic placement.

## Discussion
cyclophilae) at the site of the native Thaxter Bridge, where some of the results obtained from our analyses are from the original descriptions, suggest that the fungus is of genetic interes. For example, both the source and the source-derived datasets are from a single tree (Fig 3). The tree inferred from the original datasets was that the fungus was a member of the Termitomyces subgenus (Table 1). The trees inferred from the original dataset were both from the Termitomyces subgenus (Table 1) and from the Termitomyces clade (Table 2). The tree inferred from the original dataset was not supported by any of the trees in the Termitomyces clade, indicating that the original dataset was inaccurate. The trees inferred from the original dataset, however, were significantly different from the trees inferred from the Termitomyces clade (Table 2), and included the R. arrhizus strain RSD02, the Termitomyces clade, and the D. hansenii strain DFG321 (Table 1). The trees inferred from the original dataset were also significantly different from those derived from the D. hansenii and D. melanogaster datasets (Table 1). Therefore, these data suggest that the Termitomyces subgenus is widespread in the United States and that it has a genetic basis.

The Termitomyces clade, with the exception of D. hansenii and D. melanogaster, contained only three species of the same genus. However, it contained three other species of the Termitomyces clade, including the strain DFG323, a strain isolated from the natural reservoir of the D. hansenii strain, and the strain DFG324, a strain isolated from the native reservoir of the D. hansenii strain. These three Termitomyces species were also present in other freshwater Termitomyces species and had been previously identified in other Termitomyces species (Bruins et al. 2009).

The Termitomyces clade is of special interest as it represents a new genus for this study. It is also of interest to understand how the fungus adapts to the environment in which it encounters and other biological processes that involve the metabolism of different carbon sources and types of carbon sources.
