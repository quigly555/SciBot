## Abstract
Patients with HIV/AIDS are vulnerable to infections due to various factors, including underlying diseases and malignancies, such as: immune dysfunction, malignancy and malignancy caused by viruses and bacteria. However, the underlying causes are not well understood. Our goal was to identify immune-related processes that may contribute to virulence and provide the molecular determinants needed to treat HIV/AIDS.

Patients with HIV/AIDS were prospectively enrolled from April 2009 until October 2013, recruited at the National Hospital for Infectious Diseases “Tobahael”, Ghana. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment regimen and treatment outcome were collected and analyzed.

187 HIV-infected and 7 HIV-negative patients were included. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the immune-processors implicated in virulence. Virulence was categorized into three subtypes (virulent, suppurative and nonvirulent).

The prevalence of HIV infection among patients with suppurative HIV disease was 9.3% (8/187) in the non-vulvovaginal group, 11.2% (6/187) in the virulent group and 17.2% (7/187) in the suppurative group. The prevalence of non-vulvovaginal HIV infection was 18.9% (7/187) in the suppurative group, 18.4% (7/187) in the non-vulvovaginal group and 19.8% (7/187) in the suppurative group. The spectrum of cellular responses, cellular immunity and innate immunity among the suppurative HIV group and the suppurative HIV group without HIV showed striking differences (P < 0.001).

The results from our study suggest that HIV/AIDS patients with suppurative HIV disease are highly sensitive to infections caused by viruses and bacteria. A high clinical suspicion is required in patients with suppurative HIV disease.


## Introduction
The genus Aspergillus contains over 200 species of microorganisms that can cause diseases ranging from superficial skin and hair infections to life-threatening invasive infections. Many of these fungi have been isolated from the scalp and hair, and others are pathogenic to humans. A. flavus is the predominant filamentous fungi that cause scalp infections, and A. fumigatus is the most common filamentous fungus responsible for systemic infections in the United States [1]. The pathogenic Aspergillus species are isolated predominantly from the scalp, but a number of species are also present in other parts of the body, including nails, hair, and nails of children, and birds [2]. The most common species are A. niger, A. oryzae, A. oryzae, and A. parasiticus. Of these species, A. parasiticus is the most common pathogenic species in humans, causing infections in the scalp, nails, and mucosal tissues [3]. The clinical course of infection is often asymptomatic, while the yeast forms can cause infections in the blood, urine, skin, and mucocutaneous parts of the body [4]. A.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
C. albicans strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in YPD medium, unless stated otherwise.

Isolation of murine pulmonary aspergillosis
Female mice were inoculated intranasally with 200 µl of a conidial suspension (1 × 10^7 conidia/ml) of C. albicans strain YP44 (strain NIH-H99), inoculated intranasally with 200 µl of conidial suspension (1 × 10^6 conidia/ml), and maintained in the same environmental chamber. Mice were weighed daily, and their lung and spleen weights were measured after 3 days.

Histopathological study
Lungs were excised and fixed in 10% formalin-fixed formalin, and paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains. Sections were examined under a light microscope.

Cytokine measurement

## Results
subtilis and a strain of . laurentii, were isolated from the leaves of Bessaria javanica in May 2005 in Veenaetna, Russia (Fig 1). The isolates were subjected to a molecular genetics study. The DNA sequences of the strains obtained were identical (ITS, EF-1a, LSU, TEF1, rpb2) and the strains were identified as the same species. The strains were chosen as new agents for the study. The DNA sequence data for the strains was used to identify the strains. The strains were identified as P. pacifica (CBS 7764), P. pacifica (CBS 1399), P. pacifica (CBS 1399) and P. pacifica (CBS 1399), and as C. laurentii (CBS 1399) (Table 1).

To further confirm the identification of the new strains, the DNA sequence data were used to identify the strains of the strains by molecular phylogenetic analyses using the two-hybrid analysis (Table 2). The sequence data for the strains CBS 7764 and CBS 1399 are available in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The sequence data for the strains CBS 1399 and P. pacifica are available in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The ITS sequences of the isolates obtained from different locations, which are representative of the strains, are provided in Table 1.

Phylogenetic analysis of P. pacifica isolates
The ITS sequences of all the isolates obtained from different locations were compared using Bayesian inference and using maximum parsimony to resolve the concordance between the two Bayesian trees. The ML and BI analyses were applied to the combined dataset of the three strains obtained from different locations in Veenaetna, Russia. The results are summarized in Table 1. The results show that the strains CBS 7764 and CBS 1399 are most similar to P. pacifica. The phylogenetic tree of the strains obtained from different locations in Veenaetna, Russia is shown in Fig 2.

## Discussion
 (Fig 3B. The strain is a new species of the species Bacillus pomonelloides and it is morphologically similar to the one previously described for a catalase-producing strain of Bacillus parathyphomyces (Vestergren et al. 2012), but its ITS sequence differs from the one of Bacillus subtilis, and it is unique from the type strain (Fig 3B). The same is true for the ‘catalase’-producing strain of Bacillus parathyphomyces, a new species of the species Bacillus sp. (Fig 3B). In addition, we also obtained 16B, a new genus of the type strain of Bacillus subtilis (Fig 3B). The type strain was identified as Bacillus spp. (Fig 3B).

Another genus of the type strain of Bacillus subtilis (Fig 3B) is also a new species of the genus Bacillus (Fig 3B). This species contains eight subspecies (Fig 3B). The four strains in this group were found to be identical to the type strain of the genus Bacillus, and they are also different from the two strains described by Chaetoplastopsis sp. (Vestergren et al. 2012). The type strain of the genus Bacillus is described by Chaetoplastopsis sp. and differs from the type strain of the genus Bacillus by the presence of eight subspecies. The type strain of Bacillus parathyphomyces contains three subspecies (Fig 3B).

The genus Bacillus is a genus of yeasts isolated from different parts of the world. It includes strains isolated from different types of plants, and it is often mistaken for Bacillus, but it is also widely distributed in Europe and Asia (Crespo et al. 2010). The genus Bacillus includes strains isolated from different parts of the world, and it has been used to different degrees to produce commercial products for the production of food and cosmetic products (Crespo et al. 2010).

The genus Bacillus includes strains isolated from different parts of the world, and it includes strains isolated from different parts of the world and from different regions (Crespo et al. 2010). The strain B. bifidum is a novel species that has been isolated from the bark of different plants (Crespo et al. 2010). The strain B.
