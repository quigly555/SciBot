## Abstract
To date, the bacterium Malassezia oncotatum has been most successfully used for the treatment of neglected mycoses in tropical and developing countries. In this work, we report the successful utilization of M. oncotatum extracts in treating Malassezia mycetoma (M. oncotatum) in a Namibia donor. It is important to consider such cases with care because of the occurrence of lethal malignant syndromes in patients with M. oncotatum infection. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the properties of extracts from Malassezia mycetoma extract and evaluate their antifungal effect in comparison with standard antifungal drugs.

In this study, antifungal activity of Malassezia extract and its main active constituent, 1,8-dihydroxysaminoglycans (DGs), against M. mycetoma were evaluated by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods.

MALEA extract showed good antifungal activity with a MIC50 concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. DGs had moderate antifungal activity against M. mycetoma in the Minimal Fungal Particle (MMP) assay. DGs were also well tolerated with a V50 value of 90.05 µg/mL.

MALEA extract displayed a drug-free approach in the treatment of M. oncotatum with favorable side effects.


## Introduction
Acinetobacter species are key pathogens responsible for a wide range of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) of ICU in patients with severe otitis media (SOT) [1]. The morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial infections is largely influenced by factors such as the duration and severity of antibiotic administration, type of antibiotic used, duration of antibiotic administration, and whether clinical microbiology practices are optimal. The most common bacterial species isolated in SOT are Staphylococcus aureus (85%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (75%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (73%) [2]. In the United States, S. aureus accounts for 10-20% of all bacterial OTUs [3].


## Methods
cerevisiae and . pombe as previously described [24], [25]. Briefly, a loop full of cells was inoculated with 100 µl of a 1.0 mg/ml suspension of 0.1% w/v of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.25% w/v of methylparasitic (MOPS), 0.1% w/v of NaCl, and 0.1% w/v of a 2-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS). The cells were cultivated in SCD media (20% SCD and 2% glucose) for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested, washed twice with distilled water, and re-suspended in 0.5% w/v MOPS. The cells were counted with a hemocytometer, and the concentrations of ROS were determined by a spectrophotometer. The concentrations of a 2-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) were 0.5 mM.

2-D structures of the target peptides of the currently reported antimicrobial peptides were prepared from the 3D structures obtained from the culture of S. pombe as described previously [24]. Briefly, a loop full of cells was inoculated with 100 µl of a 1.0 mg/ml suspension of 0.1% w/v of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.2% w/v of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% w/v of 5-bromosylmethosuccinimide (MNC), and 0.5% w/v of 1-bromo-3-chlorobenzaldehyde (1-BCD). The cells were cultivated in SCD media for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water, and re-suspended in 0.5% w/v MOPS. The cells were counted with a hemocytometer, and the concentrations of MOPS were determined by a spectrophotometer. The concentrations of a 2-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) were 0.2 µM.


## Results
Deletion of NACS1/2
The NACS1 gene of N. crassa is expressed by both the NAC1 and NAC2 loci in the Caenorhabditis elegans and is secreted into the extracellular environment. The NAC1 locus was used to delete the P. aeruginosa NAC1 gene and to create an isolate from which to use the NAC1 gene in the two other isolates (Table 1). NAC1 was initially expressed in the nucleus in the control strain CBS7727, and subsequently it was expressed in the nucleus in the strain CBS723, but no NAC1 expression was detected in the Caenorhabditis elegans and CBS7727 strains (Table 1).

To assess whether NACS1 is expressed in the P. aeruginosa genome, we cloned the NAC1 gene from the Caenorhabditis elegans and created an isolate from which to use the NAC1 gene in the two other isolates (Table 1). However, the NAC1 gene of N.


## Discussion
In the present work, we identified putative transcription factors involved in the regulation of oxidative peroxiredoxin pathway, which were found to be induced by the fungus and negatively regulated by the oxidative stres. Our data revealed a high level of differential expression of differentially expressed genes involved in peroxiredoxin pathway in the two independent experimental conditions. In the present study, we identified putative transcription factors involved in the regulation of peroxiredoxin pathway in the two independent experimental conditions. Our data revealed a high level of differential expression of putative transcription factors involved in the regulation of peroxiredoxin pathway in the two independent experimental conditions. We also found a high level of differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways in the two independent experimental conditions. In this regard, we found that a significant increase in both the levels of the transcription factor Prooxidase-Insensitive Protein kinase 1 (PKA1) and a decrease in the level of the genes involved in NADH-dependent cellular respiration in response to high levels of the oxidative stress. These results indicate that oxidative peroxiredoxin signaling pathways are activated by the fungus in the two independent experimental conditions.

In the present study, we also observed that the transcription factor HapX, which is a central transcription factor for the HapX transcription factor family, plays a major role in the regulation of the peroxiredoxin pathway. HapX was found to be negatively regulated by the fungus and negatively regulated by the oxidative stress. HapX was found to be involved in the regulation of the peroxiredoxin pathway. HapX was found to be involved in the regulation of the peroxiredoxin pathway. We also observed that the expression of genes involved in the oxidative peroxiredoxin pathway was increased in the two independent experimental conditions. HapX was found to be positively regulated by the fungus and negatively regulated by the oxidative stress. HapX was found to be involved in the regulation of the peroxiredoxin pathway. We also observed that the expression of genes involved in the oxidative peroxiredoxin pathway was increased in the two independent experimental conditions. This result suggests that the fungus might be able to utilize the fungi peroxiredoxin pathway to produce a broad range of biological products, which might have a detrimental effect on the health of fungal cells.
