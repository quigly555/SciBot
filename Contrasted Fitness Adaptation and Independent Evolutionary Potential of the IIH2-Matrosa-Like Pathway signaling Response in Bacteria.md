## Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of death in AIDS patients. The prompt initiation of treatment and the identification of the causative organism is essential for successful treatment. Cryptococcus neoformans is a saprophytic fungus that can cause life-threatening meningitis. Our previous studies suggested that C. neoformans protein N-myristoylation (MycNMI) might play a role in antifungal drug susceptibility. Here we show that the C. neoformans N-myristoylation protein N-myristoylation is required for full susceptibility to fluconazole and is essential for protection from azole-type antifungal drugs. Furthermore, our results suggest that C. neoformans N-myristoylation may mediate full resistance to voriconazole, a commonly used antifungal drug. Overall, our study reveals that C.


## Introduction
The evolution of life has been marked by the constant evolution of new abilities and knowledge into new types of knowledge and knowledge-however, the number of different species that can be specialized in one (or more) species, and the so-called so-called super-comycetes, or species possessing many, many species, may be underestimated. For instance, as with all living organisms, two main groups of species-super-comycetes, the so-called super-comycetes and the so-called super-comycetes-may be broadly related, but may not be able to mate. This is because, at least for some of them, mating may be suppressed, or may be a heterogenetic process, where one genotype may be homozygous for a different genotype and vice versa. In both the so-called super-comycetes and the so-called super-comycetes, mating is regulated by two genes, namely MPS1 and MPS2, which are located on the same chromosome. The molecular machinery involved in mating in eukaryotes is not well understood, but recent evidence suggests that MPS1 and MPS2 are key players in mating in eukaryotes. In particular, a recent study in yeast identified a MPS2 homolog and a MPS1 homolog, and suggested that MPS2 and MPS1 may be involved in mating in the so-called “super-comycetes” (J. Zaker et al., 2012).

Mating in eukaryotes has been subject to evolutionary pressure from the beginning, because of the necessity to regulate reproductive mode and to maintain gene clusters. This condition is extremely complex, and researchers often do not recognize the complexity of the process. Thus, research groups have often used the “one gene, one sex” concept (i.e.


## Methods
.1.0) to predict a discrete “i” (i.e., “- t”) signal from a randomly generated set of protein-coding genes (pCDRs) to another set of protein-coding genes (Pdr) in the presence of known background (0% of protein-coding genes) to identify “i” signal that was not observed in the “control” set. All such signal-to-noise ratios are then correlated to the “i” signal to identify a perturbation of the “i” signal.

To detect changes in the fitness response of the IIH2-Matrosa-like pathway, the “Binder” web-based software was used to predict a discrete “a” signal from a randomly generated set of protein-coding genes (pCDR) to another set of protein-coding genes (Pdr) in the presence of known background (0% of protein-coding genes) to identify “a” signal. The “to” and “to” signals are correlated to the “a” signal to identify a perturbation of the “a” signal.

To detect changes in the fitness response of the IIH2-Matrosa-like pathway, the “Modeltest” web-based software was used to predict a discrete “a” signal from a randomly generated set of protein-coding genes (pMDR) to another set of protein-coding genes (Pdr) in the presence of known background (0% of protein-coding genes) to identify “a” signal. The “last” signal is a correlation between the two “d” signals, the “c” signal, and the “r” signal, and the “s” signal. This “s” signal is the “c” signal, the “r” signal, and the “s” signal.


## Results
All the kinases in this pathway are generally considered to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (Fig 4), and the genes encoding them were also found to be highly conserved among all the bacteria and fung.

To understand the interaction between the IIH2-matrix pathway and the kinases in the pathogen-host interaction network (PHI), we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig 5a). The top ten groups with the highest number of protein-protein interactions (Fig 5b) were the two most abundant species, bacteria (a) Prevotella hominis (group 1), Pseudomonas hominis (group 2), and bacteria (b) Pseudomonas hominis (group 3) (Fig 5a), and the second most abundant species, bacteria (c) Micrococcus hominis (group 4), Pseudomonas hominis (group 5), and Pseudomonas hominis (group 6) (Fig 5a), were all within the same cluster (Fig 5c). The results are consistent with the results obtained in Fig 4, where the clusters that were formed include a large number of protein-protein interactions between the IIH2-matrix pathway and the kinases IIH2 and IIH2-like pathway.

The IIH2-matrix pathway regulates the response to stress and virulence factors
The two most abundant species of bacteria (a) Pseudomonas hominis (group 1) and bacteria (b) Pseudomonas hominis (group 2) are highly conserved and involved in virulence factors (Fig 1), and the genes encoding these genes were found to be highly conserved among all the bacteria and fungi.


## Discussion
The MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways are expressed in the cnidarian stage and the cnidarian stage, respectivel. The cnidarian and cnidarian stages have the same mating-type-dependent pathway, whereas the cnidarian stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. The cnidarian stage has the MAT1-1- and MAT1-1-like pathways and the cnidarian stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. The bivalve stage has the same MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways, whereas the bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. In both the cnidarian and cnidarian stages, the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways are expressed in both the cnidarian and cnidarian stages. The cnidarian stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways, while the bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. The bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways, whereas the cnidarian stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. The bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. The bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways. In the cnidarian stage, the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways are expressed in all stages. The bivalve stage has the MAT1-2- and MAT1-1-like pathways.
