## Abstract
The incidence of cryptococcosis has seen sharp increases in recent years, as the search for new therapies for the fungal disease continues. Cryptococcus gattii is a fungus that causes meningoencephalitis and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients, especially in HIV patients, and it poses a particular challenge to clinicians because of its intrinsic resistance to antifungal drugs. In this study, we show that the antagonistic yeast S. cerevisiae is the most efficient genetic model in which to dissect the interaction between a drug transporter and a pathogen. By analyzing the genome of a strain of S. cerevisiae expressing a highly virulent variant of the transporter, we have demonstrated that the antagonistic yeast strain is more resistant to killing by the host immune system. We have also identified novel molecules that synergistically inhibit the fungal growth of the antagonistic strain. The synergistic effect with antifungal drugs observed with respect to antifungal resistance and mechanism of drug resistance identified in this study may explain why some strains are able to survive the immune system, while others are not. This work has opened up a new chapter in the world of antifungal drug therapy and may open up an opportunity for the discovery of novel treatment options against this deadly infection.


## Introduction
Inflammation is a unique and complex mechanism of immune responses and has been studied in many different ways: inflammation as a defense mechanism against infection; as a defense against immune attacks; as a means to prevent tissue damage; as a means to prevent damage from occurring; as a means to prevent destruction of the host tissue; as a means to control inflammation; as a means to prevent tissue damage [1,2,3].

One of the major features of T lymphocytes is that they are not composed of single cells, but rather contain a vast array of microorganisms that can be engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils and survive inside of macrophages for several weeks [4,5]. The host immune response consists of several different mechanisms that can be activated and regulated depending on the type of microorganism and the cell type, the presence of foreign substances, and the environment [6,7].

Macrophages play a key role in the defense against bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites [8,9]. They produce several cytokines and growth factors that in turn can interact with other cells, contributing to the development of various immune responses [10]. These cytokines can be important in the development of various immune cell types such as dendritic cells (DCs), mast cells (MMCs), and NK cells. Macrophages can also be activated by other microbes such as fungi and bacteria. They can express various receptors and induce the expression of immunoreceptor molecules [11]. On the other hand, DCs are typically recruited to sites of infection and can be activated by several different microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

Thing is a complex interplay between the immune system and the microbial infection [12,13].


## Methods
 2007. The significant contribution of this amino acid to the structure of compounds found in this study is because this amino acid is composed of 10% of the total amino acid (Glick, 2008). The two-dimensional structure of the selected compounds was obtained by compound-pair HPLC (Caporaso et al., 2005). The reaction mixture was composed of three solvents: water, acetic acid, and methanol. The compounds were eluted with methanol (2.5 mL) and methanol (1 mL) in order to obtain the following HPLC peak: (A) Acetonitrile (A) (1% C18, 1.2 mL), (B) Na_2CO_3 (A) (1.2 mL), (C) Na_2SO_4 (A) (0.1 mL), (D) Na_2MoO_4 (A) (0.1 mL), (E) FeSO_4Â·7H_2O (0.1 mL), (F) K_2HPO_4 (0.1 mL), and (G) CoCl_2 (0.1 mL). The solution was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to obtain the peak of the C18 and the Na_2MoO_4. The elution procedure was as follows: (A) MeOH (0.1 mL) (0.1 mL), (B) MeOH (0.1 mL), (C) MeOH (0.1 mL), and (D) MeOH (0.1 mL) (0.1 mL). The compounds were eluted with MeOH (2.5 mL) and MeOH (1.5 mL) (0.1 mL). The peak obtained was measured using an UV-visible spectrophotometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and obtained with a ^1H NMR spectrometer (Witlak, Jena, Germany).

## Results
cerevisiae lectin [19. These amino acids include aryl methionine, lysine, asparagine, serine, and tyrosine [20]. The distribution of these aromatic amino acids in the S. cerevisiae lectin and the use of the aromatic cyclic aromatic amino acids in the synthesis of special interest Flavors in foods and cosmetics are summarized in Table 5.

The structure of the lectin with respect to the aromatic amino acid sequence has been determined by the hydrophobic nature of the peptides. The peptide has a hydrophobic pocket at its amino acid position, which is associated with a number of amino acids, which is in agreement with the composition of the lectin structure. The hydrophobic residue of the peptide is exposed to the thermal stability of the lectin at room temperature (Fig 1). The peptide has a characteristic of a free radical scavenging agent that is released from the hemolytic solvent upon the interaction of the free radical with the protein. The free radical is released from the interaction of the free radical with the protein to reduce the temperature of the interaction (Fig 2). The presence of the free radical may result in the formation of the free radical, which may accelerate the activity of the protein. The stability of the peptide was assessed with the heating behavior of the peptide at room temperature and the peptide is stable at room temperature (Fig 3).

The potential use of the lectin for industrial purposes is very promising, as it can be used to perform the synthesis of special interest flavors. The lectin has been shown to be a promising industrial product that can be used as a base for the synthesis of flavones in various ways. For example, the lectin can be used to treat tricyclazole-induced liver disease in humans, as it can be used to treat hepatitis and other indications.
