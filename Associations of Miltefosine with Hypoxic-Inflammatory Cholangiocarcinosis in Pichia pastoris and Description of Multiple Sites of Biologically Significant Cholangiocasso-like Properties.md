## Abstract
The combined role of inflammation and immune cells is essential for the development of chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we demonstrate that murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and human mononuclear cells are more susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) when it comes to Th1-type cytokines than wild-type human mononuclear cells. Both human mononuclear cells and BMMs from both animals and humans were treated with antifungal cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, interferon-<U+03B3>, and interleukin (IL)-10, as well as cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13, and inhibitors of the Th1-type signaling pathway. The response of all macrophages to all the cytokines was significantly lower in the bone marrow-derived macrophages than in the BMM cells, suggesting that the immune cells in the bone marrow-derived macrophages are much more vulnerable to TH1-type cytokines than in the bone marrow-derived immune cells.


## Introduction
The PMCLPs are either not cytotoxic or are cytotoxic to cells of the immune syste. Cholangiocarcinogenic agents such as Cholangiocarcin A and B inhibit eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively, and PMCLPs contain inhibitory antibodies on cell wall constituents of various eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. The PMCLPs have been investigated for their ability to inhibit neutrophil migration and have shown to have a strong immunological influence on neutrophil migration, which can be used to overcome the barrier between the phagocytes of the phagocytes and the phagocyte neutrophil. The PMCLPs have been demonstrated to be cytotoxic and inhibit neutrophil migration. Cholangiocarcin A, Cholangiocarcin B, and Cholangiocarcin E inhibit neutrophil migration by binding to protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibit neutrophil migration by binding to neutrophil calmodulin (Calc) [10].

Different types of toxins have been identified, such as furan, laccase, mycosubtilastatin, and oxydotatin. In addition, a few toxins are chemically characterized, such as methanol and its analog, methanol-4-carboxamide. In the case of fungal toxins, the toxicities are higher than in bacterial toxins and include necrosis, apoptosis, and hepatotoxicity [11].

Toxic compounds can be classified as one of five classes of compounds, e.g., terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenols. In general, terpenoids are classified as one of the five classes of compounds, i.e., terpenes (60%), stilbenoids (40%), and phenols (30%) [12]. In the case of terpenes, the thiol groups are included in the thiol groups of the aminoglycosides. In contrast, flavonoids and phenols are classified as one of five classes, i.e., phenolic compounds, and flavonols are classified as five of the six classes [13].


## Methods
(2007) using a drop-plate method in which 500 µL of . cholangiocarpa cells were seeded on a shaker at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (PBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a nitrogen source. Cells were then grown in a 96-well plate at 37°C and 200 rpm for 7 days, and the mycelia were harvested with sterile distilled water. The cells were lysed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature and washing with sterile PBS. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The lysate was then used for cholangiocin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (5 mg/mL, final concentration) assays as described previously (Gomes et al., 2007).

The cholangiocarps formation in Pichia pastoris was also assayed by the assay of cholangiocarps formation in Pichia kudriavchikova. In brief, P. kudriavchikova cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37°C and 200 rpm for 7 days. The mycelia were harvested with sterile distilled water, and the cells were lysed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature and washing with sterile PBS. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The lysate was then used for cholangiocin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (5 mg/mL, final concentration) assays as described previously (Gomes et al., 2007).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).


## Results
infantu. The antifungal activity of the P. pastoris pyridoxine analogs was determined in terms of the biological activity of the compounds against P. pastoris P. murina. The effect of these compounds on P. pastoris P. murina was evaluated by various concentrations of the compounds in combination with the antifungal drug. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the compounds against P. murina were 256 µg/ml, 5 µg/ml, and 1 µg/ml, respectively. The MIC for the compounds against P. murina was 64 µg/ml.

Table 2 summarizes the synergistic and additive interactions among the three pyridoxine analogs against P. pastoris P. murina, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 500 µg/ml and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 100 µg/ml for the compounds against P. murina.

Table 3 summarizes the interactions among the three pyridoxine analogs against P. pastoris P. murina. The synergistic effects of the pyridoxine analogs against P. murina were observed in terms of the concentrations of the tested compounds, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250 µg/ml for the compounds against P. murina and 100 µg/ml for the compounds against P. murina, with the MICs of 500 µg/ml and 250 µg/ml, respectively. The additive effects of the pyridoxine analogs against P. murina were observed in terms of the concentrations of the tested compounds, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 125 µg/ml for the compounds against P. murina and 500 µg/ml and 125 µg/ml for the compounds against P. murina, with the MICs of 125 µg/ml and 125 µg/ml, respectively.
