## Abstract
Marine organisms are known for their biogeochemical processes, which result in the production of secondary metabolites, or secondary metabolites with chemotherapeutic potential. Several marine-living organisms are associated with the production of secondary metabolites, and these compounds have been exploited by the terrestrial and marine environments for the production of chemicals and biofuels. The marine environment has provided the chemical resources for the secondary metabolites production from several natural and wild-type strains. Studies of the diversity of the secondary metabolites produced by various marine organisms have revealed that they can be either beneficial or harmful for terrestrial organisms. This review focuses on the chemical composition of the secondary metabolites produced by various marine organisms.


## Introduction
Due to the limited availability of clinically available drugs, there is an urgent need for new antifungal agents. Recently, a new class of azoles, posaconazole, for the treatment of invasive fungal infections was reported [1]. The antifungal activity of this class against planktonic and biofilm species has led to increased interest in its use [2]. Although the vast majority of clinical data are derived from studies using FLC, other antifungal agents including ketoconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole, as well as other agents with antifungal activity, such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole and flucytosine, are still being used in the clinic. Among these, voriconazole is the most commonly used drug in clinical practice and has the strongest antifungal activity. It is a triazole with a unique triazole structure with a flucytosine trivalent, with a catalytic triazole moiety and a low molecular weight. It has excellent bioavailability and has a low toxicity, which make it an excellent option in many antifungal drug delivery systems.

Lactams are a heterogeneous class of natural compounds with a unique mechanism of action [3]. They have a broad spectrum of activity and are able to inhibit the growth of a wide spectrum of fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus species. In vitro inhibition studies have shown that they are able to inhibit a broad spectrum of Candida and Aspergillus species. In addition, they have antifungal activity against a wider range of fungi. The mechanisms by which lactic acid is inhibited by Lactams in vitro have been reported [4].

Lactic acid is a natural product of milk, naturally derived from milk. It is a relatively inexpensive and widely available drug with a broad spectrum of activity. Lactic acid is an antibacterial peptide with a broad spectrum of activity against a broad spectrum of fungi. This broad spectrum of activity is due to its monoterpenoid moiety, which is able to inhibit the growth of several types of fungi, including yeast, and also to its ability to inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi.


## Methods
Fungal strains, media and culture conditions
All fungal strains used in this study were maintained at the School of Food and Drug Safety and Microbiology Department (FSMB), University of Maharashtra, India. The fungal strains were isolated from the urine of four patients, who were treated with the antifungal drugs amphotericin B deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and flucytosine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (Table 1). The SBM-1 isolates (Table 1) were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Science of the School of Veterinary Medicine of FSB, Chandigarh, India. The isolates were maintained at 4 Â°C and subcultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) slants for 2 days to remove adhering fungi.

C. albicans ATCC 90030 and C. dubliniensis ATCC 90028 were obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati Nagar, India. C. albicans ATCC 90028 was obtained from the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati Nagar, India. C. albicans ATCC 90028 was obtained from the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati Nagar, India. C. albicans ATCC 90028 was obtained from the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati Nagar, India. C. dubliniensis ATCC 90028 was obtained from the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chhatrapati Nagar, India.

The C. albicans ATCC 90028 was a kind gift from Dr. R.


## Results
Osteomyelitis was the most common cause of ocular pathology in the G to XOX group and was mostly caused by pulmonary infection (6.4%) followed by infection in the G to XOX group (36.2%). In the Surgical Resection Mating Type G to XOX group, 45.7% (5/6) of patients developed Osteomyelitis at the time of surgical treatment. Although the incidence of Osteomyelitis in the G to XOX group was higher than that of the Surgical Resection Mating Type G to XOX group (2.9%), the incidence of Osteomyelitis in the G to XOX group was much lower (1.3%) (Table 1). In the G to XOX group, 40.2% (1/2) of patients developed Osteomyelitis after a 1-weekurgical treatment and 5.7% (1/2) after a 2-weekurgical treatment (Table 1). Osteomyelitis was most common in the G to XOX group, followed by infection in the G to XOX group (8.7%) (Table 1). Osteomyelitis was most common in the Surgical Resection Mating Type G to XOX group (29.9%) (Table 1).

The incidence of Osteomyelitis in the G to XOX group was 2.4%, and the incidence of Osteomyelitis in the G to XOX group was 1.7%. Osteomyelitis was most common in the G to XOX group (24.2%) (Table 1).

Meningitis (n=19) in a G to XOX group was the most common cause of meningitis. In the G to XOX group, 15.1% (5/6) of patients had meningitis, and 7.4% (2/6) of patients had meningitis (Table 1). In the G to XOX group, 11.5% (4/6) of patients had meningitis, and 6.4% (2/6) of patients had meningitis (Table 1). In the G to XOX group, 13.8% (5/6) of patients had meningitis, and 11.5% (2/6) of patients had meningitis (Table 1).


## Discussion

The differential diagnosis of cryptococcal Osteomyelitis includes Osteomyelitis of the right side, Osteomyelitis of the left side, and Osteomyelitis of the right side, Osteomyelitis of the left side, and Osteomyelitis of the right sid. Osteomyelitis of the left side is characterized by a disseminated central mass on the face and the side, followed by an overlying mass on the scalp. The right side is characterized by a solitary mass on the scalp; the left side is characterized by an extraocular mass on the scalp and the right side is characterized by a solitary mass on the scalp and the scalp. In the diagnosis of Osteomyelitis of the left side, the right side is characterized by a subocular mass; the left side is characterized by an extraocular mass on the scalp; the right side is characterized by a solitary mass on the scalp and the scalp. The diagnosis of Osteomyelitis of the right side is characterized by the presence of a solitary mass on the scalp. In the diagnosis of Osteomyelitis of the left side, the left side is characterized by the presence of an extraocular mass on the scalp and the right side is characterized by the presence of a solitary mass on the scalp. In the diagnosis of Osteomyelitis of the right side, the right side is characterized by the presence of an extraocular mass on the scalp; the left side is characterized by an extraocular mass on the scalp; the right side is characterized by an extraocular mass on the scalp.

The diagnostic criteria for Osteomyelitis of the right side include: (i) an ocular mass with a central mass; (ii) an ophthalmic mass with a central mass; (iii) an extraocular mass; (iv) an extraocular mass; (v) an extraocular mass; (vi) a solitary mass; (vii) a solitary mass; (viii) a solitary mass; (viv) a solitary mass; and (vii) a solitary mass. The differential diagnosis of Osteomyelitis of the right side includes Osteomyelitis of the left side and Osteomyelitis of the right side.
