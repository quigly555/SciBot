## Abstract
We conducted a retrospective review of published articles about fungi infections in cats in China from 2000 to 2016, including epidemiology and clinical features. A total of 481 articles were included. We found that the frequency of cats with at least one fungal organism was 223.0 cases per 100,000 cats (95% CI, 224.0-233.0) followed by the frequency of at least two fungal organisms (at least 1.5 cases per 100,000 cats) to 120.0 cases per 100,000 cats (95% CI, 120.0-127.0). Clinical features, veterinary practice and laboratory findings were the main risk factors for developing fungal infection. Clinical fungal infections were more frequent in males (86.5% vs 25.3%; 95% CI, 15.4-70.9). Female cats had higher numbers (mean:M/F:M) in groups of cats with and without fungal infections (C:W ratio: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2; P = 0.000), and the prevalence of fungal infections was higher in males than females (95% CI: 1.1-2.2; P = 0.0011). The prevalence of urinary tract infection and skin infection was lower in male than female cats (6.9% vs 1.6%, P = 0.0228). We found that the incidence of non-Candida yeasts-infected fungal infections was higher in males (22.7% vs 5.6%, P = 0.000). The prevalence of urinary tract infection was higher in males than females (90.1% vs 26.0%, P = 0.0228). At least one organism was identified in three different fungal species among cats with fungal infections (C. albicans, C. auris, and C.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus species. It is caused by either C. neoformans or C. gattii, with the two species being more common, with C. neoformans causing disease in immunocompromised patients, or C. gattii causing disease in immunocompetent individuals (1). The biological significance of cryptococcal infection is attributed to the ability of the pathogen to change its morphology, and the ability of the cryptococcal cell to produce melanin (2). The C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex are responsible for this disease. Although C. neoformans and C. gattii cause disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals, the two species are distinguished by their mating types (3). The most common clinical manifestation of the disease is cryptococcal pneumonia, a primary clinical manifestation is rare. However, cryptococcosis can also be life threatening when the fungus is rapidly cleared from the host (4).

Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate (50%-70%) for cryptococcosis and as many as 15% of cases in organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients (5, 6). As a result, nearly 10 million people die each year from cryptococcosis, of which ~10% of cases in the developed world are fatal (7). The pathogenic Cryptococcus species cause human disease mainly in immunocompromised patients, and are responsible for most cases of cryptococcosis in the developing world (8). The current treatment for cryptococcosis involves amphotericin B and flucytosine, fluconazole and itraconazole.

Antifungal agents available against C. neoformans are limited, expensive, and/or toxic. The current drugs against C. neoformans and C. gattii have not been developed in sufficient quantity and quality to last a long time. The development of new antifungal agents against C. neoformans and C. gattii is urgently needed to combat the spread of this pathogen. The main aim of this study is to investigate the chemical composition of essential oils, volatile fractions, and biological activity of crude extracts of the essential oils of the abovementioned plants.


## Methods

For each strain, 5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 . The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited the growth of the cell-free fungus compared with the drug-free control. In addition, the interaction between H. capsulatum, E. coli, and S. cerevisiae was also tested.

Lipid Extraction
The culture supernatant of each well was carefully removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the solution was transferred to a new tube. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and then stored at -20°C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford method. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford method. The amount of soluble fraction in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford method. The stability of the sample was calculated using the Bradford method. The hydrolysis efficiency (HEC) was calculated using the Bradford method.

Protein concentration and homogenization
Total protein was determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The enzyme activity was measured using the method described by the manufacturer. The enzyme activity was expressed as units per milligram of crude protein. The substrate concentration was 1% (w/v). The reaction mixture was left in ice for 10 min and the absorbance at 340 nm was determined using the spectrophotometer. The pH of the reaction mixture was controlled with a pH 4.5 media (Sangon Co., Shanghai, China) to avoid excessive hydrolysis. The absorbance of the samples at 410 nm was determined using the m/z 632. The activities were expressed as units per milligram of crude protein.


## Results
After 48 h of co-cultivation, the liver showed no signs of significant fungal growth in the mouse compared to the contro. In the mouse liver, significant growth of most of the fungal species (including Candida albicans) were observed in the liver. The results of the in vitro assay are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6. The relative number of Candida species in the mouse liver was significantly higher than that in the control mouse culture. The relative number of Candida species in the liver of the liver of the mice co-cultured with HU after 4 h was much lower than that in the control mouse culture.


## Discussion
. Patient (7). However, in contrast to bacteria, fungi do not possess a-amylase as has been reported for other human fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (4,7,8). The U.S. patient presented with a poor ability to mount a-amylase activity and to produce a-amylase on the cell surface of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. The clinical isolates were obtained from oral candidiasis and were susceptible to a-amylase and were resistant to other antifungal drugs (4). We found that the U.S. patient could mount a-amylase activity on the cell surface of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. The gene encoding the U.S. UPR1 gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the protein biosynthesis of amylase was expressed on the cell surface of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis, which could be due to the presence of the UPR1 gene. In this study, the UPR1 gene was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of amylase. The expression of UPR1 gene in C. albicans was inhibited by acetazolamide, and the cells exhibited a high susceptibility to acetazolamide. However, the resistance of the cells to acetazolamide was not found. The UPR1 gene was expressed in the C. albicans cell surface. The expression of UPR1 gene in C. albicans was inhibited by acetazolamide, and the cells displayed a high susceptibility to acetazolamide. However, the resistance to acetazolamide was not found. The UPR1 gene was expressed in the U.S. patient, which could be due to the presence of the UPR1 gene. The UPR1 gene was expressed in the U.S. patient, which was not susceptible to acetazolamide. However, the resistance to acetazolamide was not found. The UPR1 gene was expressed in the U.S. patient, which was not resistant to acetazolamide. Therefore, the UPR1 gene might be involved in the biosynthesis of amylase.
