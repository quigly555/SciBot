## Abstract
Due to its convenience and accessibility, it ranks number of medicines in every country on Earth. It ranks treatment outcomes in terms of importance, but little information is available on its human health effects. We conducted this study to determine the impact of human and animal faecal contamination on the composition of the faecal microbiota in cats (Honey Badger), dogs ( dog-human ) and cats (human-cat feces) from Cuba. We collected cats and dogs from 51 cats and 66 dogs in 1988 and randomly selected from each sample to perform routine hygiene analysis. Swabs were digested with specific bacteria according to the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) and cultured for 16, 18, 24, 36 and 48 h. Salmonella organisms were isolated from 50.0% of the samples and Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. from 30.6% of the samples. H.badger, H.human, H.jugosubus and H.humaniae were isolated from 27.0% of the samples and Escherichia coli from 10.8% of the samples. H.


## Introduction
The genus Pristionchus is based on P. lunata, which was introduced by P. Prysinae in Italy (Prysina & Prysino, 1975). The genus includes over 200 species, and some are native to Asia, Australia, and the Indian subcontinent (Prysino, 1984). The genus is characterised by the pileate, globose basidiomata, which is borne on the subcutaneous tissues, and immersed basidiospores with conidiophores. The basidiospores are mostly brown, but occasionally brown and contain a few locules (Prysino, 1984). The fruiting bodies are brown, and many locules occur on the surface of the basidiospores. The basidiospores are immersed, and the fruiting bodies are usually 2-3 cm in diameter. Basidiospores are rarely impacted by the host and are only associated with certain hosts.

The genus Pristionchus is characterised by the pileate basidioma, globose basidiomata, a latex-structured basidium, and multi-septate hyaline basidiospores (Schimpflinger, 1975; Martín & Pineda, 1983). Basidiospores are found in the litter, decaying wood, and especially in the water (Martín & Pineda, 1983; Schimppolo, 1984). Basidiospores are reported to be formed in association with the basidiospores of other fungi such as Neurospora crassa, Fusarium oxysporum, and Penicillium marneffei (Martín & Pineda, 1983; Schimppolo, 1984). Phylogenetic analysis of the draft genome of P. lunata revealed significant sequence divergence and the ability of the species to form asexual conidia (Martín & Pineda, 1983; Schimppolo, 1984). However, phylogenetic analysis of the draft genome of P. lunata and other Pristionchus species has not been conducted yet.


## Methods
Study site and soil sampling
The study was carried out at the Herbarium of the Institute of Porphological and Biochemical Sciences of the National Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology of South Africa (SPB SANSAS). The sampling took place in May 2009. The study was carried out in the field with high sand and sand clay soil (around 10% clay) and mixed by mixing with 0.2% sand by hand. The soil was kept for seven days before being harvested.

Morphological analysis of fungal communities
Morphological characteristics of the fungal communities were studied by microscopic observations and morphological characteristics of the samples were examined under a light microscope (Olympus BX51) and SEM (Axio Scope A1).

Microscopic study of fungal communities
The microscopic structures of the micro-morphological specimens were studied in order to observe the fungi (Fungi) in the soil. The studied fungi were transferred from each of the soils and placed on the surface of 1% PDA and cultured for seven days at room temperature (RT). The fungi were subcultured on PDA slants at room temperature (RT).

Morphological analysis of fungal communities
The studied fungi were examined in detail in the section sections (Fig 1). The studied fungi were transferred from each of the different soils and placed on the surface of 1% PDA and cultured for seven days at RT. The fungal communities were observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX51).

## Results
The present study showed that the addition of Ca^2+ to the seawater environment did not improve the algal growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, whereas Ca^2+ uptake into the algal growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was much improved (Figure 2. In addition, addition of Ca^2+ significantly enhanced the growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum in the presence of Ca^2+ (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively; Figure 2A and B).

It has been reported that the concentration of Ca^2+ required to achieve the maximum growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum was 1000-fold higher than that needed for growth of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum under alkaline conditions [50], [51], [52]. We have recently shown that the addition of Ca^2+ to the seawater environment improved the growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum under alkaline conditions. Our findings indicate that addition of Ca^2+ to the seawater environment may be advantageous for both species under alkaline conditions.

It has been reported that addition of Ca^2+ to the seawater environment improves the algal growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum under alkaline conditions [22], [25], [27]. It has been reported that the addition of Ca^2+ to the seawater environment increases the growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum under alkaline conditions [20], [25], [27], and the addition of Ca^2+ enhanced the growth rate of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum under alkaline conditions (Figure 2A and B).


## Discussion
The results showed that Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cladosporium herbarum were more active in alkaline pH and oxidative stress conditions (Table S1 and Table S2. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was more active in the presence of two substances and also showed higher antioxidant activity (Table S2). The results showed that the antioxidant activity of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was comparable to that of R. glutinis. The antioxidant activity of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was similar to that of R. glutinis and exhibited greater activity in the presence of C-Hex-Hex-Phenol (Table S2). However, the antioxidant activity of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was higher than that of R. glutinis, and showed lower activity in the presence of C-Hex-Hex-Phenol (Table S2). Rhodotorula mucilaginosa showed better antioxidant activity than other Rhodotorula species, but less activity in the presence of C-Hex-Hex-Phenol (Table S2). These results indicated that Rhodotorula mucilaginosa has a higher antioxidant potential than other Rhodotorula species.
