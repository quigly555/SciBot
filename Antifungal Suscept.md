## Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the leading cause of AIDS-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa, with estimated 2.4 million new HIV-infected persons become infected each year. The major objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of anti-HIV vaccine in a setting with high HIV prevalence in Zambia.

In this study, the primary endpoints were determined during the first week of implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) regime. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with AIDS or other medical conditions presenting with recurrent hemorrhagic leishmaniasis.

The program enrolled 182 HIV-infected and -veterinized individuals who presented with fever, rash, and/or a subacute or one-quarter infection with HIV-related cytomegalovirus (5/182) or tetanus. The treatment was divided into three arms: either 2 doses of anti-HIV vaccine (100 ng/kg or 125 ng/kg), either 1 dose of anti-HIV vaccine (100 ng/kg or 20 ng/kg), or both 1 and 2 doses of anti-HIV vaccine. The proportion of patients with recurrent hemorrhagic leishmaniasis was 84% (134/182) and that of HIV-infected patients was significantly lower (33.3% and 42.9% respectively). Anti-HIV vaccine was given to all patients at 1 dose (100 ng/kg or 125 ng/kg) and in 6 patients with recurrent hemorrhagic leishmaniasis (3 patients).


## Introduction
The association between fungal pathogenicity and virulence in plants is a matter of debate, particularly in the last decades.


## Methods
0 [31. The micro-dilution method was performed as described by the CLSI and has been applied to the control of clinical isolates [32].

The susceptibility of the purified plant extracts to the antifungal drugs was determined by the broth micro-dilution method according to the CLSI M27-A3 [33]. The MIC values of the purified plant extracts were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M-24-A3.12. The MIC values of the tested plant extracts were: 1-(1-phenyl)-2-(3-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (PMSAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA); 1-(1-phenyl)-2-amino-4-isopropyl-1H-aniline-2-propanesulfonic acid (ISAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA); 1-(1-phenyl)-2-amino-4-isopropyl-1H-aniline-2-propanesulfonic acid (AMPA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA); and 1-(1-phenyl)-2-amino-4-isopropyl-1H-aniline-2-propanesulfonic acid (ASPA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA).

The MICs of the tested plant extracts were: 3-(1-phenyl)-3-chloropropane-2-propanesulfonic acid (PPSAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA); and 2-(1-phenyl)-3-chloropropane-2-propanesulfonic acid (PCPSAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA).


## Results
For the further study, the fungal burden and colony morphology in kidneys of C57BL/6 mice was determined by in vitro growth and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. The mean number of CFU in the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice was 6.3 (range: 1.1-5.6) × 10^6/L (n = 20).

The two strains were significantly different at the in vitro growth and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. The two strains were significantly different at the in vitro growth and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. The mean CFU in the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice was 6.6 (range: 0.8-7.1) × 10^6/L (n = 20).

Among the four strains tested in the in vitro growth and colony-forming unit (CFU), the two strains were significantly different at in vitro growth and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. The mean CFU in the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice was 6.8 (range: 0.6-8.5) × 10^6/L (n = 20).


## Discussion
We identified the serotype D strain of Cryptococcus neoformans in the serotype D population in a single case, and we compared the results with that reported by Chen et a. (2018) in C. gattii, who found a serotype D strain (serotype A) in the serotype A population in a single patient. Interestingly, we found that the serotype D strain of C. gattii (serotype D) was not significantly more virulent in a murine model of infection (P = 0.009) than the serotype A strain of C. neoformans (serotype A) (P = 0.034). This indicates that the serotype D strain is a more virulent strain, but there is still work to be done to identify strains in which the serotype D strain is less virulent.

The two serotypes (serotype C and serotype D) of C. gattii were most commonly isolated from human patients. However, the serotype D strain of C. neoformans was isolated from a patient with pulmonary cryptococcosis (C. gattii) in an immunocompetent patient (N. meningitidis). Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to be less virulent in mice (Wei et al., 2018). However, in the mouse model of cryptococcosis, C. gattii isolates were found to be less virulent (Chen et al., 2017). The lower rates of C. gattii isolation from patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and disseminated infection in our study may reflect the greater genetic diversity of C. gattii compared to C. neoformans.

Our serotype D strain of C. gattii (serotype C) was not significantly more virulent in a murine model of infection (P = 0.005) than the serotype D strain (serotype D) in the same patient (P = 0.009). This indicates that the serotype D strain is less virulent in a murine model of infection. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most commonly isolated strain of C. gattii from clinical specimens (Chen et al., 2017).
