## Abstract

A562 is a patient-centered randomized trial of an adult, non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population with AID. Five primary outcomes were assessed: 1) antiretroviral therapy (ART), 2) immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), 3) candidiasis, and 4) candidiasis and fungal burden. The 5-year follow-up of A562 was performed: baseline serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, candidiasis status at ART initiation (CM), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and fungal burden (calcogenic load) in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected subjects.

Baseline Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, candidiasis status at ART initiation (CM), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and fungal burden were measured at ART initiation and 5-year follow-up.

Baseline Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were higher in CM and IRIS subjects than in HIV-infected or non-HIV-infected subjects. CM was associated with increased risk of invasive fungal disease (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.34, p < 0.0001, IgG < 0.005, and IRIS OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-1.73, p < 0.0005, respectively) but no association was found for candidiasis. IRIS subjects had a 2.5-fold higher risk of invasive candidiasis (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-3.78, p < 0.0001, incidence 95% CI 1.14-3.06, p < 0.0001, and no association [OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.83-99.7, p = 0.0026, respectively]). The incidence of candidiasis in A562 was similar in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected adults.

We report an 8-week-old goat female with a history of sputum-containing immunodeficiency, with a 1-year incidence of invasive candidiasis, candidiasis with a 1-year incidence of candidiasis and candidiasis with a 5-year incidence of candidiasis.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased over the past decades, and due to widespread use of catheters and the widespread use of implanted medical devices, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) and solid organ transplant patients (STRs) [1-3]. However, the main underlying pathogens responsible for IFIs are Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus, with Candida being the most common cause of IFIs in patients with hematologic malignancies [1, 4]. Other Candida and Aspergillus species are rarely encountered, and the frequency of these species varies greatly by country and sometimes by geographical area [5, 6]. In addition, the use of catheter-associated devices has been considered as an alternative to the conventional catheter-associated device in the management of patients with invasive candidiasis [7]. Moreover, the introduction of catheter-associated devices has been reported to decrease the frequency and severity of fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancy and patients undergoing extensive antifungal therapy [8-10].

The use of catheter-associated devices has been used for more than two decades to treat catheter-associated infections and to prevent complications associated with catheter-associated devices [11, 12]. In general, the catheter-associated devices are well suited for catheter-associated infections with a high mortality rate, high frequency, and high cost [11, 12]. Moreover, the catheter-associated devices can be used in settings where catheter-associated devices are not available, such as intensive care units (ICUs), or where catheter-associated devices are not available [13]. This is because, in many countries, catheter-associated devices are not equipped with catheter-associated devices, which are often not used in patients undergoing intensive care unit (ICU) care.

The use of catheter-associated devices is limited in most countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries [13-15].


## Methods
Fungal strains, media and growth conditions
M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was used to infect 5-wk-old female mice at the age of 8-18 weeks. The inocula were prepared from stock suspensions of M. tuberculosis (ATCC 10231) and of M. tuberculosis-infected mice (ATCC 14052), and the inocula were prepared as described [25]. M. tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis-infected mice and M. tuberculosis-infected animals were kept in cages and fed with fresh and regular food and water ad libitum. Inocula were prepared from freshly grown M. tuberculosis and M. tuberculosis-infected mice, and were stored at -80 Â°C until use. All cultures were performed at least two days prior to use in experiments.

For M. tuberculosis infection, female 5-wk-old male mice were used in experiments.


## Results
Thus, we investigated the antifungal susceptibility of the Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain to azole-based antifungal therapy in adults with invasive fungal infection. The Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain was also highly resistant to micafungin and fluconazole, but was resistant to caspofungin and flucytosine, and resistant to amphotericin B and voriconazole (Table 3). The Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain was also highly susceptible to azole-based antifungal therapy, but was highly resistant to caspofungin and fluconazole, and resistant to amphotericin B and voriconazole (Table 3).

Antifungal Resistance of the Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> Strains Was Associated with the Levels of Antiretroviral Therapy
We investigated the susceptibility of the Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain to antifungal therapy based on the level of antiretroviral therapy in adult patients receiving standard antifungal therapy. The Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain was highly susceptible to micafungin and fluconazole, but was highly susceptible to caspofungin and flucytosine, and resistant to amphotericin B and voriconazole (Table 4). The Fc<U+03B3>RIIb<U+0394> strain was also highly susceptible to fluconazole and caspofungin, but was resistant to amphotericin B and flucytosine, and resistant to caspofungin and flucytosine (Table 4).


## Discussion
In this study, we assessed the efficacy of antithrombital-based antifungal therapy for adult patients with invasive fungal diseas. Our data showed that antithrombital-based antifungal therapy was effective for both adult patients and pediatric patients with invasive fungal disease.

The initial hypothesis of antifungal therapy for invasive fungal infection was based on the use of compounds that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of invasive fungal infection, such as amphotericin B, caspofungin, and echinocandins [15], [46]. In this study, we found that antithrombital-based antifungal therapy was effective for adult patients with invasive fungal disease. Our data showed that antithrombital-based antifungal therapy was effective for both adult patients and pediatric patients.
