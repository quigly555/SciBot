## Abstract
The fungal pathogens Cryptococcus gattii, C. neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii VGII are encapsulated, opportunistic pathogens that can be difficult to recognize and recognize only at early stages of infection. The lack of robust in vitro diagnostic tools makes identification of these pathogens a primary concern. Here we report the detection of nine proteins from Cryptococcus sp. in the serum of an adult recipient under 20 years of age. These proteins were detected in the serum sample by using specific antibody directed to one of the Cryptococcus sp. capsular polysaccharides. Using a capillary electrophoretic mobility electrophoresis (MPE) assay, we were able to detect the nine Cryptococcus sp. proteins at a molecular mass fraction (MCF) in the serum sample. Using a multiple target binding-site mapping approach, we identified nine proteins as C. gattii VGII that were exclusive to C. neoformans and C. gattii VGII VGII isolates at the molecular mass fraction (MCF) of MCF. Two of the C. gattii VGII proteins were also exclusive to the C. neoformans VGII subtypes. These results demonstrate that our molecular analysis of Cryptococcus sp. serum could be used to identify the proteins that are exclusive to this fungal pathogen and provide a tool to facilitate the detection of C. gattii and C. neoformans infections.

## Results
The time course of the distribution and polarization of Dendritic cells in the organs of mice was analyze. The time course of Dendritic cells in the organs of mice was compared with the time course of a control group. In this study, the time course of Dendritic cells in the organs of mice was compared with the time course of a control group. In the organs of mice, a 10-fold decrease in the number of Dendritic cells was observed in the organs of mice compared to a 2-fold decrease in the numbers of cells in the organs of mice in the control group (Fig 2). In the organs of mice treated with 0.5% OVA, the time course of Dendritic cells was compared with the time course of a control group. In the organs of mice treated with 0.5% OVA, a 2-fold decrease in the number of Dendritic cells was observed in the organs of mice compared to a 2-fold decrease in the number of cells in the organs of mice in the control group (Fig 2).

In order to determine whether the activation of Dendritic cells is dependent on the availability of OVA, we examined the effects of OVA on the expression of various cytokines in the organs of mice. The results indicated that the activation of Dendritic cells was not affected by OVA treatment in the control group (Fig 3). The release of various cytokines, including IL-1ß, IL-4, TNF-a, and IL-12, were higher in the organs of mice treated with 0.5% OVA compared to the control group (Fig 3). The release of various cytokines, including IL-1ß, IL-4, TNF-a, and IL-12, was not affected by OVA treatment in the control group (Fig 3).

Aging Ratneria Decreases the Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines in the Spinal Cord of Dendritic Cells
In order to further characterize the differences in the expression of various cytokines in the spinal cord of Dendritic cells in the blood of mice, we analyzed the expression of cytokines and cytokine expression by the spleen.


## Discussion
During the winter months, the drinking water is much less acidic and the water quality is unaffecte. In winter, the drinking water quality is slightly more acidic than in summer months (winter and spring). During the winter months, the drinking water quality is significantly lower than in summer months (winter and spring). The difference in the pH is mainly due to the fact that the drinking water is acid and not alkaline. Therefore, the influence of water temperature and pH on the lymphocyte distribution and the difference in the distribution of lymphocytes from the infected rats is obvious. In the drinking water, the optimal pH is 9.5. The optimal pH for lymphocyte distribution is 9.5. The lymphocyte distribution is relatively normal, which is because lymphocytes are abundant in the lymphocyte tissues. Therefore, the optimal pH for lymphocyte distribution is in the range of 9.5 to 10.0. The lymphocyte distribution is generally abnormal in the drinking water. The lymphocyte distribution is affected by the feeding habits of the rats. The feeding habits of the rats usually consist of eating, drinking and consuming water from the table. The rats do not eat water or water from the table. The water supply is usually supplied by the rats. The water supply for the drinking water is usually supplied by the tap water system. The water supply for the tap water system is usually supplied by the tap water system.
