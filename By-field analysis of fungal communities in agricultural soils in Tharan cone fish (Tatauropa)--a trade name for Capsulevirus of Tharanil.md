## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent airborne human fungal pathogen with the mortality rates ranging between 20% and 50% in inhaled cases. The incidence of new infections rising rapidly in healthcare settings is a major concern and is of particular concern in resource-limited settings. The management of A. fumigatus infections is complicated by the high cost of healthcare and the fact that many underlying conditions are highly drug dependent. The recent availability of genome sequences, enhanced screening and the development of molecular diagnostics are enabling the early diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study is to provide a step by step review of the A.


## Introduction
cecropi) or the Brucella beeli) (Brucella beeli) and, in some areas, including the Cape Peninsula of South Africa and the Atlantic Forest of New Zealand (Cecropia and . cecropi), with an estimated occurrence of 7% of the total total cultivated area of the South African Republic of Kruger National Park (Kronemel et al. 2010, Boroujerdi et al. 2015, Vila et al. 2016, Morais et al. 2016). The North African region of Sudan, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe, with a total of approximately 1.3 million hectares cultivated (Kronemel et al. 2010, Vila et al. 2012), are characterised by a combination of Cryphonectria parasitica, the common Cryphonectria mucilaginos, the common Pleosporaceae, and the typical Pleosporaceae family (Vila et al. 2012).

Since the first studies on the effects of soil fungi on the fungal communities of the C. beeli and B. cecropi in South Africa (Deng et al. 2009), a number of studies have investigated the impact of soil fungi on the fungal communities of these two species. The B. cecropi is a species that is highly polyphyletic with more than 200 described species (Bartender et al. 2009, Ropars et al. 2011). Recent large-scale surveys of soil fungi across two African countries, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauta do (Bartender et al. 2009), revealed that the diversity of soil fungi was not evenly distributed across the study sites with the majority occurring in the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape regions. Some species were found in only two or three of the four main habitats, while others were found to be abundant in the bulk soil and were found in all four habitats (Deng et al. 2009, Thongpaolo et al. 2014). The soil communities of B. cecropi in these two African countries were more diverse than those in the United Kingdom (Kronemel et al. 2010) and Denmark (Thongpaolo et al. 2014).


## Methods
The results are reported as percent of sampled area that were “fungal. To minimize the effects of soil heterogeneity, the sampled area was divided into three groups according to their geographic origin: Chinese-origin group (SWE) and Shandong-origin group (SHWE) in Tharan cone area. The PAMPs were cultivated in PDA and BSL slants (SWE). The PAMPs were cultivated in BSL slants and incubated at 25 °C. The PAMPs were treated with 10% sodium hypochlorite for 5 h at room temperature. The PAMPs were treated with 0.1% Tween 80 for 5 h at room temperature. After treatment, the PAMPs were removed from the slants and washed with sterile distilled water. For the treatments, the PAMPs were cultured in SWE slants for 7 days at 25 °C. The PAMPs were treated with 0.1% Tween 80 for 7 days at 25 °C. After treatment, the PAMPs were removed from the slants and washed with sterile distilled water. The PAMPs were left in the SWE slants for 7 days at 25 °C. The PAMPs were treated with 0.1% Tween 80 for 7 days at 25 °C. The PAMPs were left in the SWE slants for 7 days at 25 °C.

2.6. Fungal Isolation and Isolation of Capsulevirus Genes
The purified fungal gene homologue was obtained from the supernatant of T. luteus strain TOC-21 [58]. The fungal strains were grown on PDA plates (SWE) at 25 °C and 200 rpm for 48 h. The cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and re-suspended in PBS.

2.7. Microscopy
The fungal colonies were counted after 7 days of growth on PDA plates. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) was calculated from the count of fungal cells. The colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) of PDA (Eppendorf) were calculated for the first 3 days of growth on PDA plates. The images were acquired using a Nikon Coolpix 4500 microscope.


## Results
Although the fungal community structure in the tharan cone fish was largely similar to that observed in soil, the fungal communities in the tharan cone fish were largely distinct from that of soil (Figure 5A.

The fungal community structure in the soil in the tharan cone fish was largely similar to that in the soil of other freshwater fish (Figure 5B). The soil of the Tharan cone fish showed the same fungal community structure as that of the soil of other freshwater fish, and the fungal community structure in the tharan cone fish was nearly identical to that of the soil of other freshwater fish. The soil of the tharan cone fish was much more similar to that of the soil of other freshwater fish than the soil of the other freshwater fish. The soil of the tharan cone fish was much more similar to that of the soil of the soil of other freshwater fish than the soil of the soil of the other freshwater fish. In the tharan cone fish, the soil of the tharan cone fish was much more similar to that of the soil of other freshwater fish than the soil of the soil of the other freshwater fish (Figure 5B).

## Discussion
. The bacterial community structure in this ecosystem is similar to that in the environment, in which all the fungal species were isolated from the environment [37]. The proportion of bacteria in the bacterial community was higher in the presence of sulfate. The higher proportion of bacteria in the bacterial community compared to the bacterial community in the presence of sulfate is in agreement with other studies [38].

The differences in the bacterial community structure between the two environments are in agreement with previous studies [39]. For example, a previous study found that the number of bacteria in the soil in the Tharan cone ecosystem was much higher than that in the environment, while the number of bacteria in the environment was less than 1 [36]. The relative abundance of bacteria in the soil was similar between the two environments, with a relative abundance of bacteria in the soil in the Tharan cone ecosystem (48.8%) followed by the environment (14.8%) and the environment (11.5%) [36]. The relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem was also similar to that of the environment, but higher in the Tharan cone environment (12.4%) [36].

There were differences in the relative abundances of bacteria in the soil compared to the two environments. In the Tharan cone ecosystem, the relative abundance of bacteria was highest in the presence of sulfate. The relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem was higher in the presence of sulfate, with a relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem of 12.4% compared to that of 3.4% in the environment. The relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem was similar to that of the environment, with a relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem of 12.4% compared to that of 4.7% in the environment. The relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem was similar to that of the environment, with a relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem of 12.4% compared to that of 4.7% in the environment. The relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem was higher in the presence of sulfate, with a relative abundance of bacteria in the Tharan cone ecosystem of 13.8% compared to that of 6.8% in the environment.
