## Abstract
Plants are commonly used in indigenous communities to produce nutritional supplements and have been known to be used as immunogenic natural products. In this work, we evaluated the activity of an extract of Eugenia stigmina against Leishmania yeasts and their bioactive metabolites, penicillin and penicillin-6-phosphate (PF6-PPb). The plant extract was tested against Leishmania spp. Yeast strains and bioactive metabolites produced by different Leishmania species was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; 16 Âµg/mL) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC/DC) were determined. Penicillin-6-phosphate was the main component (P; 3.3%). All strains showed a decrease in the MIC, MBC/DC, and PCM content. Moreover, all strains showed a decrease in the MIC, MBC/DC, and PCM content when compared to control. These results suggest that the Eugenia stigmina extract of E. stigmina has a potential antimicrobial activity.


## Introduction

The availability of the Paracoccidioides genus is limited due to its environmental pathogenic potential (.g. the lack of oxygen, high temperatures, soil) [8,9], as well as the lack of taxonomic expertise and knowledge of the species [10]. Despite this, the Paracoccidioides genus is important to the study of the pathogen, especially in Brazil. The taxonomic status of this genus is largely based on the morphology of the sclerotia [11]. The sclerotia have the capacity to form aggregates of conidia that can germinate into hyphal chains, and the germinating sclerotia are recognized as pathogenic by the host, as well as by the fungal cells [12]. The sclerotia are able to form thick hyphae and long chains that can spread through the plant tissues, causing a broad range of diseases. Currently, the majority of the Paracoccidioides species are classified into four different genera: Paracoccidioides, Scedosporium, Cryptococcus, and Sporothrix [13].

The current study was performed to provide a comprehensive overview of the phylogenetic relationships among the various species within Paracoccidioides. We first tried to identify the most closely related members of the genus Paracoccidioides using three loci: ITS, LSU, and TEF1 [14]. The genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, such as glucan synthase, were examined to find out which genes are involved in the production of cellular pigments. Subsequently, we searched the online databases and put together the results of the fungal genome project for the genus Paracoccidioides and identified many species in this genus. The Paracoccidioides genome project (www.osd.fbi.org) is a consortium of three genome projects: a genome assembly of the first draft genome (www.npr-clin.org), and a comparative genome analysis (www.cbs-clin.org). The Paracoccidioides genomes are publicly available at www.Paracoccidioides.org. The genome assembly of the first draft genome (www.Paracoccidioides.org/npp/npp.op) is a consortium of Paracoccidioides genomes [15].


## Methods

Determining a culture-independent impact of water source and water stress on the environmental microbiota
The impact of water source and water stress on the microbial community was determined using the two environmental soil sampling systems (Table 1) as described previously (Sun et al. 2017). The water source was a mixed-use, multi-use surface well-mediated flat-bottom, agar-based soil mixture (Settles et al. 2014). The water stress was a mixture of nitrogen and carbon sources. The soil was a mixed-use, multi-use, solid-based soil mixture. The soils were previously treated with H_2O and 1.5 N H_2O as fertilizer in order to mimic the impact of air pollution. Water stress was applied by treating the soils with H_2O and 1.5 N H_2O as fertilizer. All treatments were performed in the same day, and the result was recorded at the end of each treatment. Three samples were collected at the end of each treatment and analyzed for each treatment by running the same data, which were collected again at the end of each treatment. The soil content was determined at each time point using the soil moisture content and the carbon content as described previously (Sun et al. 2017).

Effect of 2.0-Mbar and 1.0-Mbar on the Microbial Community
Two different approaches were employed to investigate the effect of 2.0-Mbar and 1.0-Mbar on the microbial community in the soils of the three treatment mixtures. The first approach included the soil water content as an indicator of water stress and the second was the carbon content as a measure of water stress. The soil water content was measured at the end of each treatment using the soil moisture content and the carbon content as indicators of carbon stress and the final soil water content as a measure of water stress. The soil water content was calculated from the soil moisture content at the end of each treatment. The second approach was performed using the two concentrations of 2.0-Mbar and 1.0-Mbar as indicator of water stress, as described previously (Sun et al. 2017). The soil water content was measured at the end of each treatment using the soil moisture content and the carbon content as indicators of carbon stress and the final soil water content as a indicator of water stress.


## Results
We initially compared the fungal community among AMDC and WA. While the AMDC is a large and dynamic forest, it does not appear to have as many fungal communities as the WAC. As shown in Fig 5, the AMDC has fewer fungal communities than the WAC, and as such it appears to have a more diverse fungal community than the AMDC.

The fungal Community in WAC
We then compared the fungal community in the WAC and AMDC. We analyzed the fungal community in the WAC and AMDC. We identified a total of 32,422 (8.2%) fungal OTUs (Table S2), and we compared the number of fungal OTUs across the AMDC and WAC (Fig 6). As shown in Fig 6, the number of fungal OTUs in the AMDC was significantly higher than the WAC (p < 0.05).

The fungal Community in WAC
The fungal community in WAC was different from the AMDC, and the fungal community in the AMDC was significantly higher than the AMDC. As shown in Fig 7, the number of fungal OTUs in the AMDC was significantly higher than the WAC (p < 0.05), but this difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). The fungal community in the AMDC was significantly lower than the AMDC.

The fungal Community in WAC
As shown in Fig 8, the fungal community in WAC was different from the AMDC, and the fungal community in the AMDC was significantly higher than the AMDC. However, the fungal community in WAC was significantly lower than the AMDC, and the fungal community in the AMDC was significantly lower than the AMDC.

The fungal Community in WAC
The fungal community in WAC was also different from the AMDC, and the fungal community in the AMDC was significantly higher than the AMDC. However, the fungal community in WAC was significantly lower than the AMDC, and the fungal community in the AMDC was significantly lower than the AMDC.


## Discussion
In addition, the communities of both the populations that were sampled from the EDA in the tropical-rich EdA were not detecte. This is not in accordance with the communities in the Amazonian dark soil, which also had the highest richness of fungi and yeasts in the EDA. This indicates that the Amazonian soil is a microcosm of a terrestrial environment.

As the ecosystems in the Amazonian Dark Earth are characterized by high levels of biodiversity, we hypothesized that the intensity of the fungal community would be influenced by the nutrient availability (Na^+ or CO_2) in the ecosystem. Since, the fungal communities in the EDA had a high diversity of fungi and yeasts (up to 80%) and were dominated by phytopathogenic fungi, we expected to detect more fungal phylotypes in the EDA compared to the fungal communities in the bright light conditions of the EDA. However, we found that the fungal community of the EDA was dominated by members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which are dominant in this environment [40]. It is possible that these phylotypes could be more abundant in the dark soil and were more susceptible to light.

In this study, we detected different phylotypes in the EDA. In the dark soil, the phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Basidiomycota were different from the phylotypes of the other soils. In the EDA, the phylotypes of the phylotypes of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most abundant phylotypes, while the phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Basidiomycota were the least abundant phylotypes. The phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Basidiomycota were also the most abundant phylotypes in the EDA, but the phylotypes of Basidiomycota and Basidiomycota were the least abundant phylotypes in the EDA. These results suggested that the differences in the microbial community in the EDA could be related to the nutrient availability (Na^+ or CO_2) in the environment.

In the EDA, the phylotypes of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were different from each other.
