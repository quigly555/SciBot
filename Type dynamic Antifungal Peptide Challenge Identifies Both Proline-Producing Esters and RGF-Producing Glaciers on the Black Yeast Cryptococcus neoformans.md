## Abstract
The importance of the essential oil of Daucus carterioides for their medicinal uses is well known. However, the content of the essential oil of D. carterioides is unknown and it is unknown whether it is more effective than water treatment, ethanol or acetic acid. This study investigated the effect of D. carterioides on the composition of the composition of the essential oil of D. carterioides and evaluated the influence of various extracts and fractions against their toxicity. The results showed that the extract fractions, namely, i.e., E6, C16, E9, and Ga, had the most effective effect against D. carterioides and their concentrations inhibited the growth of D. carterioides at a dose ranging from 0.002 to 0.25 mg/mL. Furthermore, the extracts and fractions had a smaller effect on the cellular membrane integrity, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permease, and membrane integrity as indicated by the reduction of the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Trypanosoma brucei, and phosphatidylethanolamine. These results suggest that the extract fractions are more potent against D. carterioides with their larger size and the greater toxicity than water treatment.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections are increasingly being reported as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. However, few studies have investigated the clinical presentation, factors involved, and antifungal susceptibility of the same patients. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) has increased over the past decades due to the widespread use of immunosuppressive therapies. The high mortality associated with IA is frequently attributed to inadequate management of IA and its associated mortality rates are substantial. This is particularly true in settings with limited or no available health-care resources.

Severe IA is a spectrum of illnesses that occur in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. A. fumigatus is the most common etiologic agent of IA. A.


## Methods
Each organism was tested for both proline and RGF production in triplicat. The experiment was repeated three times, each with two biological replicates. The results were confirmed by plating 1 × 10^5 Cryptococcus neoformans cells on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) and incubation at 37 °C.

Antifungal activity of tryptophan-producing Esters
The antifungal activity of tryptophan-producing Esters was determined by the reduction of tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich) into a solution of 0.02% p-dimethylamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 25 °C for 1.5 h.

The different treatments were used in the experiments. In the first experiment, 200 µl of Ester solution (100 µg/mL) was added to each well of a 24-well plate (Nunc) and incubated for 24 h. The Esters were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS and fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The same treatment was repeated in the second experiment, this time with 200 µg/mL of tryptophan. In the third experiment, 200 µg/mL of tryptophan was added to each well of a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The Esters were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS and the concentration of tryptophan in each well was determined using the microplate reader.

Antifungal activity of the non-penetrating S. typhimurium
The antifungal activity of the non-penetrating S. typhimurium species was determined by the reduction of S. typhimurium into a solution of 0.2% p-dimethylamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 25 °C for 1.5 h. The Esters were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS and the solution was removed by washing with 2 mL of distilled water. The solution was removed by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min, 5 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was washed with 1 mL of 1 M H_3PO_4. The color of the pellet was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Biotek).


## Results
A total of 3,200 transcripts with at least one read in the GenBank were identified using BLASTx analysis. We identified 2,613 (91.4%) transcripts with a single or multiple read in GenBank that were exclusive to any of the four types of transporters (Supplementary Table S1). Of these, 29 (3.3%) transcripts were found in both type I and type II transporters (Table 1). The remaining 29 transcripts were exclusive to the type I transporters, and 12 were exclusive to type II.

We compared the transcript abundance of each of the three types of transporters in terms of their expression patterns. We also compared their expression patterns with that of the P. chrysogenum type II transporters. While most of the P.


## Discussion
The results obtained in this study are summarized in Table 1 and Table S. The results of the studies cited above show that the rhizosphere microbial community is strongly influenced by the esters’ level of proteolytic activity. Both Esters and Glaciers are strongly induced by Esters, and both Esters and Glaciers are highly induced by RGF-Producing Glaciers. These results indicate that the esters’ level of proteolytic activity is highly influenced by the rhizosphere bacterial community. Moreover, these two esters also produce high quantities of FGF and can grow at high levels of proteolytic activity, which is consistent with the growth dynamics of rhizosphere microbes [20]. However, the total proteolytic activity of Esters is significantly lower than that of Glaciers. This result suggests that the rhizosphere bacterial community is influenced by the esters’ level of proteolytic activity. These results suggest that the rhizosphere microbial community is highly influenced by the rhizosphere esters’ level of proteolytic activity.

In this study, the levels of esters’ and Glaciers’ bacterial communities were highly induced by both Esters and RGF-Producing Glaciers. This suggests that the esters’ and Glaciers’ bacterial communities are heavily influenced by both Esters and RGF-Producers. This implies that the rhizosphere bacterial community is highly influenced by both Esters and RGF-Producers. These results suggest that the rhizosphere bacterial community is highly influenced by both Esters and RGF-Producers. However, the total proteolytic activity of Esters is significantly lower than that of Glaciers. This implies that the rhizosphere bacterial community is highly influenced by both Esters and RGF-Producers. This implies that the rhizosphere bacterial community is highly influenced by both Esters and RGF-Producers. Figure 1 shows the relative abundance of proline-producing Esters and Glaciers at the two esters’ and egl’s level. The total abundance of proline-producing Esters was significantly lower than that of Egl’s, and the total abundance of Glaciers was significantly higher than that of Egl’s.
