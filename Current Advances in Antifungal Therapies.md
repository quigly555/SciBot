## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous airborne fungal pathogen that causes an estimated 300,000 cases of mucormycosis globally per year [1]. The pathogen can be readily isolated from the air, soil, water, and various aquatic environments [2,3]. While most cases are asymptomatic, invasive aspergillosis (IA) can develop in immunocompromised patients, including those with hematologic malignancies, leukemia, AIDS, and solid organ transplant recipients.


## Methods
259-29.

The method has been previously applied for the treatment of patients with septic meningitis and the characterization of its pharmacokinetics. For that purpose, the mycelial plugs of various clinical strains were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and used to inoculate 1 × 10^6 conidia ml^-1.

The mycelial plugs were collected, followed by immediate homogenization with 0.1 ml of sterile 1% saponin solution. The solution was allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 400 g for 15 min to separate the mycelial plugs from the culture. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of sterile water. The mycelial plug was removed from the culture and adjusted to 1 × 10^7 conidia ml^-1. This method has been applied to evaluate the drug sensitivity of the drug-susceptible strains of Candida albicans, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis.

4.5. Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Methodology
The CLSI reference clinical laboratory was used for the determination of MIC values. The sub-MIC MIC test was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guideline [6].

The antifungal activity of each compound was evaluated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methodology for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). A 100 µl aliquot of the mycelial plugs, and the fungal inoculum in the medium and broth, was added to the 96-well microtiter plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of the fungus was considered as the MIC value.

4.6. MIC-Based Assay
The MIC of each compound was determined for the mycelial plugs according to the CLSI methodology [7]. A 100 µl aliquot of the mycelial plugs and the fungal inoculum in the medium and broth was then added to the 96-well microtiter plate and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The lowest concentration of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of the fungus was considered as the MIC value.

## Results
One of the most relevant studies of antimicrobial efficacy of the peptides is from the perspective of what is considered the most relevant model for antifungal drug developmen. In this study, the first peptide to be synthesized from a CYP gene (TDG_01755) was identified as the first peptide with an antifungal activity against C. albicans (MIC = 250 µg/ml) with IC_50 = 8.4 µg/ml. The addition of 80 µg/ml of EDTA (8 µg/ml) and MIC values of 8 µg/ml and 125 µg/ml of EDTA (80 µg/ml) respectively were used to select the peptides. Results showed that the peptides were active against C. albicans and MIC values were higher than those of the control peptides (Table 2).

The effects of different EDTA concentrations on the MIC values of the peptides are presented in Table 3. The peptides had MIC values of 25 µg/ml for C. albicans and 125 µg/ml for C. parapsilosis. The MIC values of the peptides were higher than those of the control peptides (Table 3).

The antifungal activity of the peptides was determined using a disk diffusion method and MIC values were determined by a disk diffusion assay. The disk diffusion assay was performed in real-time on the disk diffusion plate. The MIC values of the peptides were determined by the disk diffusion assay. The MIC values of the peptides were higher than those of the control peptides (Table 4).

Introduction: In this study we developed a new lipid-active inhibitor of Aspergillus and Pyricularia sp., and we found that it has broad-spectrum activity against different fungal pathogens. It has broad-spectrum activity against Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and dermatophytes.

Method: The Candida albicans complex was grown in vitro at 25°C with a nitrogen-limited medium. The yeast cells were cultured on a medium supplemented with glucose and acetate. The cells were incubated with glucose or acetate for 3 h and then the cells were transferred into culture plates (i.v.). The cells were analyzed for the growth and lipid accumulation in the presence of glucose, acetate, and nitrosative. The results were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are presented in Table 1.

Results: The results obtained were similar to those of previous studies in yeast with several metabolites with anti-Candida activity, such as the biosynthesis of glucose, acetate, and nitrosative [14], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. However, the results of the current study were different from those reported by Zhou et al. [25].

In the present study, the activity of the B. anthracis enzyme CYP3A5 was compared with the activity of the two metabolites (CYP3A5 and CYP3A6). The results showed that the B. anthracis enzyme CYP3A5 had a significant inhibition in C. albicans. It is worth noting that the present study is the first to report the activity of CYP3A5 in the inhibition of the Candida albicans.

The results of the present study showed that the B. anthracis enzyme CYP3A5 had a significant inhibition in the Penicillium marneffei. The B. anthracis enzyme CYP3A5 was able to inhibit the fungal growth in vivo. Therefore, this compound may have a broad spectrum activity against fungi.

In addition, the B. anthracis enzyme CYP3A6 was used as a standard to evaluate the activities of the two metabolites. The results showed that the B.
