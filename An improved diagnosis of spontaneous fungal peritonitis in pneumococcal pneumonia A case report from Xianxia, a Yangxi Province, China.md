## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts, including humans, as it competes with extracellular virulence in different biological niches. An understanding of molecular mechanisms that contribute to its pathogenesis remains a major challenge. Here we report the large-scale genome sequence of the Cryptococcus gattii C. gattii VGII strain. The highly repetitive genome was conserved in fungi, and its wide-spread genome-wide association (GWAS) revealed that this fungus is unique to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Genes conserved in C. gattii were enriched in virulence factors. These included the flavonoid biosynthetic genes (FAME1, FAME2, FAME3, FAME4, FAME5, and FAME6), which are all required for cryptococcal virulence. In contrast, gene families that are otherwise common in other fungi, such as the one in the Ascomycota, were enriched in virulence factors. These included the glyoxylate molybdate dehydrogenase (MoDHx), which catalyzes the formation of long long dioxygenases (long long dioxygenases (LdEs) [Cu2+] and Cu3-long LdEs [Fe2+] in Candida species]) and the manganese superoxide dismutases (MnSv1 and 2 in Cryptococcus spp.


## Introduction
The association between environmental exposure to toxins and nosocomial infections has been well-documented. Exposure to asbestos has been strongly associated with the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and is thought to be related to exposure to toxins that are either eliminated or latent (Smits et al., 2006). Other toxins that have been associated with high incidence and mortality in immunocompromised hosts include benzimidazoles, echinocandins, and chloramphenicol. Although these toxins may not be associated with severe underlying disease, they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increased morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and haematopoietic cancers.

In the U.S., the number of patients exposed to asbestos-contaminated building materials increased from 9,000 in 1991 to 27,700 in 1997, a 10-year increase (Wattan, 1999). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the number of asbestos-contaminated buildings increased by approximately 1.6 million cubic meters during this time period (Nunes et al., 1995). The number of asbestos-contaminated homes increased by 6.1 million in 2004, a 10-year increase (Liu et al., 2004). This increased exposure, combined with increased incidence and mortality in cancer patients with cancer-like disease, has led to increased concern over the potential presence of asbestos-contaminated buildings (Bovers et al., 2006).

Although some studies have described the association between exposure to asbestos and nosocomial infection (e.g., Babich et al., 2010; Baumgartner, 2012; DeLong et al., 2013), there has been no such study examining the relationship between exposure to asbestos and nosocomial infection. Indeed, no studies have examined the association between exposure to asbestos and nosocomial infection. In this study, we used several laboratory techniques to examine the association between exposure to asbestos and nosocomial infection.


## Methods

To confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia by direct histopathological diagnosis, the lungs were placed into polypropylene tube, aseptically washed with PBS, and fixed with formalin (.7% formaldehyde) for 4 h at room temperature. Then, the lungs were removed and placed in formalin. The mice were then divided into two groups. Group A received normal saline (0.85% NaCl), group B received 100 µg/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (PAA) and group C received 100 µg/mL gentamicin. The lungs were then fixed in paraffin, embedded in paraffin and processed in a tissue culture technique. The lung fragments were sectioned and sliced into 0.5 cm thick sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS). The lung sections were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

For histopathological evaluation, lung tissue was removed from the mice and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and processed in a tissue culture technique. The sections were then cut into 0.5 cm thick pieces and processed in a tissue culture technique. The lung tissues were then sectioned and sliced into 0.5 cm thick pieces and processed in a tissue culture technique. The sections were then treated with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

For histopathological evaluation, the lungs were dissected from mice and fixed in paraffin, sectioned and sectioned. Then, the sections were treated with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) and then were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott methenamine silver (GMS).

Examination of lung function
The mice were monitored daily for 5 days to check for lung function. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed and the lung tissues were removed and homogenized in sterile PBS. The lung tissue was then serially diluted and plated on YPD agar (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, and 2% w/v bactopeptone).


## Results
Cloning of the pyrG gene
The pyrG gene was obtained from a synthetic library from an industrial isolate (strain S288C) using the pyrG-GFP method [10]. The sequence of the pyrG gene was 798 bp in length and encoded an open reading frame of 240 bp. The pyrG gene was cloned into a pyrG-GFP promoter (using the GFP cassette), followed by transformation into the pyrG-H2O mutant (Fig 1). Two independent transformants were obtained by the same pyrG-GFP technique.


## Discussion
0 µg/m. In a retrospective study of 438 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia using FLG for treatment of tuberculosis, 65% (3/17) of cases had a FLG-based therapy with a MIC of =2.00 µg/mL [22]. Of the patients with spontaneous peritoneal peritonitis, 59% (5/10) had a FLG-based therapy with a MIC =2.00 µg/mL. Other reports showed that these patients with pneumococcal pneumonia received an antifungal therapy (FLG-based therapy) with MIC of =2.00 µg/mL [23, 24].

In this retrospective study, a novel “pulmonary” peritonitis was diagnosed in an HIV-uninfected patient. A newly diagnosed HIV-uninfected patient had a lung lesion with granulomatous inflammation in the right side of the lungs. This patient had been treated with a fungicidal antibiotic for pulmonary TB, but was subsequently diagnosed with TB based on the negative results. The patient had been on a prednisolone and dolutegative FLG for pulmonary TB, but his pulmonary TB had progressed to granulomatous inflammation and was negative. The patient was treated with FLG and a fungicidal antibiotic for pulmonary TB and was subsequently diagnosed with TB based on the positive results. The patient had been on a prednisolone and dolutegative FLG for pulmonary TB and was subsequently diagnosed with TB based on the negative results. The patient had been on a prednisolone and dolutegative FLG for pulmonary TB and was subsequently diagnosed with TB based on the positive results.
