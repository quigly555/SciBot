## Abstract
Our main finding was that IgG-treated patients had a decreased incidence of severe gastrointestinal signs and were more likely to have skin, mucosal, and haemorrhagic lesion. At the same time, the number of patients with persistent or more than one episode of severe mucosal, haemorrhagic, and skin manifestations were lower among IgG-treated patients. However, there was an increase in the number of patients with a history of receiving monotherapy for at least one year and the prevalence of the disease was 26.7% among IgG-treated patients and was 13.5% among IgG-treated patients. There was a significant increase in the number of patients with all-cause, mucosal, and haemorrhagic lesions and a decrease in the prevalence of these lesions among IgG-treated patients compared with IgG-treated patients. The level of the serum immunoglobulin (Ig)glucosidase (Ig)1, IgG-receptor (IgG1) 1, and IgG-receptor (IgG2c) antibodies in the serum of patients with mucosal or haemorrhagic lesions, as well as the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG2a) 1 and IgG-receptor (IgG2c) 1 antibodies in the haemorrhagic lesions and the skin, was 2.0 × 103,105 copies/mL (95% CI, 1.857 to 1.67) and 9.9 × 103,105 copies/mL (95% CI, 2.9 to 11.4), respectively. Overall, IgG-treated patients were more likely to have fever (IRR 1 = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.0) and a higher prevalence of skin, mucosal, and haemorrhagic lesions (IRR 1 = 2.8, 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.7).

Our results show that IgG4 has an important role in mediating the immune response to Coccidioides spp. and may play a role in the pathogenesis of these host infections. IgG4 may represent a new antifungal agent to be developed for the treatment of Coccidioides spp.

## Introduction
Medicinal plants have long been used in folk medicine for treating diseases and promoting health, as well as for the treatment of some other diseases. In the past, some plants, such as leaves, flowers, stems, and flowers of different plants, have been used to treat skin infections, wound infections, and for wound treatment. These plant extracts are generally effective in the treatment of the symptoms of skin infections, wound infections, and ocular infections. However, the use of plants for treating ocular diseases has been questioned and a number of botanists have suggested the removal of plant-derived products, such as epidermolytic enzymes, from the cosmetic market.

During the past two decades, several botanists have been trying to find new sources for the production of natural extracts. We have published a paper from a Brazilian botanist named Paolo Pavicini on the ethnopharmacological uses of artemisinin and artesunate for treating ocular infections [1].

Artemisinin (E.D. Gams) is a member of the plant epidermolytic class, and it is the second most common phytochemical extracted from artesunate and artemisinin [2]. In Brazil, artesunate and artesunate derivatives are used in cosmetic products for skin, hair, and nails [3]. Both artemisinin and artesunate are considered to be active agents, which may be harmful to the skin [4]. Another interesting study done by Pascals and Artesunari et al. [5] showed that artesunate is more effective than artesunate in the treatment of ocular infections caused by Acanthamoeba invadens, the causative agent of the yellow stripe ocular mycosis. The antidermolytic activity of artemisinin and artesunate has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [6]. The plant epidermolytic class is also found in various food-based preparations, such as tea, rice bran, and rice bran oil. The epidermolytic activity of artemisinin is also considered to be effective against ocular infections, such as in an experimental study [7].


## Methods
Briefly, after the animals were sacrificed, the gastrointestinal tracts were flushed with sterile PBS, and then they were placed on a sterile diethyl ether-fixed PBS containing .02% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Fungal suspensions were added to the lower abdomen and the animals were placed on the same diet, but without FBS (2% w/v) and without antibiotics. The gut contents were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After fixation, the specimens were placed in a fresh 0.9% w/v PBS-T solution.

The gastric secretion was obtained by lysing the stomach with sterile forceps and then measuring the secretion by using a standard curve of the same solution. The gastric secretion was expressed as the amount of mycelium per mg of mycelium per min of gastric secretion.

The serum was obtained by lysing the gastric secretion with sterile forceps and measuring the secretion by using a standard curve of the same solution. The serum was expressed as the amount of serum per mg of serum.

Cellulolytic activity
The cells were obtained by staining the cells with cellulose staining solution (Sigma) at the following concentrations: 1×10^5 cells/ml in PBS-T, 1×10^5 cells/ml in PBS-T, and 1×10^5 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium. The cells were seeded in 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, the medium was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS-T. The cells were then incubated with 0.2 µg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) for 24 h at 37°C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS-T, and the absorbance was measured with a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) at 570 nm. The control was also carried out in the absence of LPS. The cells were incubated with PBS-T.

The antifungal activity was also determined by measuring the extracellular enzyme activity (ECA) of the cell-free supernatant of the mice.


## Results
mellonell. In order to test this hypothesis, we incubated gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 antibody in the intestine of gavage-free (G+) human embryonic kidney (hPDK) mice for 72 h. The numbers of total intestinal inflammation were significantly increased in the gavage-free mice when compared to that in the G+ control (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemistry of the intestinal epithelium showed that both gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies had no detectable effect on intestinal inflammation in the gavage-free mice, indicating that the immunosuppressive properties of gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 were not protective in terms of both inflammation and control (data not shown).

In order to determine whether the negative effects of the IgG3 or IgG4 antibody on intestinal inflammation could be explained by the immune system of the gavage-free mice, we tested the effects of both antibodies on the peripheral immune responses. As shown in Figure 1B, the peripheral immune response of the gavage-free mice was similar to that of the G+ control mice, while the response of the gavage-free mice was significantly reduced compared to that in the G+ control mice. These results suggest that the immunosuppressive properties of the Gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies in the gavage-free mice were not protective in terms of both the immune system and the peripheral immune response.

Taken together, these results suggest that gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies protect G. mellonella from gastrointestinal inflammation in G. mellonella. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the immunosuppressive properties of gavage-free IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies could be due to the production of inflammatory mediators by G. mellonella. In this context, the lack of immune polarization and the reduction of intestinal inflammation in gavage-free mice may explain the lack of immunosuppressive effects in the gavage-free mice.

The negative effects of the IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies on G. mellonella were also determined by measuring intestinal permeabilization after treatment with 1.5 × 10^5 Tween 20. The results showed that both antibodies were effective in inducing intestinal permeabilization of G.


## Discussion
The IgG3 subclass was more prevalent in the Japanese population, and the IgG4 subclass was more prevalent in the Chinese populatio.

The resistance to infection by C. gattii, as well as the high prevalence of IgG4 and IgG1 in the Japanese population, suggest that IgG4 and IgG1 deficiency is an inherent clinical phenotype of the C. gattii strain.

Infections by other viruses have been reported in the immunocompromised population in the United States, and the prevalence of C. gattii-infected AIDS patients in the United States has been reported to be as high as 50% [11]. C. neoformans infection was observed in 44% of AIDS patients who had CD4 counts <100 cells/µL [12].

The prevalence of IgG1 deficiency was also reported in the HIV population in South Africa, where the prevalence of IgG1 deficiency was 3.7% [13]. The prevalence of IgG1 deficiency was significantly higher in the HIV population compared to the general population [14].

The high prevalence of IgG1 deficiency in the HIV population is a result of a bottleneck of IgG production in the region. The adaptation to the immune response to pathogens is initiated by the release of monocytes and monocytes from the blood to the phagosome, where they promote the synthesis of IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17 in the body, and play an important role in the defense against viruses [15]. The process of IgG1 production by macrophages has been reported to be dependent on the activation of CD4^+ T cells [16].

It has been reported that IgG3 deficiency may be a predisposing factor for opportunistic infections in immunocompetent patients [17]. IgG3 deficiency has been reported in the HIV population in India and in the Indian subcontinent [18]. In South Africa, the prevalence of IgG3 deficiency was reported to be 17% [19].

The overall prevalence of IgG3 deficiency in the general population was 1.3% in the AIDS population, and the prevalence was 9.2% in the HIV population. The prevalence was higher in the general population, and the prevalence was 4.8% in the HIV population. The prevalence in the general population was 15.
