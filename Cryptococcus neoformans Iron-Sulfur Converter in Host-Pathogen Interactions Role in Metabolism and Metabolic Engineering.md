## Introduction
Sphingolipids (SLs) are a class of lipids that have long been known to act as sphingolipids, acting as signaling molecules and mediating important cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, tumor progression, apoptosis, and growth inhibition [1,2]. The high abundance of SL in nature has led to the speculation that the SL components could play a role in diverse biological processes such as sphingolipid signaling, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and growth inhibition [3-6]. The sphingolipids are classified into more than 1000 different structures, including lipid and sterol groups, and are categorized according to their structural and functional characteristics: sterol, sphingolipids, sterol-interacting sphingolipids (SISPs), sterol-binding sphingolipids (SBPs), sphingolipids, and lipid groups. SLs are a group of lipids that contain a hydroxyl group and an acyl group in the sphingolipid backbone. SLs are hydroxylated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) at the interface of the two major molecular types of sterol-sensing proteins, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and cyclosine-1-phosphate (Cs1P). SLs are highly abundant in the environment, and include several plant pathogenic fungi, algae, and cyanobacteria (reviewed in [7]).

To date, there is no known functional role for SLs in the physiology of C. albicans or other fungi. Only an enzyme called S. cerevisiae <U+0394>sin^2, named Cs-SM, was found to participate in sphingolipid signaling [8]. In addition, it was found that the Cs-SM was able to downregulate the expression of many virulence-associated genes (e.g., [9]). In C. albicans, the <U+0394>sin^2 enzyme was found to act as a regulator of a diverse set of virulence-related genes (reviewed in [10]). In the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, the <U+0394>sin^2 enzyme is a member of the canonical family of sphingolipids and is involved in sphingolipid signaling [11].


## Methods
typhimurium to assess the potential role of the iron chelator RIF in the antimicrobial activity of . typhimurium. This is the approach used in our work, which was previously reported [21], [22]. We found that S. typhimurium alone was significantly more effective in inhibiting antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium compared to a combination of RIF (table 1). This suggests that, although the iron chelator RIF has the ability to inhibit S. typhimurium, it is also effective in the antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium.

The hypothesis that S. typhimurium has an inhibitory effect on the antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was tested using a previously described study of S. typhimurium against bacterial strains. In this study, S. typhimurium was used as a positive control (RIF) and S. typhimurium (RIF alone) as a negative control (RIF plus RIF). The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was detected against S. typhimurium. The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was also examined against human Candida spp. (Table 1). The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was also tested against human Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) and human Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus) [23], [24].

The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was also examined against human Candida spp. (Table 1). The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was also tested against human Candida albicans (Candida albicans) and human Candida tropicalis (Candida tropicalis) [25]. The antimicrobial activity of S. typhimurium was also examined against human Candida albicans and human Candida glabrata (Candida glabrata) [26], [27].

S. typhimurium is an antimicrobial molecule that is usually used in antimicrobial treatment [22], [28]. S. typhimurium has been shown to inhibit both bacterial and yeast growth [29]. S.


## Results
The above data show that when the FeS regulon was induced under iron-replete conditions (Supplementary Figure S1) the FeS regulon was highly activate. However, FeS regulon induction in iron-replete conditions (Supplementary Figure S2) is not surprising.

The FeS regulon is not essential for the iron-limited growth of H. capsulatum

Given that FeS regulons are essential for the growth of H. capsulatum, we next examined if the FeS regulon is also essential for the growth of H. capsulatum. First, we constructed strains expressing a constitutive FeS regulon and FeS regulon under iron-replete conditions, and found that FeS regulon induction was strongly activated in iron-replete conditions (Figure 4A). However, FeS regulon induction in iron-replete conditions was not strongly activated (Figure 4A). Thus, we found that FeS regulon induction is not essential for the growth of H. capsulatum.

To further explore the possibility that FeS regulons are not essential for iron-limited growth of H. capsulatum, we next determined the growth kinetics of H. capsulatum under iron-replete conditions and iron-limited conditions. We found that H. capsulatum was able to grow under iron-limited conditions in the presence of iron (Supplementary Figure S3). We also found that iron-limited conditions in the presence of FeS regulon, but not FeS regulon, strongly activated the growth kinetics of H. capsulatum.

Iron-limited conditions promote iron acquisition
The FeS regulon induction and the growth kinetics of H. capsulatum under iron-replete conditions were analyzed. Iron-limited conditions promoted FeS regulon induction, as evidenced by the induction of iron-consuming enzymes and iron-binding transcription factors (Figure 4B). Thus, the FeS regulon induction promoted FeS regulon growth under iron-limited conditions.


## Discussion
The Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phylotypes share the same siderophore, . johnsonii (S. johnsonii). In addition, the genus Trichosporon and Candida have two members of the genus, Trichosporon ciferrii (Candida ciferrii) and Trichosporon oryzae (Candida oryzae). The Phaffia species are known to produce siderophores, but the latter species are unable to do so in Aspergillus (Stuar et al. 2015). The most abundant Ascomycete species (A. fumigatus, Fusarium graminearum, Trichosporon spp., and T. rubrum) have also been detected in the gut and biofilm of human (Nakase et al. 2006). S. johnsonii and T. rubrum are the two species found to be highly abundant in biofilms and in fungi (Nakase et al. 2007, 2016). In addition, the siderophore-producing and pathogenic A. fumigatus, A. fumigatus-associated isolates, and A. niger have been reported to be highly abundant in the gut of humans and animals (Nakase et al. 2006). In this study, the fungal community structure in the gut of mice was different from that of the fungal community in the gut of mice. The gut microbiota of mice and humans differ substantially from each other, and this difference was not observed when the mice were treated with different treatments. In addition, the mice were treated with different treatments than the mice. These differences in the intestinal microbiota of mice and mice may reflect the different types of fungal communities in the gut of mice and humans, and the different functional roles of the microbiota in humans and mice. The fungal community structures in the gut of mice and humans differed significantly from that in mice. The overall bacterial communities in the gut were not different from those in mice. These results suggested that the gut microbiota in mice is different than in mice, and the gut microbiota of mice may be different from those of mice.
