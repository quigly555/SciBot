## Abstract
In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the periplasm signal transients (SrcPs) reside in the extracellular space rather than in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the yeast cells. To understand ER transport roles in the growth response and yeast-to-hypha transition, we rigorously link the evolution of SrcPs with the unfolded protein response (UPR), an epigenetic process that is encoded in many eukaryotic genomes but not usually observed in yeast. A key term for this regulatory process is the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR1 is the major PRF/NF-kB translocation motif in the BBB and UPR2 is the major UPR activity (YU) motif in the extracellular space (EV) of the yeast. UPR1 and UPR2 are transmembrane components of the cell wall that are recruited to sites of ER stress in S. cerevisiae after ER stress. This context is key for the ability of S.


## Introduction
The genus Fonsecaea includes approximately 10,000 species distributed worldwide. This genus was established by Steinbach (1941) to accommodate the species that are stipitate, with a pileus that is characterised by the absence of any appendages, and more commonly with filiform or olivaceous margin.

## Results
We observed no significant differences in transcript abundance of the SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 (SN3) and GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 4 (GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 4) gene products between wild-type and <U+0394>sid2 mutant (Supplementary Fig 1a), suggesting that both SN3 and GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 are functiona. Interestingly, we observed a clear shift in transcript abundance of the GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 4 (GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 4) gene product between wild-type and <U+0394>sid2 mutant, indicating that both SN3 and GAF-Protein-Mediated Receptor 4 are functional.

SN3 is important for yeast-to-hyphal transition in response to environmental cues
In the context of the phenotypic shift in transcript abundance of SN3 from S. cerevisiae and in the presence of stress, we observed that the transcript abundance of SN3 was stable during yeast-to-hyphal transition (Fig 5a). However, SN3 transcript abundance was elevated during yeast-to-hyphal transition in the <U+0394>sid2 mutant, suggesting that the SN3 gene is required for yeast-to-hyphal transition. The increased transcript abundance of SN3 in response to oxidative stress was previously shown to be associated with the transcript abundance of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (42). We observed that transcript abundance of SN3 was not significantly different between wild-type and <U+0394>sid2 mutant, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of SN3 by SN3 is independent of the environmental stress.

We next attempted to determine whether SN3 is a functional stress-responsive transcription factor. We found that the transcript abundance of SN3 in response to oxidative stress was increased in the <U+0394>sid2 mutant, indicating that the transcriptional response of SN3 is transcriptionally dependent. However, in response to stress, SN3 transcript abundance was elevated in the <U+0394>sid2 mutant (Fig 5b).


## Discussion
 2009; Tavares et a., 2012). In this study, the transcriptional upregulation of the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 in the wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae was greatly reduced, compared to the parental strain. However, in contrast to other studies (Zhang et al., 2010; Tavares et al., 2012), we found that the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 in S. cerevisiae is upregulated by flucytosine and itraconazole. In addition, the transcription of the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 was significantly upregulated by flucytosine and itraconazole. Interestingly, although the expression of the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 was downregulated in S. cerevisiae at 8 h post-treatment with flucytosine and itraconazole, it was upregulated by flucytosine and itraconazole and was upregulated by flucytosine. These results indicate that the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 is required for fungal pathogenicity during infection with S. cerevisiae.

Taken together, our data show that Sre1p is the key regulator of the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 in S. cerevisiae, and that upregulation of this regulator is likely to be a key factor in the fungus's successful infection of A. fumigatus. The expression of the a-amylase SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 is upregulated by flucytosine and itraconazole. In addition, SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 was upregulated by flucytosine and itraconazole, and SREBP-Protein-Mediated Receptor 3 was upregulated by itraconazole and itraconazole.
