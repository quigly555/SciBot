## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is a major opportunistic human pathogen that is capable of causing life-threatening infections called invasive mycosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that the plasma membrane oxygenase Hrd1, an essential protein of A. fumigatus, is essential to sense and respond to A. fumigatus conidia within the fungal phagosome. Hrd1 expression in the absence of Hrd1 in the fungal cell wall was significantly higher than the wild type strain. This was associated with a high expression of the transcriptional target genes Aspergillus nidulans and Fusarium solani. Hrd1 was also required for conidiation and virulence. Our findings demonstrate that Hrd1 is essential for conidia production, conidial phagosomal pH, and the ability of the conidia to adhere to surfaces. These results provide insight into the pathogenesis of invasive mycosis and new insight into the molecular mechanisms that control conidial adhesion to host cells.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals [1]. The disease occurs when C. neoformans or its environmental niche is inhaled into the lungs of an immunocompetent host. Individuals with an intact immune system are protected by the innate immune system. Cryptococcosis usually presents in immunocompromised patients, but it can also present in patients with no immunocompromise conditions or medical history. In most cases, C. neoformans infections are observed in patients with a normal immune system. However, in the rare event of a cryptococcal infection, the patient may present with a cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and the risk of severe disease progression is increased. The highest incidence of Cryptococcal disease is observed in developed countries, such as Europe, North America, and Asia.


## Methods
Reagents and Chemicals
All reagents used were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (USA). Human and mouse IgG1-a, IgG2a, IgG3a, IgG4, IgG5, and IgG7a were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Grunach, Germany). Mouse anti-a-tubulin (His-b) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Co. Co., USA) and rabbit IgG1ß (N418) were from E. coli (Sigma-Aldrich Co. Co., USA). Mouse IgG1ß (Sigma-Aldrich Co. Co., USA) was from E.


## Results

The effect of the CMCT probes on the capsule microbe
The effect of the CMCT probes on the growth of the capsule microbe was investigated by measuring the capsule polysaccharid. The CMCT probes were used to probe the cell wall microbe in the presence or absence of the CMCT probes and the results are presented in Table 4. The CMCT probes were the most sensitive to cell wall damaging agents and the inhibition was not specific for the CMCT probes tested. The inhibition was not due to the concentration of the CMCT probes tested. The tested probes had similar specificity for the cell wall microbe and no differences were found between the concentrations tested. The CMCT probes were more sensitive to the inhibition effect of the CMCT probes than the other test microbes.

## Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that patients with CM are at increased risk for co-morbidities, including HIV infection, co-morbidities that have a negative correlation to CD4+ cell count, and several organ systems including lymphoid organs. The findings in the present study are consistent with other studies that have shown the increased risk of HIV infection in patients with CM [3,5,7,8,9]. The present study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the study was performed retrospectively. It is possible that the results may not be representative of the general population. Second, we did not collect patients with CM from our study. This study is not intended to exclude those patients with CM because they were found to have CM at the time of their diagnosis. Third, the current study was a retrospective study and the results may not generalize to the general population. Therefore, future prospective studies of this study should include a larger number of patients. In addition, because of the retrospective nature of the study, we could not evaluate the effect of treatment. Finally, because of the small number of patients, the study was not designed to evaluate the impact of treatment.

In the present study, CM in the most commonly used antiretroviral therapy (ART) group was seen in the most patients, and this was likely due to the benefit of ART therapy. CM is more common in HIV-uninfected patients and this may be associated with the use of ART. However, in our study, the association between CM and ART therapy was not significant (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). It is possible that the results of the present study were influenced by the use of ART therapy and the underlying conditions.

In our study, we found a significant association between CM and CLL. Previous studies have demonstrated that CM is a common cause of death in HIV-uninfected patients, which may be related to the presence of CM [2,5,8,9]. Our study found that approximately one third of the patients were HIV-uninfected, and the reasons for this are unclear. In our study, the median duration of follow up was 3 years.
