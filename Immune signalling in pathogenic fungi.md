## Abstract
This paper presents the case of a 31-year-old man with AIDS, liver cirrhosis, acquired immune-mediated hypercoagulability, fibrosis, lymphoproliferation and hepatomegaly who developed pituitary adenocarcinoma and subsequently developed multiple glanders and a fibrosis. The clinical features and prognosis were favourable.

Non-fibrotic malignancies may present with pituitary adenocarcinoma and glanders, and may include neoplasia, endomyocarditis and/or pericarditis. Glanders and fibrosis are uncommon clinical features.

A 31-year-old HIV infected male patient with fibrotic malignancy, neoplastic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, fibrosis, lymphoproliferation and/or pericarditis presented to the rectal cytology. He subsequently developed multiple glanders and a fibrosis and was subsequently diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and fibrosis.


## Introduction
 2017. Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing anti-fungal drugs as therapeutic agents, either by treating or as alternative therapeutic agents (Kumar et al., 2015). A single molecule approach has the potential to achieve this goal, with the development of active compounds that are biologically inactive, and hence less likely to induce resistance (Kumar et al., 2015). The development of anti-fungal drugs through the combination of biological activities and pharmacological properties can be divided into two types of drugs: polymeric compounds that act as inhibitors and soluble compounds that exert inhibitory or inhibitory activities (Pfaller and Diekema, 2015). Polymeric compounds are synthesized by a hydroxyl group at the N-terminus and are composed of a hydroxyl group at the C-terminus and a glucose moiety at the C-terminus, and are insoluble in water and therefore, can be used as antifungal drugs (Grimaldi and Page, 2011). The mechanisms of action of polymeric compounds are still poorly understood, but some reports suggest that polymeric drugs act by disrupting the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the N- and C-terminal hydroxyl groups of the active moiety (Elin et al., 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2001).

Polymeric compounds can be synthesized by an endolytic enzyme, and thus, they are considered as candidates for drug target identification. Polymeric compounds can be active against a range of pathogenic fungi and bacteria, including many viruses and bacteria with antiviral, antibacterial and antitubercular activities (Snechtler and Klionsky, 2000; Festa and Lefebvre, 2003).

Several polymeric compounds (poly(amides, polysaccharides, and esters)): antifungal, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, and antifungal agents have been used to treat fungal infections (Kubai and Stephan, 1999; Stöcken et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008).


## Methods
The PCR amplification of a total of 1 µg of genomic DNA was used as templat. The PCR mixture containing 1 µL of genomic DNA, 1 µL of MgCl_2, 1 µL of PCR-grade water, and 0.2 µL of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as the template for PCR. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 µL containing 2.0 µL MgCl_2, 0.1 µL of template DNA, 1.0 µL of template DNA, 0.2 µL of each of the following primers: ncS-F: 5'-ATCCTCCGCCGATTTCCGATCC-3' (for ncS-P1) and 5'-CTCGAGCAGCGAGCTAGGGAC-3' (for ncS-P2); ncS-F: 5'-TGATCCAGTGACGATCCCCTG-3' (for ncS-P2) and 5'-GGCCAGGCTGCTCCGCC-3' (for ncS-P3). The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 µL containing 1.0 µL of template DNA, 1.0 µL of template DNA, 0.2 µL of each of the following primers: ncS-F: 5'-ATCCGCCGATCCGATCC-3' (for ncS-P1) and 5'-CTGCCATGCCAGCTAGGGAC-3' (for ncS-P2) [34]. The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 µL containing 1.0 µL of template DNA, 1.0 µL of template DNA, 0.2 µL of each of the following primers: ncS-F: 5'-CCCCACAGACGATCCG-3' (for ncS-P1) and 5'-CTGCCATGCCAGCTAGGGAC-3' (for ncS-P2). The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 µL containing 1.0 µL of template DNA, 1.0 µL of template DNA, 0.


## Results

The results of the proteomic analysis are in agreement with our previous results showing that . neoformans was able to increase the expression of several phytoalexins (e.g. phytoalexin A, phytoalexin B, phytoalexin C), but not to increase the expression of a phytoalexin inhibitor (e.g. phytoalexin D) or a phytoalexin inhibitor (e.g. phytoalexin E) [5], [18]. Thus, the increased expression of phytoalexins in C. neoformans may reflect a specific immune response of C. neoformans to a pathogen.

In contrast, in C. neoformans, a few phytoalexins, such as phytoalexin A, phytoalexin B, phytoalexin C, phytoalexin E, phytoalexin F and phytoalexin G, were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner [5], [18], [31], [32], [33]. Therefore, these results suggest that some phytoalexins may be involved in the immune response of C. neoformans to pathogen.

In addition, we observed that the expression of several phytoalexins, including phytoalexin A, phytoalexin B, phytoalexin C, phytoalexin D, phytoalexin E, phytoalexin F and phytoalexin G were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in a dose-dependent manner. This result indicates that some phytoalexins may be involved in the immune response to a pathogen.

Phytoalexin expression was enriched in the brain in C. neoformans

Our results suggest that a phytoalexin could be involved in the immune response of C. neoformans.


## Discussion
It has been reported that the immunogenic molecule, IL-17A, interferes with immune cell recognition of plant-pathogenic fungi [32], [33. IL-17A is a potent immunoregulatory molecule which can induce the production of IFN-<U+03B3> by Th1-type T cells [34]. IL-17A induces the production of IL-17A by the bone marrow of neutrophils and macrophages [35], [36]. IFN-<U+03B3> is a key cytokine in the innate immune response to T cell responses in several organisms, including macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils [37]. The ability of the human innate immune system to sense IL-17A production in T cells has been shown to be essential for their differentiation into Th1-type cells [38]. Therefore, the results obtained from the present study demonstrate that T cell responses are induced to IL-17A by the fungus. The data indicated that T cell responses are activated to IL-17A by the fungus. The IL-17A induced by the fungus is responsible for the T cell response. IL-17A is a potent immunoregulatory molecule which can induce the production of IL-17A by T cells [39]. The T cell response induced by IL-17A is critical for the protection against fungal infection [40]. In this study, the ability of the human T cell response to respond to the IL-17A response was studied. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was highly effective against the infection of C. neoformans. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality for the treatment of infections of the patients. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality for the treatment of systemic infections of C. neoformans. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality for the treatment of candidiasis. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality for the treatment of systemic infections of C. neoformans. The results indicated that the IL-17A produced by T cells was of the best quality for the treatment of infectious diseases.
