## Abstract
We investigated the contribution of fungal resistance to antifungal drugs in the survival of human neutrophils following the combination treatment of amphotericin B and flucytosine. We found that resistance to amphotericin B was mediated by members of the MUM1 gene family. MUM1 encodes a protein with a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The prolyl isoenzymes of M. gondii a- and ß-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMD) were produced by M. oryzae cells. Treatment of neutrophils with amphotericin B or flucytosine reduced the expression of MUM1, and loss of MUM1 expression was associated with decreased intracellular iron levels. Strikingly, treatment with flucytosine at low concentrations resulted in MUM1 protein accumulation in the intracellular pools of neutrophils. Collectively, these data suggest that the interaction between M. oryzae IPMD and antifungal drugs is fungicidal, and that intracellular iron may prevent its accumulation. Our data suggest that inhibition of M. oryzae IPMD by low concentrations of flucytosine may reduce the efficacy of the combination antifungal, and that the iron reductase inhibitor, itraconazole, may be more effective than flucytosine in inhibiting M. oryzae infection.


## Introduction
Worldwide, CMV infection causes approximately 1.5 million deaths each year, primarily among HIV-infected individuals [1, 2]. CMV infection can lead to life-threatening complications in patients with compromised immunity, and cryptococcal meningitis, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of all CMV-related deaths, has been associated with only modest clinical response [3, 4]. The progression of CMV infection depends on several factors, including host immune status, immunosuppressive drugs, patient demographics, and socioeconomic factors [5]. In HIV-infected individuals, cryptococcal meningitis is the most common manifestation, and mortality rates in these patients range between 10 and 90% [6].

Similar to CMV infection, cryptococcal infection can be induced by various immunosuppressive drugs, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and/or alemtuzumab, including rituximab, an immunosuppressive drug widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and refractory to systemic administration [7, 8]. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD4^+ T-cell lymphotropic protein 2 (L-clk2) and its target, the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which activates the immune response against the parasite by directly binding to the parasite surface [9]. This antibody binds to CD4 and has been shown to inhibit parasite replication [9-11].


## Methods
Fungal materials
Viridiplantae fischeri, F. galactifolia, F. solani, F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. pisum, F. circidiae, and F. sphaerospermum were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used without further purification.

Plant materials
To prepare the plant materials, the collected plant materials were surface-sterilized with 0.5% Tween 20 and then dried under sterile conditions at 40°C. The dried plant materials were then pressed into strips of potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 20°C for 7 days. For the surface-sterilization of the plant materials, the dried plant materials were then pressed into three-layer paper disks (Reeder Scientific, Cincinnati, OH) and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The disks were then placed on the surface of a 0.3% Tween 20 agar solution and incubated at 20°C for 7 days. After the dried plant materials were surface-sterilized, the disks were then dipped in a solution of a 1% sodium carbonate solution, 0.01% Tween 20 and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried disks were then dipped into a 1% Tween 80 solution and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas.


## Results
bombycis strain KN99. The phylogenetic tree showed that the strains were well separated from the other N. bombycis strains, suggesting that the strain may be a recent hybridization event. However, it is still unclear which N. bombycis strain is responsible for the recent hybridization events.

The N. bombycis strain KN99a is responsible for the B. subtilis hybridization event and the Japanese strain was found to be the most closely related to N. bombycis strain KN99a [24]. Based on the phylogenetic tree, the strains are genetically related to N. bombycis strain KN99a. However, based on the phylogenetic tree, it is unclear which N. bombycis strain is responsible for the B. subtilis hybridization event.

Phylogenetic Analysis of the N. bombycis Strain KN99a
Phylogenetic analysis of the N. bombycis strain KN99a revealed that the strains share high sequence similarity with the N. bombycis strain KN99a. The phylogenetic tree showed that the strains are genetically related to N. bombycis strain KN99a. However, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the strains are genetically related to the N. bombycis strain KN99a.

## Discussion
As a result, we investigated if this model would be suitable for the screening of chikungunya virus infectio.

First, we first tested whether the model would be suitable for screening of the infection in humans. We used two sets of data: the initial plasmid and the final allele from the plasmid. First, we used the plasmid from the plasmid from the human infection model. Then we tested whether the model would be suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans.

We found that the model was suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. In addition, the model was also suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. Second, we used the plasmid from the plasmid from the infected patient. However, we found that the model was not suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. Third, we used the plasmid from the infected patient. We found that the model was not suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans.

The results shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 show that, for both infection models, the plasmid from the patient was suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. However, for the infection with the plasma membrane-depleted vector, the plasmid from the patient was not suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. However, the plasmid from the patient was suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans.

The results shown in Figure 2 show that the plasmid from the patient is a good model for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. However, the plasmid from the patient was not suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans.

We also tested whether the plasmid from the patient was suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans. However, the plasmid from the patient was not suitable for screening of Chikungunya virus infection in humans.
