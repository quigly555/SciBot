## Abstract
Thymol salvaged from fungal hyphae is a very interesting and promising material for biotechnological applications. This material is mainly composed of phenolic compounds, such as a-pinene, and methyl jasmonate. In this study, we analyzed phenolic compounds isolated from fungi collected from different parts of the world and evaluated their cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Phenolic compounds were assessed by elemental chromatography and elemental voltammetry. The results showed that the crude extract from the cultures of cultures of C.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients in the intensive care units (ICU) of ICU departments. In the context of prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), invasive fungal infections are one of the major sources of morbidity and mortality in ICU. The type of ICU and the duration of admission to the ICU are important in determining the rate of mortality. Currently, the most common species involved in IFI are Candida and Cryptococcus species, but other species are also commonly isolated. In this review, we will focus on the antifungal agents available for the treatment of IFI, with special emphasis on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) guidelines. We will also examine the potential for therapeutic interventions to be used in the future to improve the effectiveness of current antifungal drugs.


## Methods
Yeast strains were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 37°C for 24 h, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PB. Bacterial cultures were prepared by inoculating 1 × 10^7 conidia in 50 µl of PBS, followed by incubation at 37°C for 18 h. Bacterial suspensions were prepared in sterile PBS. All cultures were incubated at 37°C with shaking.

Antifungal Activity of Berberia reesei Essential Oil in Combination with Isocoumarin Derivative Activity
The antifungal activity of Berberia reesei essential oil in combination with Isocoumarin Derivative Activity was assessed in the evaluation of antibacterial activity of essential oil. The antifungal activity of Berberia reesei essential oil was determined with the microdilution method as described by Almeida et al. [44] and Márquez-Ortega et al. [45]. Briefly, the essential oil was diluted to a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) in sterile PBS. The diluted essential oil was subjected to a 10-min incubation at 37°C, followed by the addition of 10 µl of sterile water, and then further incubated at 37°C with agitation.

Antifungal Activity of Berberia reesei Essential Oil in Combination with Isocoumarin Derivative Activity
The antifungal activity of Berberia reesei essential oil in combination with Isocoumarin Derivative Activity was assessed in the evaluation of antifungal activity of the essential oil. The antifungal activity of Berberia reesei essential oil in combination with Isocoumarin Derivative Activity was determined by the bioassay method as described by Márquez-Ortega et al. [45]. Briefly, the essential oil was diluted to a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) in sterile PBS. The diluted essential oil was subjected to a 10-min incubation at 37°C, followed by the addition of 10 µl of 0.1% BSA in PBS, and then further incubated at 37°C for 30 min.


## Results
hepatica

Berberia reesei has been reported to be a potential antifungal agent against . hepatica [1]. We evaluated the antifungal activity of Berberia reesei against M. hepatica by using standard antifungal drugs for different treatments. The antifungal activity of Berberia reesei against M. hepatica was dose dependent, ranging from 0.25 to 3.0 mg/mL (Table 2).

Berberia reesei Botanical Garden M. hepatica Essential Oil Extract
Berberia reesei is known to be a plant pathogen. The essential oil of Berberia reesei is well established for its antifungal activity against M. hepatica and several fungi [1,7]. We tested the antifungal activity of the B. reesei Botanical Garden M. hepatica Essential Oil against M. hepatica using the standard antifungal drug azithromycin, which was shown to be effective against M. hepatica. The B. reesei Botanical Garden M. hepatica Essential Oil has a MIC of 0.25 mg/mL against M. hepatica and it was effective against the other fungi.

Berberia reesei Essential Oil (Table 2) was tested against M. hepatica in combination with azithromycin (Table 3). The concentration of the drug required to inhibit M. hepatica was 3.0 mg/mL. Berberia reesei Botanical Garden M. hepatica Essential Oil showed antifungal activity against M. hepatica with MIC values of 0.25 mg/mL for Berberia reesei Botanical Garden M. hepatica, and 0.25 mg/mL for the other fungi.

Berberia reesei Essential Oil (Table 3) was tested against M. hepatica in combination with clotrimazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin B, and fluconazole (Table 3). The concentration of the drug required to inhibit M. hepatica was 3.5 mg/mL.

The B. reesei Essential Oil (Table 3) showed antifungal activity against M. hepatica with MIC values of 0.
