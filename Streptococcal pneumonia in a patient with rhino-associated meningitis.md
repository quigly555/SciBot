## Abstract
Infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and fungi are common to all animals, but research on the pathogenesis of invasive diseases is largely confined to humans. This limited research arsenal, coupled with the increasing complexity of pathogens, undermines the scientific resolve to identify novel pathogens. Many viruses and bacteria are known to be able to evade the host immune response, often leading to the death of infected individuals. However, few viruses and bacteria have been studied in detail to begin to understand the mechanisms of their virulence.


## Introduction
The incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically in the past few decades. With the growing number of immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, patients with chronic diseases and in intensive care units, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections has also increased (Hardoim et al., 2009). The emergence of fungal infections as opportunistic pathogens has significantly reduced the incidence of fungal diseases in the past few decades. This is partly due to the reduction of the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections in general, and in particular those caused by Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Pneumocystis spp. The latter species have been found to be responsible for more than 90% of all fungal infections, and the majority of these infections are caused by C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei (Routal et al., 2012; Sampaio and Pivkin, 2013; da Silva et al., 2013; da Silva et al., 2015).

Candida albicans is a normal commensal microorganism of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (Ganja et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2015), and is the most common etiologic agent of candidiasis (Li et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015). It is also the most common species isolated from patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia (Toledo et al., 2011; deWalick et al., 2012; da Silva et al., 2015). Although the incidence of candidiasis has increased, the mortality rate remains relatively low. This may be due to the fact that the immunocompromised patient population is under immunosuppressed and is likely to experience other complications such as chronic diseases, autoimmune conditions, and cancers (Zalar et al., 2009; Zalar et al., 2011).

Currently, treatment of candidiasis is primarily achieved using azoles such as itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, and isavuconazole (Chen et al., 2012).


## Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. In order to evaluate the effect of different strains on the virulence of S. sclerotiorum, we used S. sclerotiorum wild-type strain KG168 [11] and the mutant strain, S. cerevisiae with a deletion of the cps1 gene [12]. The experimental design was as follows: S. sclerotiorum strain was inoculated in potato dextrose broth (PDB) and incubated at 37°C for 1 day. The number of CFUs/ml was determined using a spectrophotometric method (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). The inoculated liquid medium was used as a control. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

ROS was determined in the cell line RAW 264.7 (ATCC BAA-747) and its positive control, RPS (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The experimental design was as follows: RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 4×10^6 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plate and grown for 48 h at 37°C in an orbital shaker. Then, they were used as control. For the determination of ROS production, the cells were cultured in a 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at 37°C in an orbital shaker for 48 h. After this period, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000× g for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was removed and the cells were adjusted to 10^6 cells/ml. A 100 µl of PBS containing 1 mM EDTA was added and the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in an orbital shaker.


## Results
 2018) is consistent with the emergence of other opportunistic pathogens in this population including Rhinospora sp. and Rhinospora spp. (Deighton et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016). We identified 4 cases of human rhinosinusitis (3/11 with C. albicans) and 3 cases of human rhinosinusitis (1/11 with C. albicans and 1/11 with C. albicans), in which two patients were infected with rhinosinusitis.

The clinical presentations of the four patients with systemic candidiasis were typical for those with disseminated candidiasis. In 2 patients, a case of systemic candidiasis was recorded; in 1 patient, a case of systemic candidiasis was reported. In 2 patients, a case of systemic candidiasis was reported; in 1 patient, a case of systemic candidiasis was reported. Of the 5 patients with cryptococcosis, 1 patient had a cryptococcosis, whereas 1 patient had a cryptococcosis. Two patients had disseminated cryptococcosis, and 1 patient had disseminated cryptococcosis. No cases were reported for a cryptococcosis in any of the 4 patients with systemic candidiasis.

In all cases, the clinical features of the patients were typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, with normal skin lesions typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, and the main cause of disease was C. albicans. In the case of disseminated candidiasis, the clinical features were typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, with normal skin lesions typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, and the main cause of disease was C. albicans.

A total of 7 patients with systemic candidiasis were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis (Table 3). The median age of these patients was 40 years (range 5-62 years). The clinical presentation of the patients was typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, with normal skin lesions typical of those with disseminated candidiasis, and the main cause of disease was C. albicans. In the case of disseminated candidiasis, the clinical features were typical for those with disseminated candidiasis, with normal skin lesions typical of those with disseminated candidiasis, and the main cause of disease was C. albicans.


## Discussion

While the absolute incidence of CD4 T cell depletion in the lungs of children is not known, it is known that CD4 T cell depletion is an important risk factor for lymphopenia and lymphopenia in immunocompetent children [14. The incidence of CD4 T cell depletion is also associated with susceptibility to pneumocystis pneumonia in children [15].

While CD4 T cell depletion is not uncommon, it has been reported in a cohort of patients with severe disseminated HCC [16], and in a cohort of children with HIV infection [17].

While CD4 T cell depletion is an important risk factor for a number of infections, the exact mechanism of CD4 T cell depletion is unclear. While CD4 T cell depletion is associated with increased susceptibility to infections with C. neoformans [18], it is also an important risk factor for pneumocystis pneumonia and meningitis in immunocompetent children [19].

Since CD4 T cell depletion is associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, it is possible that CD4 T cell depletion plays a role in the induction of a host immune response that could eventually lead to CD4 T cell depletion [20].

The protective role of CD4 T cells against pneumocystis pneumonia has been demonstrated in a CD4 T cell depletion study by Soriani et al. [21]. However, CD4 T cell depletion did not have any protective effects on C. neoformans pulmonary infection [22].

Our results suggest that CD4 T cell depletion in children with pneumocystis pneumonia could be associated with a protective role for CD4 T cells in the protection against pneumocystis pneumonia. While CD4 T cell depletion did not have a protective role in the protective role for C. neoformans, the protective role of CD4 T cells against pneumocystis pneumonia in children with pneumocystis pneumonia has been demonstrated in a CD4 T cell depletion study by Soriani et al. [21].

The lack of protective CD4 T cell depletion in children with pneumocystis pneumonia has been demonstrated in a CD4 T cell depletion study by Soriani et al. [21]. In the same study, CD4 T cell depletion did not have a protective protective role for pneumocystis pneumonia in children with pneumocystis pneumonia.
