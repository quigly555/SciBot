## Abstract
A genome-scale model of the Pezizomycotina fungi is presented. The results are compared with a set of previously published Pezizomycotina species and their genomes to see which species are the most successful in the Pezizomycotina genus. The species richness is examined by the comparison of genome sizes of other Pezizomycotina genera. The results of the present study provide the most complete and detailed analysis of the genome of the Pezizomycotina genus in Pezizomycotina. This allows the comparison of the number and structure of genes, for instance, of the two main lineages, Pezizomycotina rhamnosperma and Pezizomycotina curvata, and also of the different genera, Pezizomycotina demati and Pezizomycotina aspera. The results are of interest to researchers and clinicians who aim to model the biology of fungal genomes and compare the efficiency of genome modifications to other fungal species, the same as for other fungi.

The network inference method in R (http://www.random.ac.uk/nginx/res/19.htm) is used. It attempts to reconcile the results of the model with the information of the fungal genome. It can be applied to the Pezizomycotina species, which are of particular interest.

In order to understand the impact of the model of Pezizomycotina, the aim of this research is to simulate the expression of genes, when different fungal species are present in the same environment, using a model of a single fungus. It can be used for research or it can be used for comparisons. The aim is to suggest a protocol for the prediction of gene expression profiles when different fungal species are present in the same environment.

## Introduction
2016)

The cost of the use of chemical antifungal agents for prophylactic or therapeutic use is rising (Michel et a. 2015), but there is still much to be done in order to improve the current antifungal options and the development of new antifungal drugs. The current antifungal drugs have a much lower toxicity than those used in clinical use, and can be used in a few cases, even with the high mortality rates (Kampaloli et al. 2015). These advantages make the development of new drugs a big challenge, particularly with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens, which were previously only found in the terpenoids. As a result, drug development is hampered. The antifungal agent development programs of the World Health Organization (WHO) have pointed out that new antifungal agents need to be developed in a reasonable, safe, and cost-effective cost-benefit-based manner (Moreau et al. 2017).

The search for new antimicrobial drugs is a continuous process, and the research on antimicrobial agents is of increasing relevance for the development of antimicrobial therapies (Kripalu et al. 2017). Recent studies suggest that the ability of different species of fungi to produce substances with antimicrobial properties is intimately linked to their virulence properties (Bodenius et al. 2014; Zuniga et al. 2015; Delgado-Silva et al. 2015). In this context, the ability of fungi to produce bioactive molecules with antimicrobial properties is a major concern. As a consequence, a number of new antifungal agents have been developed and are being tested in the clinic. Among these, azoles are one of the most common agents used in the treatment of fungal infections (Casas et al. 2015; Zaragoza et al. 2016), while polyenes like voriconazole (VORI) and isavuconazole (IAV) have been shown to have a better activity against Aspergillus spp. than against other fungi (Halleen et al. 2013; Frases et al. 2014). The main barrier to such new antifungal agents is the high cost of the existing antifungals, which are expected to rise significantly in the future (Halleen et al.


## Methods

The costs and benefits of comprehensive chemotherapy are based on the assumption that a specific strategy can reduce the cost of an existing drug by 80% compared to the total cos. An overview of the costs and benefits of comprehensive chemotherapy is provided in the Figure 2.

All results were obtained from the perspective of a researcher who was conducting research with patients who were admitted to the hospital due to pneumonia and with positive cultures. All samples were collected in two time points, in the hospital ward and in the outpatient department. All patients were screened for malignancies, as well as for liver cirrhosis and cirrhosis with pulmonary disease, as negative controls.

For the hospital treatment, we used a general hospital bedside blood study conducted in the hospital. We examined the outcome of the patient’s condition at each time point, and the percentage of patients who survived. We used the overall hospital survival rate at each time point as a proxy for the rate of change in the patient’s condition over time. In the outpatient department, we studied the number of days of hospital stay, and the number of days of outpatient follow-up (hpr) at each time point.

The study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Medicine Institutional Review Board and the hospital’s Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Wisconsin Medicine School of Medicine, Milwaukee Healthcare System, and the University of Wisconsin Hospitals.

Analysis of costs and benefits
All research costs and benefits were included in the final analysis, as this study was not based on a single-agent method and therefore was not a placebo-controlled trial.

As the costs and benefits of comprehensive chemotherapy have been reported in previous articles, we aimed to provide a comparative comparison of the costs and benefits of comprehensive chemotherapy with a focus on the costs and benefits of short- and long-term strategies. In brief, we used the total costs and benefits of comprehensive chemotherapy in order to compare costs and benefits of antibacterial and antiviral drugs.

Among the four antibiotics tested, one is considered as essential for bacterial or fungal infection, and one as a non-essential antibiotic, in this study.


## Results
albicans and . albicans-infected mice, we found that most of the small RNA gene expression in C. albicans-infected mice was not detected in the lung or brain. We also found that the small RNA gene expression in C. albicans-infected mice was low and was not detected in the brains of any mice, suggesting that the treatment of C. albicans with chemotherapeutic agents is an effective way to eradicate the pathogen.

Microbiome-Based Comparisons of Chemotherapy-Related Genes
The differences in the gene expression in C. albicans-infected and C. albicans-infected mice were compared using a modified mouse model. The chemotherapeutic drug regimen was determined for each mouse. At the end of the first week of the experiment, mice were sacrificed and the brains were taken. At the end of the experiment, all of the mice were sacrificed and brains were taken, but the brains were not taken because the mice were not alive at the end of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, no mice were found dead after 24 hours.

To analyze the gene expression differences between C. albicans-infected and C. albicans-infected mice, we compared the gene expression in the lungs and brain of each mouse during the course of the experiment. After 24 hours of the experiment, all of the mice were sacrificed and brains were taken. At the end of the experiment, the lungs were harvested and brains were taken.

The gene expression changes between C. albicans-infected and C. albicans-infected mice were analyzed. We found that the gene expression changes in the lungs of C. albicans-infected mice were not significantly different from those in the brains of C. albicans-infected mice. This finding was not surprising because the brains of C. albicans-infected mice showed a high degree of decay and no visible signs of disease. However, the brain of C. albicans-infected mice was more significantly affected than those of C. albicans-infected mice.

To understand the significance of the gene expression differences in the lungs and brain, we compared the gene expression in the lungs and brain of C. albicans-infected and C. albicans-infected mice.


## Discussion
In this section we discuss the cost-effectiveness of a microbial chemotherapeutic agent in the era of combinatory use and their potential use in the era of high-efficiency Bacteroidetes chemotherapeutic therap.

The application of microbiallytic Bacteroides sp. as Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria is of great interest for combinatory use in the era of combinatory use. These Bacteroides can degrade and digest Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria and therefore can be used in chemotherapy. However, Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria are generally resistant to antimicrobial agents and exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. Thus, in the era of combinatory use, these bacteria are in a very low cost. This is in contrast to Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria. In addition, these bacteria are not susceptible to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, a combination of these two methods is recommended for the treatment of invasive fungal infections [26].

The optimal number of bacteria in the chemotherapy samples was determined by the treatment of the selected tumor samples by Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The most efficient treatments were achieved by Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria with the lowest values of toxicity and efficacy. This is due to the fact that these bacteria are widely used in cancer chemotherapy, and due to the fact that they are also frequently used in other cancer types such as metastasis and in chronic liver disease. Furthermore, these bacteria can also produce inhibitors to some molecules, which leads to the decrease in their potency and efficacy, and this also decreases the survival of these bacteria.

The Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria exhibited significantly increased toxicity in the chemotherapy samples, which were attributed to the presence of this bacterium. This result is in accordance with other studies, which showed that the Bacteroides-toxin-producing bacteria can produce inhibitors to some molecules, such as anti-asperguloneutral antibodies [27], anti-tumorin G-ß-2, anti-tumorin G-ß-1, and anti-tumorin G-ß-1, and this also affects the survival of these bacteria [28].
