## Abstract
The morphological features of the . curvatus genes, including those encoding the fission endonuclease, are similar to those of yeast, suggesting that the molecular characteristics of the fission endonuclease might be a bottleneck limiting its applications in modern medicine. We found no evidence that the C. curvatus genes are homologous to fungi, and the pathogenicity genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are homologous to that of Saccharomyces fragis. We propose that the evolutionary fate of these features impacts the evolution of C. curvatus as a fungal-human pathogen. These results provide the most detailed genetic map currently known for the evolutionary trajectory of this host-pathogen interaction.

Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus is a black yeast that infects piglets and humans. It can be seen worldwide as the primary vector ofropfibrinolysis that causesropfibrinolysis in some parts of the world. We studied the gene content of cutaneotrichosporon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sequencing the 18S rRNA gene of cutaneotrichospor (Cut) species, and found that 10 of 14 genes were homologous to the homologs of other cutanaceous fungi. Most of the genes were conserved in cutaneotrichosporon and S. cerevisiae, while others were differentially regulated in cutaneotrichospor (Cut) and S. pelliculosa. The abundance of the genes that were functionally homologous to the homologs of other cutanaceous fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were significantly altered in cutaneotrichosporon, and the genes that were functionally homologous to other cutanaceous fungal taxa, such as Rhodotorula, were also altered in cutaneotrichosporon. The ability of cutaneotrichosporon to penetrate superficial tissue and to form biofilm on contact with human keratinocytes was determined by measuring the expression of the Fc<U+03B3>-Dys-ATPase and Fc<U+03B3>-Dys-GTPase genes. The regulation of these genes in turn were employed to examine their physical differences among the genes coding for those enzymes.


## Introduction
2015. The manuscript is well written, the conclusions are supported by the evidence, and the manuscript is currently undergoing revisions.

Major points:

- Major points:

- New Figure 6: Comparison of Cryptococcus curvatus genome sequences of C. curvatus (COP1, COP2, and COP3) in two independent laboratories reveals a high variability of the species (GenBank accession numbers GenBank: A. Saito and M. Hirooka, 2009; MycoBank; http://www.myco.org/corp/).

- New Figure 8: Comparison of C. curvatus genome sequences with those of another representative species, C. curvatus var. neoformans (COP1), reveals a high degree of conservation of the species. However, the species display significant divergence from other recognized species. This contrasts with C. curvatus, which contains only a few species (C. neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii). The divergence is comparable to that of C. albicans, which contains only C. neoformans and C. glabrata.

Reviewer #3:

The authors of this work have written a very interesting and comprehensive review of the taxonomic, clinical, and microbiological diversity of C. curvatus. The work builds on an extensive recent effort of several unnamed scientists to perform a systematic analysis of this species, which is based on combined taxonomic, genomic, molecular, epidemiologic, and clinical data. The analysis clearly characterizes this species, which has been considered as an important pathogen since the mid-1900s (Stover et al. 2001).

The authors critically evaluated the available literature and, in particular, compared the available literature on the topic to those of other well-known, well-studied species such as A. niger, A. oryzae, and A. nidulans, all of which contain a clear and consistent collection of isolates. They also compared the available literature to those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, A. cerevisiae, and A. nidulans, which contain a collection of distinct and potentially cryptic species, which were reported as important and emerging threats to agriculture and wildlife (DeMunyon et al. 2014; Cantucci et al. 2014).

## Results
The distribution of putative functions in the identified genes was plotted as a function of the number of read. The enrichment of GO terms associated with cellular component (cellular process), molecular function (cellular component development), biological process (biological process) and cellular component (cellular component transport and secretion) in the genome is illustrated in Figure 4. A significant enrichment was observed in biological process in comparison to other terms. GO term “cellular component development” was found to be significantly enriched in the genome of D. melanogaster. GO term “cellular component transport and secretion” was found to be significantly enriched in the genome of D. melanogaster. GO term “cellular component development” was also significantly enriched in the genome of D. melanogaster. The GO terms “cellular component transport and secretion” and “cellular component life cycle” were significantly enriched in the genome of D. melanogaster. GO term “cellular component life cycle” was found to be significantly enriched in the genome of D. melanogaster.

A summary of the available sequence data of D. melanogaster is shown in Figure 5. There were only 2 ORFs identified in the D. melanogaster genome. A total of 9 ORFs (1.5%) were unique to D. melanogaster and were identified in the genome of D. melanogaster. The sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis of the D. melanogaster genome. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the concatenated alignment of the complete gene loci. The tree showed that D. melanogaster is the most closely related species of the five sequenced fungal species.

The D. melanogaster genome encodes a gene-rich proteome
To analyze the genome of D. melanogaster, the D. melanogaster genome was subjected to multiple gene expression profiling. To do this, a comprehensive set of 2994 predicted proteins of D. melanogaster were amplified and sequenced. From these, approximately 95% of the proteins had at least one predicted protein of D. melanogaster. The remaining 98% had less than two predicted proteins from the D. melanogaster proteome. The percentage of proteins with at least one predicted protein in D. melanogaster is shown in Figure 6.


## Discussion
This study is the first to show that cutaneotrichosis is a novel disease in the subarachnoid spac.

The Histoplasma capsulatum strain DSM 101046 (former) was collected from a contaminated drinking water reservoir at a point in the South Pacific Ocean where exposure to an unidentified chemical agent has been reported [15]. The strain was subsequently transferred to a marine mammal host and was subsequently recovered from the corals of a large group of corals. These samples are collected from dead, decaying sea grass and marine mammals.

The four marine mammal species described as “lower extremities” were also detected in this study. Most of them were identified as “lower extremites” and were also observed to be present in other species, such as “serine fishes and corals” [16]. The marine mammals were primarily sterile, however, some were observed to be colonizing dead sea grasses. These marine mammals could be a source of viable microbes during the infection process, or they could be infected by marine mammals and/or their hosts. The detection of the marine mammals was also confirmed by detection of a single strain in a marine mammal host (Nelsonia gigantea). The marine mammals could be pathogens due to the absence of human colonization of the marine environment.

Cerebrospores are produced in most species of cutaneum (Zambellomyces, Chaetomium, Entomocarpa, Malassezia, Neofusicoccum, and Rhizophydium), but their production is usually restricted to sexual reproduction [17]. It is also known that cutaneum is a facultative sexual organism [18]. There are no two species of cutaneum, however, there are two distinct species of cutaneum, namely, Cutaneopsis sp. and Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus. It is thus possible that the two species are closely related and that they have a sexual cycle. Further investigation is needed to determine the ecological niches of these two species.

The presence of killer toxin (Knockout) was observed in both clinical and environmental samples (Figure 1), indicating that this toxin might be produced by the host. The presence of killer toxin (Knockout) is also consistent with the absence of killer toxin (Knockout) in marine mammals.
