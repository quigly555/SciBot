## Abstract
The alternative splicing (AS) network is a network of RNAi (homologous integration) between heterologous and complementizing RNAi. AS circuits coordinate gene expression, exposure of alternative splicing, transcription, and assembly of mother-tongue. AS circuits also control metabolism, stress, and virulence of the mother-tongue. The alternative splicing and AS assembly pathways are highly conserved in eukaryotes. In other eukaryotes, these pathways are integrated into individual gene families, which might lead to genome-wide changes in gene expression.

Here we present the first eukaryote AS assembly pathway in which homologous and complementing RNAi are integrated into the genome. The AS genes in the eukaryotes were assembled into homologous clusters using a combination of homology-based homology-evolution methods. Analyses confirmed the homology of the most ancestral AS family in the eukaryotes, and provided a molecular key to the eukaryote's AS function.


## Introduction
The Fungi with Different Pathogenetic Habitats (FungiHOMos) database is a comprehensive fungal genomic resource that catalogs genomes from around 10 genera and 10 families, which is an active effort in genome sequencin. The FungiHOMos database has been used for comparative genomics of a wide range of fungi and the classification of these fungi has been used in numerous studies. The FungiHOMos database is a collection of fungal genomes from around 10 genera and 10 families, which has been used for comparative genomics of a wide range of fungi and the comparison of the two genomes has been used to classify and confirm the phylogenetic position of Trichosanthes species and other Trichosanthes spp.

The FungiHOMos database contains 16 genomes and is the largest and most comprehensive fungal genome repository. The genomes of Trichosanthes are generally presented in Table 1. The genomes of Trichosanthes are organized in four main compilations: A, B, C, D, and E. Each compilation includes the following data: the genus, species, and genotype of all known species; their phylogenetic position; their gene content; and the total genome space.

The FungiHOMos database includes many species of the genus Trichosanthes and the six new genera, including T. asahinai, T. clavatus, T. domercalli, T. eucalypti, T. laxx, and T. flavescens (www.fungi.org). A few species of the new genera have been reported in other fungal species databases, such as the CT. Flavescens database and CT. Arminidae (www.ct.org). The genomes of T. flavescens, T. laxx, and T. flavescens are available at http://www.flav.net/.

Genome analysis of the Trichosanthes genus revealed a highly conserved sequence among the genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of sexual reproduction. The sequences of several genes involved in sexual reproduction were found conserved.


## Methods
MIA was performed using a single-point dilution method in a 96-well plate, which was done with the antibiotic free DMSO solution (100 µg/ml) to which the strains were subjecte. Each well was inoculated with 1×10^6 conidia/ml, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The growth of the test strains was monitored at the end of the incubation. The results are shown as the average values.

Microbial bioactivity and evaluation of antimicrobial compounds
MIA assays were performed in triplicate, and the biofilm activity was expressed as a percentage of the control, which was expressed as a percentage of the test strain that showed no biofilm [34].

2.3. 2.4. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activities of a variety of antibiotics were determined using the protocol proposed by Ligthwaite et al. [35]. A total of 10 µg of each antibiotic was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline, and the solution was heated to 100°C for 5 min. The solution was then diluted with sterile 0.9% saline to obtain a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. The solution was incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then it was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was diluted with 0.9% saline to obtain a final concentration of 0.3 µg/ml. The procedure was repeated three times.

2.4. 2.5. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activities of a variety of antibiotics were determined using the method proposed by Bajwaite et al. [36]. A total of 10 µg of each antibiotic was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline, and the solution was heated to 100°C for 5 min. The solution was then diluted with 0.9% saline to obtain a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. The solution was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, then the supernatant was removed and the supernatant was discarded. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded.


## Results
A total of 42 different Ascomycota were identifie. The Basidiomycota were mostly distributed in the soil-fungus-fungus complex (Fig 1). The Basidiomycota were more abundant in the wheat leaf spot than in other plants (Fig 2). The Glomeromycota were the dominant fungal genera in the wheat leaf spot. The Ascomycota were present in all the samples except for the Wheat Stripe Leaf Spot, which was found in all the samples except the wheat seed.

## Discussion
We also used proteomic analysis to compare the transcriptomes of the infected and non-infected stripe, and to compare the transcriptome of the non-infected stripe and the infected on. A total of 10,714,624 predicted protein coding genes were identified, which are classified into 93 categories, with the average size of each category being about 60% of the total number of proteins. The total number of protein coding genes was smaller than that of the non-infected stripe, with 5,753,325 proteins compared to 1,078,330 of the infected stripe. In addition, the total number of protein coding genes in the non-infected stripe was smaller than that of the infected stripe, with 2,967,775 compared to 1,860,085 of the infected stripe. In addition, the number of protein coding genes in the non-infected stripe was smaller than that of the infected stripe, with 2,452,767 compared to 1,972,769 of the infected stripe.

These results suggest that Ste12 plays a role in the infection of the wheat stripe by the pathogen. Ste12 homologs are found in all of the genomes of the two species. In addition, these homologs are present in the transcriptome of the non-infected stripe and the infected stripe, which are in close proximity to each other, but in different degrees of similarity. This is a strong indication that Ste12 is important for pathogenicity of the stripe. Furthermore, the expression of Ste12 was increased in the non-infected stripe, suggesting that Ste12 plays a role in pathogenicity of the non-infected stripe.

Transcriptome Analysis of the Infected and Non-infected Wheat Stripe Stripe
To examine the relationship between Ste12 and the pathogenicity of the wheat stripe, we compared the transcriptome of the infected and non-infected stripe, and to compare the transcriptome of the infected stripe with that of the non-infected stripe, we searched the genome of the non-infected stripe. A total of 6,947,356 genes were identified, which are classified into 33 groups, and the average size of these groups was about 70% of the total number of proteins.
