## Abstract

Method.


## Introduction
The increased use of invasive devices in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major cause of patient mortality and morbidity in the critically ill (1). The presence of anti-MS antibodies has been reported in the clinical specimens of patients with MS (2). Other cases were reported in patients with other forms of immunosuppression, such as cancer patients, and the antibody prevalence was rarely reported. It is known that MS patients with low levels of circulating anti-MS antibodies may be at a higher risk of developing serious complications, such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), than patients with normal levels of anti-MS antibodies (3).


## Methods
albicans in vivo and in vitr. Thirty-five Thymus strains were cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB) media and incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. The fungi were harvested from the colony and suspended in sterile PBS. The cultures were diluted to the desired density (10^6 CFU/ml) and added to fresh LB media. The suspension was then poured into an orbital shaker (200 rpm) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted and the pellet was resuspended in PBS. The suspension was then filtered through a 0.22 µm nylon filter to remove any fungal particles and stored at -80 °C for subsequent experiments.

For S. cerevisiae, a non-template control was used (Figure 1). Briefly, the yeast cells were cultured in YPD broth at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 18 h. The cell concentration was adjusted to 2 × 10^6 cells/ml with sterile PBS. S. cerevisiae was then cultured in YPD broth at 30 °C for 3 days with shaking at 200 rpm. The cell culture was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The S. cerevisiae cells were then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in PBS.

In vivo evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of cAMP and AMP
The in vivo antimicrobial activity of cAMP and AMP was evaluated using the Aspergillus S. cerevisiae strain MU402 (AFS-79-1, CEA01; control strain) as previously described [24]. Briefly, the yeast cells were cultured in YPD broth at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 18 h. The culture was then pelleted, and the cell culture was pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The suspension was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The suspension was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The suspension was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The suspension was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS. The suspension was then pelleted, and the suspension was then resuspended in sterile PBS.


## Results
We found that inflammatory cells were hyper-inflammatory in the lungs of the infected Taqueria subhashii isolates compared to the control (Figure 4. The inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of the Taqueria subhashii isolates were consistent with the published data (Figure 4).

The T. rubrum T. rubrum infection induced rapid changes in immune responses and expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, including monocyte chemoattractants, neutrophils, eosinophils, and caspase-3, as well as anti-oxidant chemokines such as interferon-induced chemokines. In addition, many anti-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-2, interleukin-1ß, and interleukin-6, were down-regulated in the lungs of infected T. rubrum-infected Taqueria subhashii isolates compared to the control (Figure 5). In contrast, in the lungs of the control Taqueria subhashii isolates the majority of inflammatory mediators were up-regulated (Figure 5). The observed change in anti-inflammatory mediators could be explained by the increase in inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of the Taqueria subhashii isolates compared to the control. Moreover, the interleukin-2/interleukin-6 (IL-2) and monocyte chemoattractant/monocyte chemoattractant (MCC) genes were increased in the lungs of the Taqueria subhashii isolates compared to the control (Figure 5).

In addition, the inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of the Taqueria subhashii isolates were consistent with the published data (Figure 5).

The results of the T. rubrum T. rubrum infection induced an increase in IL-2 production by isolated pulmonary epithelial cells compared to the control (Figure 6). In contrast, the IL-2 production by pulmonary epithelial cells was reduced in the lungs of the Taqueria subhashii isolates compared to the control (Figure 6).

## Discussion

The results presented here provided a first look at the presence of the biofilm on the two strains of Taqueria antigens in the clinical sample.

The biofilm of the human strain was found to be highly biofilm-active, with an approximately 20-fold increase in biofilm formation compared to the other strains. The biofilm of the isolate of the human strain was the only strain, in which the biofilm formed by the human strain was not observed. This suggests that the biofilm formed by the human strain could be a result of AMB exposure.

The biofilm of the parasite was observed to be non-remodel with an increase in the number of cells in the medium. The amount of cells in the biofilm was not significantly different from the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm.

The biofilm of the human strain was also not observed. The amount of cells in the biofilm was significantly different from the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm. The amount of cells in the biofilm was approximately 8-fold higher than that of the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm. The biofilm of the parasite was also significantly higher than that of the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm.

The biofilm of the parasite was significantly lower than that of the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm. The biofilm of the parasite was also significantly higher than that of the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm.

The biofilm of the human strain was not significantly different from the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm. The biofilm of the human strain was not significantly different from that of the other strains, which could be due to the fact that the parasite itself was not actively growing in the biofilm.
