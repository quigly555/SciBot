## Abstract
The dematiaceous cycle is characterized by the accumulation of hydrolytic enzymes in the female reproductive tract. The canonical dematiaceous cycle involves two evolutionary processes: 1) the transition from the prolyl/hemogallin/glucose-to-membrane oxygen in the female reproductive tract to the formation of a new enzyme cofactor in the progeny hemoglobin; and 2) the formation of a new enzyme from the hemagglutinin in the progeny hemoglobin. Synthetic amino acids have been identified as key catalytic residues in the hemagglutinin cycle. Studies of the evolution of amino acids in the hemagglutinin cycle led to the identification of a new, essential amino acid in the corresponding protein of G. mellonella. Review of amino acids in the 14S rRNA gene was expanded to include their function in the formation of the new hemagglutinin cycle.


## Introduction
The genus of the Staphylococcus genus includes a large group of Gram-negative bacteria that cause skin infections ranging from cutaneous infections to life-threatening infections in humans and animals. S. spp. are common in the environment and are estimated to cause approximately 1,300,000 annual deaths worldwide [1, 2]. S. spp. are able to colonize different body sites and can cause severe infections that can be fatal [3]. Staphylococci are widely distributed in the world, and some strains are responsible for a wide range of diseases ranging from superficial skin lesions to life-threatening infections [4, 5]. Staphylococci are also known to be pathogenic to humans, and the most common strains causing infections in the upper respiratory tract and skin are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The most common fungal species causing infections in humans are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Other important opportunistic fungal pathogens include Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii.

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are caused by opportunistic fungi such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and dimorphic fungi like Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Sporothrix schenkii.


## Methods
neoformans va. neoformans, and the differentially expressed genes of C. gattii in response to different stresses (1). For each strain and condition tested, samples were prepared for analysis using a sucrose solution and centrifuged at 3000× g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3000× g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at -80°C until use.

Genes with differentially expressed genes were selected based on the number of proteins that had a P-value less than 0.01 in at least one sample. To determine the P-value of the supernatant, the number of proteins that had a P-value greater than 0.01 in at least one sample was subtracted from the total number of proteins in that sample. To determine the P-value of the supernatant, the number of proteins that had a P-value greater than 0.01 in at least one sample was subtracted from the total number of proteins in that sample.

C. gattii conidia were obtained from the fungal mycelium of C. gattii strain SC5314 by growing on Sabouraud dextrose (SD) agar plates at 30°C for 4 days. The conidia were harvested by filtration through cheesecloth and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) (5 ml of sterile distilled water). The conidia were harvested by inoculating a loopful of conidial suspension onto the center of a sterile plastic petri dish and incubating at 30°C for 4 days. The fungal mycelium was harvested by filtration through cheesecloth and washed twice with PBS. The conidial number was counted using a hemocytometer.

Treatment with 2-Phenanthroline and 4-Phenanthroline
To test the ability of the different solutions to inhibit C. gattii growth, the different solutions with different concentrations of 2-Phenanthroline and 4-Phenanthroline were compared with the control without the drugs, and the treatment was performed with the same concentrations.


## Results
neoforman. We first investigated the expression of the genes regulated by nutrient-replete conditions in C. neoformans, and then found that the transcript levels of the genes regulated by nutrient starvation (Fig 2A) were elevated in all strains (Fig 2B). In contrast, the transcript levels of genes regulated by nutrient-rich conditions were similar in all strains (Fig 2C), which could reflect that nutrient-rich conditions are not limiting for C. neoformans. Thus, in C. neoformans, nutrient-replete conditions may be limiting to the development of pathogenesis.

In the presence of high concentrations of caffeine, the expression of a transcription factor (Hep-3) was reduced in the strains that were grown under nutrient-rich conditions, while the expression of a transcription factor (Ap-4) was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-poor conditions (Fig 2D). In contrast, the expression of a transcription factor (Aka-2) was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-poor conditions, while the expression of a transcription factor (Ap-2) was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-rich conditions. We further found that the expression of the transcription factor Hap-3 was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-poor conditions, but the expression of a transcription factor (Ap-1) was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-rich conditions (Fig 2E). These results suggested that nutrient starvation may be limiting for C. neoformans.

C. neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen for the human pathogen WNV, and its pathogenesis is characterized by virulence as well as in pathogenesis-related host infections (16). We investigated the transcription of genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans in a growth-associated, model of systemic infection. We observed that the transcription of Hap-3 was increased in all strains and the transcription of a transcription factor (Ap-4) was increased in all strains that were grown under nutrient-rich conditions. The expression of a transcription factor (Ap-2) was increased in the strains that were grown under nutrient-rich conditions (Fig 2F).


## Discussion
mellonella larva is a unique invertebrate model that has been used for detailed investigations into molecular biology of a large number of fung. In addition, it has been used to study the pathogenesis and development of pathogenic fungi, such as C. albicans, C. neoformans, and C. gattii [14], [15], [16]. In addition, the larval development of this model is dependent on the type of insect the host has, such as the insect and the insect's strength of feeding [17], [18]. It is also important to study the interaction of the host with fungi because of the beneficial effects of insect-fungal interaction [19], [20]. In addition, the larvae of G. mellonella are also used to study the immune responses of the host, because the larvae have an ideal prey and an optimal habitat [21], [22]. Therefore, larval development in this model is dependent on the type of insect that the host has. The larvae are fed on the sugar cane by the G. mellonella larvae and this occurs for a short time period. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on sugar cane fruits and vegetables. In the course of this experiment, the G. mellonella larvae have been fed a short time period, which also coincides with the feeding. This period is called the feeding period. After the first feeding period, the larvae enter the larvae' larvae and they experience some degree of fungal growth, which they can then kill by the insect. This fungus is then used by the larvae to acquire nutrients and sustain the larvae.
