## Abstract
Bacterial meningitis is a serious complication of adult onset pediatric patients. Delayed diagnosis, poor therapeutic outcomes, and increased risk of infectious complications are typical clinical features of adult acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) syndrome. A clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the role of protective immunity in disease control efforts is required to improve treatment and control of bacterial and fungal infections.

A retrospective study was conducted among female pediatric patients with a CD4 cell count of 123 cells/µL and a viral load of 35 copies/mL from C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates from the University of Washington (UW) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Laboratory Service (LINE-1) clinical trial sites. Clinical records were abstracted and analyzed. Data were analyzed using Epi-info ( FORMAT), which allowed for summary analysis. The primary outcome was the CD4 cell count and counts at admission. Secondary outcomes were the counts and/or levels of the following at discharge: hemoglobin, urinary protein, bacterial loads, or CSF at presentation.

among 121 women with CD4 cell counts of 123 cells/µL and 35 copies/mL, 97.4% (89.4%) were infected with C. neoformans, and 98.3% (87.7%) had received antifungal treatment. Among persons with CD4 cell counts of 200 cells/µL, 86.8% (85.8%) had received a first-line treatment for C. neoformans. Among persons with CD4 cell counts of 350 cells/µL, 72.1% (83.9%) received a first-line treatment for C. gattii. In all, 345/102 were treated with antifungal drugs and 534/102 received at least one regimen of antifungal treatment.

Patients with CD4 counts of 200-300 cells/µL who were uninfected after C. neoformans infection are at a higher risk for C.


## Introduction
The genus Hydnodontaceae is comprised of 8 genera, with one species (H. ovoides, O. thailandensis) and one epitype (H. graminis, O. ovoides) representing temperate distributions of the genera Hydnodonta and Hydnodonta.


## Methods
Bacterial inocula were prepared by inoculating one individual into a sterile tissue culture well and incubating at 37°C for 16 hour. Tissues were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then homogenized by using a cell disruptor (ZB-Cell, Marienfeld, Germany) in order to avoid bacterial contamination. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and stored at -20°C. The bacterial concentration in the supernatant was determined using a microplate reader (Infinite M200, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The sample was diluted 1:10 in PBS and plated on SDA to determine the colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of cell mass (g ml^-1) of the inoculum. The results were expressed as the mean of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

DNA Extraction
DNA was extracted from mice tissue using a protocol previously described (15). Briefly, mice were suspended in PBS and an equal volume of sterile PBS was added. After homogenization with a cell disruptor (ZB-Cell, Marienfeld, Germany), the tissue was removed and the pellet was suspended in sterile PBS. Then, the tissue was removed from the cell suspension by washing the tissue in PBS. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and stored at -20°C. The DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Molecular Detection of P. brasiliensis
Mice were used in the present study as the control for the detection of the P. brasiliensis spore suspension. The mouse cell suspensions were prepared by mixing a cell suspension with PBS, a cell suspension of 0.5 ml per mouse, and a cell suspension of 1 ml of PBS.


## Results
cruzi infection model has been shown to induce cell death [9, 16. To investigate whether T. cruzi infection could induce cell death, we monitored cell death in yeast cells in the lung using the Trichothecene-expressing or the T. cruzi-infected C. neoformans strain. Following 2 h of T. cruzi infection, 2.5% of the cells died within the first 24 h and the death rate was higher in the T. cruzi-infected C. neoformans strain (Figure 3(a)). At the same time, 4.2% of the cells died within 24 h of T. cruzi infection and 4.2% of the cells died within 24 h of T. cruzi infection. At the same time point, the death rate was higher in the T. cruzi-infected C. neoformans strain (Figure 3(b)). These data indicated that T. cruzi infection induced cell death in C. neoformans, as well as in C. neoformans strain, but not in C. albicans or C. glabrata.

To confirm the toxicity of T. cruzi infection to C. neoformans, we tested the survival of wild-type C. neoformans cells in the presence of T. cruzi in the presence of DTT. After 24 h, the survival rate of wild-type C. neoformans cells was 7.3% (5/13). Similarly, the survival rate of wild-type C. neoformans cells in the presence of T. cruzi in the presence of DTT was 8.6% (5/13). In the absence of DTT, the survival rate of wild-type C. neoformans cells was 5.9% (4/13).

T. cruzi Infection induces Cell Death and Metabolic Changes in Sterol Membrane Regulator
To investigate whether T. cruzi infection could induce cell death or metabolic changes in steroid-induced MAPK phosphorylation, we monitored cell death and metabolic changes in the steroid-induced MAPK phosphorylation in C. neoformans and C. albicans using the three-dimensional (3D) MAPK phosphorylation system. We monitored the phosphorylation of several MAPK phosphorylation motifs of the C.


## Discussion
fumigatus infection, ATP-Protein Kinase C was overexpressed in the host C57BL/6 mice and used for ATP citrate synthase-induced changes in the hos. In the wild-type mice, ATP citrate synthase-induced changes in the host mice were significantly greater than those of the wild-type mice (Figures 3 and 4B). The increased ATP citrate synthase-induced changes in the host mice did not affect the expression of the host marker of ATP citrate synthase (PAS) as well as that of the activator of ATP citrate synthase C (ATG) (Figure 5). However, ATP citrate synthase-induced changes in the host mice were significantly greater than those of ATP citrate synthase-induced changes in the wild-type mice. These results suggested that ATP citrate synthase is important for inducing a response that was similar to that of a previous study (28).

In order to identify ATP-Protein Kinase C-dependent kinase activities, knockout mice were infected with A. fumigatus strain BPS21/6 and the wild-type mice were infected with the knockout mice. In the infected wild-type mice, ATP-Protein Kinase C-dependent kinase activity was increased significantly in the infected wild-type mice compared to the infected wild-type mice (Figures 6A,B and Supplementary Table S7). In the infected wild-type mice, the ATP-Protein Kinase C-dependent kinase activity was increased significantly in the infected wild-type mice compared to the infected wild-type mice (Figures 6A,B and Supplementary Table S7). In addition, the ATP-Protein Kinase C-dependent kinase activity was increased in the infected wild-type mice compared to the infected wild-type mice (Figure 6B). The ATP-Protein Kinase C-dependent kinase activity was also increased in the infected wild-type mice compared to the infected wild-type mice (Figure 6C). These results suggested that ATP-Protein Kinase C is important for inducing the host-pathogen interactions between A. fumigatus and the host.
