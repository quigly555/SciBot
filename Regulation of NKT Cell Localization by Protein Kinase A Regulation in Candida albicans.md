## Abstract
Aflatoxins, endogenous mycotoxins, and “tween-a-monooxins” are the primary contributor to the emergence and spread of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI). Candida albicans is considered to be one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens. In this study, we identified and characterised aflatoxin-producing genes in the genomes of C. albicans and investigated their roles in biofilm development.

Biosignments of aflatoxins in the genome of C. albicans were characterized by the use of a plating method and gene expression analysis using RNA-seq.

The genome of C. albicans contains numerous putative primary/secondary metabolites. The expression of many putative secondary metabolites is induced and upregulated in response to biotic/microbial invasion. Afloxins are the most abundant aflatoxin species in fungal species genomes and are found in aflatoxins from the ascomycete, Aspergillus niger. In this study, we found that the aflatoxin biosynthetic gene HBSI1 was essential for aflatoxin production. We discovered that this gene is not only essential for aflatoxin production but also associated with biofilm formation.

The genome of C. albicans contains several putative secondary metabolites.


## Introduction
Neuropsychiatric diseases, such as frontotemporal degeneration and frontotemporal non-fluent aphasia, are caused by the loss of the control of the executive functions of the brain. In addition, the presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is a form of neuropsychiatric disease with a range of clinical features that include cognitive decline, hallucinations, delusions and other forms of language impairment. The disorder is characterized by the loss of the executive functions of the brain. The disorder is characterized by the loss of the executive functions of the brain. The disease is often characterized by aphasia and loss of the language and visual skills. The disease can develop from multiple presentations that may differ in age and genetics. Several sclerosis patients have a low frontal cortical tauroencephalin level, while others have a high frontal tauroencephalin level. There is a strong association between the brain dysfunction of MS patients and the frontal taurosis and Lewy body formation. The disease is characterized by the loss of the language and visual skills. The disease is characterized by the loss of the language and visual skills. The disease is often characterized by the loss of language and visual skills. The disease is often characterized by Lewy body syndrome (WMS), which is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. The disease can be characterized by the brain dysfunction of MS patients and the brain dysfunction of patients with WMS. The disease is frequently characterized by WMS, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder. The disease is often characterized by the brain dysfunction of patients with WMS. The disease can also be defined as a subacute or chronic disease. The disease can be characterized by the brain dysfunction of patients with WMS and the brain dysfunction of patients with WMS.


## Methods
They were washed three times with PBS and counted with a Neubauer chambe. Then, yeast cells (5 × 10^4) were cultured in a total volume of 200 µl of YPD medium, and then, the number of NKT cells was determined by plating the cells on YPD agar plates. After incubation, the number of NKT cells was determined at 37°C, 5% CO_2, and using a Neubauer chamber. To determine the relative expression of the transcription factor, the number of NKT cells was normalized to the total number of cells in a given volume of medium, and the mean value of the three replicates was calculated. The relative expression of the transcription factor was calculated by comparing the number of NKT cells in a given volume of medium to that of the total number of cells in the same volume of medium. The relative expression of the transcription factor in the control group was calculated by using the following formula:

Fluorescence Microscopy
To observe the expression of the fluorescent protein FLU, yeast cells (5 × 10^5) were cultured in YPD medium at 30°C. The culture was then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. Then, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and blocked with PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the cells were incubated with the fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were stained with an anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Kew, U.K.) diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The fluorescence was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioscope 1.4.1 microscope. The fluorescence was read at excitation and emission wavelengths of 520 nm and 590 nm, respectively. The different levels of FLU were determined by comparison of the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 nm and 590 nm, respectively.

Virulence Assay
The virulence of the strains was assessed using a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [21] as previously described [28].


## Results
albicans, the NKT cell line is involved in the maintenance of the normal immune response in the environment, which can be used to target drug therapy [16. In the present study, we found that C. albicans NKT cell is a target of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA pathway in vitro, as well as in our microarray experiments (Fig 4A and B). The results of C. albicans protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA pathway in vitro experiments are in agreement with the findings described in the literature [16]. As a result of the PKA pathway, the NKT cell phenotype could be defined as either a normal immune response or a combination of normal immune response. In the present study, we found that both of these conditions were achieved by the addition of 1 M of the PKA pathway inhibitor, a MgCl_2 concentration of 10 µg/ml, to the culture medium of C. albicans. This concentration of MgCl_2 is considered to be the optimal concentration of PKA inhibitor for C. albicans in the context of the human PKA pathway, as well as for C. albicans in the context of human PKA pathway [16]. The PKA pathway of C. albicans in vitro experiments were found to be highly conserved in C. albicans, suggesting that the PKA pathway may be unique to C. albicans, as observed in the microarray experiments. However, the PKA pathway of C. albicans is not found in fungi, suggesting that the PKA pathway may be unique to C. albicans. Moreover, we found that the addition of 1 M of the PKA pathway inhibitor, a MgCl_2 concentration of 10 µg/ml, did not significantly affect the viability of the yeast cells, confirming that PKA pathway was not involved in the yeast cell viability under the experimental conditions.

PKA pathway in vivo studies
To investigate the interaction of PKA pathway with the PKT cell line, the cells were treated with a PKA inhibitor, 1 M of MgCl_2, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 µg/ml for 3 h, in the presence of 10 µg/ml of the PKA inhibitor. The results of the experiments are shown in Fig 5. In the presence of 10 µg/ml of PKA inhibitor, C.


## Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a . albicans cell-to-cell contact-dependent transcriptional response to protein kinase A and regulation of NKT Cell Localization by protein kinase A. In addition, this study is the first report of a C. albicans cell-to-cell contact-dependent transcriptional response to cell surface protein kinase A. Our findings have revealed that C. albicans has a unique mechanism by which NKT Cell Localization is regulated by protein kinase A. In addition, we have shown that C. albicans responds to cell surface protein kinase A by increasing the expression of the <U+0394>gclA and <U+0394>gclB genes. The cell surface protein kinases are known to be regulated by protein kinase A (24). Our finding that C. albicans responds to cell surface protein kinase A by increasing the expression of the <U+0394>gclA and <U+0394>gclB genes, which is consistent with a transcriptional activation of the NKT Cell Localization pathway, suggests that C. albicans is an interesting candidate for further studies in studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell contact-dependent transcriptional regulation of NKT Cell Localization.

C. albicans cell surface protein kinases are modulators of the cell surface, and the protein kinases are essential for cell wall integrity (34). These cell surface proteins are involved in the integrity of the cell wall and their involvement in the pathogenicity of C. albicans has been shown in various cell types (17). We found that the cell surface protein kinase A (gclA) and NKT Cell Localization (ntsC) induced by cell surface protein kinase A (cspA) was upregulated in the presence of C. albicans. The C. albicans cell surface protein kinase A (gclA) is a key regulator of cell wall integrity, and the NKT Cell Localization (ntsC) was also upregulated in the presence of C. albicans. This study showed that NKT Cell Localization was modulated by cell surface protein kinase A (CspA) and that cell surface protein kinase A (cspB) was upregulated in the presence of C. albicans. These findings indicate that C.
