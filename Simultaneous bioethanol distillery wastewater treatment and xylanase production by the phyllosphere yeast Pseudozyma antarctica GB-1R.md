## Abstract
Human and plant-derived nanoparticles (NPs) and NPs/silver nanoparticles (NP-NPs) were produced using a combination of chemistry and Nanotechnology that was developed to the highest standard of quality. The following review is given: Effects of silver nanoparticles (NP-NPs) on plant growth, antioxidant activity, and cell-wall structure. Effects of NP-NPs on the actin cytoskeleton, actin structure, and antioxidant activity were evaluated. In particular, the NP-NPs showed remarkable enhancement in the activity of the polypeptides C6, C8, and C13, affecting them to reduce the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and the actin polarity. Silver nanoparticles were also able to increase the surface area of endoplasmic reticulum and tumor necrosis factor alpha (ER-Tu) in plants, and in plants’ secreted effect was also enhanced. Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum of NPs and NP-NPs was found to be significantly expanded compared to the plants’ secreted content. The results of this review indicated that the endoplasmic reticulum of NP-NPs might be a potential source of new bioactive NPs.


## Introduction
 .E. Curtis (Aldeb.) K.E. Kwon, and bioethanol in soil microorganisms [6,7].

An important part of the success of P. antarctica is the production of bioethanol using non-conventional wastewater treatment systems. However, bioethanol requires a significant amount of organic matter (e.g., organic catechin, polyethylene, and other) to be functional, and it requires high amounts of organic carbon (e.g., organic carbon and organic nitrogen) to support its growth. Bioethanol production has to be facilitated by the complex organic matter (e.g., mixtures of organic catechin, polyethylene, and other) present in the wastewater, especially in the form of organic matter. The increasing use of wastewater treatment systems (such as wastewater treatment systems in solar farms, bioremediation, and wastewater treatment plants) has reduced the amount of organic matter present in the wastewater. This has resulted in a reduction in the amount of organic carbon (e.g., organic catechin and polyethylene) in the wastewater. The optimization of the environmental conditions to improve the productivity of bioethanol from wastewater to microbial biomass has also led to a decrease in the amounts of organic carbon (e.g., organic catechin and polyethylene) in the wastewater. In addition, the utilization of organic carbon is important for the production of bioethanol from wastewater. In order to improve the productivity of bioethanol from wastewater to microbial biomass, the utilization of organic carbon as a carbon source has to be optimized.


## Methods
 2012) were used as negative control. The samples were dried in a Clevenger-type apparatus (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin, Franklin, USA) and diluted to 1.0 McFarland standard (0.2 McFarland standards). A volume of 5 µL of diluted sample was applied to each well of a 96-well plate. The OD_600 of the test solution was measured using a spectrophotometer (Megafuge 4100 Ultra, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA).

Chemical analysis of P. antarctica bioethanol
The synthetic peptone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was used as the standard in all the experiments except for the assay of bioethanol production. The samples were prepared as previously described in the text. The crude peptone extract (0.15% v/v) was prepared by dissolving the peptone in a solution of 20% (v/v) formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and then the crude extract was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator at a speed of 10 kV. The crude peptone was dissolved in 40% (v/v) formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and then added to each well. The test solution (0.2% v/v) was then added to each well of a 96-well plate. The absorbance of the test solution (0.2% v/v) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Megafuge 4100 Ultra, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) and the final extract was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. The absorbance of the control (non-treated sample) (no bioethanol) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Megafuge 4100 Ultra, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) and the final extract was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. The amount of bioethanol required for each treatment was calculated using the following formula: % of bioethanol required (extracted sample) = (total amount of bioethanol in treated wells/total amount of bioethanol in untreated wells) × 100%.

The aforementioned novel species may be caused by horizontal transfers of genetically modified organisms from the Middle East or North Africa (Schrettl et al., 2011). For this reason, it is important to look into the potential horizontal transfers of genetic material.

In this study, the methanogenic methanolic wastewater treatment induced a wide variety of undesirable environmental impacts, and it is proposed that the wastewater wastewater treated with DL-lactate as the sole carbon source should be transformed into liquid organic water for new microbial bioethanol production. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this transformation method, the wastewater treatment was also conducted using different conditions. The wastewater treatment was conducted at a pH of 5.0, followed by a 50:50 dilution of DL-lactate and the 50:50 treatment with the 2.0:1 ratio of DL-lactate. The wastewater treatment was conducted at a pH of 5.0 and then the 50:50 treatment with the 2.0:1 ratio of DL-lactate was conducted with the same pH. The resulting culture media were then subjected to a sedimentation step (Supplementary Figure S1).

The process of converting DL-lactate into a liquid organic water (LCW) was firstly performed in two steps: the treatment with DL-lactate was performed at a pH of 4.0 and the treatment with DL-lactate was conducted with a 50:50 dilution of DL-lactate. The total LCOE at pH 4.0 was 3.36, which corresponds to the maximum amount of DL-lactate per gram of LCOE. The total LCOE at pH 4.0 was 3.52, which corresponds to the maximum amount of DL-lactate per gram of LCOE. The LCOE at the 50:50 dilution was 1.65, which corresponds to the maximum amount of DL-lactate per gram of LCOE. The total LCOE at the pH 4.0 was 0.97, which corresponds to the maximum amount of DL-lactate per gram of LCOE. The total LCOE at the 50:50 dilution was 0.96, which corresponds to the maximum amount of DL-lactate per gram of LCOE. The total LCOE at the pH 4.0 was 0.
