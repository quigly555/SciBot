## Abstract
The complex interaction between the host and the pathogen has evolved from multiple roles at the host-pathogen level. The inflammatory response, which consists of the direct activation of the innate immune system, through the host response can either be either an immediate or a late response depending on the location and magnitude of the invading pathogen. In either case, the host response can be either beneficial or a defensive response which preserves the integrity of the organ system and protects against the harmful pathogen invasion. The defensive response involves the inflammatory protein(s) interacting with the innate immune system via the maturation of the fungal cell wall. The objective of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the pathogenic effect of pathogenic proteins on the innate immune system and the reasons for the innate immune response and immune regulation in response to the fungal pathogen. The key features of the immune system are the production of molecules which modulate the host response, and are involved in many more than just the activation of the innate immune system.


## Introduction
The classification of plant diseases has undergone a dramatic revision in recent years, and plant-associated fungi (mf) are of increasing relevance and relevance. The current classification of plant diseases is based on the analysis of the phytochemistry of various compounds. The biological functions of fungal phytochemistries in plant diseases are still controversial, but several recent studies suggest that the production of these toxic compounds by plant-associated fungi may be inhibited. The phytochemistry of various plant-related compounds can be divided into various categories, based on their chemical constituents and pharmacological properties [1,2,3,4]. These categories are as follows.

The review of Roy et al. [1] describes the phytochemistry of various fungal phytochemicals, including the chemical constituents of the major constituents of the major constituent glucosinolates, phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids. The main phytochemicals studied in detail are as follows: glucosinolate, polyphenols, anthocyanidins, tannins, and their derivatives [1].

Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungi, such as plant-associated fungi (AMF) and fungi of the subphylum Pucciniomycotina, are known to produce various phytochemicals. The most important phytochemicals studied in this phytochemistry are glycosides, terpenoids, polyphenols, glycosides, flavonoids, and their derivatives [1,2,3,4]. The biosynthetic pathways of these phytochemicals are well-known and have been extensively studied in the past decades [1,2,3,4,5]. The main types of phytochemicals studied in this review are glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, and glycosides. The phytochemistry of glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, glycosides, and glycosides is described in Table 1.


## Methods

In vivo ATPase assay
The ATPase activity was determined as described previously (Barth et a., 2016). The ATPase activity was normalized to the amount of ATP that was required for the enzyme to catalyze 3-keto-D-Glucopyranoside (3KG) release, and compared to the amount of ATP that was required to cause the enzyme to degrade a 3-keto-D-Glucopyranoside (3KG) extract.

In vivo ATPase assay
The ATPase activity was determined as described previously (Barth et al., 2016). The ATPase activity was normalized to the amount of ATP that was required to cause the enzyme to catalyze 3-keto-D-Pyr-1,2,3-bis-acetate (3KG) release, and compared to the amount of ATP that was required to cause the enzyme to degrade a 3-keto-D-Pyr-1,2,3-bis-acetate (3KG) extract.

## Results
werneckii and . cerevisiae, we tested whether the amino acid sequence of the predicted transglycosylase from H. werneckii might be useful in the analysis of the full virulence of the strain in vivo.

First, we examined the ability of the transglycosylase from H. werneckii to degrade the full virulence factor produced by H. werneckii. The transglycosylase was not able to fully degrade the virulence factor required for the virulence of H. werneckii. In this experiment, the only P. pastoris strain with a fully degraded virulence factor was P. falciparum (Table 1). This suggests that the transglycosylase from H. werneckii may be capable of degrading virulence factors and thus may be responsible for the virulence in this strain. Further, the transglycosylase was not able to fully degrade the virulence factor required for the virulence of H. werneckii.

The ability of the transglycosylase from H. werneckii to degrade the virulence factor required for H. werneckii to cause death in mice was also tested in the model animal model of disseminated candidiasis. As shown in Fig 1, the virulence of the transglycosylase from H. werneckii was highly similar to that of the virulence factor P. falciparum. The virulence factor P. falciparum was associated with high levels of tissue fungal burden and thus the possibility of disseminating candidiasis in this model of disseminated candidiasis was rejected.

The transglycosylase from H. werneckii was the most effective in the role of P. falciparum as virulence factor. Therefore, we also tested whether the transglycosylase from H. werneckii could be used to investigate the role of P. falciparum in virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. The virulence factor P. falciparum was associated with high levels of tissue fungal burden and therefore the possibility of disseminating candidiasis in this model was rejected.

A more sensitive approach to investigate the role of P. falciparum in the virulence of P.


## Discussion
The fluorescence intensity of pKcsA/pctAp_2 in Fusarium graminearum grown under various stresses (.e., osmostress, blastoconidium, oomycetes) is similar to those of P. anserina, P. expansum, and P. lutzii [47]. However, it is interesting to note that the fluorescence intensity of pKcsA/pctAp_2 was significantly lower in H_2S-treated fungus. This observation may be attributed to the ability of the fungal cell to use a selective defense to the stresses, such as oxidative stress and cell wall stress [48].

The second significant difference between the two strains was the expression of the basidiomycete genes, pkcsA and pkcsB, which is expressed in the basidiomycete fungus C. neoformans [49]. The expression of these genes was higher in the A. fumigatus than that of P. expansum. This suggests that PkcsA is involved in basidiomycete growth. In addition, the expression of pkcsA/pctAp_2 in P. expansum was higher than that of P. expansum. Thus, the expression of basidiomycete genes may contribute to the growth of P. expansum and P. expansum-infected fungus. The expression of pkcsA/pctAp_2 in A. fumigatus was increased by 72-fold in the H_2S-treated fungus, whereas the expression of pkcsA/pctAp_2 was increased by 48-fold in the P. expansum-infected fungus. These results suggest that basidiomycete genes may play a role in fungal pathogenicity. The fact that PkcsA and PctA are expressed in the same gene, as in the basidiomycete fungus C. neoformans, suggests that PkcsA and PctA are involved in fungal pathogenicity.

The data presented here showed that the expression of basidiomycete genes was increased in the H_2S-treated fungus and H_2S-treated fungus was significantly more resistant to UV irradiation.
