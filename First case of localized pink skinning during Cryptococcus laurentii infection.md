## Abstract
The immune response to fungal infections relies on innate immunity to the fungus. However, innate immunity to Aspergillus fumigatus is poorly understood. In this study, we found that the expression levels of several virulence factors in A. fumigatus-infected cells were significantly decreased compared with wild type A. fumigatus. These decreased levels were associated with decreased fungal burden and increased survivability of A. fumigatus in vivo. The increased survival of A. fumigatus in vivo also suggests a direct role for calcineurin in the fungal pathogenicity. In addition, this study demonstrated that A. fumigatus can interact with murine macrophages to become resistant to a diverse array of antifungal drugs including amphotericin, atazanavir, caspofungin, and flucytosine. Overall, these studies provide insights into a mechanism for the decreased fungal burden in infected A. fumigatus hosts and suggest that A. fumigatus virulence may rely on interaction with diverse immune factors.


## Introduction
The majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are either asymptomatic, have no symptoms, or are otherwise not responsive to therapy.1-3 SLE is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).4,5 It can be caused by more than one species of the pathogenic genus Cryptococcus, and in the absence of known etiologic agents, most patients develop a spectrum of non-specific symptoms including fever, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) or non-neurotoxic shock syndrome (NTSS), a rare clinical manifestation of the disease, which may or may not be associated with the classical syndrome of idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia (TLCL).6,7 The pathogenesis of MAI is not fully understood, but the most commonly isolated pathogen is HIV.8

The main etiological agents of MAI are HIV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Cryptococcus neoformans, but some cases are due to other etiologies such as autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, and malignancy.9-11 The HIV epidemic is responsible for causing over one million cases of MAI, resulting in over 600,000 deaths annually.12-14 The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex is the most common cause of M. tuberculosis, with an estimated 220,000 cases of disease each year.15,16 The TB complex is composed of four subspecies of the complex, named Mtb, Mtc, and TB. Mtb is the most prevalent, and the most severe, of these is the Mtc complex. The complex is characterized by high diversity and affects predominantly the subcutaneous tissue, especially the digestive tract and thymus. The complex is characterized by the ability to synthesize a wide variety of metabolites and secrete a variety of toxins. The complex is found in all TB patients and is capable of producing toxins that are harmful to the host. In order to be pathogenic, Mtb must be able to invade the target host organs. In addition, Mtb has to be able to interact with the host immune system.17,18 Therefore, the complex is critical for the progression of TB disease.


## Methods

Patients who were treated as previously described [33] were not treated for Cryptococcus infection with antibiotic therapy, because antibiotic therapy is not recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline. Therefore, the treatment regimen was adapted to achieve the full spectrum of treatment available to the patients in our study. The efficacy of therapy was evaluated as previously described [35].

In this study, the antifungal agent was performed according to the CLSI (CLSI M27-A2) guidelines [36]. Therefore, the antifungal agent was prepared according to the CLSI M27-A2 guidelines [37]. The final concentration of antifungal agent used in the study was 0.03% (0.5-2.5 mg/mL) and the antifungal agent was prepared according to the CLSI M38-A2 [38]. The antifungal agent was diluted 1:50 (v/v) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and then incubated for 72 h at 37Â°C with shaking at 200 rpm.

Antifungal Agents
Antifungal agents were used in the study as previously described [36]. In brief, the antifungal agent was dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and then diluted 1:50 in RPMI medium containing 0.5% FBS and then diluted 1:100 in RPMI medium containing 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The antifungal agent was diluted in RPMI medium containing 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin and then diluted 1:100 in RPMI medium containing 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. The final concentrations of the antifungal agent and the antifungal agent were prepared in RPMI medium containing 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin and 1.0% antifungal agent.

Lipid Migration Assay
The lipid migration assay was performed as previously described [36], with modifications.


## Results
We detected positive CD4+ T lymphocytes in both the control and infected strains of . laurentii as well as in the infected cells of the control and infected C. laurentii strain (Supplementary Fig S3C). In both cases, we observed a significant difference in the expression of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the control and infected strains of Cryptococcus laurentii.

A common culture of C. laurentii in the infected and control groups was the presence of live CD4+ T cells from both the CD4+ T lymphocytes and the control cells. Our results showed that the numbers of live CD4+ T lymphocytes from both infected and control groups were not significantly different. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the CD4+ T lymphocytes from the infected and control groups.

Identification of C. laurentii-Associated Cryptococcal Infection Samples
Our results showed that all of the infected C. laurentii were isolated from the blood. These samples were taken for culture and/or culture-proven identification. In the control C. laurentii strain, we identified the pathogen in the blood. However, the C. laurentii isolates from blood and/or blood-related bloodstream of the control C. laurentii strain were not identified in the bloodstream samples.

A large amount of C. laurentii was isolated from the blood in both the control and infected C. laurentii strains (Fig 2B). However, the isolation of C. laurentii from blood was more prevalent in the infected strains of both the two strains (Fig 2B). We found that the isolation of C. laurentii from the blood in both C. laurentii strains was more prevalent in the infected strains of both the two strains.

The C. laurentii-Associated Cryptococcal Infection Samples
The survival of C. laurentii isolates was determined by determining the percentage of surviving yeast cells during the incubation period. We found that the percentage of surviving C. laurentii isolates was significantly higher in the infected C. laurentii strains than in the control strains (Fig 3). The percentage of surviving C. laurentii isolates in the infected C. laurentii strains were significantly higher than in the control strains (Fig 3).
