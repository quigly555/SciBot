## Abstract
Cocos nucifera (L.) (Arecaceae) is a plant widely used in South America for the treatment of various ailments. It is known for its fragrances, pharmacological activities, medicinal uses, and anti-cancer activities. In the present work, the antioxidant, antimicrobial, antimutagenic and anti-inflammatory activities of C. nucifera were evaluated. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and the chemical compositions were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).


## Introduction
The present study evaluates the contribution of the honey bee and its digestive system to digestive mucosal diseases, which are related to its interactions with the bacteria, fungi and other microbes in the gut. The microbiome can be characterized by the presence of microbes that are of minimal impact to the digestive system, and those that can be considered commensal and harmful to the host (microbiome). These organisms can have profound effects on the host immune system and may be detrimental to the host. In this context, microbes can have profound effects on the host immune system and may be detrimental to the host. The microbiome has been identified as a potential source of infection in the gastrointestinal tract of honeybees (O.K. Jones et al., 2017). The microbiome can be associated with digestive tract problems in honeybees (Boes et al., 2016), or with host immune disorders and chronic diseases in honeybees (Lomar et al., 2016; El-Ghaouth et al., 2017). The microbiome is also associated with health, stress, stress tolerance and immune response (El-Ghaouth et al., 2017; Lahede et al., 2017). The gut microbiome is composed of bacterial, fungal, and other non-commensalized microbial communities that are present in the gut and other organs of the body (Fisher et al., 2016). Bacteria, fungi and other microbes from the gut can have profound effects on the host immune system and may be detrimental to the host. In this context, the microbiome can be an important source of infection in the digestive tract of honeybees (El-Ghaouth et al., 2017). The composition of the gut microbiome has been well studied in honeybees (Boes et al.


## Methods
The common denominator for the present study was a repetition of the traditional angiography [50. The angiography consisted of a straight line through the skin, extending over the underlying body, to the epidermis. The line was drawn on the skin and placed on a table with a defined area for the angiography to provide a detailed picture. The angiography was repeated in the same way twice.

In the angiography, there were 5-7 groups of four (bendover/edge/point/mark/on/overlap) that were placed on a table. The angiography was repeated twice in the same way. The pattern of the progression of the function was examined from the bottom of the skin to the outermost layers of the epidermis, to which the skin was closed. The direction of the line of the angiography was observed from the top of the skin to the upper of the epidermis. The details of the contour of the contour of the angiography are presented in the figure legends.

After the routine presentation, the parents had read the prognosis, including therapy, treatments, and death. The prognosis was considered to be good and the death was considered to be very unlikely. The prognosis was decided by the final outcome of the blood work-up. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Pathology and Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maring Kingdom (Protocol number 0029/2013) and by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maring Kingdom (Protocol number 01/2015/PVM/09/2010).

The samples were obtained in the beginning of March 2013. In the first four days, the animals were observed for the following conditions: weight loss, weight loss of the neck, hindbrain inflammation, and skin or hair loss. The animals were sacrificed by injection of pentobarbital. Their organs were removed from the stomach and spleen, weighed, and a lumbric spine was dissected. The lumbric spine was placed in a sterile tube and stored at -20°C. The samples were homogenized using a sterile homogenizer with 1 ml of sterile water in a sterile tube and homogenate was centrifuged at 8000× g for 10 min.


## Results
 days; range = .6 to 14.2).

Overall demographic characteristics and clinical presentation of patients with IFIs in the HIV community are presented in Table 3. Of the 76 patients with HIV infection, 21 (52.8%) had HIV infection and 19 (57.2%) were HIV positive. In the overall HIV prevalence, the prevalence of HIV infection in HIV-infected patients was 11.2% (29/74) and 8.5% (27/49) in the HIV-negative population, respectively. The HIV-negative population was predominantly from rural areas (Table 4). The HIV-negative population in the HIV-negative population was also highly mobile (P < 0.001). The HIV-positive population in the HIV-negative population was younger (median age, 14 years; range, 6-17 years), and it was more frequently male (median age, 36 years; range, 5-71 years) than HIV-negative population (median age, 17 years; range, 6-25 years). The HIV-positive population in the HIV-negative population was also less frequently infected with Cryptococcus neoformans (median age, 4 years; range, 2-6 years) and had lower median CD4 count (median 22 cells/mm^3; range, 1-76 cells) than HIV-negative population (median 27 cells/mm^3; range, 2-80 cells). HIV infection was more common in the HIV-negative population (23.2% (28/74) vs. 5.9% (17.6%) in the HIV-positive population, p < 0.0001). In contrast, the HIV-positive population in the HIV-negative population was more frequently infected with other cryptococcal organisms (53.8% (22/74) vs. 18.7% (16.5%) in the HIV-negative population, p < 0.0001).

Laboratory culture results were not available for any of the patients. However, clinical signs of infection, including fever and cough, were present in all the patients (Table 5).


## Discussion

The case presented here, which is the first case of occupational-psychological presentation of . jirovecii, is the first case of P. jirovecii isolated in a small rural region of Germany.

The association between pigeon population and exposure to pigeon droppings has been reported in several countries, including South Africa [43], India [44], India [45], the Philippines [46], Thailand [47], and Australia [48]. A study of the association between pigeon population and exposure to pigeon droppings has been described in Taiwan [49] and China [50]. In China, exposure to pigeon droppings is known to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection [51]. In our case, the patient had an occupational exposure to pigeons and was exposed to pigeon droppings on a regular basis.

While the exposure to pigeon droppings is not known to be a causal factor for P. jirovecii infection, it may be contributing to the development of a severe illness in this patient. The patient had a history of recent exposure to pigeons, and the patient was exposed to pigeons in the past. The patient had a history of exposure to pigeon droppings in the past, and the patient had recent exposure to pigeon droppings in the past. Further investigation is required to determine the source of the exposure, if any, in this patient.

In conclusion, the patient presented with occupational-psychological presentation, including the presence of pigeons. The patient had an occupational exposure to pigeons, which was reported in the past. The patient had recent exposure to pigeon droppings, and the patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past. There were no other occupational exposures to pigeon droppings in this patient. However, the patient had a history of recent exposure to pigeon droppings, which was reported in the past. The patient had a history of exposure to pigeon droppings in the past, and the patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past. The patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past, and the patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past. The patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past, and the patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past. The patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past, and the patient had exposure to pigeon droppings in the past.
