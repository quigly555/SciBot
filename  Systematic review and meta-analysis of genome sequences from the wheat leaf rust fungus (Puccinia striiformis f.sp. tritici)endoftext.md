## Abstract
Fungal infections are a global concern due to their occurrence in significant numbers of individuals with primary or secondary fungal infection, which has led to a growing body of literature detailing the need for the development of novel antifungal therapies. The fungal cell wall is a heterogeneous matrix that is capable to undergo evasive morphologies, such as asci, that allow for the entry of fungi into the host.


## Introduction
Although it is not considered a serious disease, TB is an important cause of death in HIV/AIDS and other immunosuppressed populations, including in India and Brazil where it is the third leading cause of death in HIV/AIDS (Rostrup and Fraser, 2008.

The global burden of TB remains unacceptably high, with over one million cases reported in 2008, with approximately 180,000 deaths (Binder and Fraser, 2007; Binder and Fraser, 2007). The global TB epidemiology is complex, encompassing both rural and urban TB communities (Vasconcelos et al., 2016). While some authors have described the rural TB population as a driver of TB epidemic, it is not clear how the process of TB transmission begins and ends. The model that has emerged as the “microbiome of the human body” is a complex and dynamic community of microbial consortia that includes both bacteria and fungi (Granados et al., 2006; Vasconcelos et al., 2016). Consortia can have a profound influence on the microbial composition and function, with commensal bacteria modulating the expression of defense genes and promoting disease resistance (Levin and Hall, 2015). In contrast, a key driver of the “microbiome of the human body” is a microbial consortium that includes a diverse community of symbiotic bacteria, including the microbiota of the lungs, skin, and gut (van Wees and de Hoog, 2016).

Studies focusing on the microbiota of the respiratory and skin tissues have shown that the microbial composition varies according to environmental conditions, and is associated with a variety of health conditions (Granados et al., 2006; Lavelle et al., 2009; Vasconcelos et al., 2016). A key driver for this dynamic microbial composition is the microbiome of the respiratory and skin tissues. While the respiratory and skin microbiota are strongly associated with disease progression and severity, the microbiota associated with other organs and health conditions are poorly understood (Mendes et al., 2012; Coelho et al., 2015; Galindo et al., 2016). In general, the respiratory and skin microbiota are associated with inflammatory and chronic diseases (Levin and Hall, 2015).


## Methods
indica isolates was isolated from rice (Sordariopsis c. Tsering, K., and Lipsins, 1989) and wheat (Sordariopsis smuttsii, X. X. Fujimura, and Y. Wu, unpublished data) cultivars by using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers ITS1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAAAAG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') were used to amplify the region of the ribosomal gene of P. indica, and the primers LSU (5'-GGTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGC-3') and LR3 (5'-TCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3') were used to amplify the LSU region. The PCR products were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers LSUF (5'-GGTCCGTAGGAACCTGC-3') and LSUR (5'-CCACCCACCCGTTACCC-3') were used to amplify the fragment of the ribosomal gene of P. indica. The PCR products were sequenced at the Nucleotide Archive of China (NTA) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequence was deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KT236087-KT236088).

The ITS region of the fungus P. indica was amplified by using the primer pairs ITS1F (5'-GTGTTTCATTTAGGAAGTAAAAG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATGC-3') to amplify the fragment of the ribosomal gene of P. indica. The PCR products were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.


## Results
The acute phase of ureitis was demonstrated by the diagnostic accuracy in 23 of the 42 (43%) patients. Of these patients, 14 were diagnosed with non-unevenous inflammatory syndrome (NIHR) and one was diagnosed with inflammatory syndrome (IOS). Among these patients, 8 (43%) had chronic renal disease and the other 9 (43%) had a non-unevenous inflammatory syndrome. A significant difference in diagnostic accuracy was found between the clinical diagnoses of IOS and the non-unevenous inflammatory syndrome (p < 0.001).

The diagnostic accuracy of the combined clinical data was comparable between the non-neutropenic and the neo-neutropenic inflammatory lesions. The diagnosis of IOS was a higher diagnosis in the neo-neutropenic lesions than in the non-neutropenic lesions (p < 0.001). Of the 9 patients with IOS, 6 (40%) were diagnosed with non-neutropenic inflammatory syndrome, 7 (40%) with NOS and 2 (16%) with NOS. The difference was significant in the NOS diagnosis between the neo-neutropenic lesions (p < 0.001) (Table 1).

Of the 7 patients with NOS, 2 (16%) had a non-neutropenic inflammatory syndrome, 6 (40%) had a NOS, and 2 (16%) had NOS.


## Discussion
The orders Penicillium and Aspergillus were the dominant genera in the epiphytic fungus Acremoniu. This fungal order also includes species of ascomycetous fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Pichia kudriavzevii, Alternaria sp., Aspergillus terreus, and Alternaria alternata. However, the order Acremonium is separated from the other orders by a number of taxa that have no or very few genera. These genera are represented by two orders, Acremonium and Aspergillus. In Acremonium, the order Aspergillus is represented by two genera, Acremonium and Penicillium. These orders are composed of species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Penicillium and Talaromyces. The order Penicillium is comprised by species of Penicillium and Talaromyces. In addition, the order Penicillium is composed of species of Penicillium, Talaromyces and Penicillium. The orders Penicillium and Aspergillus are represented by three orders, Penicillium, Talaromyces, and Penicillium.

The order of Aspergillus, which is represented by three genera, is represented by two genera, Penicillium and Talaromyces. These genera are represented by Penicillium and Talaromyces. In addition, the order Penicillium is represented by two genera, Penicillium and Talaromyces. This order is distinguished from the other orders by the presence of eight genera and the order number of the genera on the genus level, and the presence of eight genera and the number of genera on the genus level on the genus level. The order Penicillium is represented by six genera, Penicillium by four genera, and Penicillium by three genera. The order Penicillium contains three genera, and Penicillium by two genera.
