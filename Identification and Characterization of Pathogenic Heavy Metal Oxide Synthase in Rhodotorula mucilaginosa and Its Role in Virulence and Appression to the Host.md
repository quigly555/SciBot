## Abstract
In the past decades, the incidence of fungal infections has increased dramatically, especially among inpatients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In particular, fungi are now the leading cause of invasive mycoses. However, the pathogenesis of CF-related invasive fungal infections remains unclear. We therefore compared the in vitro and in vivo virulence factors of 30 CF patients with and without CF and healthy controls. Our results showed that the in vitro spectrum of mycoses was different in CF patients and controls. Furthermore, in vivo analysis revealed that mycoses were significantly more virulent in CF patients than in controls. Furthermore, in vivo analysis revealed that CF patients had significantly higher intracellular ß-asar (ß-ALS)- levels, with high levels of resistance to macrophage killing. Thus, our results show that CF patients with and without CF had significantly different virulence factors and significantly different host inflammatory responses.

Infectious fungal infections are very common in CF patients, often with sepsis. CF patients with CF have higher in vitro fungal burdens than control, which may contribute to the high burdens of these infections. The in vitro and in vivo mycoses were studied by immunodiffusion and imaging techniques, respectively. The in vivo results revealed that CF patients had significantly higher intracellular ß-asar (ß-ALS)- levels, with high levels of resistance to macrophage killing, and high levels of resistance to neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, in vivo analysis revealed that CF patients with CF had significantly higher intracellular ß-asar (ß-ALS)- levels, with high levels of resistance to macrophage killing. Furthermore, our results showed that CF patients with CF had significantly different virulence factors and significantly different host inflammatory responses in comparison to controls. Our findings also revealed that CF patients with CF patients had significantly different innate immune responses compared to controls. Our results may be useful for developing novel antifungal therapies against CF patients.


## Introduction
 2014.

The HOS protein family comprises a set of proteins that catalyze the conversion of metals to oxygen and nitrogen by two processes: Cu^2+, which is converted to hydrogen and oxygen by the enzyme CuSO_4, and Fe^2+, which is converted to iron by the sulfoxide reductase. CuSO_4 is an organic species and thus present in the cell membrane and is the major redox active metal. Because of its importance as a metal ion, its antioxidant properties are exploited to reduce the damage to the host cell, which in turn leads to increased infectivity and resistance to antifungal agents. Due to this potential toxicity, it is used in industries and hospitals, as well as in biotechnology to control infectious diseases (Van Zanten, 2013). The enzyme MnSO_4 catalyzes the oxidation of Fe^2+ to Fe^3+ and forms a metal hydroxide-containing molecule, which is not present in the host cell, but is present in the extracellular space. As a metal hydroxide is a substrate of CuSO_4, it is important to find out if the pathogen is a human pathogen or an animal pathogen.

The mammalian pathogen Candida albicans causes most cases of mucosal candidiasis, which is a life-threatening infection. The fungus can be divided into two varieties, C. albicans var. grubii (serotype A) and C. albicans (serotype D), with the C. albicans var. duboisii (serotype A) and C. albicans var. duboisii (serotype D) species, and it is normally classified as a commensal of the mucosal membranes of the upper and lower extremities of the human body. In addition, it is the most common fungal pathogen of the skin and other mucosal surfaces in the United States and worldwide. It causes a wide range of infections, from superficial to invasive forms, and is able to cause a high level of disease in immunocompromised patients. Because of the extremely high prevalence of the fungus in the environment, it is difficult to diagnose it accurately, particularly in countries with limited access to antifungal drugs. The current diagnostic approach relies on multidisciplinary approaches, such as clinical observation, microbiologic culture, and immune surveillance.


## Methods
SDS-PAGE was performed using a ProgRes X Transfer protein-reductase-HRP-purified membrane with a ProgRes Nunc protein-purified membran. The reaction mixture was incubated with 10% polyacrylamide gels and then heated at 60 °C for 5 min to visualize the mitochondrial resin and the resin was stained with 10% isopropanol.

For the identification of pathogenic heavy metal oxide synthase, the reaction of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa to the solvent A and B was carried out as described previously [26]. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 28 °C. The reaction mixture was then heated at 80 °C for 5 min to reach an intensity of 200 ± 10 °C, and then cooled at 60 °C to maintain a constant temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to a final concentration of 10% and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The oxidative damage to the medium was quantified by the reduction of the absorbance to 0.02% with the help of a UV lamp.

The molecular structure of the antimicrobial substance, rhodotorula mucilaginosa, was predicted by using the program MOLASSER [27]. The search for the molecular structure of the substance was performed using the program MOLASSER [27].

Microscopic observation of lipid distribution and biofilm formation was conducted using a microscope (Axioplan; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A sample of S. mucilaginosa (0.0 g) was mixed with 50 ml of 100% sterile filtered water. The solution was allowed to stand for 5 min, and then it was allowed to stand for 20 min. The samples were then mixed with 100 µl of 0.1% NaCl and then transferred to a glass slide and observed under a light microscope. The samples were observed under a light microscope at 200× magnification and observed in a Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective.

## Results
mucilaginosa is the model pathogen for the pathogenicity of the animal pathogen Cryptococcus neoforman. In this study, the virulence of R. mucilaginosa was confirmed using a diverse range of models (Figure 3). In addition, the pathogenicity of R. mucilaginosa was determined by using a biocontrol agent, the chemotherapeutic agent fluconazole. For the chemotherapeutic agent, the R. mucilaginosa was efficiently killed by the agent. In this case, the R. mucilaginosa pathogen was most sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent. In addition, R. mucilaginosa was more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent than the bacterium. For the bacterium, R. mucilaginosa was more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent than the bacterium.

To further determine whether the higher sensitivity of R. mucilaginosa to fluconazole is due to the higher resistance of R. mucilaginosa to the azole drug, we compared the resistance of R. mucilaginosa to the azole drug fluconazole and the chemotherapeutic agent fluconazole. For both agents, R. mucilaginosa was more resistant to fluconazole than the bacterium. For fluconazole, R. mucilaginosa was more resistant to fluconazole than the bacterium. The sensitivity of R. mucilaginosa to fluconazole was the highest when the fluconazole concentration was increased to the concentration of 10 µg/ml. R. mucilaginosa was more sensitive to fluconazole than the bacterium. The sensitivity of R. mucilaginosa to fluconazole was the highest when the fluconazole concentration was increased to the concentration of 10 µg/ml.

In addition, R. mucilaginosa was more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent fluconazole than the bacterium. For fluconazole, R. mucilaginosa was more resistant to fluconazole than the bacterium. In addition, R. mucilaginosa was more resistant to fluconazole than the bacterium.

## Discussion
In this study, we were interested in the identification of the genes that are light-sensitive and pathogenicity-relate. The most abundant light-sensing genes in all strains were Ssn4, Abr1, PkhA, Fps1, and Gpr1, which encode the pathogenicity-related proteins (PHI: S. cerevisiae pkhA (Ssn4), Hsp70 (Hsp70), Gpr1 (Gpr1) and Php2 (Php2) respectively. In addition, Fps1 was the most abundantly expressed protein in the culture supernatants of S. cerevisiae, whereas it was only expressed in the P. cubeba strain H99 [40]. Php2 is a fungal homolog with high affinity and high degree of sequence similarity to phytochelatin-like proteins (C-glycosylated proteins) [41]. Abr1 is a fungal homolog of the C-terminal subunit of the arginine monooxygenase (AMP-1) and a component of the plasma membrane [42], [43], [44]. Abr1 was also abundantly expressed in P. cubeba strain H99 and was also present in the supernatants of S. cerevisiae H99 and C. albicans [45], [46]. The other light-sensitive genes were Gpr1, Gpr2, and Gpr3, which encode the protein components of the plasma membrane [47].

The protein domains and their subfamilies of Ssn4, Abr1, and Gpr1 were highly conserved in the whole fungus, and a similar pattern was observed in other fungal species, including A. fumigatus, C. albicans, and P. gattii [48]. Gpr1 was found to be the most abundant protein in S. cerevisiae, and it was present in the supernatants of S. cerevisiae H99 and H99-Hsp90 (Hsp90) and in the supernatants of S. cerevisiae H99-Hsp90 (Hsp90) and Hsp90-Ssn4 (Hsp90).
