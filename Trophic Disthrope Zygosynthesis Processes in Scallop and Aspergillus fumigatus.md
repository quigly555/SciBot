## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections are common in hospitals and intensive care units. The most common fungal agents used in these settings are Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. Aspergillus is the most common causative species. Despite that, there is a small number of niche niche fungi that are highly prevalent among populations of immunocompromised patients and they are difficult to manage. The use of new therapeutic agents and innovative biotherapies will increase the availability of antifungal agents and will enhance the efficiency of treatment. The aim of this review is to describe the use of antifungal agents and emerging antifungal resistance in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in the emergency department. We discuss the various strategies currently available for managing invasive fungal infections, including the use of new drugs and the possibility of using alternative treatments in the future.


## Introduction
Aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic filamentous fungus that produces a large number of mycotoxins (e.g.


## Methods
 as a basis for phylogenetic analyse. The Zygosporium sp. is present in the New World Order (NWO) of fungi in the Basidiomycete in Zygosporium. Zygosporium has been treated as a host plant in many other plants, and in this study we used the genera Zygosporium sp. (Pg. vinifera) and Aspergillus fumigatus (Zygosporium pyriformis).

DNA Extraction
DNA was extracted from all the samples using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA samples were sequenced in two directions using a BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, USA). Each sample was sequenced in triplicate with an ABI Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, USA). The primers ITS5 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') were used for the PCR reactions using the following thermal profile: an initial denaturation of 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min.

Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis
The sequence alignment was performed using the software program Se-Al v. 1.0 (DNASTAR, Madison, USA). The alignments were generated with Clustal Omega v. 1.6.0 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustal_ omega/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA v. 5.1 (http://www.megasoftware.net/).

Phylogenetic Analysis
The available sequences were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. The sequences were aligned with the software program MEGA v. 5.1 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA v.


## Results
We analyzed the coelomycete eukaryotic lineages that have undergone duplication and also identified those that do not appear to have undergone this event (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3. The coelomycete lineage that appears to have undergone a duplication in the coelomycete lineages is the lineage that we have identified as coelomycete fission, which is represented by the coelomycete F1 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). F1 was named the fission yeast U. maydis, which was the first fission yeast species in the fission yeast kingdom (22). We also identified the fission yeast fts from the coelomycete lineage that we have identified as coelomycete fission. The fission yeast F2 was named the fission yeast F2 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). F2 is represented by the fission yeast F2 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). The fission yeast F3 was named the fission yeast F3 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). We identified the coelomycete fts from the coelomycete lineage that we have identified as coelomycete fission, which is represented by the fission yeast F3 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). The fission yeast F3 was named the fission yeast F3 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). The fission yeast F4 was named the fission yeast F4 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3).

In the coelomycete lineage that we have identified, F4 was named the fission yeast F4 (Fig S4, Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3).


## Discussion
expansum mutants, we performed a network analysis with the cdaA mutant that, as expected, had a reduction in the growth rate of both of the Scallop and Aspergillus sp. (Figure 5A). In addition, we also performed a network analysis with the ddaA mutant that was completely devoid of any of the growth defects (Figure 5B). The ddaA mutant showed no significant growth defect in either Scallop or Aspergillus spp. (Figure 5C), suggesting that ddaA plays a role in Scallop growth and not Aspergillus spp. growth. Deletion of ddaA did not result in any growth reduction in either Scallop or Aspergillus spp. (Figure 5D), indicating that ddaA plays a role in Aspergillus spp. growth. In addition, we confirmed that ddaA plays a role in Aspergillus spp. growth, since the <U+0394>ddaA strain grew normally in the wild-type medium (Figure 5E). These results demonstrate that ddaA plays a role in Aspergillus spp. growth.

DdaA-Regulated Zinc-Coated Protein Kinase Isolate Isolate Kinase Activity
The results obtained in the <U+0394>ddaA mutant yeast were consistent with those reported in other fungi such as Candida albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Cryptococcus neoformans (24, 25). Moreover, the <U+0394>ddaA mutant showed a significant reduction in the growth of the other fungal species tested (Figure 6). The <U+0394>ddaA mutant exhibited an increased level of the zinc-zinc transporter C2H2 (Znf2) (Znf2), which plays a major role in the Znf2 pathway, which in turn is involved in the biosynthesis of cysteine in TCA cycle and the production of calcium carbonate (Cacp1). In the wild-type strain, the Znf2 activity was increased by 20-fold in response to zinc-mediated zinc sensitivity (Figure 7A). In contrast, in the <U+0394>ddaA mutant, the Znf2 activity was decreased by only 1-fold (Figure 7B).
