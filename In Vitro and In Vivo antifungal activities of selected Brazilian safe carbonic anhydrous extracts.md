## Abstract
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. The presentation can be confusing for clinicians and for the immune system. It is often difficult to differentiate PCM from other systemic mycosis, and the evaluation of successful treatments needs to be both thorough and focused on the symptoms and the treatment. The treatment can often be complicated and the outcome is dependent on the nature of the treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose PCM by the time of treatment. In this article, we present the diagnostic algorithm and the current and future perspectives for PCM treatment. We also discuss the challenges in the evaluation of effective treatments for this disease.

A retrospective study was conducted in Argentina during the period from January 2003 to May 2006. Data were collected in the Hospital della Salute dell’Aiche, Pére, Marche, and collected in the period from June 2006 to January 2007. All patients were treated with antifungal drugs.

55 patients were diagnosed with PCM during the period, most of whom were diagnosed on antifungal therapy and given antifungal treatment. 44% were treated after symptoms improved. In the treatment arms, treatment duration of 70 days (n=25) and 70 days (n=100) were the most commonly used duration of antifungal treatment (80%, P<0.001 and P=0.06, respectively).


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous and saprophytic mold that is readily biotoxic for humans. As a consequence, its spores are inhaled and can reach the lungs, resulting in the chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. The pathogenesis of aspergillosis is primarily associated with its ability to produce aflatoxins and the production of mycotoxins. Exposure to aspergillosis is believed to be the first exposure to the fungus, which has been linked to the development of allergic reactions, asthma exacerbations and aflatoxin sensitivity [1-3].


## Methods
The extraction of plant extracts was performed in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 10 L of water (5% w/v), followed by filtration with Whatman n. 1 filter paper (Whatman, Kennesaw, GA, USA) at 25°C for 1 h. The extract was concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Heide, Tousimis, TX, USA) for 1 h at 70°C. The concentrated extract was re-extracted with a sterile funnel by extracting with 1 M H_2SO_4 (pH 6.0) for 3 h at 100°C. The supernatant was removed and the crude extract was extracted with chloroform (3 × 10 mL). The crude extract was filtered, concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Heide, Tousimis, TX, USA) and the concentration was adjusted to 5 mg/mL. The extracts were stored at -20°C.

4.5. Antifungal Activity of Selected Compounds
The antifungal activities of the selected compounds were evaluated on C. albicans SC5314 (MEM grade, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), C. parapsilosis (MEM grade, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and C. krusei (MEM grade, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). The preparation of the inoculum was conducted according to the method of Montoya et al. [28]. The inoculum was prepared in sterile saline (0.85% w/v) and diluted with distilled water. The inoculum was adjusted to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm (OD_600) of 0.5. The suspension was divided into four parts, and then it was spread on a plate of nutrient agar (NA, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) with the appropriate number of yeast cells. The test was conducted in duplicate. The number of yeast cells required for each compound was counted, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows:

4.6. Antifungal Activity of Selected Compounds
The following compounds were used in the antifungal assay: K, CH, G, N, S, O, and X (Table 1). K, CH, G, N, S, O, and X were extracted from K.


## Results
In Vivo, the compound exhibited fungicidal activity against . neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii, respectively.

In Vitro and In Vivo antifungal activity of selected Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts
The antifungal activities of the selected Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts against the pathogenic Cryptococcus neoformans, C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. haptenii and C. neoformans var. neoformans were tested by using the cell viability assay. The results showed that the extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity against C. neoformans, C. neoformans var. grubii, C. neoformans var. haptenii, and C. neoformans var. neoformans.

## Discussion
were evaluated using high throughput assay. The results show that the tested extracts showed potent antifungal activity against Fusarium spp. and Fusarium sp. in Vitro and In Vivo assays.

The inhibitory effect of the tested Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts against Fusarium spp. was assessed by the checkerboard assay. The results showed that the Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts were more potent than the in vitro antifungal activities of the tested extracts. It has been reported that the Fusarium sp. extracts have strong antifungal activity against Fusarium spp., especially against Fusarium sp. (25). Fusarium sp. are opportunistic pathogens in humans (25). However, the potential of the Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts as an antifungal agent against Fusarium spp. has not been reported. The antifungal activity of the Brazilian safe carbonic anhydrous extracts was investigated by the checkerboard assay, and the results were similar to those obtained by the in vitro antifungal activity of the extracts.
