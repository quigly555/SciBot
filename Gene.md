## Abstract
Nocardia species (Scedosporium oryzae) is a ubiquitous fungus that infects humans and animals and is considered to be the only known pathogen capable of causing disease in the human pathogen S. mansoni. However, the pathogenic role of nocardia in S. oleosuppurans infection remains poorly investigated. Here we show that nocardia can be induced in vitro and in vivo to produce hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the mycelia Freundia mansoni in mice model of S. oleosuppurans infection. In an in vivo study, we found that Freundia mansoni induced nocardial mass injury and induced S. oleosuppurans necrosis. In an in vitro study, we found that activated murine lung epithelial cells markedly increased the survival of S. oleosuppurans infected with nocardial mass. The in vivo studies provide the first evidence for a role of nocardial injury in inducing host-directed colony-forming cells to invade S. oleosuppurans, resulting in an incremental beneficial effect of Freundia mansoni treatment on human pathogen propagation.


## Introduction
 2016), while malignant tumors are more often associated with malignant tissues (Holland et a., 2016). The tumor-invasive tumor (TIT) complex is a heterogeneous group of cells, which includes epithelial, endothelial, and tumors (Shekman and Helen, 2005; Spitzer and Cohen, 2014). In addition, malignant tumors can be classified into two types: non-small cell lung cancer (NLSC) and large cell lung cancer (LCMBC), which are both classified as PCMBC (Schoch et al., 2000). The PCMBCs are classified as metastatic melanoma (Malloch et al., 2000), and M.smolensch-Anhalt (MSAC) is classified as metastatic melanoma (Andersen et al., 2007). PCMBCs are classified as primary lung cancer (Pellegrini et al., 2000), and MSAC is classified as metastatic melanoma (Andersen et al., 2007). Both types of malignant tumors are distinguished by their metastatic nature (Andersen et al., 2007), and a large number of different metastatic melanoma types can be classified, according to their site of growth and tissue distribution (Clements et al., 2012).

It is well known that there is a transition from benign to aggressive malignant tissue within the tumor. The tumor is a complex structure, and the tumor cells are driven by several factors. Some tumor cells have a multiprotein, such as the tumor fibrogenesis complex (TFC), and some tumor cells produce a large number of soluble mediators, such as phospholipase, and cytokines, which mediate the transition to the aggressive malignant state. Several factors influence the progression of the aggressive malignant tumor, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokines, and chemokines (Andersen et al., 2007; Schoch et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2013; Mao et al., 2016). The molecular mechanisms are complex, and the macromolecules produced are subject to modification, which can result from the interplay of the various interplay receptors on the tumor cell surface (Santi et al., 2011).

The tumor matrix is an organelle with a dense matrix composed of proteins, that are attached to the cell surface (Andersen et al., 2007).


## Methods
.0 (Clone Central, Auckland, New Zealand). Three DNA samples were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, which had been designed to use paired-end reads.

Comparison of sequences and taxonomic ranks
The raw reads were aligned to the NCBI non-redundant protein database using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.6 (Li and Durbin, 2009) and used for phylogenetic analyses with the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) method (Langmead and Salzberg, 2007). The alignments were analysed with the MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and the GTRCAT model of nucleotide substitution (Holt and Huelsenbeck, 2003) was used for the Bayesian inference. The two MCMC chains were run for 1 million generations, sampling every 100th tree. The first 25% of each chain was discarded as burn-in, and the remaining 25% were used to search for the best nucleotide substitution model and to calculate posterior probabilities (PP). The second MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 100th tree. The first 25% of each chain was discarded as burn-in, and the remaining 25% were used to search for the best nucleotide substitution model and to calculate posterior probabilities (PP). The final chain was sampled every 100th tree. The likelihood-ratio test was run using the R package “vegan” (R Core Team, 2012). The first 10% of each chain was discarded as burn-in, and the remaining 100% were used to search for the best nucleotide substitution model and to calculate PP.

Nucleotide substitution
The rapid bootstrap method was used to estimate the reliability of the substitution models. For the rapid bootstrap analysis, the rapid bootstrap consensus tree was generated by using 1,000 replicates of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the rate parameter of 1,000 generations was used for bootstrap analyses. The bootstrap support values (BS) were calculated with the “step 1” parameter. The likelihood ratio test was run in “vegan” mode using the “admint” command to determine if the substitution models converged with a confidence level of >0.5.


## Results
las.nl), and the ACT database. The total number of reads was 4,948,722, and the percentage of sequences per sample was 43.8%. The distribution of fungal and bacterial reads was very similar. There were no significant differences in the percentages of fungal and bacterial reads for reads from the control samples. These data suggest that the fungal and bacterial reads were not the same in all samples.

As shown in Figure 2, the average number of reads per sample in the control and the fungus samples were not significantly different (P = 0.77, t test). However, the fungus sample was significantly different from the control sample (P = 0.59, t test) (P = 0.08, t test). The fungal and bacterial reads were not significantly different between the control and the fungus samples (P = 0.25, t test). The analysis of the average number of reads per sample showed a significant difference (P = 0.56, t test) (P < 0.001) between the two fungal and bacterial reads for reads from the control and the fungus samples. The average number of reads per sample for reads from the fungus and the control samples was not significantly different (P = 0.33, t test).

Comparison between fungal and bacterial reads
The relative abundances of fungal and bacterial reads were analyzed using the logistic regression model (Figure 3) as described in the Materials and methods section. The logistic regression model also showed that the number of reads per sample was not significant in all samples (P = 0.16, t test). However, the number of fungal and bacterial reads was significantly different between the control and the fungus samples (P < 0.001, t test). The fungal and bacterial reads were not significantly different between the control and the fungus samples (P = 0.05, t test).

Comparison between fungal and bacterial reads
The logistic regression model showed that the number of reads per sample was not significant in all samples (P = 0.22, t test). However, the number of fungal and bacterial reads was significantly different between the control and the fungus samples (P < 0.001, t test). The fungal and bacterial reads were not significantly different between the control and the fungus samples (P = 0.


## Discussion
In addition, several genes encoding intracellular enzymes are known to be up-regulated in the <U+0394>glucose synthase mutant [53.

A putative pyruvate decarboxylase was also identified in the <U+0394>cda1 mutant, and in the <U+0394>cda2 mutant. The <U+0394>cda1 mutant is less sensitive to cAMP than the <U+0394>cda2 mutant, and is also less sensitive to cAMP than the <U+0394>cda1 mutant. The <U+0394>cda1 mutant also has fewer genes encoding genes encoding enzymes of the pyruvate decarboxylase family, including the pyruvate decarboxylase, pyruvate-epimerase, and pyruvate-reductase, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of pyruvate [54].

In summary, the analysis of the NCBI GAL1 gene sequence showed that the <U+0394>cda1 mutant has a wild-type phenotype and a decreased level of HapX and the pyruvate decarboxylase activity, but the genes encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase were not significantly different. The <U+0394>cda1 mutant is more sensitive to cAMP than the wild-type strain, and has fewer genes encoding enzymes of the pyruvate decarboxylase and pyruvate-epimerase genes, which are important for the pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate-reductase activities, and the pyruvate-epimerase gene was not significantly different from the wild-type.
