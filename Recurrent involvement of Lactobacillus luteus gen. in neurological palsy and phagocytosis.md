## Abstract
To assess the utility of two peptide nucleic acids as antifungal stimuli, the peptides were amplified, purified, and used for the evaluation of antifungal activity. The anti-fungal effect of the peptides was assessed by the enzyme activity assay. Two peptides, ADH1 and ADH5, were added to the culture medium at 0.1% (v/v) concentration with a glass cap at a temperature of 25°C for 48 h. The adsorption and catalase activities of the peptides were evaluated by the T2-parameterization method. The adsorption constant value of the peptides was measured for 2- and 24-h methods. The antifungal activity of the peptides was evaluated by the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration methods. The antifungal activity of the peptides was evaluated by the broth microdilution assay. The anti-fungal activity of the peptides was evaluated by the performance of the enzyme activity assay, where it showed an overall higher activity compared to the other peptides tested. This study showed that peptide nucleic acids could be used as a potential supplement for the evaluation of antifungal therapy and antifungal drug screening, because they are soluble in complex solutions and can be readily integrated into routine supplies and point-of-care testing, respectively.


## Introduction
The family Cystella is a polyphyletic group of bacteria that are mostly isolated from animal skin, decaying wood, plant debris, and decaying vegetation, and they are commonly associated with plant pathogenic fungi, especially the ascomycete Exophiala krusei (teleomorph Ex. krusei (Schwein.) Kühn) Gäumann, and the ascomycete Ex. pedrosoi (Teleomorph: Ex. krusei) (Müller et al., 1986; Dean et al., 2000; Flory et al., 2007; Stamm, 2007; Dijksho and Köhler, 2007; Honegger et al., 2008; Sandhoff et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Li and Xu, 2014; Wu et al., 2014; and Zhang et al., 2015). Ex. krusei is a well-known pathogen of many trees and shrubs in different regions of China and some of these are grown in rice, maize, and wheat (Zhang et al., 2015). In addition to the human pathogen Ex. pedrosoi, the pathogen Ex. pedrosoi can also cause wound infection in several other plant species, such as E. castellani (Pichia) kunzei, E. dehiscence (Lactarius) griffith, and E. abiesii (Lactarius) griffith. In fact, the pathogen Ex. pedrosoi was reported to cause disease in the pine trees Quercus citrinus, E. citrinus, E. juglandus, and E. juglandus × E. abiesii (Zhang et al., 2015).


## Methods
. Essential Oils
For the observation of the OIs, the raw materials were obtained from the Industrial Process Technology and Testing Laboratory (China). Oils (1% wt/vol) were extracted with 3% wt/vol of ethyl acetate. After the filtration process, the organic layers were washed with 70% of ethanol, then dried over Na_2SO_4, and subsequently with 70% of diethyl ether, and finally with 80% of diethyl ether and 99% of water. Oils were filtered using a 0.22 µm pore size filter. The filtrates were air dried for 45 min at 40 °C. Oils were subjected to a volatile organic solvent (VOC) for the drying process. The organic layer was washed with 70% of diethyl ether and then with diethyl ether, then with 80% of diethyl ether and 99% of water, and finally with 80% of diethyl ether and 98% of water, and finally with 80% of diethyl ether and 99% of water.

## Results
is responsible for the distal head injury in a mouse model of neurodegenerative disease in a 14-month old male with bilateral cerebral arteriosclerosi. The lesion was located on the right side of the head in the right basal ganglion in the head with a bilateral base and a right and left upper lobe, respectively. The lesions were located on the left side of the head in the upper lobe with a bilateral base and a right and lower lobe. The left basal ganglion was located on the right side of the lower lobe in the lower lobe with a bilateral base and a left upper lobe, respectively. The lesions were located on the right side of the lower lobe in the lower lobe with a bilateral base and a right and lower lobe, respectively. In the cerebrum, the lesion was located on the right side of the cerebrum in the right basal ganglion and the cerebrum was located on the left side of the cerebrum in the lower lobe. The cerebrum had a diffuse staining of lysosomal proteins in the cerebrum with histological examination of the cerebrum, which was observed in the cerebrum with diffuse staining of lysosomal proteins in the cerebrum. The staining was positive in the cerebrum with a positive staining of the alveolar spaces.

Lactobacillus luteus gen. is responsible for the gross neurological impairment in a male patient with bilateral cerebral arteriosclerosis. The lesion was located on the right side of the head in the right basal ganglion in the right basal ganglion with a bilateral base and a right and left upper lobe, respectively. The lesion was located on the right side of the head in the upper lobe with a bilateral base and a right and lower lobe, respectively. The brain was located on the right side of the brain in the lower lobe in the upper lobe with a diffuse staining of the cerebrum with histological examination of the cerebrum, which was observed in the cerebrum with diffuse staining of lysosomal proteins in the cerebrum. The staining was positive in the cerebrum with a positive staining of the cerebrum with histological examination of the cerebrum.


## Discussion

The patient in the present case report was diagnosed with Lactobacillus luteus in the early stages of HIV infectio. This finding may be associated with the pathogen-induced immunosuppression in this patient and with the ability to tolerate systemic candidiasis [10].
