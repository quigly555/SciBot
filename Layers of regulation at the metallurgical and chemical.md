## Abstract
Several studies have evaluated the effects of combined therapy of caspofungin and flucytosine on the clinical course of myelofibrosis (MF) patients. The effects of caspofungin on the clinical course of MF, as well as on the prognosis of this disease, were mainly related to the response to antifungal treatment. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of flucytosine in these patients were different from those reported for fluconazole, which is usually used in the treatment of MF, and these differences were mainly related to the duration of therapy. In addition, the rapid and accurate identification of patients with active disease was crucial for the correct choice of treatment. In the present study, we compared the PK parameters and the prognosis of these patients before and after caspofungin treatment.

We retrospectively compared the PK parameters and the clinical course of our patients before and after 12 mg/kg caspofungin plus flucytosine plus 14 days of fluconazole therapy. PK parameters were compared with those reported in literature for active disease.

We noticed that caspofungin treatment showed a marked increase in the time to myelofibrosis onset from 14 days to the third week of therapy (P = 0.0169). The mean time to myelofibrosis onset in our patients who received caspofungin plus 14 days was 2.8 ± 0.4 weeks (0.34 ± 0.36, P < 0.0001 P = 0.0152), whereas no difference was found in the mean time to myelofibrosis onset after 14 days (0.96 ± 0.46 weeks P = 0.0294).

These results suggest that caspofungin plus 14 days was a useful therapy strategy for the treatment of active disease. However, it appears that caspofungin plus 14 days of treatment might be more appropriate for the treatment of active disease.


## Introduction

The bottom line on all eukaryotic enzymes and enzymes from the two genomes that have been sequenced is that these enzymes are the most highly regulated enzyme. The regulation is also highly diverse. In some of the eukaryotic enzymes, for example superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, the most abundant enzymes [27] and the most conserved enzymes [28], SOD and catalase have been identified. In SOD, three catalytic domains, called catalase (CAT) and catalase (CAT-II), are present in most of the enzymatic domains, but there is a small subset with a CAT domain. Catalase, like SOD, has two domains, CAT-III and CAT-IV [27]. CAT-III and CAT-IV have a catalytic domain, and catalase has a second catalytic domain with a CAT-II domain. The catalase domain is especially abundant in the CAT domain and the catalase-binding domain (CBB) of SOD [27], [29]. The catalases and enzymes from the two genomes share a similar architecture. The catalase from the two genomes, CAT II and CAT III, has a single, unique catalytic domain. The catalase domain of CAT II is particularly abundant in the CATII domain. However, in the genomes of the two genomes, CAT II and CAT III, a large difference in catalase activity exists between them. CAT II and CAT III are characterized by more than 10 distinct domains, which are organized into eight superfamilies, with the domain corresponding to the catalytic domain and the domain containing the hydroxyl group [27]. The catalase domain of CAT II and CAT III has a hydroxyl domain. In contrast, CAT II has a hydroxyl domain, and CAT III has a hydroxyl domain [27], [30].

As with SOD, catalase has a CAT-II-like catalytic domain, and catalase is not found in the catalase-binding domain of CAT II [27]. Instead, catalase is associated with the catalase-binding domain of CAT II, which contains a hydroxyl residue. In contrast, CATII has a hydroxyl residue, and catalase is involved in the catalase-binding domain of CAT II.


## Methods

.4. Synthesis and Purification of CBPs
Cobalt (6,8-dichlorofluorescin ethyl) and CuSO_4 (1,2-dichlorofluorescin ethyl) were synthesized from the solid phase by coupling the reaction of the solid phase with H_2O. Compound 7 was obtained by the reaction of the reaction mixture of the solid phase with 1,2-dichlorofluorescin ethyl at 37°C. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature (RT), then the reaction mixture was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant obtained was filtered and dried by evaporation. The dried residue was dissolved in methanol and used as the standard for the preparation of CBPs. The CBPs were dissolved in methanol at 0.5 mg/mL. The concentration of the solution was adjusted to the corresponding final concentrations of 10% (w/w). The stock solution was kept at -20°C until use.

4.5. Preparation of CBPs
To obtain a pure CBP, the reaction mixture (1 mg of crude CBP, 10% w/w) was mixed with 1 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 min, with the centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant obtained was filtered, dried, and dissolved in methanol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then cooled down to room temperature. The CBPs (4 mg of crude CBP, 10% w/w) were obtained by the reaction of the mixture of methanol and 1,2-dichlorofluorescin ethyl at 0.5 mg/mL. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 60 min, then cooled down to room temperature. The solution was filtered and dried by evaporation. The dried residue was dissolved in methanol at 0.5 mg/mL. The solution was filtered, dried, and dissolved in methanol.

4.6. Pathogenicity Assays
The assay of pathogenicity of the compounds was carried out by adding the pathogenicity of the tested bacteria to the growth of the tested strain.


## Results

In this study, we demonstrated that the fungal-derived macrophage isogenic factors were not confined to the metalloproteome (Figure 2. For example, the fatty acid profile of the metalloproteome was characterized by the presence of well-known fatty acids, namely: palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid, stearoyl-tannoyl-ACP, propionic acid, palmitoyl-CoA, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, linolenic acid, and stearoyl-CoA. Additionally, the macrophage fatty acid profile also showed that the composition of the fatty acid composition of the metalloproteome of the fungal-derived macrophage was characterized by the presence of fatty acids such as palmitoyl-CoA, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linoleic acid, stearoyl-tannoyl-ACP, propionic acid, palmitoyl-CoA, linoleic acid, linoleic acid, and stearoyl-CoA.

Identification of fungal-derived macrophage-derived cell line lines
To further explore the pathogenicity of fungal-derived cell lines, we employed an in vitro model of fungal-derived macrophage infection. To do so, we used live-cell imaging in the presence of the fungal-derived cell line, C. neoformans var. grubii. In the presence of C. neoformans var. grubii, the fungal-derived cell line was detected to be a viable host cell. Moreover, the presence of C. neoformans var. grubii did not influence the fungal-derived cell line (Figure 3).

We observed that the presence of the fungal-derived cell line was not associated with the pathogenicity of C. neoformans var. grubii (Figure 3). In the presence of C. neoformans var. grubii, the pathogenicity of C. neoformans var. grubii was associated with the fungal-derived cell line. However, when C. neoformans var.


## Discussion
In this case, a large concentration of ammonia was needed to obtain sufficient ammonium to supply the operating temperatur. The optimal concentration for this concentration in the synthesis of CO_2 was 10.0 mM, which was slightly higher than the level used by S. suis in the initial stages of its production [42].

The enzyme activity at the level of CO_2 was evaluated by the maximum activity of the enzyme. The maximum activity reached the highest concentration of CO_2 in the metalloprotein synthesis, followed by that of CO_2 from Tween 80 and then the concentration of CO_2 in the final synthesis. The highest activity of CO_2 was reached in the synthesis of CO_2P. The maximum activity was obtained in the synthesis of CO_2 from acetone. The highest activity was observed in the synthesis of CO_2 from ethanol.

The enzymes were then tested at a higher concentration of CO_2P, and the enzyme activity was then evaluated at the same concentration of CO_2P. The highest activity of CO_2P was obtained in the synthesis of CO_2P from acetone. The enzyme activity was not high enough for enzyme production at the metallurgical level, as the enzyme was not active in this process. The enzyme activity was in the range of 0.7-2.5 mM. The maximum activity of CO_2P was reached in the synthesis of CO_2P from acetone. The enzyme activity was in the range of 1.0-2.5 mM. The highest enzyme activity was achieved in the synthesis of CO_2P from acetone. The enzyme activity was not high enough for enzyme production at the metallurgical and chemical levels.
