## Abstract
Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients has increased significantly in recent years. Candida auris is a dermatophyte that causes life-threatening infections that are difficult to treat. The present study was designed to detect antifungal activity of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactarius and to identify its potential as a source of systemic antifungal antibodies.

One hundred and seventy-two adult patients with suspected fungal infection were enrolled in this study. Clinical features, fungal burdens, cultures, and anti-fungal autoantibodies were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antifungal activity of F. oxysporum f.sp. lactarius was investigated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (rTAF). The results indicated that F. oxysporum f.sp.


## Introduction
The filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora is a ubiquitous and frequent soil-dwelling fungus. This fungus is the causative agent of a devastating foliar disease called black spot, which is transmitted throughout the world, and can affect about 3 million people annually [1]. It can also cause serious invasive infection in immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or for stem cell transplantation [2]. Black spot is acquired by inhalation of conidia [3] or by traumatic inoculation of spores through traumatic infection of soil with a blackish-yellow color [4]. Infection is usually asymptomatic and a single inoculum is sufficient to cause a progressive and severe disease, called black-spots, which are difficult to treat with current antifungal agents. In the past, black spot was considered a non-pathogenic fungus, and this disease has been classified as fungemia-associated fungal disease, which is commonly associated with fungal infections in otherwise healthy people [5]. However, in the past two decades, black spot has become one of the most important plant diseases worldwide [6]. Black spot is caused by the dimorphic fungus Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labrouse and causes a disease called “black spot” [7]. It is caused by the interaction of A. rabiei with its host, the common phoretic mites, and thus, the fungus can survive and proliferate inside phoretic mites and then disseminate into the central nervous system, causing fatal pneumonia. The symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis, ataxia, myalgia, and myelitis [8]. The fungus can survive inside phoretic mites, colonize the phoretic mite body, and disseminate to different organs such as the brain, heart, lung, and kidneys [9]. The spread of the disease from a healthy host is caused by the action of a specialized pathogen, the Ascochyta rabiei (Aryanthaprobacter-Rabie) [7]. The pathogen can be cleared from the host and the infection can be controlled within the host. The majority of infections are either asymptomatic or asymptomatic, although some individuals may experience cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions that are often chronic and nonspecific, although they may not develop with dissemination.


## Methods
rg) to identify training set and data set for the PLEAN-independent training se. The data set was composed of training set 1 and the data set 2, which were set to train with random-mutation-based selection and the data set 3. In the data set, we set the training set to run with random-mutation loop-based selection at the sampling rate of 10% and with a sampling time of 1. A list of all sequence read pairs, and the list of the class for which the training set was trained (in the same condition as the data set), were added to the training set. We used two methods to detect the effect of selection on a sample. In the first method, we used PLEAN (http://plysan.org) to identify training set for the PLEAN-independent training set, and in the second method, we used the data set 3, which were set to run with random-mutation loop-based selection at the sampling rate of 10% and with a sampling time of 1. A list of all sequence read pairs, and the list of the class for which the training set was trained (in the same condition as the data set), were added to the training set.

## Results
The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manne. The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner. The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner. After all four primers were designed, the three libraries of the test conditions were obtained and the combined results are shown in Figure 4. The three libraries were prepared by three independent RT-PCR primers for each of the three RT-PCR primers.

The four libraries were prepared by two independent RT-PCR primers for each of the three RT-PCR primers. The RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner. The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner.

The four RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner. The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner.

To ensure that all the test conditions were suitable for the co-expression of the three RT-PCR primers, four additional independent RT-PCR primers (Table 1) were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner. The primers were designed to amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of the TF genes in a random-mutation loop-based manner.

When the primers were designed for the same gene in a different culture condition, the co-expression between the two RT-PCR primers was achieved, although the co-expression was not achieved in all conditions.


## Discussion
We found that, similar to . jirovecii, this P. jirovecii strain is highly tolerant for heat stress.

We found that this strain was highly tolerant for long-term growth at 37°C and for increased temperatures above 40°C. While P. jirovecii strains are known to tolerate temperatures above 40°C [10], we found no evidence of tolerance to 40°C heat stress. Similarly, P. jirovecii strains are also known to tolerate high temperatures as high as 37°C [5], which is below the threshold for adaptation to high temperature [10]. We also found that P. jirovecii strains were highly tolerant to elevated temperatures and that this tolerance was maintained even after 30 min of growth at 37°C. In addition, we found that P. jirovecii was highly tolerant to elevated temperatures and that this tolerance was maintained even after 10 min of growth at 37°C. In addition, we found that this strain was highly tolerant to high temperature.

We also found that P. jirovecii was highly tolerant to low temperature. We found that this strain was highly tolerant to low temperature but not to high temperature. Similarly, P. jirovecii strains were highly tolerant to elevated temperatures but not to high temperature. This strain is highly tolerant to high temperature but not to low temperature. Furthermore, P. jirovecii strains were highly tolerant to low temperature and also to high temperature. This suggests that P. jirovecii strain can adapt to high temperature by adapting to low temperature. However, our results do not rule out other potential mechanisms that may exist for adaptation of P. jirovecii strain to low temperature.

We found that P. jirovecii was highly tolerant for high temperature and stable temperature. We found that P. jirovecii strain was highly tolerant for high temperature but stable temperature. Additionally, we found that this strain was highly tolerant to low temperature. These results suggest that P. jirovecii strain may have other mechanisms that require temperature-dependent adaptation.

We found that P. jirovecii strain is highly tolerant to high temperature and stable temperature. We found that this strain was highly tolerant to high temperature but not to low temperature. Similar results were found in P. jirovecii strains.
