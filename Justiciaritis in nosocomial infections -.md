## Abstract
The increasing incidence of fungal infections has become a major concern in the modern era, leading to an urgent need for new therapeutic agents. In the recent years, numerous natural, in plant and fungal compounds have been isolated and then assessed for their potential anti-fungal activities. Among them are plant natural products with biological activities, such as terpenes, saponins, and natural products with chemical structures such as flavonoids, as well as hybrids, compounds with interesting structures such as polyphenols, fenoconients and terpenoids. Some of these products were reported for the first time in 2011 when they were also in the preliminary preparations for clinical applications. This review gives an overview of the reported activities of terpenes, saponins, flavonoids and natural products from plant and fungal origin that have been reported as anti-fungal against filamentous fungi, fungi, and molds.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for the highest number of deaths worldwide, with approximately 1.5 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2014 (1). Meningitis is a common complication of TB, with approximately 1,000,000 new cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2014 (2). A majority of cases are due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a multidrug-resistant pathogen, and in high-burden countries, such as the United States, the incidence is estimated to be over 20% (3). As a result of the development of highly active anti-TB therapy (HAART), the incidence of MTB-associated meningitis has declined significantly (4). However, the incidence of MTB-associated TB remains significantly higher than in non-TB cases, such as in the United States, where approximately 600,000 cases of MTB-associated meningitis occur annually (5,6). Although the incidence of meningitis is high, the overall mortality rate remains low (<20%) (7,8). Globally, there is little evidence that MTB is associated with HIV/AIDS; however, there is growing evidence that MTB increases the risk of developing HIV/AIDS (9). While there is still no consensus on the best treatment approach, it is clear that HAART and combination therapy can improve the outcomes of TB patients (10).


## Methods
 2017.

Fungal burdens in 2014 were compared with the burdens in 2014 for all patients in the study, and their proportions were compared by their proportions in 2014 for patients in the same study.

All of the experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The study was approved by the ethics committee at the University of Pretoria (Protocol number: 08-97-01). The research ethics committee of the University of Pretoria approved the study.

Sample preparation
The samples of the infected rice were collected from the rice fields in South Africa. The rice samples were stored at 4 °C for 2 days. The rice leaves were peeled and then transferred to a sterile dish in a plastic bag with 20% glycerol. The leaves were soaked in sterile water for 10 min. Then the rice samples were removed, washed with sterile distilled water, and used for inoculation of M. tuberculosis virus-containing rice (6.5% v/v), according to the method described by Selman et al. (2004).

M. tuberculosis virus-containing rice (6.5% v/v) was used as a positive control in this study.

Plant inoculation
The inoculation of M. tuberculosis virus-containing rice leaves with M. xanthosis (n = 4) was performed as described by Selman et al. (2004). The rice leaves were washed with sterile distilled water, and then the rice leaves were placed on a sterile glass slide and sprayed with 75 µl of a conidial suspension of M. xanthosis (n = 4). The slide was left in the dark at room temperature for 24 h. The M. xanthosis hyphae were stained with a suspension of 3% (w/v) hyphae powder of M. xanthosis (n = 4) in water. The slide was then put in a humidity chamber at 37 °C for 24 h. The slides were then placed in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 24 h. After the treatments, the M. xanthosis hyphae were stained with a suspension of 3% (w/v) M. xanthosis hyphae powder of M. xanthosis (n = 4). The slide was then placed in a humidity chamber at 37 °C for 24 h. The slides were then fixed in 100% methanol, and then air dried.


## Results
-4.2%) and (30.9-45.3%) in non nosocomial infections.

Novel pathogens - In combination with a weak oral microbiome, non nosocomial nosocomial infections are associated with oral candidiasis (44.3-44.5%). The most common nosocomial candidiasis is in non-osmotic otitis, in which oral candidiasis is responsible for 25% of nosocomial candidiasis, and in the nasopharynx and esopharynx of nasopharyngeal candidiasis. The incidence of oral candidiasis is not significantly different between the groups. In a multivariate analysis of the odds of nosocomial candidiasis, a weak oral microbiome is associated with higher incidence of nosocomial candidiasis.

Novel pathogens - Oral candidiasis is an uncommon nosocomial infection in patients with nosocomial infection, and it is caused by oral candidiasis in whom no oral candidiasis has been reported. The incidence of nosocomial candidiasis is 10-25% in nosocomial infection, and the incidence of nosocomial candidiasis in patients with non-osmotic otitis is 10-25% (44.3-45.3%) in nosocomial infection (P < 0.001).

Novel pathogens - A total of 89 oral candidiasis cases were reported, and no cases were assigned to a cohort. Most of the candidiasis cases were diagnosed in the patients with non-osmotic otitis, and the rate of nosocomial candidiasis was low in the non-osmotic patients (14.2% in non-osmotic otitis, 28.9% in non-osmotic otitis and 18.9% in nosocomial candidiasis). In the patients with non-osmotic otitis, the incidence of nosocomial candidiasis was less than in the patients with nosocomial infection (15.6% in non-osmotic otitis, 22.9% in non-osmotic otitis and 22.3% in nosocomial candidiasis).

Novel pathogens - In a multivariate analysis of the odds of nosocomial candidiasis, a weak oral microbiome is associated with higher incidence of nosocomial candidiasis in non-osmotic otitis than in nosocomial infection (P < 0.001).


## Discussion
The global burden of HIV and cryptococcal disease in South Africa is estimated at US$ 45 million, an area with the highest burden of C. neoformans infections and the lowest rates of AIDS-related death among African-Americans (Table 1). C. neoformans is the second most common fungal pathogen in South Africa. The burden of C. neoformans is estimated to be as high as 43.5% in South Africa [11] and as low as 22.
