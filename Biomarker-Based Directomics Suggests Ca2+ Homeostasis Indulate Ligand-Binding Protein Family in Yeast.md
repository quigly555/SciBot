## Abstract
In the last decade, the aim of this study has been the discovery of new antimycotics for the treatment of infections caused by pathogenic fungi. The discovery of new compounds against which new antifungal drugs have been developed has provided an impetus to further research on these antifungal drugs. The discovery of promising compounds against which new antifungal drugs are being developed has created new demand for the discovery of other compounds that would be effective against these fungi. This review discusses the potential of the use of natural products to develop new drugs against fungi and the potential of natural products in the treatment of invasive fungal infections.


## Introduction
Ganoderma lucidum (Lacerta spp.) is a very common plant of medical and economic importance, which is widely used in the world's major industries. G. lucidum is a perennial, weakly succulent plant and the most widely grown variety of G. mandrag√≥nica, being grown in tropical and subtropical areas. It is also grown commercially in tropical and subtropical countries, including Australia, the Philippines, and Malaysia.


## Methods
First, we used the . albicans strain H99 as a model for the second experiment. Second, we used a model that has a similar binding property to the C. albicans strain CAB660, and that we used to build a model for Ca2+ binding to Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+. Then, we used the models to build the model that is similar to the C. albicans strain CAB660, and that we used to build a model for Ca2+ binding to Ca2+. Finally, we used the models to build the model that is similar to the C. albicans strain CAB660, and that we used to build a model for Ca2+ binding to Ca2+.

Two-Stage Models of Ca2+ Binding to Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+. The first model was based on a model of Ca2+ binding to Ca2+, which is similar to the model of Ca2+ binding to Ca2+. The second model was based on a model of Ca2+ binding to Ca2+. The model is the same as the model of Ca2+ binding to Ca2+, except that the Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+1-bonded Ca2+. Finally, we used the models to build the model that is similar to the model of Ca2+ binding to Ca2+.

## Results
cerevisia. Using confocal laser confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that the yeast cells were surrounded by LigB, which was localized to the cell membrane (Figure 6A,B). We next examined the surface of the yeast cells in order to determine whether Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ binding were observed. We observed that Ca2+ binding was highly concentrated in the plasma membrane of yeast cells compared to the plasma membrane of Ca1+ negative control cells (Figure 6C,D). Furthermore, Ca2+ binding was more intense in the yeast cells than in Ca1+ negative control cells (Figure 6E). This suggests that the Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ binding of LigB and LigA in yeast cells is dependent on LigB and LigA, respectively, but not on Ca2+ binding. To further investigate whether the Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ binding are mediated through Ca2+ uptake or through Ca2+ channel activity in yeast cells, the Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ channel activity were evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of LigA or Ca2+ in the presence or absence of LigA or Ca2+ in the presence of LigA or Ca2+. LigA was detected in the absence of LigA, but not in the presence of LigA, whereas Ca2+ was detected in the presence of LigA (Figure 7A,B). The Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ channel activity in the presence of different concentrations of LigA or Ca2+ were evaluated by qRT-PCR in the presence or absence of LigA or Ca2+ in the presence or absence of LigA or Ca2+. In the presence of LigA or Ca2+, Ca2+ uptake was significantly reduced compared to the plasma membrane (Figure 7C,D). In the absence of LigA or Ca2+, the uptake of LigA and Ca2+ was significantly reduced compared to the plasma membrane (Figure 7E). The Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ channel activity in the presence of different concentrations of LigA or Ca2+ were evaluated by qRT-PCR in the presence or absence of LigA or Ca2+ (Figure 7F).


## Discussion
(2015) showed that the Ca2+ receptor (Ca2p) in filamentous fungi has conserved a Ca2+-binding protein, BGLK-B, to mediate regulation of Ca2+-signaling by a conserved calcium transporters (Papiliotrema and ZnC1. Their results indicated that this transporters (Papiliotrema and ZnC1) might be involved in the calcium channel-mediated calcium signaling in C. albicans. In yeast, a PAPILB1 homolog is present in the genome of C. albicans (Ko et al., 2011). In S. cerevisiae, a Ca2p-dependent transcription factor (CaTRF1) and a Ca2p-dependent protein kinase (CaMK1) are required for Ca2+-signaling (Liu et al., 2007; Jacobson et al., 2011). In this study, we found that in addition to CaTRF1, CaMK1 and Ca2p, all genes coding for other calcium transporters were identified, and they also showed significant similarity to CaTRF1 and Ca2p.

Here we found that C. albicans possesses two Ca2p-dependent transporters that are annotated in its genome. The first is the Ca2p-binding protein, BGLK-B. The second is the Ca2p-dependent protein kinase BGLK-B, which is also identified in the genome of C. albicans. The orthologous protein kinase BGLK-B is a key regulator of filamentous growth, including the ability to form biofilms and filamentous growth (Frazieri et al., 2011). It is a regulator of genes involved in energy production and cell differentiation in fungal pathogens (Liu et al., 2007). The dimorphic fungus Ustilago maydis, which is a dimorphic fungus, has two Ca2p-dependent proteins, BGLK-B and BGLK-A, which are required for the induction of filamentation. The latter protein is expressed by the fungus in a Ca2p-dependent manner (Frazieri et al., 2011). The BGLK-B protein plays a critical role in the filamentous growth of Ustilago maydis (Frazieri et al., 2011).
