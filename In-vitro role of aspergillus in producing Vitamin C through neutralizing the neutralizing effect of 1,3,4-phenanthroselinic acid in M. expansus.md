## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii has caused a major threat to immunocompromised people throughout its life cycle. Meningoencephalitis is caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and is associated with a high mortality rate. The key steps of disease progression are immune response and viral replication. To identify the genetic factors that contribute to the genetic background of disease, we investigated the genomes of wild-type strain Y.


## Introduction
Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by an encapsulated organism, termed a cryptococcus, can be a lethal clinical complication, and represents a serious, life-threatening challenge to human health. Cryptococcosis is a brain-threatening fungal disease, with a prevalence in the lower respiratory tract and mortality rates of 20-25% [1-3]. In the U.S., most cases of cryptococcosis are due to Cryptococcus neoformans, which accounts for approximately 5%-10% of all cases, and Cryptococcus gattii, which is predominantly caused by C. neoformans and accounts for only 0.6%-2.3% of cases [4].


## Methods
In addition, the non-neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid can be exploited to distinguish neutralizing and neutralizing effect of aqueous solutions of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid, respectively, as described by Kornerup and Wanscher [30. The neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid can be obtained in M. expansus with a pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2. The neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid is achieved in M. expansus with pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 1.

In-vitro role of Aspergillus flavins on neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid in M. expansus

The neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid and 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid in M. expansus was achieved through the neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid, as described by Kornerup and Wanscher [30]. In addition, the neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid is obtained in M. expansus with a pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2. The neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid in M. expansus with pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2 was observed in M. expansus with pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2, and the neutralizing effect of 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid in M. expansus with pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2 was observed in M. expansus with pH-neutralization of neutralizing factor of 2.

## Results

Effect of aspergillus strains on H_2O_2 production from . aculeatus
To test the effect of aspergillus strains on H_2O_2 production from M. aculeatus, the concentrations of H_2O_2 and the concentration of O_2 in the culture medium were determined by utilizing the results of a modified broth microdilution assay (S6 Fig). As shown in Fig 1, the Aspergillus strains induced a significant reduction in H_2O_2 production from M. aculeatus at a concentration of 25 mM. However, the growth of aspergillus strains was significantly inhibited at a concentration of 25 mM H_2O_2. The H_2O_2 production from Aspergillus strains was also reduced by a factor of approximately 5,000-fold at a concentration of 25 mM H_2O_2. These results indicated that the in vivo effect of Aspergillus strains was responsible for the reduction in H_2O_2 production by Aspergillus strains.

In addition to H_2O_2 production, we evaluated the influence of aspergillus strains on the growth of M. aculeatus. As shown in Fig 2, the aspergillus strains induced a significant decrease in M. aculeatus growth in the presence of the 1,3,4-phenanthroselinic acid (PFA) concentration. The addition of PFA to M. aculeatus culture medium resulted in a significant reduction in growth of the fungus at a concentration of 25 mM H_2O_2. In contrast, the growth of aspergillus strains was inhibited by a factor of approximately 5,000-fold at a concentration of 25 mM H_2O_2. The growth of Aspergillus strains was also inhibited by a factor of approximately 5,000-fold at a concentration of 25 mM H_2O_2. These results indicated that the in vivo effect of aspergillus strains was responsible for the reduction in H_2O_2 production by Aspergillus strains.

Effect of aspergillus strains on melanin production
To further analyze the in vitro melanin production from Aspergillus strains, the H_2O_2 production from Aspergillus strains was analyzed by the addition of 0.5 mM MVA to the culture medium.


## Discussion
 2013. Vitamin C is a major component of the physiological vitamin C systems in humans, which is why vitamin C deficiency is considered an adaptive response (Anderson and Esher, 2009).

The release of fluconazole in M. expansus was confirmed to be an effect of vitamin C deficiency. In addition, it was confirmed that there is a positive correlation between vitamin C level and fungal growth in the lung tissue. This result indicates that vitamin C levels in the lung tissue may be a factor in fungal virulence. In addition, fluconazole has been used for treating patients with asthma (Stuart, 2005) and bronchial asthma (Stuart et al., 2011).

In conclusion, M. expansus produces more vitamin C than does other fungi. Furthermore, the aspergilli presented in this study do not produce vitamin C.

The results of this study are also in agreement with previous studies which showed that aspergilli are a potent source of vitamin C (Sophia et al., 2009).

The results also showed that the aspergilli used for growth in the M. expansus were capable of producing vitamin C even after growth in the presence of vitamin C (Deng et al., 2007).

The results showed that the aspergilli were also able to produce vitamin C even after growth in the presence of vitamin C (Sophia et al., 2009).
