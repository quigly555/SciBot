## Abstract
The cell wall is the main interface between the externalized fungal biomass and the polysaccharides that comprise the cell wall. The composition of the cell wall, the composition of its polysaccharides, and the characteristics of its structural proteins are important for the design and development of various novel drugs and pharmaceuticals.

The cell wall is a structural and biochemical determinant that plays a key role in the virulence of fungi. In fungi, the composition of the cell wall is critical for its adaptation, as it determines both morphology and structure. The composition of the cell wall is also important for its therapeutic applications. Fungal biomass has multiple characteristics, such as its size, thickness, color, etc., and the differences between these phenotypes can be caused by different cultivation techniques. Growing on solid agar plates, however, reveals several techniques that allow growth on the same solid agar, but different cultivation techniques are required to overcome differences. Therefore, the identification of the cellular players involved in the adaptation to different cultivation techniques is necessary. In this review, we describe the differences in the composition of the cell wall of different fungal species and their roles in the physiology of the fungus. In addition, we analyze the effect that different cultivation techniques have on the cell wall structure of different fungal species and their properties as drug targets.

In order to identify the cellular players involved in the adaptation to different cultivation techniques, we describe the different cultivation techniques and their effect on the cell wall structure of different fungal species and their properties.


## Introduction
Meningoencephalitis is an entity that is characterized by progressive memory impairment and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, approximately 80% of meningitis cases are described to be due to bacterial meningitis, which is associated with a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other pathogens.1, 2, 3 The predominant bacterial pathogen in the central nervous system (CNS) accounts for 40% of the estimated 1.5 million meningitis cases.4, 5, 6, 7 Dysregulated and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines may account for the high bacterial burden in CNS.8, 9 As a consequence, the management of meningitis remains challenging. In fact, over 75% of CNS meningitis cases are asymptomatic, and symptoms are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis.2, 10

The most common infectious etiology in meningitis is bacterial meningitis, which is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cell apoptotic bodies, called necrotic bodies, in the CNS.9, 11, 12, 13, 14 The formation of necrotic bodies is a hallmark of bacterial meningitis. The formation of apoptotic bodies is related to the presence of microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), which are widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord. The MAMPs are produced by specific genetic mutations in the target protein cytochrome c oxidase and act as mediators of apoptosis. In addition, the cytotoxic properties of MAMPs are related to their cytotoxic activity.


## Methods
In our study, we examined the genomes of four fungal pathogens and their evolutionary history in order to identify gene sequences that could be useful for predicting their genome annotatio.

We first identified the orthologs of all fungal pathogens using the KEGG (KEGG Automatic Annotation Service) Orthologous Group Finder (KOG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/index.html) tool. Next, we used the AUGUSTUS tool (http://www.ambiguous.org/tools/AUGUSTUS/) to search the orthologs of different fungal pathogens in the fungal genomes of all species.

To identify the orthologs of the four fungal pathogens, we used a combination of the AUGUSTUS search tool and the KOG Orthologous Group Finder search tool. A BLASTp analysis was conducted with all the fungal pathogens identified by the AUGUSTUS tool. For that purpose, all fungal pathogens with no more than three representative orthologs in at least one of the four orthologs were considered as orthologous.

We analyzed the number of unique orthologs that were detected in the two fungi that were not identified by the AUGUSTUS search tool. We extracted the number of unique orthologs that were detected in each of the two fungi using the BLASTn tool (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

Finally, we used the KOG Orthologous Group Finder tool to identify orthologous gene families in the fungi and the fungi were classified according to the annotation of the genome.

To identify the orthologs that were not detected in the three fungal pathogens, we used the gene predictions of the four fungal pathogens and the genome of the three fungi and were also used to identify the orthologs in the fungi.

Gene Family and their Evolutionary History Analysis
We searched for the conserved domains in the orthologs of the three fungal pathogens using the BLASTp tool (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). We then used the KOG Orthologous Group Finder tool to identify conserved domains in the orthologs in the fungi.

The number of gene families for each species ranged from 8,816 in the set of strains from Japan to 1,412 in the set of strains from USA. The number of genes in each species ranges from 1,142 in the set of strains from Japan to 1,471 in the set of strains from USA.

The number of novel genes for each species ranged from 1,132 in the set of strains from Japan to 2,563 in the set of strains from Japan. The number of genes in each species ranges from 1,464 in the set of strains from Japan to 2,043 in the set of strains from USA. The number of genes in each species ranges from 2,156 in the set of strains from Japan to 2,027 in the set of strains from Japan. The number of genes in each species ranges from 1,724 in the set of strains from Japan to 2,835 in the set of strains from Japan.

In total, 1,049 novel genes were predicted from the sets of 2,152 strains from Japan and 1,073 genes from USA. These novel genes were classified into three categories: “Identification of novel genes based on the read counts”, “Identification of novel genes based on the predicted protein numbers” and “Identification of novel genes based on the protein sizes” (Table S3).

For each species, 1,063 novel genes were predicted from the set of 2,152 strains from Japan and 1,426 genes from USA. The number of genes in each species ranges from 1,010 in the set of strains from Japan to 1,067 in the set of strains from Japan.


## Discussion
In the Sanger database, there are no genes for which an NGS approach could be applied to detect the true presence of these genes in . cerevisiae. The most frequently identified genes in the same clade, however, are those involved in the translation machinery of the ribosomal protein. This approach has been applied in many species of the Saccharomycetales, including P. marneffei [25] and U. maydis [26] and U. hordei [27]. The two species of U. maydis were identified as closely related by the comparison of the sequences from this strain.

There are two other gene models for the ribosomal protein in P. marneffei, one for the transcription factor, and the other for the translation machinery. The ribosomal protein is highly expressed in a large number of fungal species. The most active ribosomal protein was identified in S. cerevisiae [24]. In the present study, the ribosomal protein is expressed at 100% in the majority of S. cerevisiae strains. However, in the most active strains, the mRNA is much lower. In contrast, the mRNA is expressed at the low expression level in S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus. Therefore, the ribosomal protein might be expressed at the low level in the active strains, which could explain why the ribosomal protein is expressed in low levels in the active strains. Another possible explanation for the low mRNA level in the active strains is that the ribosomal protein has a transcriptional activation mechanism that facilitates the ribosomal protein synthesis and degradation [28]. This mechanism could be involved in the ribosomal protein biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and U. maydis. However, the mechanism for the activation of this mechanism has not been described.

The ribosomal protein was also expressed at high levels in the most active strain (S7A Fig). The mRNA was highly expressed in the active strain. The ribosomal protein was expressed at the highest level in the S7A Fig. The ribosomal protein was expressed at a lower level in the S7A Fig.
