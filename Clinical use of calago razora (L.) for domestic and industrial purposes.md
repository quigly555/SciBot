## Abstract
The study was designed to assess the influence of different carbon sources on the composition of the fractions of Bacillus spp. (Bacillus bulgaricus, B. lunatus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis, and Torulaspora delbrueckii) recovered from leaves and stems of two different Alternaria alternata species (A. salamandriviradaceae and A. salamandriviforme) growing in the semiarid climate of the northernmost part of the country, respectively. The relative abundances of different carbon sources, such as a-3-OAc, a-3-Odi, and a-3-Odeol, were investigated in the collected samples. The results showed that the fractions of A. salamandriviradaceae and A. salamandiforme were subjected to various carbon sources, such as a-3-OAc, a-3-OAc, and a-3-Odi which may affect the properties of the products. Among the fractions recovered from leaves and stems of different species, only a small fraction were able to form biofilms.


## Introduction
Fungi constitute a significant component of the human microbiota, including opportunistic pathogenic fungi. The association of fungal diversity and pathogenicity with human health has been well-documented [1-3]. However, there is an alarming increase in the frequency of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis, with increased frequency in the intensive care unit (ICU) of patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CNS) [4-6]. These infections are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the skin to severe, invasive infections that can be fatal [7]. However, over the past decade, reports of C. albicans-associated infections have increased, indicating that there is a need for better understanding of the relationships between Candida and the host immune response [8-11].

Candida albicans is a heterogeneous fungal organism that can cause superficial mucosal infections in healthy individuals. However, certain species can cause serious invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Candida glabrata is the most common species that causes candidiasis, and C. parapsilosis is responsible for the majority of cases of invasive candidiasis [12, 13]. C.


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii strain H99 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). A.


## Results
Among the 31 clinical specimens examined, the most commonly used calago razora (Table 2) was used in 25 cases, with 6 other cases (5 cases with multiple calago razores) used in 3 cases and 1 case in 1 case eac. In 7 cases, calago razores were used in one case, 1 case each.

The most commonly used calago razores were used in 1 case each. The most commonly used calago razores were used in 6 cases each. One case each was used for the indications of endoscopists. One case was used for a diagnosis of nasal pneumonia, and 3 cases were used for the diagnosis of other medical conditions.
