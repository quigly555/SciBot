Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
During the last decades, the epidemiology and management of pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by the heterothallic aspergillosis (HA) species Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger, has evolved tremendously. Over the last decade, more clinical and animal models of the disease have been developed, the last of which, Alveolata (2015) is a new species with a different goal of understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary aspergillosis and its potential impact on animal health and ecosystems.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the suitability of Alveolata as a model species of pulmonary aspergillosis. The characterization of alveolata microflora, morphological characteristics, and host-pathogen interactions will be discussed in order to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, the effects of Aspergillus on the host-pathogen interaction are also discussed.

Differences in morphological characteristics and host-pathogen interaction between Alveolata and model species are discussed. Finally, the impact of Aspergillus on the host-pathogen interaction will be shown in detail.


## Introduction
263-266; ibi., p. 268.

Response: It is a vague term and we have modified the sentence. We have not considered other important taxonomic issues like the presence of other species.

Response: We have only considered the occurrence of Cryptococcus eurus among the species in the Genus Cryptococcus. We have also considered the significance of some species like C. albidus, C. brachycephalus, C. glabrata, and C. toga were among the Cryptococcus eurus. We have included the Cryptococcus genus in the text and have added the species name.

5. In the Abstract: The “Cryptococcus” epithet is used in the “Orbek” Dictionary, §2.1.7.1, to describe an encapsulated yeast, as cryptococcosis. The word “orbek” is used to refer to any yeast that does not grow on agar rather than to enumerate its species. This definition is very confusing and needs clarification.

Response: We have added the species name to the abstract.

6. In the Abstract: The “Orbek” Dictionary, §2.1.7.1, defines the type of the term “typical C. neoformans”. The type of the term “typical C. neoformans” is described in the Abstract: The term “typical C. neoformans” refers to a variety of yeast species, including C. neoformans, which is a major pathogen of the world population. The type of the yeast is defined by its morphology and the conidia produced. The conidia are spherical, elongated and straight, and are produced in a straight or slightly curved direction from the cell wall. The conidia are spherical, unbranched, and straight, and produce 3-6 exocysts per cell. The type of the yeast is defined by its morphology.

## Methods
Sequence analysis
The Eukarya-eukaryotic complex (Chromosphaeria) was analyzed using the complete genome sequence of the eukaryotic species, from which the phylogenetic analysis was performed. The eukaryotic species are considered to be highly divergent from each other and are therefore considered to be as close as possible to the eukaryotic species. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both a Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approach. ML was used to estimate the evolutionary relationship between the eukaryotic species, using the jModelTest v1.1.1 [23]. A Bayesian analysis was performed by using MrBayes v3.1.2 [24]. Bayesian data were obtained from MrBam v1.0.1. The MCMC was run with a burn-in of 10 000 generations, and the trees were sampled every 1000^th generation. The reliability of the MCMC was evaluated by checking that the MCMC chains converged on the same data before the branchpoint convergence. The parameters used for Bayesian analysis were set to use a reversible-jump-based approach with two chains, with each run involving three chains and four randomly chosen starting trees, as implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [24]. The convergence of the chains was evaluated by the stationary phase. The tree was sampled every 10 000 generations. The remaining trees were subjected to a single burn-in. The remaining trees were used to calculate the posterior probability of the topology for each analysis. The MCMC probabilities were estimated using the Kimura’s 2-parameter method and the posterior probability of the nodes of a tree was estimated using the Kimura's 2-parameter method [25]. The first step of the MCMC is the discretization of the first 25% of the nodes. The first 25% of the trees is discarded and the posterior probability of the nodes is then estimated using the Kimura's 2-parameter method [25].


## Results
The first clade is composed of two species, . eurus (CL008220) and C. eurus (CL006220) that were separated from the other species (Figure 4). The second clade is composed of three species, C. eurus (CL006220) and C. eurus (CL006220). The third clade is composed of C. eurus (CL006220) and C. eurus (CL006220) that shared a common ancestor with Cryptococcus eurus. The fourth clade is composed of two species, C. eurus (CL006220) and C. eurus (CL006220). The fifth clade is composed of three species, C. eurus (CL006220) and C. eurus (CL006220). The taxonomic revision of the Cryptococcus eurus phylogeny is currently underway and we are awaiting more information.

Sequence analysis of Cryptococcus eurus in the four clades
To analyze the taxonomic relationships of the four Cryptococcus eurus in the four clades, we conducted the SSFS analysis of the four species using the RAxML phylogeny (Figure 5). The SSFS tree is supported by all of the trees used in the phylogenetic analyses and the RAxML phylogeny is in good agreement with the ML analysis. The topology of the trees formed are similar to those of the ML tree (Figure 5). The tree topology of the SSFS tree showed that the four species grouped in the same clade and the clade formed by C. eurus was supported by all of the trees, while the clade formed by C. eurus was not supported by the ML tree (Figure 5). The SSFS tree also shows the same topology as the ML tree. Both trees generated from the SSFS analysis showed that the clade formed by C. eurus and the clade formed by C. eurus were supported by all of the trees, while the clade formed by C. eurus was not supported by the ML tree (Figure 5).

The RAxML phylogeny and the ML phylogeny were highly similar to each other and supported the separation of C.


## Discussion
cerevisia. Our phylogenetic tree revealed that Cryptococcus eurus is a monophyletic group with a position of 87-88% within the clade, and is in line with the phylogeny of S. cerevisiae, as well as the study of S. pombe [11].

C. eurus was first described from the genus Cryptococcus [20] and has a genome size of approximately 2.1 Mb and an average GC content of 50% and 48%, respectively. The species present in the genus have been reported as causing infection in humans [21,22,23,24], but the precise origin of the infection has not been ascertained.

Based on the phylogenetic tree, the present-day species C. eurus grouped into two distinct clades, and the former clade is constituted by the species T. atroviride and T. flavus, while the latter clade is composed of species with no apparent relation to each other. The species T. atroviride grouped into the clade containing species with C. eurus, while T. flavus clustered into a clade consisting of species with C. eurus and T. atroviride.

The phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2) revealed that the present-day species C. eurus has a position of 94% within the clade, and is in line with the phylogeny of S. cerevisiae, and the study of S. pombe [11]. The clade formed by C. eurus, T. atroviride and T. flavus is composed of the species T. atroviride, T. taiwanensis, T. pseunia, and T. infundibulum, which is characterized by a GC content of 52-69%. The species T. atroviride clustered with T. atroviride, and the clade formed by T. taiwanensis clustered with T. infundibulum. The present-day species T. infundibulum clustered with T. atroviride, and the clade formed by T. pseunia clustered with T. infundibulum.
