## Abstract
We recently isolated a serendipitous protein lacking a conserved variant of Dectin-1 from the fungus Sclerotinia homoeocarpa and demonstrated its potential role in pathogenicity. Here, we extend our current understanding of gene function and serendipity in this fungus with a view to future directions for research.

Dectin-1 is a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes. It is found across a wide range of eukaryotic kingdoms. In fungi, it is a large protein with a 70-kDa region that is preferentially localized at the poles. In contrast, Dectin-2, the largest protein, is found in the tropics and has a 73-kDa region that is more abundant at the poles. The major difference is that Dectin-1 is located at the heart of the red yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae septum and Dectin-2 is located at the center of the yeast eumycetoma. In addition, the septum is surrounded by a dense membrane that blocks its natural lining protein S-palmitoylation. We identified two S-palmitoylation sites in Dectin-1 that are important for seeding of the septum. Sesquiterpenes, however, were found to be the primary sources of these seeding sites. The current model is incorrect to suggest that only S-palmitoylation is required for the adaptation of fungi to the eukaryotic conditions in which they exist. Instead, we propose that the specific roles of these two seeding proteins play a role in the adaptation of fungi to life in the host environment.


## Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is a very reactive compound which has been used for centuries in medicine, cosmetics and agriculture (Druzhinina and Kalra, 2011). NO is a widely used co-factor in medical and cosmetics industries. It is used in the food industry for the treatment of various diseases. It is also used for the treatment of digestive disorders (van der Meijer et al., 2014) and fungal infections (Pardulescu et al., 2015). It has been used in the textile industry as a mixture for the production of natural fibers (bespoke fibers) and a dye (derp-derp) for textile industry (Hole et al., 2012; Kronstad et al., 2015).


## Methods
neoformans, Dictyostelium discoideum, Scedosporium kluyveri, and Aspergillus niger, were used in this stud. All strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and stock cultures were stored at -70°C.

Antifungal activity of T. vulgaris
The antifungal activity of the synthesized T. vulgaris compound 2.5 µg/mL was tested against two types of filamentous fungi, Candida albicans (ATCC 208821) and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 52794) and the antifungal activity of T. vulgaris against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans was compared with the control. A volume of 1 mL of a crude T. vulgaris extract was prepared as previously described [11], with the addition of 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.5 mL of sterile distilled water. The extracts were then mixed with DMSO (1.5%) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again to separate the C. albicans and C. neoformans cells. The combined supernatant was again centrifuged to separate the Cryptococcus and Aspergillus cells. The resulting pellets were suspended in DMSO (1.5%) and diluted to 5% for the preparation of the compound 2.5 µg/mL.

T. vulgaris conidia
The fungal strains were cultivated on YEPD medium at 37°C for 2 days, and the mycelium was harvested. The mycelium was harvested by filtering through a 70 µm pore size nylon filter, and the conidial suspension was filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer. The conidia were inoculated onto YEPD agar medium at 30°C for 3 days, and the mycelium was harvested. The mycelium was harvested by filtering through a 70 µm pore size nylon filter, and the conidial suspension was filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer.


## Results
. Analysis of B. dermatitidis Strains
To evaluate the ability of the B. dermatitidis strains to produce IL-10, a suspension of IL-10 was added to B. dermatitidis cultures at an initial concentration of 1.0-1.5 µM. The results are summarized in Table 1. The T. vinifera strains produced significantly less IL-10 than the B. dermatitidis strains at a concentration of 1.0 µM. As shown in Figure 1, B. dermatitidis strains produced significantly more IL-10 than the B. dermatitidis strains in a concentration of 1.0 µM. IL-10 production was inhibited by IL-10 concentrations of 0.5-1.0 µM. The results showed that the B. dermatitidis strains could produce the cytokines IL-10, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-1ß, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-1ß, and IL-6. In addition, the B. dermatitidis strains could produce IL-10 and IL-1ß at concentrations of 1.0-1.5 µM, as shown in Table 1.

3.2. B. dermatitidis Strains Are More Sensitive to IL-10 than B. amylolentus Strains
The inhibitory activity of IL-10 in B. dermatitidis was evaluated using the IL-10/IL-1ß ratio assay (Figure 2). The IL-10/IL-1ß ratio assay revealed that the IL-10/IL-1ß ratio of the B. dermatitidis strains was significantly higher than the B. amylolentus strains, which indicated that IL-10/IL-1ß ratios were higher than the T. vinifera ratios. The results showed that the IL-10/IL-1ß ratio of the B. dermatitidis strains was higher than the B. amylolentus strains, which indicated that IL-10/IL-1ß ratios were higher than the T. vinifera ratios. The results showed that the IL-10/IL-1ß ratio of the B. dermatitidis strains was higher than the B. amylolentus strains, which indicated that IL-10/IL-1ß ratios were higher than the T. vinifera ratios.


## Discussion
The mouse host is an excellent model for examining immune responses and disease development in different organs, and to distinguish between immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice [4, 12, 14]. The immunopathology of immunocompromised mice is considered to be dependent on the pathogenesis of the disease [14]. In this study, mice were immunosuppressed with a highly potent immunosuppressive agent, a monoclonal antibody such as CpG, and we found that immunosuppressive therapy had an influence on the magnitude of the immune response to C. glabrata. Immunosuppression with C. glabrata reduced the amount of IL-17Ra, IL-12Ra and TNF-a in the lungs of immunocompromised mice, but this effect was not observed in immunocompetent mice. On the other hand, immunosuppression with C. albicans resulted in a significant increase in the amount of IL-17, IL-22 and TNF-a in the lungs of immunocompromised mice, but this effect was not observed in immunocompromised mice. This finding suggests that the immune response is primarily to C. glabrata. In addition, the increased levels of Th2 cytokines and Th1 and Th17 cytokines in immunocompromised mice was observed in immunocompromised mice, but the immune response to C. glabrata was not to immunosuppression. These findings suggest that immunosuppression with C. glabrata has a significant immunosuppressive effect on the immune response to C. glabrata, and that the immune response is mainly to C. glabrata.
