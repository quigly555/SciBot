## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are devastating complications of solid organ transplantation (SOT). We herein report a case of Trichosporon fungemia in a 48-year-old man with idiopathic granulomatosis who had undergone a new SOT. The antifungal regimen was changed to a combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FDC) and doxorubicin (DF). The patient had been taking fluconazole fumarate for the past 5 years. He had taken FDC for the last two years. Fungal cultures were done on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar at our institution.


## Introduction
Protein phosphorylation is an essential cellular process and is central to many biological processes, including growth, differentiation, migration, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and apoptosis of all living cells [1,2]. The phosphorylation status of proteins varies among organisms, and several proteins may be phosphorylated in response to external environmental signals, such as nutrient competition or the action of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) [3,4]. Protein phosphorylation is crucial for various biological processes, including growth, differentiation, migration, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cell death [5]. For example, phosphorylation of cysteine residues is essential for the function of the human serum albumin-binding protein (HBP1), which is important for the integrity of the cell membrane and protein synthesis [6,7]. Therefore, phosphorylation of proteins in response to the various stresses or signaling molecules (e.g., hormones) can be an important response in regulating various biological processes [8]. In addition, proteins can be phosphorylated in different ways by different cellular processes [9]. The number of phosphorylated proteins in a cell depends on many factors, including pH, temperature, cell volume, and membrane potential [10]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the phosphorylation status of proteins in response to different stresses. In addition, this review discusses the state of the art in the field of protein phosphorylation studies and discusses the current understanding of phosphorylation in response to stresses.


## Methods
dermatitidis

Antifungal resistance to cercosporin was assessed with a modified bacteremia test (BDS) for . albicans. The cercosporin resistance index (DRI) was calculated using the following equation:

where A, C, G, are the resistance rates at which the cercosporin is used in cercosporin; B, D, E, are the resistance rates at which the cercosporin is used in Bd, and R, S, T, and T_T_T are the gene or protein-protein interactions; and N, N_N, and N_N_N_T are the number of nonsynonymous genes and the number of synonymous genes, respectively; and D, E, N_N, and N_N_N_T_T_T_N are the number of homokaryotic genes and the number of synonymous genes. The cercosporin resistance index was calculated as follows:

where N, N_N_N_T_T_T_N are the genes and protein-protein interactions; N_N_N_N_T_T_N is the gene or protein-protein interactions; and N_N_T_N_T_N_T_N is the cercosporin-specific resistance rate.

Molecular Biodiversity
The presence of major molecular diversity was assessed using the Index of Mutation [29] and Mutation Index [30] algorithms for the P. brasiliensis genome [31]. The indices were calculated using the Bionumerics v. 7.1.0 program [32] (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/Bionumerics/index.html) [33]. The Mutation Index is calculated based on the number of mutations per site across all sites of a database, as follows:

where <U+03C1>_a is the mutation index; <U+03C1>_c is the total number of sites of a database; and <U+03C1>_p is the mutation index of a single mutation per site. The number of mutations per site in the database was calculated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 10.0 [34] with the following parameters: *p = 0.


## Results
(2016) for the effect of the . oryzae genome design on R. oryzae and a group of wild type (WT) as well as the deletion of five loci: lcb1, rbf1, rbf2, rca1, and rca2.

The ability of R. oryzae to survive against a host was also investigated in the presence of other pathogens, including an as yet unidentified fungal pathogen. The rbf1 locus, which encodes the N-terminal signal peptide, was deleted and the R. oryzae-induced peritoneal macrophage colony forming unit (MPU) was replaced by a control LN (Figure 2A). The rbf2 locus, which encodes the N-terminal signal peptide, was also deleted and the R. oryzae-induced peritoneal macrophage colony forming unit (MPU) was replaced by a LN (Figure 2A). The resulting strains were confirmed by PCR amplification, amplicon sequencing and sequencing.

The R. oryzae genome design was also successful in the killing of Rhizopus oryzae in this study. The results showed that R. oryzae was able to kill an animal in two hours (Figure 2B). The killing was comparable to that of the control. The killing of Rhizopus oryzae in this study was also observed in the presence of various pathogens, including the fungus A. niger and the fungus P. guilliermondii, with the exception of Rhizopus oryzae killing by P. guilliermondii.

R. oryzae Is Impaired in Stress Response
The results of this study suggest that R. oryzae might be able to survive in a hostile environment. However, this study also showed that R. oryzae is susceptible to many stresses, including oxidative, nitrosative, nitrite, heat, ionic, nitrosative stress, oxidative stress, and salt stress. To investigate the physiological mechanisms of stress response, stress-induced expression of the R. oryzae genes was analyzed.

## Discussion
cb.nlm.nih.gov/SNF database), we found that the A. fumigatus strain A10.2 was the only strain to respond to the high-affinity (H-bond) environment in which to establish a successful resistance response to the fungus. In contrast, the A. fumigatus strain A10.1 did not respond to this H-bond, indicating that the A. fumigatus strain A10.1 is not a suitable candidate for this H-bond.

To determine whether the H-bond provides a competitive advantage to the fungus, we measured the response of A10.2 to high-affinity H-bond in response to a fungal cell wall. We found that the fungus A10.2 was able to establish a strong and sustained resistance to H-bond in response to this high-affinity H-bond. The A10.2 strain also displayed a strong and sustained response to H-bond when compared to the strains of A10.1, A10.2a and A10.3 (data not shown).

In addition to the H-bond, the strain of A10.2 showed a strong and sustained response to the high-affinity H-bond in response to this high-affinity H-bond. The A10.2 strain also exhibited a strong and sustained response to the high-affinity H-bond when compared to the strains of A10.1, A10.2a and A10.3.

We performed PCR experiments with A10.2a and A10.3. We found that the PCR products of A10.2a and A10.3 differed significantly from those of the PCR products of A10.1, A10.2a and A10.3, and we found that the PCR products of A10.2a and A10.3 differed significantly from those of the PCR products of A10.1, A10.2a and A10.3, respectively.
