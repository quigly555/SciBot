## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a globally distributed fungus that has caused various invasive diseases. In this study we aimed to isolate and molecularly characterize two C. gattii isolates from southern China, using the recently developed ITS/6.8S rDNA region and the recently established nrDNA region of two Chinese C. gattii isolates (G9 and G11). The isolates were identified as C. gattii by the morphology and by genotyping using the newly described ITS/6.8S rDNA region. Microscopy examination of the two isolates revealed characteristic dark brown colonies with discoloration of germ tubes on the surface. Both colonies had a pale yellowish-orange color, and both had light yellow colonies with reduced stipe. The presence of ascospores and dimorphic yeast cells was confirmed by light microscopy. The two C. gattii isolates were mainly distributed in southern China. Only one isolate (G9) was identified as Chinese, and the remaining isolate (G11) was not.


## Introduction
Fungal infections, particularly aspergillosis, invasive aspergillosis (IA) and mucormycosis, mycoses of the mucosa, are among the most important global health problems (Abbas and Diekema, 2016). The opportunistic fungal pathogen A. fumigatus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (Calvo et al., 2007; Kowal et al., 2007; Nijkamp et al., 2016). However, antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B (AmB), polyenes, flucytosine (5FC) and flucytosine (5FC), are associated with high toxicity, low bioavailability, high costs, high frequency of failure, and the emergence of drug resistance (Chen and Diekema, 2016). Therefore, new antifungal agents are urgently needed to control these infections.


## Methods
This type of reactive tagging is called “susceptible” and represents the presence of a “breathing down” to metabolic activation caused by heavy or light stimul. In addition, it has been shown that Urease-dependent malignancies occur in many patients with severe ocular disease, but not all ocular diseases are ocular diseases [61]. As a result, these ocular diseases can be a significant barrier for the immune system, leading to the formation of lesions that are susceptible to Urease-mediated wound repair and thus an important immune response in some cases [62].

In order to further characterize the role of ergosterol in the pathogenesis of chronic infections, Urease-related malignancies in patients with corneal opacity and urease production have been reported [64]. The report from (the last reported instance) also suggested that the ocular lesions that were previously observed in this patient may be due to urease-related malignancy [65]. In addition, Urease-related malignancies can occur in patients with viral infections, but this is not the case in the case of other fungi [66]. The most recent study indicated that the presence of OVA in a corneal opacity patient is not considered as a “synergistic” relationship between urease and blood urease production.

If the ocular disease is proven, it is considered as a “potential risk factor” for keratitis and a “permissive condition” for the immune system [67]. If the corneal opacity is diagnosed, the presence of ocular lesions is considered as a “positive” sign [68].

If the ocular diseases are treated successfully, a “potential risk factor” is now considered as a “non-risk factor” in the keratitis. If a patient is treated with urease, the presence of urease production is considered as a “positive” result in keratitis [69].

Additionally, the occurrence of urease-related malignancies in patients with keratitis is generally considered a “risk factor” [70]. In addition, the presence of ocular diseases in patients with keratitis is considered to be a “non-risk factor” in the ocular lesions [71].


## Results
Urease-dependent caspase-3 and caspase-4 gene expression was significantly decreased in response to fungal infection (Fig 3A and B. Urease-dependent caspase-3 and caspase-4 gene expression was also significantly decreased by fungal infection, but not by Casp3-induced caspase-3 expression (Fig 3A and B). Moreover, Casp3 and Casp4 gene expression was significantly increased by fungal infection in response to Casp3-induced Urease-D-mediated inhibition (Fig 3A and B). Urease-dependent caspase-4 gene expression was also significantly increased by fungal infection, but not by Casp3-induced caspase-4 gene expression (Fig 3A and B). Moreover, Casp3 and Casp4 expression was significantly decreased by fungal infection, but not by Urease-induced caspase-3 gene expression (Fig 3A and B). These data indicated that Urease-dependent caspase-3 and caspase-4 gene expression was up-regulated by fungal infection in response to Casp3-induced Urease-D-mediated inhibition (Fig 3). Urease-dependent caspase-4 gene expression was also increased by fungal infection, but not by Casp3-induced caspase-3 gene expression. Together, these results indicate that Casp3 and Casp4 play a role in Urease-dependent caspase-3 and caspase-4 gene expression, but not in Urease-dependent caspase-3 gene expression.

Urease-dependent caspase-4 gene expression was significantly decreased by fungal infection, but not by Casp3-induced caspase-3 gene expression
In S. cerevisiae, Ure1 is the only Urease-dependent caspase-4 gene that is not essential for normal function of Urease [27].

The Urease-Dependent Pathways in Human Fungi
Previous studies have revealed that Urease-dependent transcriptional activation is mediated by Urease-GFP-GFP (Ahn et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008) (Figure 6) and that this pathway is involved in various pathologies in humans, including fungi (Baker et al., 2014). It is therefore of interest to investigate the role of Urease-Dependent pathways in the pathogenesis of human fungal pathogens. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the Fc<U+03B3>R-bck1<U+0394>Urease-Dependent pathway is involved in the defense against aflatoxigenic fungi (Ahn et al., 2008). In the present study, we found that the Urease-Dependent pathways were associated with the defense against aflatoxigenic fungi, including Fusarium graminearum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Coccidioides immitis. Additionally, Urease-Dependent pathways were found to be associated with the response to starvation (Figure 7), which is consistent with the results of other studies (Dibas et al., 2010; Murphy et al., 2012). In addition, the results of previous studies (Murphy et al., 2012) and our current study are in line with the results of our current study.

In addition to the pathogenic mechanisms, it is possible that the Fc<U+03B3>R-bck1<U+0394>Urease-Dependent pathway also plays a role in the response to various stresses, such as heat, cold, oxidative stress, and environmental stresses. Heat-sensitive fungi have been previously reported to exhibit different phenotypes in the presence of various stresses (Hodkinson et al., 2005; Heitman et al., 2006; Kontoyiannis et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013; Hoda et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2014), which could explain why the Urease-Dependent pathways are enriched in fungi. In addition to these phenotypes, Urease-Dependent pathways have been reported to have a role in stress response, including heat-sensing (Bakker et al., 2005; Heitman et al.
