## Abstract
It harbors thousands of proteins that function as effector protein. Many of these proteins are important regulators of transport proteins and transcription factors in cells undergoing apoptosis. However, the role of these regulators in light transmission and the regulation of apoptosis have not been completely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the CSF light response factor lightT in regulating cell death, including the regulation of transporters and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We found that, in addition to light transporters, the light protein tyrosine kinase AflN, which plays a role in the light response and transport machinery in C. elegans, but whose role in light transmission and transport is not clear, also controls the expression of the critical cell survival genes Cop51 and Fus3. A syngas deletion mutant of this protein significantly reduced the capacity of normal cells to die from lethal infection by caspase-1 efferent cells. In addition, the death of the deleted Cop51 and Fus3 mutants was increased more rapidly in the absence of light than in the light state, even in the presence of the critical cell survival genes such as those encoding the heat shock protein Hsp70, the heat shock protein Ndr1, and the MAP kinase kinase Kinase Kinase Kuntze-Laglopievo, which function as essential virulence factors. We found that, during the course of infection, light repolarizes the CSF to a state of inactive condition, rendering cells unable to form persistent filaments that become trapped by other cells. Consequently, the cell is not able to retrace the defect in light transmission and replication, and, in turn, it is reduced in size and complexity. Finally, in a mouse model of infection, we found that the expression of key virulence factors, including the HLA-DR and the PARP activator family of AflN, was restored in the sinus model. Our data indicate that the loss of the critical virulence factors, Cop51 and FgD, can be harnessed as a means to restore the virulence restored by the Cop51 and FgD defects in C. elegans.

IMPORTANCE The light response is essential for cell survival and proliferation in the human eye.


## Introduction
Similarly, the UAM33 promoter of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe light-regulated gene Pme2 has a strong promoter-gene interaction with the UAM33 promoter, thus suggesting that UAM33 might regulate Pme2-encoding genes in light microscop. Finally, the UAM33 promoter of the S. pombe light-regulated gene Mid1 has strong promoter-gene interaction with the UAM33 promoter, thus suggesting that UAM33 might regulate the gene regulation of cell cycle progression. Finally, the UAM33 promoter of the Fusarium graminearum light-regulated gene Fil3 has strong promoter-gene interaction with the UAM33 promoter, thus suggesting that UAM33 might regulate the expression of Fil3, which is a regulatable protein involved in plant infection. Finally, the UAM33 promoter of the mycotoxin polymyxin, paxilline, showed strong promoter-gene interaction with the UAM33 promoter of the Penicillium chrysogenum light-regulated gene BxN have strong promoter-gene interactions with the UAM33 promoter, thus suggesting that UAM33 might regulate the expression of Penicillium chrysogenum, a pathogen that causes anthracnose on wheat, might be involved in the disease.

2. The UAM33 promoter of the Fusarium graminearum light-regulated gene FgE and FgP are strongly induced during plant infection and are required for the induction of the UAM33 gene FgE. The UAM33 promoter of FgE has been shown to be required for the induction of FgP in F. graminearum. These results suggest that the UAM33 promoter is not only required for the induction of FgE, but also is required for the induction of FgP and FgE in order to complete the infection cycle.

3. The F. graminearum light-regulated gene FgC is the most abundant in the Fusarium graminearum and is found in the majority of the affected plant tissues.


## Methods

Light microscope
. neoformans strains were grown at 37°C on Sabouraud agar (SDA) plates for 7 days. For the growth assay, conidia from a 0.5 McFarland standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated onto 10 mm diameter glass coverslips and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The cells were then transferred to Sabouraud agar plates containing 5% sheep blood.

C. neoformans cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, counted with a light microscope and adjusted to 1 × 10^7 cells/mL.

C. neoformans cells were treated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to evaluate the role of the transcription factor, C-terminal, in the lipid peroxidation pathway.

## Results
rubrum genome encodes at least six light-induced protein kinases, among which two have been identified in other fungi [12,15. A set of four PKA (two in Aspergillus niger and two in M. oryzae) light-induced proteins was found in several fungal species, suggesting that they are involved in a diverse set of biological processes (Figure 3). However, a set of seven PKA light-induced proteins was found only in Aspergillus spp., suggesting that they have a variety of functions (Figure 3). The PKA light-induced proteins were more abundant in fungal species, such as the parvovirus (Figure 3) and the giant fern (Figure 3).

LAMP has been proposed to regulate several physiological processes in plants [16,17,18,19]. In addition, light has been demonstrated to promote the activity of several fungi, including A. niger [20-22] and M. oryzae [21]. We have recently identified two light-induced PKA proteins, TmCyp51 and TmCyp6, that are in fact light-induced proteins, consistent with our recent publication [23]. However, T. rubrum lacks both the PKA and PKA-specific lysine kinase genes, and the role of these two proteins in the light response has not been elucidated.

A. niger is a facultative pathogen, which is also known as a pathogen of food crops and vegetables [24]. Therefore, we have identified several PKA and PKA-specific lysine kinase genes in the genome. We identified the PKA light-induced lysine kinase genes in A. niger, M. oryzae and S. cerevisiae (Table S4). We also found that in the M. oryzae genome, all five lysine kinase genes were detected in all five fungal species tested, and three of them were significantly up-regulated in the PKA strain (Table S4). T. rubrum strains with different gene models had similar expression profiles. However, the three PKA lysine kinase genes were up-regulated in the PKA strain, suggesting that they are involved in a diverse set of biological processes.


## Discussion
 2014. In this study, we focused on the transcription factor (Ftr1) gene. The Ftr1 gene is a representative of the majority of light-regulated genes in Fusarium. The transcription factors that are most often associated with light-regulated genes in Fusarium are known as Ftr1, Ftr2 and Ftr3 (Baker et al., 2007; Fortunato et al., 2010; Bellini et al., 2014; Fortunato et al., 2015). However, we were unable to identify the transcription factor(s) that are regulated by light. Ftr3, the most common Ftr1 gene in Fusarium, is regulated by light but not by light-induced changes in the transcription factor. This suggests that Ftr3 may have a role in regulating light-responsive genes, such as Ftr2 and Ftr3. We speculate that Ftr3 may be involved in the regulation of light-responsive genes. We also found that the upregulation of light-responsive genes (such as Ftr1) and induction of Ftr3 expression by light in Fusarium suggests a role of Ftr3 in the regulation of Ftr1.

Our study also showed that Ftr3 is involved in regulating the expression of Ftr1, Ftr2 and Ftr3 (data not shown). In this study, we discovered that the expression of the Ftr3 gene was downregulated in the <U+0394>Ftr3 strain. This is consistent with the transcription of Ftr3, which is regulated by light, to be regulated by Ftr1. However, the Ftr3 gene expression in the <U+0394>Ftr3 strain was not different from the <U+0394>Ftr1 strain. The expression of the Ftr1 gene was also upregulated in the <U+0394>Ftr1 strain. This may suggest that Ftr1 may have a role in regulating the expression of Ftr1. However, the expression of the Ftr3 gene in the <U+0394>Ftr3 strain was not different from the <U+0394>Ftr3 strain.
