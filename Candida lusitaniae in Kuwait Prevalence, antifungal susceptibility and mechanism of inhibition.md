## Abstract
Lipoprotein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) play a central role in the modification of glycoproteins, particularly in eukaryotes. These enzymes play a crucial role in the transport and lignocellulolytic process, particularly in plants and animals. In this study, we characterized a family of five o-glycosyltransferase-encoding genes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. These four-orion-domain O-mannosyltransferases play a crucial role in the o-glycosylation of several plant pathogenic fungal families, including the trichothepinins, the ascomycetes, the plant pathogenic fungi, and the yeasts. In addition, the mycelium size of a representative of the mycelium types grown in this study was examined, and the results indicated that these five O-mannosyltransferases likely encode a novel protein family that contains the four typical mannosyltransferases found in eukaryotes.


## Introduction
Acinetobacter species are the most common nosocomial pathogens, with infections in hospitalized patients in the United States and Europe accounting for more than 70% of all nosocomial infections in these hospitals (Bovers et al. 2015). Among these pathogens, Acinetobacter species have emerged as the most important causes of nosocomial infections, with infections in critically ill patients being the third leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the United States (Pfaller & Diekema 2008). In the United States, the number of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections with Acinetobacter species increased from 1.2 million in 2008 to 2.3 million in 2012 (Sutton et al. 2008), which has been attributed to a shift in the epidemiology of Acinetobacter species from the hospital environment to the outpatient setting (Pfeifer et al. 2012) and the continued emergence of strains with resistance to at least three antifungals (Saini & Monain 2008) in the United States and Europe. This trend is mirrored in Europe, where the number of infections due to asymptomatic strains with atypical bacterial and fungal pathogens has increased from 10 in 2004 to 15 in 2010 (Saini et al. 2010). The United States has the highest number of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (Saini et al. 2010), with infections occurring in the first month of intensive care (Saini et al. 2008).

The majority of the infections caused by Acinetobacter species are nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, (Bidgeway & Rothrock 2004). In Europe, infections are caused by patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and those with severe and persistent bacterial and fungal pneumonia (Saini & Monain 2008). In the United States, infections by Acinetobacter species are largely caused by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), patients with pulmonary fibrosis, and patients with cystic fibrosis (Saini et al. 2010).


## Methods
The antifungal susceptibility testing of the malaria vaccine and the control (.75 µg/mL of Trichomonas aeruginosa or 0.5 µg/mL of Candida glabrata) were also done in the same animal model.

Antifungal susceptibility testing
The stock suspension of T. rubrum was used in all the assays. The assay was done in 96-well microtiter plate with 96-well microplate. Inoculum of T. rubrum was prepared according to the method of Mowse [31]. The inoculum was adjusted to a final density of 2 × 10^4 CFU/mL with RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 20% (v/v) of the antifungal drugs. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the mycelia was removed by filtration and washed twice with sterile water. The mycelia were then placed on a clean glass slide, covered with a paper towel and placed in a sterile container. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the mycelia was removed by filtration and washed twice with sterile water. The clear mycelia from the bottom of the well were stained with 50% (v/v) ethanol.


## Results

Antifungal activity
The results of the antifungal activity are shown in Table . We observed a significant reduction in the MIC_50 of Amphotericin B for the majority of Candida species in the presence of azole drugs. In contrast, in the presence of fluconazole, the MIC_50 values for all Candida species were reduced to 2 µg/ml for Candida albicans (Table 1). On the other hand, we observed the MIC_50 values for all Candida species in the presence of amphotericin B, suggesting that fluconazole treatment is fungicidal.

Antifungal activity
The antifungal activity of Amphotericin B was tested in all Candida species except for Candida lusitaniae. The MIC_50 values for amphotericin B were reduced to 8 µg/ml for Candida lusitaniae and 0.5 µg/ml for Candida lusitaniae in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B. The MIC_50 values for amphotericin B for Candida lusitaniae were reduced to 0.5 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml for Candida lusitaniae in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. The results indicated that amphotericin B is fungicidal in Candida lusitaniae.

Antifungal activity
The results of the antifungal activity are shown in Table 2. We observed a significant reduction in the MIC_50 values for amphotericin B for all Candida species in the presence of fluconazole, and amphotericin B was fungicidal in all Candida species except for Candida albicans. In contrast, the MIC_50 values for amphotericin B for Candida lusitaniae were reduced to 2 µg/ml in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively.

Antifungal activity
The results of the antifungal activity are shown in Table 3. All Candida species except for Candida albicans were fungicidal in the presence of fluconazole, and amphotericin B was fungicidal in all Candida species except for Candida lusitaniae in the presence of fluconazole and amphotericin B.


## Discussion
The prevalence of cryptococcosis in Kuwait is under investigatio. The infection occurs in patients with an immunocompromised state. It is difficult to diagnose, diagnosis and treatment in such a large population of patients. The main diagnostic challenge is that the patient is not a healthy individual with immune deficiencies. Thus, most of the cases were diagnosed in immunocompetent hosts.

Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii var. neoformans (formerly C. gattii) was first reported as a causative agent of cryptococcosis in Kuwait in 1991 [29, 35]. The organism has now been described in Kuwait from the 1990s to 2008, and is now considered a rare cause of infection among immunocompromised patients in the country [29, 34, 36]. The organism is classified in the class of Candida, which has been reported to cause ~40% of all cases [35]. The organism is able to grow at temperatures above 40 °C and exhibits resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B, which are two azole drugs used to treat candidemia. The patient was treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B. The patient had no other risk factors, including diabetes mellitus and HIV. The patient presented with severe fever, cough, hemoptysis and vomiting. We suspect that the patient was on antiretroviral therapy at the time of the infection.

In the present case, the patient was diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. This species causes the most frequent disease in immunocompromised patients. The organism is most commonly found in tropical and temperate regions, such as Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and Mexico [36-38]. In a study conducted in Kuwait, only a few cases were diagnosed in immunocompromised patients [29, 30]. The main reason for the delay in diagnosis was the high cost of antifungal treatment.

The patient had been treated with amphotericin B for 6 weeks. The patient had also received oral fluconazole, which is considered the most effective antifungal agent in HIV patients [39]. The patient had received two weeks of fluconazole therapy, and then two weeks of fluconazole replacement therapy. It is unclear whether the patient had another underlying immunosuppressive condition.
