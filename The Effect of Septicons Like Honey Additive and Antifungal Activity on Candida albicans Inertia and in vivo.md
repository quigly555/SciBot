## Abstract
The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of different microbial communities, and their roles in host-pathogen interactions, in the Beitarium dennisii A280, a quarantining plant used for monitoring soil health in Brazil. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 75 samples taken from soil and plant, while soil and plant were separately assessed. A serial stepwise shuffling (SKS) approach was used to select samples that were most relevant to the study. A total of 36,928 (96.2%) samples were included in the study and in this subset 37,337 (73.9%) samples were available for further study. In the unsupervised manner, soil was selected and P. dennisii was effectively separated from the plant. The presence of different microbial communities with a similarity threshold of =1.5 revealed the discriminant power to distinguish between them. The influence of soil microbes on the results of this study was evident when we used a combination of both control and active soil microbes as the reference soil. The presence of different microbial communities revealed the discriminant power to distinguish between them. The results suggest that different soil species have a significant effect on the occurrence of different bacterial and fungal genera.


## Introduction
The genus Dendrobium is highly specialized to produce high quality materials from native to cultivated plants. It is used as an agricultural, ornamental, medicinal and natural product and has been used in traditional medicine, cosmetics, and cosmetics for centuries [1]. The species is also used in the treatment of dysentery and general health problems [2, 3].

The genus Dendrobium has more than 250 species that have been reported as potential plant pathogens [4]. Dendrobium can cause a wide range of diseases including head blight, anthracnose, dirty blotch, powdery mildew, leaf blotch, scab, fruit rot, powdery mildew, and anthracnose. Dendrobium can be found in several environments including soil, water, air, and water quality [5]. In recent years, many species of Dendrochus were reported to cause diseases in humans [6, 7, 8].


## Methods
The fungi were cultured in 1 mL of nutrient broth at 37°. After 24 hours of incubation, the fungal colonies were picked and treated with the addition of 10% (v/v) of peptone, and then the plates were incubated at 37°C. The fungal growth was measured by measuring the turbidity of the wells of the plate. The total fungal biomass was determined by the method described by Devereaux et al. [36] and Bradford assay [37]. The following test compounds were used in combination with the Septicons like honey: laminarin, benzamidine, or rhamnolipid: xylose, or lignocellulose, and arabinose, palmitic acid, or lignin. The range of the inhibitory concentrations (IC_50) was set at 0.05 to 0.125 mg/mL for laminarin, 0.25 to 0.125 mg/mL for rhamnolipid, and 0.25 to 0.125 mg/mL for arabinose. The extracts were diluted in sterile water. The test concentrations of the compounds were 1.25 to 40 mg/mL and 1.25 to 40 mg/mL for laminarin, rhamnolipid, or arabinose, respectively. The experiment was repeated three times.

C. albicans in vitro growth on PDA
The fungus was cultured on PDA at 37°C for 24 hours, and then the cells were collected. Then, the fungal suspension was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. Then, the cellular pellet was washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again. The pellet was washed with PBS. The pellet was suspended in PBS to 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. The yeast cell count was determined using a hemocytometer. The percentage of yeast cells in the suspension was calculated as follows: (L_1) = (A_0)/A_0. The test compounds were used in combination with the Septicons like honey on PDA at concentrations of 0.25 to 0.25 mg/mL. The cell count was measured using a hemocytometer. The experiment was repeated three times.


## Results
%) and antifungal activity on in vivo . albicans growth was investigated. In the same experimental conditions, honey increased the virulence of C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 1.0% honey increased the survival of C. albicans in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6). We have previously reported that 1.0% honey increases the virulence of C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner (10). We therefore speculated that 1.0% honey might enhance in vitro virulence of C. albicans in vivo.

We also explored the in vitro antifungal activity of honey addition and incubation of in vitro C. albicans in the presence of 1.0% honey. We tested the growth of C. albicans in the presence of 1.0% honey and incubated in the presence of 1.0% honey. After incubation, we observed that 1.0% honey had no significant effect on the growth of C. albicans.

Effects of Honey on the Growth of C. albicans
We also evaluated the effect of honey addition on the growth of C. albicans. The growth of C. albicans was evaluated by counting colony forming units (CFU) on YM agar media after 24 h of incubation with honey. Colonies were counted on YM agar and the results showed that honey addition did not have any effect on the colony forming unit formation of C. albicans.

The effects of honey addition and incubation on in vitro C. albicans growth are shown in Table 4. We observed that the colony formation of C. albicans was obviously inhibited by honey addition. After incubation of C. albicans in the presence of 1.0% honey, we observed that the colony growth of C. albicans was inhibited by honey addition.

Effect of honey on in vivo Candida albicans Infection
In vitro infection of C. albicans was evaluated by inoculating C. albicans in the same experimental conditions. The results showed that honey addition and incubation of honey enhanced the virulence of C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 1.0% honey significantly reduced the in vivo mortality rate (Figure 7). We have previously reported that 1.


## Discussion
In this study, we focused on the effect of the honey chemoprophylation on the in vivo immune response of Candida albicans in different types of inflammation and tissue inflammation, as well as on host immune response to fungal infection.

The first line of defense is a protective immune response to fungal infections. In addition to its major role in host defense against fungal infections, antifungal agents have also been shown to reduce Candida albicans infections in various host tissues and tissues in vivo [30].

Antifungal chemoprophylation of honey decreases the fungicidal activity of the bee’s gut microbes, and a decrease in fungal growth was observed in Candida albicans and C. tropicalis [29].

The second line of defense is a protective immune response to fungal infections. In this study, we investigated the effect of honey chemoprophylation on the in vivo immune response of Candida albicans. We tested whether this chemoprophylation could inhibit the fungicidal activity of the honey and also against the antifungal activity of the insecticidal honey and found that the insecticidal honey had a significant effect. In addition, the insecticidal honey had a significant effect on the in vivo immune response of Candida albicans in different tissue and tissue inflammation.

In addition, the honey chemoprophylation has a significant effect on the in vivo immune response of Candida albicans in different organs, and we investigated whether this chemoprophylation could inhibit the antifungal activity of the honey and also against the antifungal activity of the insecticidal honey and also against the antifungal activity of the insecticidal honey. The results showed that the honey chemoprophylation could inhibit the antifungal activity of the honey and also inhibit the antifungal activity of the insecticidal honey. The results showed that the honey chemoprophylation had a significant effect on the in vivo immune response of Candida albicans in different organs, and we investigated whether this chemoprophylation could inhibit the antifungal activity of the honey and also against the antifungal activity of the insecticidal honey.
