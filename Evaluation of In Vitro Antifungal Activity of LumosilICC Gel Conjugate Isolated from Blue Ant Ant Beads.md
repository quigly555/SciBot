## Abstract
The fatty acid profile of E. coli STE12 is used to identify the potential of algae-related proteins for developing new antibiotics. This study presents a screen for compounds with a higher amino acid profile in the E. coli STE12 broth micro-agarticle. Eight compounds were identified in STE12 by amino acid sequence comparison with their bacterial counterparts (e.g., tyrosine-amylase, pyruvate amylase, and arginine pyruvate lyase). The highest score for the bacterial peptide diversity was obtained for pyruvate-amylase, pyruvate- lyase, and arginine pyruvate-amylase, with an average of 98.6 and 98.4%, respectively.


## Introduction
Microorganisms are fundamental elements in the functioning of living organisms, and their diversity is crucial to the ecological survival and reproduction of the microorganisms. However, the study of diversity in the diversity of fungi is still challenging due to the very limited study facilities and the problems they face in the study of fungi. For instance, the study of fungi in general is very slow and the study of fungi in particular are highly diversified (Gartner, 2009). The study of diversity in fungi is crucial in understanding the mechanisms of fungi to successfully adapt to environmental changes and to encounter the challenges posed by microorganisms. Indeed, the study of fungal diversity is one of the key challenges for studying the evolution of the fungal kingdom.

In fungi, the taxonomic division of diversity is relatively simple: they belong to the class Mycosphaerella, which is divided into two varieties, the a and the asexual morphs. The a-complexes and is composed of numerous sexual and asexual morphs. The a-complexes and the a-complexes have been isolated from a few loci including the largest class of phytopathogenic fungi, the teleomorphs, such as Cladophialophora bantiana, Cladophialophora bant. The phytopathogenic fungi are mainly associated with dead branches of wood and crop plants and can be found in soil and in living tissues (Hagler, 1999; Hagler and Keller, 2000; Haseeb and Haseeb, 2002). Phytopathogenic fungi are mainly responsible for disease development, especially in wood-rotting plants and phytopathogens, but also can be found in other fungal species (e.g.


## Methods
Briefly, each well was coated with 1 µL of Xpert MicroSystems protein lysis buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and then incubated for 10 min at 37°. The Xpert Microsystems Brilliant X-band spectrophotometer (Xpert Microsystems, Woburn, MA, United States) was used to measure the absorbance at 540 nm. Antifungal activity was measured by measuring the inhibition of the formation of a blue bead upon incubation of the wells with the isolated Xpert Microsystems™ microtiter assay and the Xpert Microsystems™ microtiter assay without the compound. Antifungal activity was plotted against the inhibition zone.

4.6. Isolation of Fungal Cell Lysates
S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. leucostigae and C. albicans were cultured overnight in 200 ml of liquid YPD medium at 30°C, 200 rpm, then transferred to a chemically defined medium (YPD-PBS) containing 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Cell suspensions were adjusted to 2 × 10^3 cells/mL using sterile Millipore’s Modified Eagle Medium (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Sterile MEM was prepared by mixing the cells with 1% Triton X-100, 10% H_20, 0.02% Na_2MoO_4 and 0.5% NaCl and then adding 0.2% Triton X-100. The medium was then removed, and the cells were resuspended by pipetting up and down three times. The cell lysates were then used as a cell-free sample by the addition of 1% Triton X-100, 1% MgSO_4, 0.2% KH_2PO_4 and 0.2% KCl and incubated at 37°C for 20 min.


## Results
Results of the analysis of the association between BDG2 and Rifampin and the development of mucormycosis in C. neoformans

In the present study, the association of BDG2 and Rifampin with Rifampin-induced mucormycosis was confirmed by the results of the association test of BDG2 and Rifampin in C. neoformans.


## Discussion
In contrast, all Fc<U+03B3>RIs and Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb (Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc) had the same antifungal activity as fluconazol. This might be due to differences in the antifungal properties of fluconazole and amphotericin B. The Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb (Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb) was the most potent fluconazole, which is a monoclonal antibody. This might be due to the fluconazole being the most potent antifungal agent, since it is the most potent antifungal agent of all of the tested antifungal agents. Therefore, the Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb was the most potent fluconazole, which is a monoclonal antibody. The Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb (Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb) was the most potent antifungal agent, which is a monoclonal antibody. This might be due to the Fc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIFc<U+03B3>RIIb being the most potent antifungal agent.
