## Abstract
Background. Although the number of reported fungal infections has increased significantly during the last decades, little is known about the total number of these infections. We wanted to know if there were any extra reports of the number of extra cases of Candida auris, a emerging cause of nosocomial infections, to be considered, and to assess the sensitivity of the VITEK2 system to this infection.

Methods. Three hundred and fourteen cases of candidaemia, predominantly intraoral, were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the VITEK2 system using standard VITEK algorithm, in conjunction with blood culture, to characterize the rate of candidaemia and the specific antifungal susceptibility pattern of the species.

Results. The VITEK2 system showed a sensitivity of 95% for isolates with a VITEK2 count >1000/mL and >1000/64 pg/ml.


## Introduction
The genus Pseudoviriglione is composed of a diverse group of opportunistic pathogens that cause septicemia and septicemia-like illness, septicemia-like illness and septicemia-associated infections in different geographical areas (1-6). Pseudoviriglione (P. viride) is a type of pathogenic bacteria and is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (7). P. viride mainly infects the respiratory and urinary tract and is present in humans and animals. It is also isolated from the skin and nails and may cause septicemia and septicemia-like illness in animals. P. viride is also an important opportunistic pathogen of human, animals and plants, causing human infections ranging from subcutaneous infections to deep and deep seated ulcers, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, ocular infections, keratitis, keratitis, and dermatitis (8-10). P.


## Methods
 San Diego, CA, USA. The samples were processed and analyzed using the Sanger Library Preparation Guide (Illumina Inc.).

The sequencing data was analyzed using the Sanger Library Construction Kit v2.0 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing data was exported to FASTQC (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and the reads were assembled using the Trinity (http://www.trinityrnaseq.com/). The clean reads were aligned to the Ensembl database using the MOTHUR pipeline (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/trinityrnaseq/). Only low-quality sequences were used for further analysis. The clean sequences were assigned a quality score of 0.5 using the Bowtie2 (http://bowtie2.sourceforge.net/index.html). Sequence identity was validated by using the FASTX tool (http://stringy.org/fastx_tool.html).

The three-dimensional structure of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was analyzed using the Pneumocystis jirovecii sequence type I (STIT1) [18]. The structure of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was determined by PyNAST, version 2.0 [19], and the HMMER package (http://www.pymot.org/). The primer sequences for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were designed using the program HMMER3 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/HMMer3/). The sequences of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers are in Table 1).

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher’s exact test. The results of the relationship between the bacterial and fungal bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared using Student’s t-test. The results of the relationship between the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence and the fungal bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence were compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.


## Results
 2015. The first group (52.2%) is based on the marine mammal and terrestrial plant-derived products and the second group (26.5%) is based on the poultry and poultry products. The environmental related taxonomic community of the phylum Ascomycota is similar to the animal-related community, but their composition and toxin distribution differs (Table 3).

The phylum Basidiomycota (53.3%) is the major phylum (Table 3). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the geographic location (Mauro-Bello et al., 2015) and to be associated with the average number of bacterial and eukaryotic community members present in household samples (Mehrishi et al., 2014).

The fungal communities of the phylum Glomeromycota (52.8%) were similar to the bacterial communities (Table 3). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the geographic location (Mehrishi et al., 2014). The fungal OTU richness was also similar between the two environments. The fungal OTU richness was found to be significantly correlated with the number of fungi present in the household sample (Mehrishi et al., 2014).

The bacterial communities of the phylum Basidiomycota (30.2%) were similar to the bacterial communities (Table 3). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the geographic location (Mauro-Bello et al., 2015). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the number of bacteria present in the household sample (Mehrishi et al., 2014).

The fungal communities of the phylum Chytridiomycota (34.7%) were similar to the bacterial communities (Table 3). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the number of bacteria present in the household sample (Mehrishi et al., 2014). The relative abundance of fungal OTUs has been shown to be significantly correlated with the number of fungi present in the household sample (Mehrishi et al., 2014). The fungal OTU richness was found to be significantly correlated with the number of bacteria present in the household sample (Mehrishi et al., 2014).


## Discussion
2000; de la Cruz et a. 2007). Similar to this approach, the C. albicans-Hog-like toxin associated molecular chaperone, PbsA, was identified in a tMeningo-like toxin (TshMtB) associated cytoskeleton protein (TcMtB) (Jung et al. 2008). PbsA was previously found to be associated with a secreted antimicrobial peptide, serotype D (Shu et al. 2013) and a CD45 derivative, which is often associated with liver failure (Mossmann and Cooke 2001). The PbsA-Hog-like toxin in the oomycete Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein (MPTP) (Crowley and Smith 1997) was identified in the tick gut and found to be associated with a metallothionein-like toxin (MtMtB) (Tsuyama et al. 2012). Similar to the C. albicans-Hog-like toxin, the C. albicans toxin was identified in the gut of an oomycete (Jung et al. 2008). The other three C.
