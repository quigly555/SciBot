## Abstract
We herein report a case of Nocardia rajuschikii (formerly known as Rhizopus spp.) causing severe pulmonary and eye infections in a 68-year-old woman with Diabetic, Kidney, and Lipid dysfunction. She was on lipid-lowering treatment. She developed a local nodule in the right posterior lobe, which was interpreted as cryptococcal meningitis, because the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were negative for infectious agents. She also developed an atypical pulmonary nodule at the time of CT and CT scan. This report emphasizes the need for early diagnosis of Nocardia rajuschikii because infectious agents may develop from tissue collected at the admission. Early diagnosis is important to improve survival.


## Introduction
The presence of extracellular traps (ECs) in the gastrointestinal tract is an occupational hazard for the intestinal flora of the individual, and is associated with both psychological and behavioral effects [1]. The ECs in the intestines are believed to be a source of persistent intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis of mucosal barriers that leads to intestinal inflammation and formation of epithelial barrier dysfunction, as seen in type 2 diabetes patients [2].

The term “ecchymorphism” is used to describe the morphological changes that occur within the intestinal tract in response to various micro- and macro-physiological conditions [3]. Ecchymorphism is a common feature among intestinal parasites, and it is present in both protists and non-parasites [4,5].


## Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (No. FUGT, 01.07.2016). Informed consent was obtained from all participants before the start of the study.

Ethics statement
No specific permissions were required for the location of research facilities or the use of animals. In this study, we used mice from a study conducted at the National University of Maranhão (UPM) (Portugal). The protocols of the UPM study were approved by the University of Minas Gerais Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol No. 2015-002).

Strain
The wild-type H99 (NRRL 11817), the homozygous M2-tagged A. fumigatus strain, the homozygous A.


## Results
To determine the effect of methionine in treatment of Cryptococcus Emancipation, we investigated the effect of methionine on the ability of . neoformans to invade the host. We first established that the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of methionine was reduced when the fungus was grown on media supplemented with methionine. No significant differences in the growth of C. neoformans on solid media with methionine were observed (Fig 4A). The growth of C. neoformans on media supplemented with methionine was comparable to that on media supplemented with other antifungal agents (Fig 4B). These data support our hypothesis that methionine inhibits the growth of C. neoformans when grown on methionine.

Methionine has been shown to interfere with the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of other antifungal agents, such as penicillin and azithromycin [5-7]. Therefore, we tested the effect of methionine on the ability of C. neoformans to colonize the host. No significant differences in the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of methionine were observed (Fig 4C). These data suggest that methionine has no effect on the ability of C. neoformans to colonize the host.

Methionine Deficiency Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Colonization in the Presence of Antifungal Drugs
We investigated whether methionine disrupts the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of other antifungal drugs. We first compared the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of methionine, azithromycin, or penicillin. The growth of C. neoformans was significantly inhibited by methionine when the fungus was grown on solid media supplemented with methionine (Fig 5A). The growth of C. neoformans was not inhibited by azithromycin, or by penicillin. The growth of C. neoformans was not inhibited by penicillin or by azithromycin when the fungus was grown on solid media supplemented with methionine (Fig 5B). The growth of C.


## Discussion
 2012. As a result, C. neoformans-derived intron and the C. gattii complex-derived intron were also independent of the intron-derived and the C. gattii-derived ones (Li et al., 2012). Consistent with this, intron-derived C. gattii-derived intron (the gene encoding the intron-derived intron of C. gattii) was induced in C. neoformans-infected mice (Li et al., 2012). These data suggest that C. gattii and C. neoformans are able to establish a C. gattii-and C. neoformans-induced C. gattii-C. neoformans-C. gattii-C. gattii-C. gattii complex.

Of note, we also found that intron-derived C. gattii-derived C. gattii-C. gattii complex was also induced in C. neoformans-infected mice (Figures S4, S5, S6, S7). In addition, intron-derived C. gattii-derived C. gattii complex was induced in C. neoformans-infected mice (Figure S8). These data suggest that C. gattii and C. neoformans are able to establish C. gattii-C. gattii complex-derived C. gattii-C. gattii complex in C. gattii-C. gattii-C. gattii complex.

GPA-induced gene expression is an indicator of the extent of immunopathology in mice
The C. neoformans-specific G protein-coupled receptor Gpa1 was predicted by RNA-Seq and other approaches (Li et al., 2012). In mammals, G protein-coupled receptor Gpa1 is activated by histone H3a and is required for cell surface recognition and phagocytosis (Reichardt et al., 2001).
