## Abstract
In the emerging age of antibiotic resistance, the use of multidrug-resistant strains has become an important clinical and public health concern. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antifungal activity of the COGC Meningitis Growth Gland (MGG) treatment against fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Germinated fractions were taken from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cultured in order to determine the antifungal activity. MIC values were determined using the broth method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the crystal violet-based assay. The MIC values for MGG were 0.62-1.25 µg/mL for yeasts, 2-8 µg/mL for other yeasts, and 1-6 for other fungi. In the in vitro activity test, the in vivo growth of Candida albicans (CA) mutants <U+0394>gcsg1 was inhibited by COGC treatment, with inhibition constants in the range of 8-32 µg/mL. The in vivo growth of Candida glabrata, however, was not inhibited by COGC treatment. MIC values for MGG and COGC were 0.63 and 0.62 µg/mL for yeasts, <U+0394>gcsg1 <U+0394>sensuosol, and <U+0394>sensuospc1, respectively.


## Introduction
The genus Valsaceae was introduced by Roy (1983) and has since been recognised as a family in the family Diaporthales (Sutton 1989, Barron 2000). Valsum is divided into two subfamilies, Valsales and Valsidae. Valsales include the plant pathogenic species V. pinnata, V. pinnatae, and V. pinnatae/pinnataeae and the pathogenic species V. pinnata, V. pinnatae, and V. pinnata (Baker et al. 2009). The genus Valsaria, first described by Barron (2000), was classified based on the lack of specific morphological characters and morphological features and has now been divided in three genera: V. valsae, V. illudens, and V. illudensii (Liao 2002, 2000, 2003, Simmons et al. 2006). Currently, several species of Valsaria have been reported from Japan, China, Iran, and the United States (Simm et al. 2006, 2007).

V. illudens is a native species occurring on dead, woody and mossy shrubs in Japan, China and Iran (Baker et al. 2009, 2011). V. illudens is a species of the family Valsariaceae (Baker et al. 2008). In Iran, V. illudens is found on dead, mossy and stone fruits of up to 70 m tall and is commonly mistaken for V. pinnata (Kaur 2006, Anwar et al. 2008). The genus Valsaria was divided into three different families, Valsellaceae, Valsellataceae, and Valsellataceae (Kaur 2006, Anwar et al. 2008). The first two families are found in the subfamily Valsellatinae (Kaur and Inácio 2009).


## Methods
In cases of bacterial meningitis, the patient was treated with antibiotics for fungal meningitis and a new antibiotic for bacterial meningitis was not availabl.

With few exceptions, bacterial meningitis was diagnosed by direct clinical or radiographic examination. The patient was treated with either cyclosporine, gentamicin or amphotericin B, for example.

HIV-positive patients were treated with sub-cultured Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and/or methicillin-sensitive H. capsulatum (MSH) or S. aureus (SIGMA B-2327) or rifampicin, for example.

Viral meningitis was diagnosed by viral culture using a commercial HIV viral purification kit (Zymo Research, Inc., USA).

With few exceptions, viruses were identified by their presence in the culture and/or by their genotype.

Patients with severe acute or moderate fever and/or body temperature of >38.0 °C were treated with cyclosporine or gentamicin. The use of cyclosporine or gentamicin on patients with a fever or body temperature of >38.0 °C was unnecessary.

Patients with severe or deep-seated systemic aspergillosis were treated with rifampicin. The use of rifampicin was unnecessary.

Patients with serious bacterial meningitis were treated with lumbar punctures (LP) and/or with steroids.

With few exceptions, serovar meningitis was diagnosed in patients with neurological and/or psychiatric disorders.

Respiratory syncytial fluid (RSF) was detected using the World Health Organization-approved guidelines [29].

In this group, the results were consistent with clinical or radiographic evidence of meningitis.

In the case of proven meningitis, the patient was treated with amphotericin B and/or rifampicin.

With few exceptions, the CSF samples were positive for bacteria.

With few exceptions, the CSF samples were negative for eosinophils.

Patients with severe acute or moderate pneumonia were treated with rifampicin.

With few exceptions, rifampicin was unnecessary.


## Results
The gene ontology analysis (GO) for the S. cerevisiae SGA1 gene revealed that the gene had a predicted K^+ ratio of 101.1±2.0×10^-4 (p<0.001) and was enriched in proteins related to the cell wall and membrane (p<0.0001, p<0.001). Of the four S. cerevisiae genes in the S. cerevisiae genome, SGA1 and SGA2 were predicted to have the highest K^+ ratios (p<0.0001, p<0.001, respectively) (Table 2). S. cerevisiae also showed a higher sensitivity to oxidative stress (p<0.0001, p<0.001) (Table 3).

The S. cerevisiae gene contains a conserved (NAD1) domain and a predicted secreted domain (SDR1) (Table 2)
The S. cerevisiae SGA1 gene encodes a putative NAD-binding motif (SDR1) (25). S. cerevisiae SDR1 contains a predicted NAD domain and a predicted secreted domain (SDR1) (25). The S. cerevisiae SGA1 gene contains a predicted SDR1 domain and a predicted secreted domain (SDR1) (25). In addition, a predicted secreted domain was found in S. cerevisiae SGA1 (Table 2) (25).

A comparison of the predicted S. cerevisiae SGA1 protein with other fungal S. cerevisiae SGA1 proteins revealed that S.


## Discussion
neoformans infection [37.

To further expand our understanding of the role of these two opportunistic pathogens, we have identified and characterized an additional, less common cause of meningitis in immunocompetent individuals. This patient had a history of meningeal symptoms including increased cough and dyspnea. The patient had a history of trauma and/or hearing loss, which may be related to his previous exposure to these entities. We also identified a significant (OR 3.5) risk of CNS fungal infection in this patient. It is not known whether this risk is associated with an increase in C. neoformans infection, but it is possible that C. neoformans infection may increase the risk of CNS fungal infection. The patient had a history of diabetes, which may have led to an increase in C. neoformans infection. He was a smoker, which may have contributed to his risk of C. neoformans infection. The patient was also a recent smoker, which may have contributed to his increased risk of C. neoformans infection. Further investigation is required to determine if the increased risk of C. neoformans infection associated with smoking, trauma, and/or trauma is also due to the increase in C. neoformans infection.

The increased risk of C. neoformans infection in immunocompetent individuals may be a result of the increased risk of fungal infection associated with C. neoformans infection, and that may be associated with the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressant, and/or immunomodulation therapy. C. neoformans infection may be associated with corticosteroid therapy, and/or immunomodulation therapy, as well as the use of immunosuppressant or immunomodulation therapy. C. neoformans is a yeast, which may cause disease through inhalation. C. neoformans is known to cause disease through ingestion, ingestion, and inhalation of eukaryotic cells. It has been reported that the fungus can cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals [38]. C. neoformans can also cause meningitis, as well as pulmonary infections, which have also been reported [39]. Cryptococcus species are commonly found in the environment, and may cause disseminated infection.
