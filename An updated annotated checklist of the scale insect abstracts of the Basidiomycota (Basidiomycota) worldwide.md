## Abstract
In the last decade, the emergence of multicellularity has become an important focus of research on pathogenesis and life forms of multicellular organisms. In response to this emerging complexity, research in the development of multicellularity has increasingly attracted increasing attention from several countries, including China. The most recent example is the topic of the topic of intron retention and the phenomenon of intron gain during splice-site transitions. We review the main aspects of splicing regulation in multicellular organisms, including the mechanisms underlying the regulation of introns, and the implications of these features in cell biology, protein fate, and pathogenesis.


## Introduction
Plant biomass has attracted considerable interest as a sustainable energy and energy-producing alternative to fossil resources (Diaz and Diez, 2013). However, it is also a source of intermittent feedstock that can be used as a feedstock for biofuel production (Odom et al., 2010; Wiederhold and Klionsky, 2015). The increasing use of biofuel as a renewable and renewable energy source in recent years has been stimulated by the increasing amount of global population and consumption of fossil fuel and the increasing demand for renewable sources of energy (Santos et al., 2013). In a lot of countries, biofuels are the leading source of transportation fuels. However, biodiesel from palm oil is still considered as a waste product because of its carcinogenic and toxic properties (Bryant et al., 2006; Baroni et al.


## Methods
2.1. Materials
The 4-µl samples (2 mL) of chloroform and methanol were collected from the V. dahliae colonies on rice agar slants. The samples (2 mL) of chloroform and methanol were collected from the plate agar plates. The plates were incubated at 25°C and the yield of the plate was observed after 48 h. The 3-µl samples (2 mL) of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1.5% (w/w) dithiobis (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as control.


## Results
A comprehensive overview of the 5-gene database is available (Table S6.

Groups of Eurotiales, Amoebozoa, and Microbotryomycetes
The Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) were the largest group in the database (Figure S2). In particular, the first branch of the Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) was the most complete in terms of number of syntenic genes (n = 50), the number of gene families containing more than one protein family, and the number of families containing more than one gene family (n = 44). By contrast, the Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) contained a large number of genes containing multiple protein families and families, and were thus less complete. In particular, in the last 6-gene database, the total number of genes containing multiple protein families was higher than that of the Eurotiales, but the number of genes containing the same number of genes was relatively lower. Thus, Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) are the most complete groups in terms of number of gene families, number of gene families, and number of gene families.

Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the Eurotiales
The phylogenetic tree of the Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) shows the topology of the Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) to be similar to the phylogenetic tree of the Basidiomycota (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes). In particular, the tree of the Eurotiales (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) shows that the major group of Eurotiales (Amoebozoa) is very similar to the phylogenetic tree of the Basidiomycota (Amoebozoa, Microbotryomycetes) (Figure 3).


## Discussion

The Classification System (CS) in this publication is not part of the CABI generic system, and the CABI classification system for these species is not yet availabl. However, the CABI classification system for these species has been extensively used in the past to classify fungi into the same species (Furvat et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2015; Andrade-Mendoza et al., 2017; Dennard et al., 2019). The CABI classification system for these species has been developed for a certain taxonomic group of fungi (Berk. and S. ascomata; Bull. & C. capitascens; B. mexicana; Fusarium polymorpha; Scleroderma boydii; and T. terrestris) and for the ITS-LSU system for these fungi (Wang et al., 2015).

The cutin fibrillar-like structures are represented by globose clusters of sclerotia and basidiospores with thin, thick, and somewhat branched ends, and chlamydospores (Figs 2 and 3). The cutin fibrillar structure is not unique to the Basidiomycota, and the fungal species represented are not known yet.

The Clades of Phylogenetic Species of the Fungal Species in the Fungal Species Database (CDS)
The Fungal Species in the Fungal Species Database (FST) (CDS) (Figures 2 and 3) was constructed by placing the new species within the Fungal Species Database (FST) (CDS) (Figs 2 and 3). The Fungal Species Database (FPSDB) (CDS) (Figures 2 and 3) was built using the phylogenic species data of the basidiomycetous fungi Aspergillus and Aspergillus fumigatus in the Fungal Species Database (FPSDB). The Fungal Species Database (FPSDB) (CDS) (Figures 2 and 3) was also used for the phylogenetic analysis of these taxa, and the Fungal Species Database (FPSDB) (Figures 2 and 3) was constructed by placing the new species within the Fungal Species Database (FPSDB) (Figures 2 and 3).
