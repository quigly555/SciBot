## Abstract

Our study assesses the extent to which the three most common citrus species, Citrus, Citruslimonene and Citruslimonene+L-ascorbic acid (COA), affect citrus disease occurrence, severity and secondary metabolites resistanc. The data show that: (i) citrus species have significantly increased the resistance to citrus diseases; (ii) Citruslimonene and Citruslimonene+L-ascorbic acid have reduced the severity of citrus diseases; (iii) citrus species have significantly increased the resistance to fungicidal treatments; and (iv) citrus species are significantly over-exposed to fungicides.

IMPORTANCE The epidemiology of fungal infections in pigeon Colonies is largely unknown. The purpose of the present study is to identify fungal agents and metabolites of interest for future antifungal therapies targeting these agents.

Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is the primary agent of common human diseases. It is the second most common cause of fungal meningitis in the world after human disease. Human fungal infections are the second leading cause of fungal meningitis in the world after fungal meningitis. Candida has received significant attention as an attractive antifungal drug target. However, the present study shows that a major component of fungal virulence is not secretory, rather it is phenotype. A strain of Candida presented a significantly higher resistance to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B compared with a strain of Candida sativus. The induction of resistance in C. albicans by fluconazole enhanced the susceptibility of C. sativus isolates to voriconazole and amphotericin B.

The present study reveals that C. albicans is a commensal fungus that is able to survive in the human body and exert its virulence. The antifungal effect of fluconazole against C. albicans was investigated.

We found that C. albicans strain H99 was more susceptible to voriconazole and amphotericin B compared to C. albicans and Candida. This was associated with the high level of fluconazole resistance among fluconazole-resistant isolates. In addition, we found a dose-dependent increase in the survival of C. albicans-infected susceptible and susceptible C.


## Introduction

## Methods
To maximize the study sample size, inclusion criteria included: (1) ICD-10 codes =4; (2) no mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosis was made in the study; (3) TB diagnosis was confirmed by culture of blood; (4) TB treatment was indicated by the presence of a number of clinical symptoms consistent with a confirmed tuberculous infection; and (5) the presence of a positive result from culture was considered as proven T.

In order to minimize bias due to various risk factors, the inclusion criteria for patients who were excluded from the study were based on the following three criteria: (1) age =25 years; (2) College education =15 years; (3) education level =18 years; and (4) income =75% of income. The exclusion criteria for patients who were pregnant, with less than one of the following conditions were included: (1) pregnant women; (2) pregnant women with advanced stage of pregnancy; (3) pregnant women with advanced stage of pregnancy; and (5) pregnant women with multiple other conditions (see Appendix S1 for the criteria and definitions).

Patients were followed up for 14 days after discharge from hospital. The diagnostic test was performed at the College of American Pathologists (CAP) laboratory in a traditional Chinese medicine-intensive care unit (HMCLU). Inclusion criteria for the hospitalization included (1) infection with tuberculosis, (2) heart disease, (3) hematological malignancy, (4) hematological malignancy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and (5) hematological malignancy with immunosuppression. Patients who were diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis were excluded from the study.

For the study of the response to apple fruit disease, we identified patients who were admitted to the hospital and who were discharged from hospital during the follow-up period. The clinical characteristics of the patients included: (1) age =25 years; (2) age =30 years; (3) age =35 years; (4) age =40 years; (5) age =45 years; (6) age =50 years; and (7) age =55 years.


## Results
cerevisiae and . albicans are two distinct yeast species that are well characterized in terms of their virulence. In this study, we used two strains of S. cerevisiae (strain UABH-2) to compare the response to apple fruit apple disease and the fermentation medium of apple fruit. One of the strains was used for the analysis of the virulence of apple fruit apple disease (Table 1). The other was used for the analysis of the pathogenicity of apple fruit fruit apple.

The pathogenicity of apple fruit fruit fruit infection is the most important virulence factor of the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae is an essential pathogen for many different plant pathogens. The pathogenicity of apple fruit fruit fruit infection is affected by the microorganism community (Art. 42.2) and by the environmental factors (H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and D. melanogaster) in different parts of the world. The pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans was found to be important for the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae in the pathogenicity of C. albicans. The pathogenicity of C. albicans was found to be important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae. The pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae was found to be important for the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae. The pathogenicity of C. albicans was found to be important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae. The pathogenicity of C. albicans was found to be important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae. The pathogenicity of C. albicans was found to be important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of C. albicans in the pathogenicity of S. cerevisiae.

## Discussion
This hypothesis is supported by the observed ability of Citrus Phellinus to penetrate and colonize the fruit tissu. We hypothesize that Citrus Phellinus might also use this fruit as a means to colonize other microbes in the fruit tissue. In support of this hypothesis, Citrus Phellinus is an important constituent of apple fruit tissues. Other microbes, such as Trichosporon spp., may also be able to colonize fruit tissue. The ability of Trichosporon spp. to penetrate fruit tissue may be a novel attribute of fruit pathogenic microbes in apple fruit.

Fungal Communities in Fruit tissues
In this study, we did not find any significant differences in fungal communities in apple fruit tissues. However, we observed that the fungi in apple fruit tissues were different from the fungi found in other plant parts. This suggests that fungal communities in fruit tissues are influenced by the plant pathogen. Our results also suggest that fungal communities in apple fruit tissues are influenced by the pathogen.

Fungal Communities in Fruit tissues
Fungal communities of apple fruit tissues were dominated by Ascomycota, which accounted for 73% of the fungal communities. However, the diversity of fungi and species of Blastocladiomycota were only slightly higher in apple fruit tissues than in other parts of the plant. These results are consistent with previous studies on apple fruit tissue fungi [7,12]. However, our study is the first to show the occurrence of fungal communities in fruit tissue.

Fungal Communities in Fruit tissues
Fungal communities of apple fruit tissues were dominated by Ascomycota, which accounted for 43% of the fungal communities. This may be due to the fact that Ascomycota are often reported to be the dominant fungal community in apple fruit tissue [15]. The detection of fungal communities in fruit tissues has been widely reported [7,12,15,17]. However, this study is the first to show fungal communities in fruit tissue.

Fungal Communities in Fruit tissues
The distribution of fungal communities in apple fruit tissue was dominated by Ascomycota. The distribution of fungi in apple fruit tissue is similar to other plant parts [17,18,19,20].
