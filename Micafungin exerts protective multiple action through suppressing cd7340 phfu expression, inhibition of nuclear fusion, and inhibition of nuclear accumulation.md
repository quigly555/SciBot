## Abstract
We have previously shown that the light- and conidial-state-associated proteins Cdc11 and Hsp90 play critical roles in the virulence of C. neoformans. In this study, we investigated the roles of these proteins during the virulence of C. neoformans by employing the non-nucleotidylated, phosphorylatable DCX-2 cell lines and in melanoma progression. In addition, we explored the contribution of Cdc11 and Hsp90 proteins to melanin production and conidia formation. These results demonstrate the critical role of these proteins during melanization and the melanoma progression of C. neoformans and provide a basis for melanoma prevention strategies.

The dynamic growth of fungal pathogens is tightly controlled by the light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway. A light-independent pathway, where only the light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway is active, is in principle sufficient for melanoma progression. In this study, we show that the Cdc11 and Hsp90 isoforms are essential for normal melanization, and in fact, these proteins contribute to the melanization defect caused by C. neoformans melanoma. In agreement with the importance of the light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway, the Tnfa1, the tnfa1<U+2206> mutant, and the Xyl4 and Xyl13 mutants had no preference for the normal light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway and the Cdc11/Hsp90-cavitated dfa1<U+2206> mutant. Furthermore, we show that the glycolytic pathway, in particular the glycolytic reductase and the ras2<U+2206> mutant had an independent role in normal melanization, confirming that the light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway is also important for melanoma progression.

The identification of conserved components within the essential pathways of melanoma sheds light on the requirement for melanization by the light/CAS2/Hsp90 pathway and highlights the importance of these pathways for normal melanization.


## Introduction
The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the host defence against invading pathogens and their toxins [1,2]. Gut microbiota comprises a diverse group of microbial individuals that live in a constant state of symbiosis, commensal and mutualistic. However, in the context of this mutualism, the gut microbiota may interact with other microbes that may also be found in the host tissue, and may act as potential drug targets. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in understanding the role of gut microbiota in the host defence against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, which are major causes of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AVS) [3,4,5].


## Methods

The mechanisms of activity of the protease activity are not know. The role of Hsp90 in the induction of protease activity is unknown. Asap et al. [18] reported that Hsp90 in combination with protease inhibitor 2, is able to activate the cell-cell fusion cascade of Hsp90, and that it also suppresses the nuclear accumulation of chitin, the enzymatic activity of Hsp90 is also affected by protease inhibitor. Hsp90-Triton X-100, and/or Hsp90-SOD, were used as positive and negative control, respectively. The activity of Hsp90 alone was determined using the enzymatic method.

5.2. Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial activity of Hsp90 was determined in a broth micro-dilution assay. The assays were performed in 96-well plates in a final volume of 200 µL. The Hsp90-M-F and Hsp90-Triton X-100-F medium (20.0 mg/mL) were added to the wells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial activity was determined by the micro-dilution assay according to the method of Al-Haddadi et al. [22]. The micro-dilution assay was performed in 96-well plate in a final volume of 200 µL. The bacteria were grown in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The extracts were added to the wells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The assay was performed in triplicate, and the lowest concentrations that completely inhibited the growth of the bacteria were used. The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded.

## Results
This observation is consistent with the observed increase in multiple levels of cen4 expression upon killing of cd73/40, indicating that . albicans may also overcome the severe defects in cd73/40 expression.

C. albicans eliminates host cells by killing host cells
We first addressed the question whether C. albicans directly kills host cells, or if it indirectly kills host cells by the release of virulence factors. We first used a selective killing assay to determine the importance of host cells for the C. albicans-killing activity of the C. albicans complex. As shown in Fig 4, C. albicans can kill host cells by killing host cells, but it can also kill host cells by killing host cells by itself (Fig 4B). Consistent with the killing activity data, we observed that C. albicans can kill host cells by killing host cells by itself, but it can also kill host cells by killing host cells by itself (Fig 4B). In contrast, we observed that C. albicans can also kill host cells by itself by killing host cells by itself (Fig 4B). These results indicate that the C. albicans complex may be able to distinguish between the action of host cells and host cells in the absence of host cells.

The extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in host cell killing. We asked whether C. albicans could eliminate host cells by extracellular killing by extracellular killing. To test whether C. albicans could eliminate host cells, we stained C. albicans with calcein and analyzed extracellular matrix (ECM). We observed that C. albicans could eliminate host cells by extracellular killing of both extracellular and extracellular EPS. C. albicans could eliminate host cells by extracellular killing of both extracellular and extracellular EPS.

We next wanted to determine whether C. albicans could kill host cells by killing host cells by themselves. As shown in Fig 5, C. albicans can kill host cells by killing host cells by itself, but it can also kill host cells by killing host cells by itself. In contrast, we did not observe any significant killing of host cells by the latter, as we did not observe any significant killing of host cells by the former. These data indicate that C.


## Discussion
In addition, DHHS-2 has been shown to be involved in the phagocytosis of fungi and the development of infection [37. DHHS-2 is involved in the phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in the development of infection [38]. DHHS-2 also plays a role in the antiviral activity of the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans [39]. The roles of DHHS-2 in the host defense against Cryptococcus neoformans have also been reported [40]. In this study, the antiviral effect of DHHS-2 was blocked by phagocytosis with a combination of both DHHS-1a and DHHS-2a. However, phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages was not affected by phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages. In addition, phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages was not affected by phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages. These findings strongly support the idea that the effect of phagocytosis with DHHS-2 on Cryptococcus neoformans is independent of the phagocytic activity of DHHS-2.

In addition to the antiviral effect of DHHS-2, phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages was not affected by phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages. This result suggests that phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages is a distinct activity to the antiviral effect of DHHS-2.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages is independent of the phagocytic activity of DHHS-2. It is possible that phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans is dependent on the phagocytic activity of DHHS-2. Further research is required to define the phagocytic activity of DHHS-2.

In summary, we have shown that the antiviral effect of phagocytosis of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages is independent of phagocytic activity of DHHS-2.
