## Abstract
C. elegans is an important model organism that studies the interaction of bacteria and fungi. However, the genomes of many species of C. elegans have a limited number of transposable elements, and fewer than half have been experimentally verified. In this study, we analyzed the genomes of two C. elegans strains and a related species and discovered that approximately 1.5% of the genomes are transposable elements. We used comparative genomics to determine the number of transposable elements in the genomes of these two strains and discovered that approximately 50% are from non-coding RNAs, such as small subunits of RNA polymerase II. Although most of the transposable elements were found in the genome of the closely related species C. elegans, a large proportion were found in the genomes of the related species. The comparison of our transposable elements with those of other model eukaryotes showed that the number of non-coding RNAs was also significantly higher in the genomes of the related species. The genomes of the related species and species of C. elegans had more transposon-yielding elements, and the number of transposon-yielding elements in the genomes of the related species was significantly higher compared with those of the related species. These results provide evidence for the existence of two distinct eukaryotic lineages with transposon-yielding elements, one of which was found in our genomes.


## Introduction
C. albicans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes severe fungal infections in the human host. Invasive candidiasis is a common opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, and mortality is high in this group of patients [1]. C. albicans is also a causative agent of several other infections, including onychomycosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, among others [2].

The yeast-to-hypha-like transition from yeast cells to hyphal growth is observed during C. albicans infection. The hyphal form can persist as cells in the moist environment of the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin, or in the lungs, and this form may be cleared by phagocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells [3]. On the other hand, neutrophils are the main cells involved in the phagocytosis of C. albicans [4].

The phagocytosis of C. albicans occurs in two types of phagocytic cells.


## Methods
Briefly, the procedure used was the same as described in [12. Briefly, overnight cultures of A. fumigatus were diluted 1:10 with fresh phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). One-half of the diluted cultures were inoculated onto the pH balanced agar (PMA) plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C and the number of bacterial colonies was counted after 24 h. The number of P. brasiliensis colonies was calculated by the formula: colony diameter × 100 = (number of colonies on PMA plates)/100 × 100 [12].

O. fischeri culture
O. fischeri cells were grown on PDA at 37°C for 48 h. The cells were centrifuged at 5,000× g for 10 min, and washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was collected and used for culture of O. fischeri. The suspension was centrifuged at 5,000× g for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine, and the number of viable bacteria was adjusted to 10^3 CFU/ml. The final concentration of the solution was adjusted to 5% (w/v).

Effect of L-DOPA on A. fumigatus
The effect of L-DOPA on A. fumigatus, as a filter, was performed using a bacterial culture obtained from a stock culture of A. fumigatus at 1×10^6 cells/ml. The culture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the number of viable bacteria was determined by the method described by [12]. Briefly, 1×10^5 A. fumigatus cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml of L-DOPA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, the suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and used for the assay of A. fumigatus viability. The final concentrations of the solution were adjusted to 5% (w/v).

## Discussion
coli (the most common . coli pathogen) and L. donovani biofilm development. Cell fertilization was also effective in inhibiting the growth of E. coli. Cell fertilization is known to be a complex system that involves the participation of numerous, independent enzymes and secreted enzymes. Among these enzymes, some are plant-derived [26], while others are manganese-derived [27,28]. In our study, the use of Mg-F3 to reduce the growth of E. coli (the most common E. coli pathogen) resulted in a significant reduction of its biofilm development. However, it is difficult to compare the efficiency of Mg-F3 to Mg-F3 in reducing the growth of E. coli. Therefore, we conclude that the efficacy of Mg-F3 as a plant-derived cell fertilizer is not directly dependent on the activity of the enzyme. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Mg-F3 may act as a second-line agent for inhibition of E. coli growth. In addition, we did not observe that Mg-F3 has an additive effect in inhibiting the growth of E. coli. However, Mg-F3 may also be used as a second-line agent to inhibit the growth of E. coli. This is a possibility that will need to be experimentally investigated in the future.

We also demonstrated that the use of Mg-F3 to reduce the biofilm formation of E. coli was effective in inhibiting the biofilm formation of E. coli. This is in agreement with previous studies of the activity of Mg-F3 as a plant-derived cell fertilizer [26,27,28]. However, the application of Mg-F3 to E. coli biofilm inhibition is challenging, as the bacteria are not only difficult to culture, but also act as biofilm mites. Indeed, the bacterial biofilm mites can form as pseudohyphae, which can also affect the biofilm formation of E. coli [29]. This type of inhibition is not novel for E. coli, as pseudohyphae are known to play an important role in biofilm formation [30].
