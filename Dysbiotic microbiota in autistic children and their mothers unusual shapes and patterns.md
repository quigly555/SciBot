## Abstract
The monotypic genus Leishmania (Dothideomycetes, Subphylum Hypocreales) contains the etiological agents of meningoencephalitis in humans and animals. Despite the spectacular success of our antifungal drug discovery strategy in the field, the emergence of new microorganism infections is still a large and complex issue in the field of infectious disease. To overcome this, several approaches have been considered, but mostly to predict the outcome of a particular clinical case or scenario based on the similarity or similarity of profile-tolerance-based phenotypes of the isolates, and the phenotype of the corresponding associated strains. Despite the impressive virulence of the prevalent causative agents in this group of parasites, there is still an enormous gap in knowledge concerning their phenotypic and epidemiological features.

In this study we propose a new approach to define the features of the associated strains and the related molecular epidemiology in a large collection of clinically diagnosed cases of meningoencephalitis and neonatal infections. Based on this approach, we analyze 39 isolates from 33 patients with diagnosed meningoencephalitis and 35 additional cases, and the results are relevant to the current discussion on the epidemiology and causes of disease in the field of infection.

This study describes the data obtained in the investigation, and also analyzes the consequences of the approach for defining the phenotypes of the associated strains. The results provide the context for the characterization of the isolates, and furthermore, the epidemiology of meningoencephalitis in general, as an independent mechanism of action in the protection against the infection, and a new direction for the study of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in this group of parasitic protozoa.

## Introduction
 2017) and functional and functional roles of microbes in the gut (Pereira-Urdaniel et a., 2018). These findings suggest that dysbiosis may be a diagnostic criterion for the disease, but it is also possible that dysbiosis is a disease spectrum, and that it is not a disease phenotype, as is commonly thought.

The importance of dysbiosis in autism is well established. It has been shown that dysbiosis can affect brain development in autistic children and their mothers, and that this has a profound impact on the functioning of the brain. Dementia, both early and late, has been reported to be associated with impaired language and visual function in children with ASD (De Hoog et al., 2012; de Hoog and Schindler, 2012). Dysbiosis in the gut has been shown to influence the functions of the gut mucosa, the immune system, and the brain by dysbiosis (Aguilar et al., 2015; Navarrete et al., 2015). However, it has been found that dysbiosis is not the primary etiological process, and the role of dysbiosis in ASD remains poorly understood.

Dementia is a progressive, debilitating and life-threatening disorder of the central nervous system characterized by seizures, movement disorders, and movement disorders with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. The disease has a spectrum of causes, and the most common causes include polydactyly, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and/or edema, which may be secondary to the physical or chemical environment of the brain (Zalar et al., 2008). The most common clinical presentation is Guillain-Barr√© syndrome with/without language delay, seizures, loss of spatial memory, meningitis, and intracranial pressure (Zalar et al., 2008). There are no treatment strategies available for this condition. The most common treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy (CMT) with a history of suicide or attempted suicide and a history of at least one suicide attempt. Some children have been reported as a group with other disorders and have received anti-psychotic medications, such as cycloserine, fluconazole, and echinocandins (Scharf et al., 2010). These medications can interfere with the brain microvascular endothelial growth and the function of the brain microvascular endothelial cells. These medications may increase the risk of suicide or attempted suicide (Khan et al.


## Methods

[*] The characteristics of the dogs were categorized into three groups: dogs with known symptoms of illness or disease, dogs with known symptoms of injury or death, dogs with known symptoms of distress, and dogs with no symptoms of distres. The clinical outcomes of the dogs were classified into two groups: ones with known symptoms of illness, and those with no symptoms of distress.

[*] The diagnosis of dermatitis was based on the epidemiological data of our study [5] and was based on the diagnosis of dermatitis using an algorithm of the International Diagnostic and Statistical Organisation (ICD-9) [25]. According to the reference reference manual of the International Diagnostic and Statistical Organisation (ICD-9), dermatitis was diagnosed when two dermatitis tests were used: the clinical appearance of dermatitis and the dermatitis-related clinical manifestations. The histological findings were based on the inclusion of the serological examination, the analysis of the phalloid glandular region, and the histologic examination.

[*] The clinical features were based on the presence of the lesions in the skin of the dog, which were characterized by the presence of black bands, a darkening of the nails, or a white coloration [26]. The histological results were based on the presence of a lesion in the skin.

[*] The diagnosis of benign skin diseases was based on the assessment of the following characteristics: presence of a lesion on the hair or skin of the dog, and presence of a lesion in the nails, using the Histostriatal Inclusion and exclusion criteria [27,28].

[*] The diagnosis of chagitis was based on the clinical features and the histological findings. The histological findings were based on the inclusion of the histological examination, the analysis of the phalloid glandular region, the analysis of the vitreous glandular region, and the analysis of the histologic examination.

[*] The diagnosis of ulcerative meningitis was based on the histological findings, the analysis of the phalloid glandular region, the analysis of the phalloid glandular region, and the histologic examination. The histological findings were based on the presence of the lesions on the hair or skin of the dog.


## Results
The SSU of the first two OTUs was assigned to the draft genome of the well-characterized mouse IgG1 mouse model of autism (Illustrative Fig 1) (7. To investigate whether a particular pattern of gut microbiota can be identified in the autism population, we generated a random forest tree with a cut-off cutoff of ~3 OTUs per kilobase of exon per Million reads (KEGG) and a cutoff of ~10 OTUs per kilobase of exon per Million reads (KEGG) using the program MEGA v. 3.0.0 (8). We found that among the 16 genes with the highest number of OTUs, 12 were unique to the autism population (Table 1 and Fig 1). Among these, three are not yet characterized by existing studies.

The first and the fourth genes with the highest number of OTUs are the control genes (PDB code: RPB2; Table 1). We found that genes with high numbers of OTUs were expressed more strongly in autism children than in the control group (Fig 2). The genes with the highest number of OTUs were also enriched in the right arm of the right-handed barrel (Fig 2). The genes with the lowest number of OTUs were also enriched in the left arm of the left-handed barrel (Fig 2).

The analysis of gut microbiota in autism children showed that there were no significant differences between the autism and the control groups, and the gut microbiota of autism children was similar to the control (Fig 3). The control microbiota was composed of tightly grouped proteins (Fig 3), with a few unassigned classes including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The control microbiota was composed of a mixture of unidentified bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. There was a high amount of Firmicutes in the control microbiota, with a high abundance in the left arm (Fig 3). The left arm of the left-handed barrel (Fig 3) showed a similar pattern of gut microbiota composition, with a strong abundance of Firmicutes. In contrast, the right arm of the right-handed barrel showed a similar pattern of gut microbiota composition, with a more diverse composition of unidentified Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (Fig 3).


## Discussion
However, a limitation of the study was that we did not have all the information we wanted to in order to detect microbiological diversity in the small intestine of childre. The study was also conducted in the laboratory where the study was done and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results. We have also investigated the presence of microbiota in the intestine of children using a patient-matched group. Our findings are in line with those of other studies that have used small intestinal samples [7-9, 12-14] and demonstrated the microbiome of children is different from that of their mothers [15]. We found that the microbial communities in the small intestine of children were largely dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. This suggests that this species may be more prevalent in the small intestine of children, and that it may be a more important taxon in autism. In addition, the presence of these taxa in the small intestine of children may be a contributing factor in the development of autism.

We showed that the bacterial microbiota in the small intestine of children were largely dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. This is consistent with previous studies that have observed the presence of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the small intestine of children [7, 9, 12]. However, the presence of these bacteria in the intestine of children was not significant, as demonstrated by the presence of other taxa, such as Proteobacteria.

In the study of the proteome of children with autism, we observed that the proteome of children with autism was dominated by Actinobacteria. This may be related to the fact that Actinobacteria is a major commensal bacteria in the small intestine of children, and that Actinobacteria is a risk factor for autism [16]. We also found that the proteome of children with autism was dominated by Firmicutes. However, the presence of Firmicutes in the small intestine of children with autism was not significant, as demonstrated by the presence of other taxa, such as Proteobacteria. This suggests that the presence of Actinobacteria in the small intestine of children with autism may be a contributing factor in the development of autism.

The bacterial community in the small intestine of children with autism was dominated by Bacteroides.
