## Abstract

The effects of host and pathogen on immune cell surface states are critical to host defence and control of diseas. How these changes are mediated is not fully understood. Here we show that Lipo-dependent Cu uptake and maturation is required for the development of inflammation in macrophages. We find that Cu uptake in the cells is regulated by the release of key macrophage cytokines, including interferon alpha (IFN-<U+03B3>) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). This regulation is governed by the master regulatory pathway that contains the lipooligosaccharide guanidine monooxygenase (Liposomal glycine). We show that Cu uptake by macrophages from LPS-infected and immune-challenged C3b/c mice is regulated by two important regulatory pathways: the host-pathogen interaction and the protective lysis. This regulatory paradigm is distinct from that in human lPS, where the lysosomal glycine is predominantly catabolized by macrophages. This lysis of macrophages is governed by a master regulatory circuit that utilizes the master lipase CuRpo1, a mutation-free amino acid decarboxylase (L-CuEx) to synthesize long chain fatty acids that, in turn, play essential roles in the host defence against pathogens. This regulatory paradigm is distinct from the host-immune-cancers paradigm, where the regulation of lysis is controlled by the master lipase CuRpo1. We also identify a key regulatory pathway in Cu uptake by macrophages that could be uniquely controlled by this lysis process. In addition, we demonstrate that the ability of the CuEx enzyme to cleave long hairpin polysaccharides was uniquely required for their survival in immune-challenged C3b/c mice. Finally, we identify a unique lysis-related mechanism in which the master lipase CuRpo1 functions to control lysis of lysosomal glycine and glycobiology. Together, these findings suggest that L-CuEx is uniquely needed to control the development of inflammation.

IMPORTANCE The global burden of opportunistic fungal infection is rising and continues to rise. Here, we report the first case of a human mycosis caused by the prototypical human mycosis Mycosis (P.


## Introduction
The pathogenic yeast is present in most parts of the world, but the burden of disease in immunocompromised patients is highest in the developing countrie. In contrast, in immunocompromised patients, Cryptococcus neoformans is a frequent cause of life-threatening invasive fungal infections and mortality rates that reach 60% in the developed world [1]. The main pathogenic yeast species include C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. deuterogattii, although some species are even present in environmental settings [2]. Cryptococcus neoformans is capable of producing the characteristic encephalomyelitis morphology, which is often accompanied by a rise in serum creatinine concentration and elevated serum protein [2]. As a consequence of this neurotropism, the development of fungal infections can be quite life-threatening, with mortality rates that range from 30% to 70% in immunocompromised patients [2].

Cryptococcus neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is able to survive inside macrophages. In this state, it can outcompete all the other pathogenic yeast species and escape phagocytosis and subsequent killing by macrophages [3]. Macrophages are major players in the outcome of cryptococcosis, as they kill the yeast cells within weeks of phagocytosis. Macrophages can eliminate Cryptococcus from the environment [4], [5], but macrophages fail to clear Cryptococcus from the lungs [6]. This outcome is dependent on the level of cytokine production from macrophages, as Cryptococcus is able to survive inside macrophages. Other macrophage-killing mechanisms include the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by macrophages [7], [8]. This immune evasion mechanism allows Cryptococcus to evade macrophage killing by hiding within the macrophage.

The development of drug resistance and the necessity of various mechanisms of innate immune evasion by the yeast within macrophages and other phagocytes is of great concern, especially with regard to the development of antifungal drug therapies.


## Methods
To identify the subcellular-associated (TL) and the TL-associated (TLAPA) subcellular-associated (TLAPA) were taken as the thresholds to have a higher level of reliabilit. In order to confirm that the subcellular-associated (TL) and the TL-associated (TLAPA) subcellular-associated (TLAPA) were significantly different, the sequencing of the samples and the data processing of the data was performed using BioNumerics version 6.6.7 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) [36]. The sequences of the genes of interest were retrieved from the annotation files and aligned to the reference genome of the microsatellite species, using the manual alignment tool of the online tool Galaxy [37].

TL-associated and TL-associated genes of interest were compared to the 16S rRNA gene of the common cold. The data of the 16S rRNA gene, as well as the data of the TL-associated gene, were used to construct a matrix and a cut-off of the genes were computed. The mean and standard deviation of the standard deviation was calculated. The correlation between the mean and standard deviation of the gene of interest was calculated using the correlation tool of the online tool Galaxy. The relationship between the mean and standard deviation of the gene of interest was also calculated.


## Results
cerevisiae-driven RNAi platform with the aim of reducing costs and increasing competition in the host is a critical strategy for controlling infectio. For this reason, we evaluated the utility of this approach for genetic manipulation of host immune response. We reasoned that if the host is capable of sensing a pathogen and is able to recognize the pathogen, then it is expected that the host will be able to recognize the pathogen and subsequently recognize the pathogen. We first tested the efficacy of deleting the most common class of microRNAs, which are derived from the mitochondria. These microRNAs can be either single or double or triple or quadruple, and the microRNAs are either designed to express or to be expressed by the recipient cells. The target microRNA can either be expressed in the recipient cells or in the recipient cells. The microRNAs are either designed to express or to be expressed by the recipient cells or in the recipient cells. The target microRNA can either be expressed in the recipient cells or in the recipient cells.

## Discussion
dermatitidis infection depends on a range of biological processes, including the production of small molecules and/or the release of inflammatory mediator. The transcriptome analysis of B. dermatitidis infected mice showed that the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, pathogenesis, immunity, and stress response was down-regulated in the infected mice. The gene encoding the homolog of TCA-dependent N-acetylglucosamine synthase (TCA1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of the homolog of TCA-dependent enzyme (TCA2) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a cell wall-associated peptide synthase (SCAM1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a mitochondrial protein (NAD-dependent protein kinase (NAD-kinase) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a gene encoding a toxin (GTR-C1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a signaling protein (MSP-G10) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a pheromone (PTH-G1) and chitin synthase (COOH) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a cell wall-associated protein (CWF1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a lipid-related protein (TINY1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a protein-related gene (TREK) was also down-regulated in the infected mice. The expression of a protein-related gene (PET1) was also down-regulated in the infected mice.
