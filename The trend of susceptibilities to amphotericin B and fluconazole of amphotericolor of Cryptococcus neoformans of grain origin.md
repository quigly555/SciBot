## Abstract
Ochroconis spp. are dimorphic fungal pathogens that cause life-threatening asymptomatic head and neck tumors in humans. The primary agent of this infection is Ochroconis gannii (Og). Diagnosis of Og is a rare and often difficult to recognize entity. Cerebral oxysmal excision is a relatively common procedure in the setting of ochroconiosis and typically includes a series of biopsy samples that include the following: the head, lungs, brain, blood vessels, spleen, and brain biopsy (e.g., colon, mammary, liver, lung, pancreas, etc.). Clinical features and radiological findings in cases of ochroconiosis are often nonspecific, requiring a high degree of suspicion and consideration. Therefore, surgical procedures should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe ochroconiosis. This case demonstrates the importance of being aware of the common features of ochroconiosis, particularly the nonspecific nature of the features, and working through the various contraindications of surgical ochroconiosis and possible complications. This case report demonstrates the importance of broad differential diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of severe ochroconiosis and potential complications.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom contains many key plant pathogens, which contribute to global plant disease outbreaks (Van Ende et al., 2017). A number of plant pathogenic fungi cause disease in a wide range of hosts, and are recognized as plant pathogens by humans and other animals (Amano et al., 2015; El-Ghaouth et al., 2016).


## Methods
The whole blood sample was collected from the sacrificed animal by cardiac punctur. Blood was stored at -20°C until analysis.

Antimicrobial Activity of the Conventional Antifungal Agents
The standard antibiotics (IC_50) for the common antibiotics used in the study were A. fumigatus, E. coli, L. pneumophila, and A. niger. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [20]. The animal experiments were approved by the University of São Paulo School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number: 03-01-2008).

Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing
The drug susceptibilities to antibiotics were assessed according to CLSI guidelines [21]. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the CLSI guidelines [22]. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the antibiotics were compared to the standard susceptibility testing assay (SAP) assay. The MICs of each antibiotic were determined as the lowest concentration showing no visible growth of bacteria. The endpoints was determined as the lowest drug concentration that significantly inhibited visible growth of bacteria. The sample was diluted and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco, Detroit, MI) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The MICs were defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of bacteria. The MICs were defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of bacteria. The results were evaluated by the micro-dilution method. The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited the growth of bacteria. The data were evaluated by the broth dilution method. The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited the growth of bacteria. The growth was monitored at 72 h, 48 h, and 72 h. The data were evaluated by the micro-dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [21].

In Vitro Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
The MICs of the antibacterial agents were evaluated by the broth dilution method.


## Results
To develop a novel route of administration of antifungal drug to treat cryptococcal meningitis, we have performed antifungal drug-delivery systems. This strategy has been successfully employed in other systems and is known as “havroviral delivery” [12].

The delivery of drugs into the brain is a complex process. In order to understand the delivery of drug to the brain, we have conducted a series of delivery systems (Table 1). The first delivery system consists of an intravenous injection of drug (5 mg/kg) in the BALB/c mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis, followed by a subcutaneous injection of fluconazole in the BALB/c mouse model of meningitis (Fig 1). The second delivery system consists of a subcutaneous injection of drug (5 mg/kg) in the BALB/c mouse model of meningitis, followed by a subcutaneous injection of fluconazole in the BALB/c mouse model of meningitis (Fig 1). The delivery system is composed of an intravenous injection of drug (5 mg/kg) in the BALB/c mouse model of meningitis, followed by a subcutaneous injection of fluconazole in the BALB/c mouse model of meningitis (Fig 1).


## Discussion

In the present study, MIC_50 value of amphotericin B against Candida albicans was 6.0 µg/ml and a similar MIC_50 value of fluconazole against Candida albicans was 62.5 µg/ml, and a similar MIC_50 value of fluconazole against Cryptococcus neoformans was 63.6 µg/ml. However, the results of MIC_50 value of fluconazole against Candida albicans were 100-fold lower than those reported in previous studies [16, 17]. In the present study, MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C. albicans was 100-fold lower than that of fluconazole against C. tropicalis, which had a MIC_50 value of 63.5 µg/ml. In the previous studies, MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C. tropicalis was 100-fold lower than that of fluconazole against C. albicans [16, 17]. The results of the current study showed that a MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C. tropicalis was 100-fold lower than that of fluconazole against C. albicans. The MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C. tropicalis was 100-fold lower than that of fluconazole against C. albicans. It is known that the MIC_50 value of fluconazole is an important factor in the antifungal susceptibility of yeasts. For C. albicans, MIC_50 value of fluconazole was 100-fold higher than that of fluconazole for treatment of systemic candidiasis in mice [17]. It was reported that a dose of fluconazole (5 mg/kg) for 6 days, at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, resulted in a breakthrough and fatal infection in mice [18]. The data presented in the current study showed that an MIC_50 value of fluconazole was 100-fold higher than that of fluconazole for treatment of systemic candidiasis in mice.

In the current study, a MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C. albicans was 100-fold lower than that of fluconazole against C. tropicalis. The MIC_50 value of fluconazole against C.
