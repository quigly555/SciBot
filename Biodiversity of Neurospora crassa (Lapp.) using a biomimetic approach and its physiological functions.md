## Abstract
A unique feature of the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathway is its ability to polarize the corresponding lipids to the plasma membrane. While the roles of the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway in plant resistance to fungal infection are well established, the contribution of the lipids themselves to resistance to euascoma is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the lipid composition of the lipids and perform a role of lipid biosynthesis in the promotion of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) by A. fumigatus. We found that the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway was sensitive to the oxidative burst of FHB, and that their contribution was increased during the conidial infection. The low-osmolarity glycerol pathway was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress, but was not sensitive to the hydrogen peroxide stress of A. fumigatus. The low-osmolarity glycerol pathway was sensitive to alkaline pH stress, and to heat stress. Our results suggest that the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway is a suitable system for the promotion of resistance to FHB by F. fumigatus and thus of resistance to FHB during the infection of FHB-tolerant plants.


## Introduction
albicans, . dubliniensis, C. glabrata, and C. neoformans (Dinan et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2016).

The development of multi-species biogeography is an important process of ecological adaptation, and it is generally acknowledged that it has the potential to be a complex and dynamic process (Höller and Sundstrom, 2010). Various taxa, including the phylum Nemato-distantly related, have been placed in the biogeographic group (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011; DiCosmo et al., 2014). A variety of species of both marine and terrestrial organisms are found in the various marine environments, including soil, freshwater, and plants (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011; DiCosmo et al., 2014). Marine phyllosphere fungi, including the phylum Nemato-distantly-related, are grouped into seven phyla (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011), and they are divided into three phyla (C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. neoformans) based on phylogenetic analyses of rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor (TEF) and beta-tubulin gene (BT2) gene expression (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011; DiCosmo et al., 2014).

The genus Phyllosphere includes approximately 5% of all fungi (Woudenberg, 2007). Phyllosphere fungi are ubiquitous in the environment (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011), and they can be found in soil, air, water, and plants (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011; DiCosmo et al., 2014). Many species, including the phyllosphere fungi, have been reported as pathogens of plants (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011), and many species of Phyllosphere fungi are considered potential sources of food (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011).

The genus Phyllosphere includes approximately 5% of the genera of fungi (García-de-Sousa et al., 2011).


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The wild type C. albicans strain SC5314 (serotype A) was used to perform all experiments. The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All the yeast strains used in this study were cultured on Vogel's agar (Vogel, Brno, Poland) at 37°C for 5 days.


## Results
 2016.

Among the different species of this genus, one species, C. rigida, was the most abundantly isolated. This species was recently transferred to the new genus C. crassa (Crous et al., 2016). C. rigida was recently transferred to the new genus C. elegans, a new species from France (Crous et al., 2016). C. elegans was recently transferred from the family Cucurbitaria to C. clavigera (Crous et al., 2016). C. elegans was recently transferred from the family Cucurbitaria to C. maculans (Crous et al., 2016). The above mentioned species were collected in the USA and the Netherlands.

Species of C. strictonii have been classified in the family Cucurbitaria sensu stricto (Crous et al., 2004). The genus is not monotypic because it is morphologically very similar to the clade, which is known from several species. In the genus Cucurbitaria, the closest relatives to the genus are C. cercospora and C. aff. pseudocercospora (Crous et al., 2004, 2014). The closest relatives of the clade are C. australis and C. hirsutum, which were isolated from Japan (Lapp.) and Thailand (Crous et al., 2004).

Species of the Cucurbitaria sensu stricto (Crous et al., 2004) were collected from the USA and Japan.

Phylogenetic relationships of the Cucurbitaria sensu stricto species
The concatenated seven-gene trees were rooted with best topologies consistent with the multi-gene data. The tree topologies are shown in Fig 2 and 3. The tree topology of the cercosporoid clade is more congruent with the multi-gene data than to the multi-gene tree. The cercosporoid clade is more congruent with the multi-gene tree than with the multi-gene tree.

The multinucleated conidia of the Cucurbitaria sensu stricto species are not differentiated. They are broadly ellipsoidal to subfusoid, occasionally subcylindrical, and usually longer than conidia of the other species (Fig 2).


## Discussion

In addition to morphological changes, we also observed growth changes on cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from the vertebrate host. We observed significant differences in the size of the lesion, size of the lesions and lesion development in the vertebrate hosts. In the vertebrate hosts, the size of the lesion increased at the early stages of disease. At this stage, the lesions were larger than those of the vertebrate hosts. This increased lesion size was not observed in the vertebrate hosts. Although the extent of lesion development in the vertebrate hosts was not obvious, the extent of lesion development in the vertebrate hosts was significantly greater than that in the vertebrate hosts.

During the early stages of disease, the lesion size increases with the time of lesion development. In the vertebrate hosts, the lesion size increased rapidly after lesion development and was also increased in the vertebrate hosts. The lesion development of the vertebrate hosts was higher than that of the vertebrate hosts. The lesion size of the vertebrate hosts was much larger than that of the vertebrate hosts, and the lesion size was much larger than that of the vertebrate hosts. This is consistent with the fact that the pathogenic fungi have an advantage in the hosts and consequently increase in size.

Molecular studies have shown that the microfilariae cell wall is made up of a complex of different ß-1,2-linked mannans, ß-1,4-linked mannans and ß-1,4-linked mannans. This complex is comprised of a small number of mannose-linked mannans, ß-1,4-linked mannans and ß-1,3-linked mannans. The cell wall of M. oryzae is composed of mannose-linked mannans, ß-1,4-linked mannans and ß-1,3-linked mannans. The cell wall of M. oryzae is composed of ß-1,3-linked mannans and ß-1,3-linked mannans. This complex is comprised of ß-1,3-linked mannans and ß-1,4-linked mannans. The cell wall of M.
