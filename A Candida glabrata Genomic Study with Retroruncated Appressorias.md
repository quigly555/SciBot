## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is most often caused by members of the Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species complexes that are divided into two sibling species, C. gattii predominantly and C. neoformans the majority (71%) is confined to immunocompromised, primarily HIV-infected, patients with an unfavorable prognosis. Systemic, supportive therapies, including corticosteroids, are effective in about half of cases, but few have demonstrated a curative effect. The recent availability of broad spectrum oral antifungal agents, coupled with the success of the drugs cyclophosphamide and itraconazole, has paid off. However, there is a dearth of clinical trial data that can establish a clinical impact on outcomes, so investigators are weighing the benefits of targeting specific phenotypes over established, well-established, well-established drug treatment strategies. Here we present the first comprehensive clinical trial data of cyclophosphamide alone and in combination for cryptococcosis in HIV-infected, previously healthy, and previously immunocompromised patients with presumed underlying conditions. Seventy-nine patients (32.1%) with suspected cryptococcosis died. At the individual clinical level, we report a male patient with HIV who developed cryptococcosis with meningoencephalitis, and he subsequently expired. Our data indicate that treatment with cyclophosphamide for cryptococcosis was effective, with residual antifungal therapy in place.


## Introduction
 2008, 2010), and a genetically tractable Candida glabrata strain that has been genetically tractable but not yet fully adapted (Groucho et a., 2008, 2010).

The widely used type VI secretion system (Tinsberg et al., 2012) consists of a tinsbergiae-like model with an N-terminal cAMP-dependent histidine kinase and a cAMP-dependent histidine demethylase (Woudenberg et al., 1996; Tinsberg et al., 2012; Siles et al., 1997). The cAMP-dependent histidine demethylase (CDM) is a large proteolytic cleavage protein that catalyzes the hydroxylation of cAMP to form cAMP, which is then processed by the N-terminal CDM (Dong et al., 2013). The cAMP-dependent histidine demethylase (CDMn) is a type II secretion system and the type II secretion system of Candida species (Kneale et al., 1998; Kneale et al., 1999; Niles et al., 2001; Woudenberg et al., 1996; Tinsberg et al., 2012). CDMn is a heterotrimeric protein composed of two subunits, CDM1 and CDM2. CDMn does not appear to be evolutionarily related, but is closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDMn and to mammalian CDMn (Siles et al., 1997; De Jong et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2006; Woudenberg et al., 1996). CDMn can be induced to form heterotrimeric CDMn proteins (De Jong et al., 1998), or it can be the sole component of CDMn (Woudenberg et al., 1996) (Kneale et al., 1999; Niles et al., 2001; Woudenberg et al., 1996) (Kneale et al., 1999; Niles and Keller, 2006). The induction of CDMn expression can be controlled by the expression of a number of different proteins, such as CDM1 (Woudenberg et al., 1996; Kneale et al., 1999; Niles and Keller, 2006), CDM2 (Woudenberg et al., 1996), CDM1A (Tinsberg et al., 2012), CDM1B (Lee et al.


## Methods
cb.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)); with a modification of the method described previously [13]. A single fungal colony was isolated from a petri dish containing a single agar plug from a Petri dish containing 20 ml of RPMI-1640, supplemented with 2% glucose, and then cultured in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 3 days. Then, the fungal colonies were isolated using sterile method and the number of CFUs was determined. Three replicates were performed for each treatment and the results were presented as mean ± SD.

Identification of Candida species and characterization of Candida spp.
The strains of Candida spp. used in this study are listed in Table 1. Candida glabrata strains and their mutants were isolated from the culture of clinical isolates of Candida spp. Fungal culture was carried out on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Crous et al. 2009) medium [28]. The mycelial plugs (5 mm diameter) of the colony were excised from the PDA medium, ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle and then inoculated on PDA plates with the seed of C. glabrata. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and observed for colony color.

Characterization of Candida spp. from culture and PDA plates
The Candida spp. were identified from the PDA culture according to the Candida genus name. The isolate was isolated from a patient with invasive Candida infection who was treated for treatment with PDA. The yeast strains of Candida spp. were isolated from the culture of a patient with invasive Candida infection who was treated with PDA. The yeast strains were cultured on PDA medium. The PDA plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The appearance of a colored colony on the PDA plates was recorded.

Detection of endophytic endophytic fungi in Candida spp.
The endophytic endophytic endophytic fungi of C. glabrata were identified according to the characteristics of Candida spp. as described previously [29]. The endophytic endophytic fungi were identified according to the endophytic species name. The fungi were cultured on PDA medium at 37 °C for 48 h.


## Results
For the Candida glabrata strain, the number of extracellular vesicles was significantly lower in the presence of glucose (.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 g/ml, P < 0.01) (Table 4). For the C. glabrata strain, the number of extracellular vesicles in the presence of glucose was significantly lower (7.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 g/ml, P < 0.05) (Table 4). For the C. glabrata strain, the number of extracellular vesicles was significantly lower in the presence of fructose (7.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 g/ml, P < 0.05) (Table 4). These results indicated that the C. glabrata strain is able to utilize glucose, fructose, and glucose-rich substrates as well as extracellular vesicles in the presence of glucose and fructose.

Since the Candida glabrata strain is the only strain that can grow on glucose, we tested the impact of glucose on the growth of the C. glabrata strain in the presence of glucose and fructose. The Candida glabrata strain grew on glucose in the presence of fructose and glucose-rich substrates (Figure 1). The C. glabrata strain grew on glucose in the presence of fructose and fructose-containing substrates in the absence of glucose. We found that the C. glabrata strain grew on glucose in the presence of fructose and fructose-containing substrates in the presence of glucose. The results indicated that the C. glabrata strain has the capacity to utilize glucose and fructose in the presence of glucose and fructose.

We next tested the effect of fructose and glucose on the growth of the C. glabrata strain. The C. glabrata strain grew on fructose in the presence of fructose and fructose-containing substrates (Figure 2). The C.

brucei, . cruzi, and P. marneffei and Other Candida spp. Genome Assembly: A Study of Genome Assembly by Image Viewer with 28,138 Strains and 4,474 BGCs from Occhiolo/Sporopinia spp. Genome Assembly: A Study of Genome Assembly by Image Viewer with 26,245 Strains and 2,237 BGCs from Pichia, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Candida, and Pichia.

Also, the results of the genome sequencing of A. fumigatus and A. terreus indicated that the two species are capable of forming fruiting bodies with a density of only ~2.5 fruiting bodies per ml.

Phylogenetic analysis of the A. fumigatus and A. terreus combined sequences of the ITS, LSU, RPB2, and TEF1 regions of the genomes of these two species, and phylogenetically related species were identified.

In addition to the previously described species A. fumigatus and A. terreus, two new species of A. terreus and A. fumigatus were identified. The two new species A. fumigatus and A. terreus have been previously identified in other species, but the ITS and TEF1 regions of the A. terreus and A. fumigatus genomes were not completely sequenced. Therefore, this study provides the first information about these two new species in the Aspergillus and Coccidioides genera.

The phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and TEF1 regions of the A. terreus and A. fumigatus genomes indicated that the two new species are genetically distinct from each other, with a high degree of genetic and morphological similarity.

Comparison of the phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and TEF1 regions of the A. terreus and A. fumigatus genomes revealed that the two new species are related to each other, as revealed by the phylogenetic analyses of the LSU, RPB2, and TEF1 regions.

The molecular phylogenetic analysis of the LSU, RPB2, and TEF1 regions showed that the two new species are closely related to each other. The LSU and RPB2 sequences of A. fumigatus and A.
