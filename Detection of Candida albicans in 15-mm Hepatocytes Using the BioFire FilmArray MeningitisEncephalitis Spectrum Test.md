## Abstract
Leptographium spp. are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause most of the world’s most destructive infectious disease leptospirosis. Leptospira infection is frequently refractory to therapeutic treatment and remains a public health concern. Optimal therapy with limited chemotherapeutic options and prolonged antimicrobial therapy are critical parameters for optimal clinical outcomes. The present study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of flucytosine against L. infantum infected with Leptospira species in a subcutaneous multiple sclerosis model. Eighteen eyes were infected with L. infantum and treated with 14 days of continuous therapy. The effect of flucytosine on lesion size, lesion penetration, and engorged histopathology was evaluated. The study revealed that flucytosine had a significant effect on the size decline and lesion penetration decline of L. infantum and reduced lesion penetration and engorged histopathology in the eyes. In the lesion diameter reduction, the treatment had a significant effect on lesion penetration, lesion penetration, and engorged histopathology. In the lesion diameter reduction, the treatment had a significant effect on lesion penetration, lesion penetration, and engorged histopathology.


## Introduction
(Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida glabrata) with high prevalence in blood samples and CNS samples from patients with suspected haematological malignancie.

BioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Antigen Tests) [19] (1) [20] in case of negative blood culture (NCC) results of Candida albicans showed high antifungal susceptibility, which indicated that the antifungal susceptibility of Candida albicans may be more than the resistance to the drug itself [19] (Figure 1). It was observed that the antifungal susceptibility of Candida albicans can be explained by two main mechanisms: (1) the overgrowth of Candida spp. (in the presence of other Candida spp.) and (2) the overgrowth of Candida glabrata that is present at very low levels in the blood. These two mechanisms are, however, distinct.

Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidemia and it is associated with bloodstream infections of high clinical relevance [21]. The presence of Candida glabrata in blood cultures is believed to be due to the overgrowth of the fungus and the overgrowth of Candida spp. in the blood, and has been shown to be related to its ability to form biofilms (a morphological change that allows the fungus to invade and colonize the blood vessels). The fungus, in turn, produces hyphae and invasiveness in order to invade and colonize the blood vessels [21]. The hypha formation in Candida albicans is dependent on the presence of several nutrients: glucose, mannitol and galactose. In addition, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are found on the surface of the yeast cell wall. The structure of GAG is critical to the formation of biofilm on the surfaces of the host and is regulated by several factors, such as cell wall mannitol and cell wall mannitol [21].

Mannan is an essential polysaccharide found in the cell wall of many fungi, including the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [22], and is one of the key virulence factors of C.


## Methods
 Burnaby, BC, Canada)
The first step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to identify . albicans with a microsomal presence in the presence of a red fluorescent dye. In a typical culture of a normally healthy human immunodeficient (HIV-II) “unsupplemented” human immunodeficient (HIV-III) patient, C. albicans is present in the culture medium. The first step is to confirm the presence of C. albicans by using the bioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test (BioFire Technologies, Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada) as previously described [11]. Briefly, the procedure is performed using the same pre-concentrated medium as previously described [10]. The wells of the bio-filter (5 µm) were washed with sterile water to remove the non-cured C. albicans cells. The bio-filter is placed on a slide in the negative control and the bio-filter is placed in the positive control (Figure 1).

The second step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to differentiate C. albicans from C. dubliniensis [12]. The first step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to determine the presence of C. albicans in the presence of C. albicans. This results in C. albicans being the first C. albicans in the culture medium. The first step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to distinguish C. albicans from C. dubliniensis. This results in C. albicans being the first C. albicans in the culture medium. The second step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to differentiate C. albicans from C. dubliniensis. This results in C. albicans being the second C. albicans in the culture medium. The third step in the Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) spectrum is to determine the presence of C. albicans in the presence of C. albicans. This results in C. albicans being the second C. albicans in the culture medium.


## Results
The detection of Candida albicans in the six-week-old Hepatocyte culture sample of healthy adults is of great importance to immunisation program. Candida albicans is often associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Although early detection of C. albicans infection has not been well characterized, the use of the Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test (BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test) could be the first line of defense against C. albicans infection. In this study, Hepatocyte culture samples of healthy adults were pre-incubated with 1 × 10^6 (w/v) C. albicans for 3 h and then the Hepatocyte suspension was inoculated into the Hepatocyte suspension for 3 h. Samples were diluted, plated onto the plate, and the number of colonies and total number of colonies was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg CrAg Kit. BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test (BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test) was designed to detect Candida albicans in the blood, Hepatocyte culture, and Hepatocyte suspension. Samples were diluted, plated onto the plate, and the number of colonies and total number of colonies were determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg CrAg Kit. Samples were plated onto the plate and the number of colonies and total number of colonies were determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg CrAg Kit.

The results of the BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test (BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test) were consistent with the results of the Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test (BME/Encephalitis/Encephalitis Spectrum Test). Candida albicans was detected in most of the Hepatocyte culture samples, but not in the Hepatocyte suspension, but in some of the blood samples.


## Discussion
In this study, we present the first comprehensive case of a Ugandan male with a confirmed Cryptococcus neoformans serotype D infection. The patient presented with a focal neurological lesion with bilateral cerebellar consolidation and a lesion on the left cerebellar side of the right ventricle and right side of the left arm, and an underlying cerebellar and cerebellar neuropilocytopenia, respectively. The patient’s symptomless neurological status was confirmed by multiple radiological and CT imaging findings, as well as by histopathology and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient’s clinical presentation was characterized by a mixed myelodysplastic, myelodysplastic, and non-myelodysplastic lesions on the cerebellar side of the left side of the cerebellar side of the left arm. The patient’s neurological symptoms were also consistent with other pulmonary aspergillosis cases [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Treatment for cryptococcosis includes amphotericin B, flucytosine, and induction therapy with fluconazole [7, 8].
