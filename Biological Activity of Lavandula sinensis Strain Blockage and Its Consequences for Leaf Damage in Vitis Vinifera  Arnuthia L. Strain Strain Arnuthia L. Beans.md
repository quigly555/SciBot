## Abstract
In this study, a fluconazole-based compound is conjugated with 5-pyridone, a flucytosine analogue widely used in the clinical setting. A series of fluorophores and a flucytosine-containing nanoparticle construct, mimicking the surface charge of a human alaA, were conjugated on fluconazole-pyrimidine and flucytosine (FLZ) via the slit end of the alanine nucleotide-binding attachment system (WAS) to obtain a simple, yet effective and safe drug combination. The drug was then packaged into vesicular vesicular transport bags (VDS), which were examined daily for clinical signs of toxicity, for the duration of the study, and compared with other clinically relevant amphotericin B-based antifungal agents. The drug was well tolerated, with all the possible exceptions of the fluconazole-based drug, with a slight potential for toxicization of the host cell. The drug was found to be non-toxic in nature at the time of sample collection. The safety of both the drug and the VDS was found to be in good agreement with clinical observations. In conclusion, the drug is safe and non-toxic in nature, and is non-toxic in nature when compared with other amphotericin B-based antifungal agents that have toxicities. The results of this study demonstrate that FLZ is a promising alternative to conventional amphotericin B-based antifungal agents in the treatment of invasive fungal infections.


## Introduction
Lavandula sinensis has been used for the treatment of respiratory, cutaneous, and urinary diseases [17. Lavandula sinensis has been used in the treatment of wounds, infection, and inflammation of the skin, joint, and skin folds [18]. Lavandula sinensis is one of the most important herbs of the Vitis genus used in the treatment of various skin conditions. It is used for the treatment of swelling, pain, and inflammation of the skin and the nails [19]. It is used in the treatment of menstrual problems, allergic reactions, and skin lesions caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [20]. Lavandula sinensis is used for wound healing, skin and nail diseases, and dermatoses caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [21,22]. Lavandula sinensis is used in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and infections caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [23]. It is used in the treatment of asthma, rheumatism, fever, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease [24]. The important medicinal uses of Lavandula sinensis are as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiulcer, antiulcer-destruction, and to reduce the septicemia [25]. It is used for the treatment of various diseases [26]. It is used for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, fever, and skin and nail diseases [27]. It is used as anesthetic, antiseptic, and aphrodisiac [28]. It is used for the treatment of rheumatism, indigestion, and pain caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [29]. It is used in the treatment of headache, sinusitis, rheumatism, and irritation of the skin caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [30]. It is used in the treatment of arthritis, ulcers, and skin lesions caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses [31]. It is used as anesthetic, antiseptic, and skin lesions caused by viruses [32]. It is used as anesthetic, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing agents [33]. It is used as anesthetic, anti-tumor, and wound healing agents [34].


## Methods
carinii were studied in order to test the impact of the previous method of antagonistic application of antiviral drugs on the growth of Vitis Vinifer. In order to test the efficacy of Lavandula sanguinis, a C. vineyard antifungal drug, Vitek 2 (CVS) was used [31]. In order to test the effects of V. sinensis on the growth of the V. sanguinis, a C. yellow vineyard antifungal drug, Tofu (Tofu), was used.

The antifungal activity of V. sinensis was tested with V. sinensis Tofu (Vitek 2) using the test tube method with high pH and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. A drop of Tofu was added to a 50 mL microtitre 96-well plate and incubated for 3 h. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm and converted into a percentage of growth inhibition. The data were presented as a mean of three independent experiments. The final concentrations of Tofu and Tofu + V. sinensis were 0.03-3.4 mg/mL and 0.25-1.0 mg/mL. The test was performed in triplicate. The inhibitory effect of Tofu was determined using the test tube method. A drop of Tofu was added to a 100 mL microtitre 96-well plate and incubated for 3 h. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm and converted into a percentage of growth inhibition. The final concentrations of Tofu and Tofu + V. sinensis were 0.02-0.05 mg/mL and 0.015-4.0 mg/mL, respectively. The data were presented as a mean of three independent experiments. The final concentrations of Tofu and Tofu + V. sinensis were 0.015-4.0 mg/mL and 0.039-1.0 mg/mL. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

2.3. Induction of AOX1 in V. sinensis
AOX1^-/-AOX1^-/-V. sinensis (V. sanguinis) was inoculated into 100 mL of YPD broth and incubated for 6 days at 37°C. V.


## Results
Lavandula sinensis was described by Arnuthia in the USA and also in the UK (Arnuthia 1991. In the present study, the isolates of this strain were obtained from the USA and the isolates of the other species from the USA are represented by the type strain, V. sinensis.

Lavandula sinensis L. beans, 1981) was described as a pathogen causing leaf spots. The conidial color of the conidia was initially yellowish yellow, finally blackish to greyish brown in color, changing to bright yellow to dark brown at maturity. The conidia of the type strain of L. beans (L. beans) are pale brown (1.3-)2.5-3.0(-3.5) × (0.5-)1.0-2.5(-2.5) µm, with several germ pores. In the present study, the conidia of the type strain of L. beans were very pale brown (1.3-)2.5-3.5(-4.5) × (0.5-)1.0-2.5(-2.5) µm.

Vitis Vinifera L. beans, 1981) was described as a pathogen causing leaf spots. The conidial color of the conidia was initially yellowish yellow, finally greyish brown to dark brown at maturity. The conidia of the type strain of V. Vinifera (L. beans) are yellowish brown (0.5-)1.3-2.5(-2.5) × (0.5-)1.0-2.5(-2.5) µm, with several germ pores. The conidia of the type strain of V. Vinifera are yellowish brown (0.5-)1.3-2.5(-2.5) × (0.5-)1.0-2.5(-2.5) µm.

## Discussion
Cupriva, and . Fasciola are able to grow on both foliar and leaf surfaces, and are unable to be grown in semi-solid medium (van Lijnen and L. Winterhout, unpublished).
