## Abstract
During a two-year study of the fungal community in the city of Pievella, Italy, 11 fungal isolates were obtained that were shown to be of species unknown and/or resistant to antifungal drugs. All these isolates are potential pathogens and pose a serious public health hazard for the community. To identify new antifungal drugs, Rhizopus lactonee (Rl) was the most frequently reported drug. Although it is reported to possess broad-spectrum antifungal activity, very little is known about the mechanisms used by fungi to increase their susceptibility to antifungal drugs. Rl represents one of the most potent antifungal drugs in existence. The drug was synthesized using yeast-assisted extraction and purified using 1% methanol for its mode of action. In addition, it was demonstrated that its mechanism of action is dependent on the ROS scavenger CYP51. Rl is a potent inhibitor of the virulence determinants Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium graminearum. Moreover, the antifungal activity of Rl against clinical Aspergillus species was demonstrated. Taken together, the data presented here indicated that Rl is a potent antifungal agent against fungi with the potential to greatly enhance the efficacy of antifungal treatments. It can be considered as a rational strategy for the development of new antifungal drugs.


## Introduction
Fungal infections affect millions of people worldwide. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungus in the human body. The number of immunocompromised patients has been increasing due to immunosuppressive medications and AIDS. Over the past decades, the incidence of fungal infections has increased, and nowadays more than 10,000 life-threatening infections are reported annually [1]. There are several risk factors that influence the development of these infections. Candida albicans is the most common pathogen, and aspergilloma is a less common condition, which can be caused by any of the above-mentioned fungi [2]. The infection starts with inhaled fungal spores. The infectious agent inhaled fungal spores undergoes a morphological switch from the non-pathogenic yeast phase to the pathogenic hyphal phase. As a consequence, the fungus is able to survive in the human lung for long periods and invade other tissues, such as the skin and bone. The switch to the pathogenic hyphal form then enables the pathogen to invade the host tissues and invade the host tissue. The hyphal form then causes a localized infection and a progressive progressive necrotizing tissue injury. As a consequence, patients develop a wide variety of diseases, including invasive aspergillosis and aspergillomas [3].

Fungal infections caused by these fungi are difficult to treat. Treatment of these infections is hampered by the absence of specific antifungal drugs and the growing resistance of fungi to these drugs [4]. Therefore, the development of new antifungal agents is of critical importance to improve the overall effectiveness of current antifungals.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient that is required for the growth of fungi. Iron is found in the cell nucleus, and it is synthesized in the heme-containing ferric iron-containing protein ferritin. Ferritin is an enzyme that converts ferrous iron, the predominant ferric iron, to ferrous iron, ferric iron, ferric iron, and ferrous iron. Ferric iron is then transferred to the cell, where it is utilized for subsequent development [5]. Ferric iron is a heterogeneous polymer, consisting of two types of ferric atoms: ferric nanoparticles and ferric heteromers [6].


## Methods
[9] These rules were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of São Paul. All animals were handled according to the guidelines of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation. All animals were housed in sterile and controlled conditions in accordance with the Brazilian National Council for Animal Experimentation Control (CONCEA) Guidelines (COG) for the care and use of laboratory animals and the Animal Welfare Act (AWC) of the United States of America. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of São Paulo. The experiments were conducted according to the principles of good animal practice as recommended by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Society for Laboratory Animals.

Fungal strains and plasmids used in this study
The clinical isolates of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. R. G. Portillo-Alves (Duke University, USA) and Dr. R. J.G. Brown (Oregon Health and Science University, USA). C. albicans strains were routinely cultured on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) agar at 37°C. C. dubliniensis strains were routinely cultured on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) agar at 30°C. The mycelium was harvested by filtration and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then resuspended in PBS (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% NaCl). The cell suspension was collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and kept at -20°C until use.

Preparation of Lactoferrin and Lileium dahliae (LDA)
The LDA assay was performed using a previously described protocol [12] with slight modifications. Briefly, 100 µl of cell suspension was mixed with 3 µl of 1 mg/ml DMSO and incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. The solution was filtered and then cooled to room temperature.


## Results
The rules were amended with new rules, which were observed in the current study with .


## Discussion
fumigatus to LAC. LACR is a non-toxic, bactericidal agent that is used in clinical, animal, and human infections [1]. LACR can also be administered orally [5,6], via a needle, and intravenously [7]. LACR treatment induces intracellular accumulation of LACR [4,7], and, in some cases, has been reported in the human body [8,9]. In this investigation, we observed that LACR exposure led to an increase in the level of LACR in the CNS and increased the accumulation of LACR in the brain, suggesting that LACR could play an important role in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus-associated cerebral infections.

In our investigation, the LACR concentration was decreased in brains of infected mice treated with LACR. LACR-treated mice had a significant increase in the LACR concentration in the CNS, which was almost threefold higher than that in the absence of LACR. The result suggests that LACR plays an important role in the CNS infection of A. fumigatus.

The results of this study suggest that LACR could play an important role in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus-associated cerebral infections. Previous studies have also reported that LACR could stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and produce ROS, which could induce A. fumigatus to enter the brain and induce cerebral infection [10,11]. In addition, LACR could also stimulate the production of ROS and inhibit the synthesis of the superoxide anion, which can cause the release of superoxide anion and the oxidative stress [10].

In the current investigation, the results of LACR treatment showed that the LACR concentration increased in the brain, and the LACR concentration decreased in the brain. The authors observed that LACR could stimulate the synthesis of superoxide anion, which can cause the release of superoxide anion and the oxidative stress. In addition, the authors found that LACR can activate the cell-mediated oxidative stress response, and induce the synthesis of superoxide anion, which can cause the release of superoxide anion [10].
