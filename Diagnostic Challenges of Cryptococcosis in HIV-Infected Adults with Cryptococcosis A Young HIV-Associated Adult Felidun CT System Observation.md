## Abstract
The EphViridae is a large, filamentous family of the entomopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. It is found throughout the arid regions of the West and Central deserts, and is considered to be the most important saprobes in the order Rhizoctonia. In this study we examined the genetic diversity and phylogeny of the Rhizoctonia species and determined their cryptic species taxonomy. In total, 44 species are recognized among the Rhizoctonia species. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined dataset of LSU, ITS, rpb2, tef1 and tub2 sequence data revealed 50 species that are new to science. The remaining species are considered to be undescribed. Rhizoctonia species are re-described herein as Rhizopus oryzae (19 species), R. oryzae (7), R. oryzae (6), R. oryzae (5), and T. oryzae (3).


## Introduction
The genus Arthrorhynchus Lüe (Orthridium Lüe) was introduced by Van der Walt (1906) for three species, L.tulosea, L.corymbifera and M.chondriole (Lüe 1878). These fungi were described later as rare parasites of the plants, particularly lusciousus, which was collected in coastal areas of northern Italy from July 1878 to March 2001 [1]. The genus was defined by the presence of four epithets, and the presence of a “sporangium”, which could not be ascribed to any one species but had “several “persistent signs of association with other organisms” and “”possible influence on the distribution of the genus in nature” [2]. In recent years, the genus Arthrorhynchus has been recognized as an important plant pathogen, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in India, China, Australia, Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea [3-6].

There are several important aspects to be considered when seeking to correctly identify and identify a new species of Arthrorhynchus. First, the nomenclature for this genus is highly debated, and several authors have advocated a variety of different synonyms, including the current species [7]. Second, species names should be carefully selected to ensure that they are appropriate for each species and their phylogenetic relationship with other Arthrorhynchus species. For example, the authors of the current study used the name M.chondriole for the genus Arthrorhynchus, and they chose to include M.chondriole in their phylogenetic analyses. Third, the use of the name Arthrorhynchus is inappropriate for a taxonomic study of a pathogen that causes disease in a low-quality habitat, as the pathogen must have spread from a healthy plant host and then spread into the new environment. The authors should limit the use of the names they adopt in order to minimize the taxonomic impact of the study and their impact on the taxonomic practice. The fourth and finally, and most debated, issue concerns the use of the names used in the current study as a reference for the phylogenetic analyses of the pathogen.


## Methods
 Norman, OK. The IACUC confirmed that “risk of death” was a common denominator in the HIV-associated cryptococcal disease in adults with cryptococcal meningitis.

Study Design
This study was a prospective, observational study that enrolled adult HIV-infected adults aged 18-75 years from Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. HIV-associated cryptococcal disease is a serious and common opportunistic disease that afflicts approximately 1% of HIV-infected adults [7], [8]. The study was conducted in a high-risk setting.

We included the following: adults aged 18-75 years with either type of cryptococcosis, or HIV-associated cryptococcal disease in the cohort: HIV-positive (1-3 × 10^5/L), HIV-negative (4-8 × 10^4/L), HIV-pertussive (9-13 × 10^4/L) or HIV-pertussive (14-22 × 10^3/L).

We also included HIV-pertussive (3 × 10^6/L) and HIV-pertussive (3 × 10^5/L) adults with cryptococcal disease in the cohort.

Participants were followed from the University Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2013.

Study Ethics Statement
The Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital, Uganda approved this study (NIH Publication No. XM-84-01) and the study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board (IRB) from April 28, 2009 to December 31, 2012.

Patients’ data were anonymized in accordance with the principles of informed consent. The study was registered and reviewed by an IRB, and all data were analyzed anonymously.

Data Analysis
We conducted the primary analysis of cryptococcal disease incidence in HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis using the IACUC's Cryptococcal CrAg Quality Assessment tool [9]. We compared HIV-associated cryptococcal disease with other opportunistic opportunistic opportunistic diseases that were found in the cohort with cryptococcal disease in adults with cryptococcal meningitis.


## Results
A white blood cell count of 4 × 10^6 cells/µl was the normal range for the child (Table 1. After 1 week of CT, the child presented with fever, headache and blurred vision. The CT findings were unremarkable (data not shown), but the cranial drainage device was compromised in the child. The child had a fever of 105.5°F and 50.5°C, with a normal cranial drainage rate of 24/min/min. The cranial drainage device was stable, and the child was able to walk. The CT findings were unremarkable (data not shown), but the cranial drainage device was compromised in the child.

CT Findings of the CHS-FM Plasma Membrane
The results of CHS-FM analysis of the CHS-FM plasma membrane are presented in Figure 4. The plasma membrane showed a clear and punctate pattern (Figure 4A). There were numerous puncta with free mononuclear cells. The plasma membrane was uniformly punctate (Figure 4B). The plasma membrane was punctate and was punctate and punctate (Figure 4C). The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared thick and punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared loose and punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared smooth (Figure 4D). The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells.

In the case of the CHS-FM plasma membrane, the CHS-FM plasma membrane was punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane was punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells. The CHS-FM plasma membrane appeared punctate with free mononuclear cells and was punctate with free mononuclear cells.


## Discussion
The magnitude of this difference could be due to the difference in HIV status, age at diagnosis, and type of CD4^+ T cell depletio. We also found that HIV infection by CD4^+ T cell is more frequent in adults with CD4^+ T cell infection than in adults without CD4^+ T cell infection [9].

Although Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell was also higher in adults with CD4^+ T cell infection than in adults without CD4^+ T cell infection [9], we did not find any significant differences in Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell and HIV-infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection. This is likely due to the presence of CD4^+ T cells in HIV-infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection, rather than HIV-infected individuals with CD4^+ T cell infection [9].

However, in a recent study, Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell was found to be less frequent in HIV-infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection compared to HIV-infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection [10]. Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell has been reported in HIV-infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection [10]. In our cohort, the frequency of Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell in HIV-Infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection was also higher than that in HIV-Infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection. The frequency of Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell in HIV-Infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection was also higher than that in HIV-Infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection [10].

Our study population included adults with CD4^+ T cell infection. Although not statistically significant, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of Cryptococcus infection by CD4^+ T cell in HIV-Infected adults with CD4^+ T cell infection. The study population also had high HIV prevalence and CD4^+ T cell depletion.
