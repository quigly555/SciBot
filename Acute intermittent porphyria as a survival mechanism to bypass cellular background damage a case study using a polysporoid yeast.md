## Abstract
Antifungal activity of the four major polyphenolic compounds isolated from Pinus Cruciformis (Pcu) vineyards of the Netherlands was evaluated against the yeast Candida albicans and the filamentous ascomycete Dictyostelium discoideum. The compounds were evaluated in combination with flucytosine and amphotericin B. The two antifungal activities were observed in planktonic cells of Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium discoideum planktonicus, with the best activity achieved in the planktonic yeast Dictyostelium discoideum (92.4% and 96.2%, respectively). The following compounds were isolated and assessed in vitro against Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium discoideum planktonicus: calcofoside, cinnamicin, echinocandin, guanidine, 3-oxohexan-4-yeast, and tyrosinase. The compounds were isolated from the treated yeast strain Dictyostelium discoideum and the antifungal activity of the four compounds was evaluated. In vitro, the compounds were more selective and/or inhibited the growth of Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium discoideum planktonicus, and the results suggested that they were more effective than fluconazole against both yeasts and filamentous ascomycetes.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Invasive fungal infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and a number of mortality rates are increasing in developed countries (WHO, 2017). The most common agents are Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Other common species include Candida glabrata, C. auris, and C. parapsilosis. In the last decades, a significant number of studies have described the pathogenic role of opportunistic yeast species like Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis. The most important risk factor for invasive yeast infections is immunosuppression and appropriate treatment. However, the most common clinical presentation is candidiasis. Candida infections are caused by a wide spectrum of Candida species including C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis, but also by other Candida species, such as C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. auris, and C. tropicalis (Bartra et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2014; Voyack et al., 2016).


## Methods
oxysporum, as the model organism [30. Our data shows that bacterial and fungal infections of the urea-insoluble fraction of the urea-binding protein are efficient in pathogen-free mice, and that infection was the limiting factor for the survival of mice [31].

Adherence to gut wall was investigated by recording the density of the bacterial or fungal cells in the alveolar space. A total of 30^5 bacteria and 10^5 fungi were incubated with 20 µl of 1 × 10^6 bacterial cells in 20 µl of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the dark at room temperature. These cells were cultured for 24 h at 37°C in 1 × 10^6 fungal cells. After this period, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with the antibody cocktail (FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After this, the cells were washed three times with 1 × 10^6 PBS and stained with the antibody cocktail. Then, the stained cells were washed three times with 1 × 10^6 PBS and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Axio Scope A1; Carl Zeiss).

The ability of B. dermatitidis to bind to the gut wall of F. oxysporum was investigated by monitoring the distribution of the cell wall-associated fungi in the gut of mice, as described by [32]. Briefly, a total of 10^6 bacteria and 10^5 fungi were incubated with 20 µl of 1 × 10^6 bacteria and 10^5 fungi in 20 µl of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer in the dark at 37°C in 1 × 10^6 fungal cells. After this period, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with the antibody cocktail (FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After this, the cells were washed three times with 1 × 10^6 PBS and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Axio Scope A1; Carl Zeiss).


## Results
neoformans) [34] and a non-albicans yeast (. cereus) [35].

In a multivariate analysis of the effect of each carbon source (i.e. biomass, CO_2, FeSO_4, FeSO_4, CO_2, or H_2O) on the survival of the C. neoformans-neoformans complex, the pathogenicity of the C. neoformans-neoformans mixture (with CO_2 as the carbon source) was highly significant (P<0.05). As the only source of CO_2 that eliminated the C. neoformans-neoformans mixture, the lack of CO_2 alone did not alter the outcome of the experiment. In contrast, the removal of CO_2 from the C. neoformans mixture did significantly increase the number of viable cells, with the addition of 2 mM H_2O, but the killing effect of CO_2 was smaller (Table 1). The pathogenicity of the C. neoformans-neoformans mixture was significantly reduced in the presence of FeSO_4, with the removal of FeSO_4 producing a substantial effect (P<0.05).

The virulence of the C. neoformans-neoformans mixture was not significantly different in a dose-response manner to the different carbon sources (P<0.05). A survival curve was generated using a cumulative survival curve as the slope parameter of the Tukey’s HSD test. The results show that the C. neoformans-neoformans mixture induced a significant decrease in the virulence in a dose-response manner.

Impact of CO_2 on the Growth and Mating of C. neoformans Strains
The effect of CO_2 on the growth of C. neoformans strains was evaluated by different carbon sources (i.e. FeSO_4, H_2O, or FeSO_4 + FeNO_2). As shown in Fig 1, the growth of the C.


## Discussion
The lack of nutritional and environmental stress is mediated by the balance of the transport of proteins and carbohydrates in the intracellular environment [35], which is linked to cellular stress tolerance and adaptation to environmental changes [36. The decrease of carbon dioxide production is another response to carbon dioxide-induced oxidative stress, which is triggered by the lack of oxidative stress in the intracellular environment, as well as by an increase in levels of CO_2 [37].

Co-regulation of proteases
Co-expression of a broad range of proteinases (including some glycoside hydrolases) is generally considered as a typical response to a variety of stress conditions, including oxidative stress, osmotic and hydrophobic stresses, and the presence of an antioxidant system [38]. The transcriptional induction of proteases by the presence of glucose, maltose, fructose, arabinose and galactose is a common response to stress [39]. The majority of the proteases were expressed in the intracellular environment, including in the extracellular environment. Many of the proteases are thought to be involved in the degradation of exogenous nutrients, or are involved in the degradation of secreted or secreted proteins [40], [41]. In the extracellular environment, the majority of the proteases were up-regulated in the presence of glucose, maltose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, sucrose and trehalose, with the exception of the flavoprotein proteins, which are also up-regulated in the presence of these carbon sources. The expression of these proteins was also detected in the extracellular environment, suggesting that their role as a post-translational modification system has also been modulated in the extracellular environment.

Co-expression of a wide range of proteases (including some glycoside hydrolases) was found to be down-regulated in the extracellular environment. Among the proteases, the most abundant were the orthologue of the human DHA-1 homologue (DHA1-a) (CDR 70442) and two homologs of S. cerevisiae protein kinase (CDR 60518 and 60521) involved in the HOG-C (HaK2) and HOG-A (HaK1) pathways, respectively. The only exception was the homologue of the human homologue of S.
