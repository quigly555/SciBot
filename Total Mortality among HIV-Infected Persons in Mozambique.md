## Abstract
The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and the prevalence of fungal antigenemia and the prevalence of other immune-mediated pathologies (including HIV, EBV, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) have been rising slowly in Mozambique. Despite the recent increase in the number of HIV infected patients, the prevalence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) still remains unacceptably high in Mozambia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of NHL among HIV-infected patients in Mozambia.

The descriptive and univariate statistics data was presented. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NHL in HIV-HIV co-infected patients were calculated.

Among HIV-HIV co-infected patients, a total of 42 participants were selected according to the assigned gender according to WHO clinical and epidemiological criteria. The selected cohort of HIV-HIV patients consisted of 19 patients of which only 25 were admitted due to community service, 9 cases were admitted in the acute phase, and 3 cases were admitted in the acute phase. At the time of admission, 86% were aged between 25-44 years, 57% were from rural areas, and 29% were from sub-Saharan Africa. According to the initial disease, 67% of HIV-HIV co-infected patients presented with cryptococcal meningitis. The risk factors for NHL were referred to the research and onco-infection study.

Among HIV-HIV co-infected patients, there were only three significant risk factors for NHL (OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.09; P = 0.026).


## Introduction
The health system in the area is characterized by poor sanitation, which is partially attributable to HIV infection and the absence of a national data collectio.

The state health department (MIDD) of Mozambique (MND) has developed a national HIV/AIDS awareness campaign called, The Perfect Circle: A Vision for AIDS Control and Control (Part 1) [10]. The core of this campaign is the concept of the Perfect Circle Project, which is focused on HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention throughout the country. The Perfect Circle Project is composed of six national HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns: Mozambique First Steps Project, HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project, Central Africa Program, and Perfect Circle Project. These six national HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns were established in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The national HIV/AIDS awareness campaign is one of the key events of the national HIV/AIDS campaign. The national HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project was established in Mozambique in 2013, and the Central Africa program was established in 2016. The Perfect Circle Project is the largest and most successful national HIV/AIDS awareness campaign in the country. The national HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project was established in Mozambique in 2013 and has been successfully implemented in Mozambique since then. In 2017, the MND launched the National HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project (NEP), which aims to implement the national HIV/AIDS program in the country. The National HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project has attracted much attention from the scientific community as a reliable and reliable indicator of HIV disease burden and the magnitude of HIV/AIDS epidemic in this country. The MND launched the NEP in October 2017, and the NEP commenced in May 2018. The MND NEP aimed to implement the national HIV/AIDS program by providing lessons in HIV treatment and care, HIV/AIDS awareness campaign, and HIV/AIDS treatment in Mozambique. The National HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project was an initiative of the Mozambican Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDOT) (Morocco: Public Health Ministry, MDA Datalaga, Portalegre, Porto, Ethiopia). The National HIV/AIDS Emancipation Project aimed to implement the national HIV/AIDS program by providing lessons in HIV treatment and care, HIV/AIDS awareness campaign, and HIV/AIDS treatment in Mozambique.


## Methods
Sample Collection
A total of 54 clinical isolates of G. mellonella were collected from the respiratory tract in the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Table 1). The collected samples were identified by API-20C (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and API-20C-C (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).

Microscopic Observation
The experiment was performed on three plates: one containing H. mellonella (Charles B. and Don Carlos, Cat. No. 23-1585, Paris, France) and one containing G.


## Results
Compared with the other countries, Mozambique has the highest mortality rate in the sub-Saharan African region (Table 1. The age range of the deaths among HIV-infected persons was 29 years (range, 1,818-352,841). The age range of deaths among HIV-infected persons in the sub-Saharan African region was 16 years (range, 2,957-28,481) and in the other countries, the age range of deaths among HIV-infected persons was 14 years (range, 6,624-25,788). The age range of deaths among HIV-infected persons in the sub-Saharan African region was 19 years (range, 2,957-32,851) and the age range of deaths among HIV-infected persons in the other countries was 26 years (range, 6,721-31,350).

Mortality Among HIV-Infected Persons in Central Africa
There were 2,846 HIV-infected persons in Mozambique during 2012-2017. Compared with the other countries, the death rate among HIV-infected persons in Mozambique was 22.5% (range, 1.06-100), but there was no significant difference (p = 0.48). The death rate among HIV-infected persons in Mozambique was 4.9% (range, 0.68-14.3) and the death rate among HIV-infected persons in the other countries was 2.8% (range, 0.02-5.1) (Table 2).

Mortality Among HIV-Infected Persons in Transient Areas in Central Africa
There were 897 HIV-infected persons in Mozambique during 2012-2017. Compared with the other countries, the mortality rate among HIV-infected persons in Mozambique was 2.9% (range, 0.52-4.8) and the death rate among HIV-infected persons in the other countries was 3.5% (range, 0.05-5.2) (Table 3).

Mortality Among HIV-Infected Persons in Eastern Africa
There were 812 HIV-infected persons in Mozambique during 2012-2017.


## Discussion
% (37/171) and was not significantly different from that among the non-HIV infected persons in the current stud. While this difference might be due to the fact that the present study was conducted in an HIV-infected population, the HIV population in the present study was a population with a very low burden of TB. The lowest burden of TB was in the male group and the highest burden was in the female group, which is also a population with a very low burden of TB [28].

The prevalence of TB among HIV-Infected persons in Mozambique is 1.4% (37/171) and the prevalence of TB among HIV-infected persons in the current study was 1.4% (36/57). The current study is the first to report this prevalence of TB among HIV-infected persons in Mozambique, which was 1.4% (35/58). The current prevalence of TB among HIV-Infected persons in the current study was 1.2% (23/50), which was lower than that reported in the current study [29]. This may be due to the fact that the prevalence of TB among HIV-infected persons in the current study was much higher than that reported in the current study [29].

The prevalence of TB among HIV-infected persons in Mozambique was 3.6% (37/54) and the prevalence of TB among HIV-Infected persons in the current study was 1.5% (23/50). This result is comparable to that reported by Bensch et al. [30]. In addition, the HIV-infected persons in the current study had a lower burden of TB compared to the HIV-Infected persons in the previous study, which is also a population with a very low burden of TB. In this study, the prevalence of TB among HIV-Infected persons was higher than that in the HIV-Infected population in the present study. This might be due to the fact that HIV-Infected persons are more likely to have tuberculosis, which is a more common cause of TB in HIV-infected persons, and the incidence of TB in HIV-infected persons is extremely high compared to the prevalence of tuberculosis in the present study [30].
