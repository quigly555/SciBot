# Cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients: the highs and lows
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
The cephalopiloid diethyoid fungus, Pichia pastoris, is a causative agent of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which is extremely common in tropical and temperate regions. The high mortality of this fungus even in immunocompromised patients is a real problem because of its intrinsic resistance to the drugs commonly used to treat infections. The improved understanding of P. pastoris pathogenesis has opened new perspectives for therapeutic development. In this review, we provide an overview of the main P.


## Introduction
The HIV-associated immune suppression, or the “AIDS state,” has been defined as those times when HIV-infected patients are 2-4 times more likely to die from AIDS than uninfected patients [11,12. However, it is unclear whether the increase in HIV-associated immune suppression is due to the increased prevalence of the disease or to the improvement of the immune status of the population. It is also unclear whether these patients are at all immunocompromised. It is clear that the burden of HIV-related mortality is increasing because of treatment and prevention of HIV-related disease. The absence of HIV-infected patients at all stages of HIV-related disease may partly reflect the increasing numbers of individuals receiving ART who do not have the disease at all.

The HIV-associated immune suppression, or the “AIDS state,” has been defined as those times when HIV-infected patients are 2-4 times more likely to die from AIDS than uninfected patients. The disease may be defined as those times when HIV-infected patients are more likely to die from AIDS than uninfected patients.

There are different definitions of an AIDS-defining illness, as defined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (USDHS) Guidelines for Antiretroviral Therapy (Guidelines G-1 and G-2). The term “AIDS” is defined as those times when HIV-infected patients are more likely to die from AIDS than uninfected patients [3].

## Methods
The results of the initial diagnoses of cryptococcal infections of HIV infected patients and HIV infected patients were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from all HIV infected patients, all HIV infected patients with HIV infections, and the results of the second assessmen. The results of the first diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the second diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the third diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the fourth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the fifth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the sixth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the seventh diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the eighth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the ninth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the tenth diagnosis were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the eleventh and twentieth diagnoses were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the twentieth and thirteenth diagnoses were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the ninth and tenenth diagnoses were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the tenth and twentyfifth diagnoses were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections. The results of the twentyfifth and twentysixth diagnoses were presented in a table, which is a list of sera from HIV infected patients with HIV infections.

## Discussion
neoformans HIV-1a immune response and the cell wall integrity of the CD4+ T-cell population were discussed in further detail in the present stud.

The a-factor receptor CCR5, which is associated with HIV-1a and CCR5-dependent antigen presentation and antigen presentation in HIV-1a infection, is highly expressed in the plasma membrane of HIV-1a infected patients (54, 55). The CCR5-CXCR3 complex mediates HIV-1a infection in HIV-1a infected patients (56). In a previous study, it was shown that CCR5-CXCR3 complex was also present in plasma membrane of HIV-1a infected patients (57). CCR5-CXCR3 complex was found to be activated in HIV-1a infected patients by CCR5-A (58). CCR5-A is found in the plasma membrane of HIV-1a infected patients (59). The CD4+ T cells are activated by CCR5-A, and the CCR5-A is activated by CCR5-B, CCR5-CXCR3, and CCR5-A (60). The CCR5-CXCR3 complex mediates CCR5-CXCR3-dependent antigen presentation in HIV-1a infected patients (61). CCR5-CXCR3 complex mediates HIV-1a infection in HIV-1a infected patients (60).

In the present study, HIV-1a infected patients exhibited significantly increased CD4+ T cell lymphocyte counts and increased the number of CD4+ T cell subsets.

CD4+ T cells are cytotoxic and potent pro-inflammatory cells that produce cytokines (62). They are activated by anti-CD8+ and pro-CD8+ T cells and generate excessive ROS (63). CCR5-CXCR3 complex mediates CCR5-CXCR3-dependent antigen presentation in HIV-1a infected patients (61). CCR5-CXCR3 complex mediates HIV-1a infection in HIV-1a infected patients (61). The CD4+ T cell lymphocytes are activated by CCR5-CXCR3 complex and release reactive oxygen species (ROS) to generate excessive ROS to cause apoptosis of CD4+ T cells (64).
