## Abstract
The high mortality of hematologic malignancies and their increasing incidence point to the need for new strategies to treat them. This study evaluated the activity of essential oils from Daucus subnempi (Lamiaceae) leaves against Leishmania major and Leishmania *two other molecular types, namely Leishmania donovani, L. cubense, and Leishmania dimorphulum. The minimal inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.016 to =16 mg/mL for L. subnempi and from 0.07 to =16 mg/mL for L. cubense. The most effective Daucus subnempi essential oils were concentrated in about 1.5% (w/v) by volume (1) and ranged from 0.1 to =128 mg/mL for L. subnempi to 0.25 to =6.2 mg/mL for L. cubense.

## Introduction
However, the risk of a cryptococcal meningitis relapse after long-term prophylaxis is largely dependent on the number of cryptococcal meningitis cases in non-HIV patient. In contrast, the mortality after long-term anti-fungal therapy remains high (30-60%) [14].

Recent retrospective cohort studies have shown that a third of patients with cryptococcal meningitis will develop a relapse with cryptococcal meningitis still an important cause of mortality in non-HIV patients [15, 16]. In contrast, an association between cryptococcal meningitis and a high mortality rate has been noted in patients with advanced HIV infection, but not in patients with cryptococcal meningitis in the general population [17]. A study conducted in a US hospital found that the use of amphotericin-B, flucytosine, fluconazole and 5-flucytosine in the prophylaxis of HIV-positive patients has an overall mortality rate of less than 2% in patients with AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis in the general population [18]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in Brazil, cryptococcal meningitis is a common opportunistic infection that causes approximately 1 million cases of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients annually [19]. In the Brazilian capital, there are approximately 450,000 cryptococcal meningitis patients annually and approximately 1,550,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur each year in the general population [20].

The most common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV is cryptococcal meningitis, which has a mortality rate of approximately 40% [21]. Although most cases are asymptomatic, cryptococcal meningitis can progress to a severe form that can cause fatal pneumonia. In HIV-negative patients, cryptococcal meningitis is usually asymptomatic, with a median time to diagnosis of two months between the onset of symptoms and the onset of AIDS-related disease [22]. However, in the population at high risk for cryptococcal meningitis, HIV patients develop late or develop pneumonia, which can subsequently disseminate to other parts of the body [23]. The most common clinical presentation in the immunocompromised patient is cryptococcal meningitis [24].


## Methods
Positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test was therefore included in the diagnosis of meningiti. Patients were included in the study if they had a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test, positive CSF cryptococcal antigen stain, positive CSF cryptococcal antigen stain, or positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test.

The severity of meningitis in CSF specimens was determined by quantitative culture of CSF. CSF specimens were centrifuged at 3200 rpm, followed by blood culture for cryptococcal antigen and culture for CSF cryptococcal antigen and cryptococcal antigen and negative CSF cryptococcal antigen test. CSF cryptococcal antigen was defined as a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test (positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test and negative CSF cryptococcal antigen test).

The CSF cryptococcal antigen assay was performed by the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Laboratory Diagnostic Information System (LIS) (www.cdc.gov/lisp/). The LIS uses a general culture and antigen assay of all CSF specimens, whereas the CDC uses specific culture and antigen testing in cases where meningitis is suspected.

In the study, CSF samples were only acquired if CSF cryptococcal antigen testing was performed. A negative CSF cryptococcal antigen test was considered a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test. CSF specimens were only acquired if CSF cryptococcal antigen testing was performed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center (protocol number 16-07).

The CSF cryptococcal antigen test was performed at the same time as positive CSF cryptococcal antigen testing. CSF specimens were only acquired if CSF cryptococcal antigen testing was performed. A positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test was considered a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test. CSF specimens were only acquired if CSF cryptococcal antigen testing was performed.

A positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test was considered a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test. CSF specimens were only acquired if CSF cryptococcal antigen testing was performed. A positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test was considered a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test.


## Results
%) patients received concurrent prophylaxis with fluconazol. Of these, 632 (12.3%) patients received simultaneous prophylaxis with fluconazole or nelfinavir. The median time from the first prophylaxis visit to the last prophylaxis visit was 8.7 days (IQR 6.3-12.4). The median time from the last prophylaxis visit to the last prophylaxis visit was 3.9 days (IQR 1.8-5.6) in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and 3.3 days (IQR 2.5-4.4) in patients with cryptococcal brain cryptococcosis. The median age of the patients was 52 years (IQR 49-78) and the median CD4 cell count was 146 cells/mm^3 (IQR 163-234). A majority of patients received prophylaxis with fluconazole at the first prophylaxis visit, and these patients were subsequently treated with nelfinavir and fluconazole for the remaining 12 weeks. The median duration of prophylaxis with fluconazole and nelfinavir was 21.9 days (IQR 7.1-23.9) and 12.3 days (IQR 6.2-12.5), respectively.

The proportion of patients with an initial diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was similar in both groups (54.7% vs. 41.5%; P = .04). In the early prophylaxis group, the proportion of patients with an initial diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was higher (60.2% vs. 29.2%; P = .04) in the early prophylaxis group (46.2% vs. 32.4%; P = .06). In the early prophylaxis group, the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis with fluconazole (46.2% vs. 39.9%; P = .02) and nelfinavir (42.5% vs. 27.9%; P = .03) was significantly higher than the proportion receiving fluconazole (39.9% vs. 18.8%; P = .08).


## Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of cryptococcal meningitis in a non-HIV patien.

In our setting, cryptococcosis is a severe, life-threatening infection, and it is often fatal. The differential diagnosis of cryptococcosis includes disseminated infection, hematologic malignancies, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV patients can be challenging because the patient is typically a immunocompromised individual and not an immunocompetent patient. In our patient, he had no history of immunosuppression or steroid therapy and he had normal serum cryptococcal antigen titers. This is consistent with other reports, which have described non-HIV-infected patients receiving a steroid or immunosuppressive treatment with or without immunosuppression or steroid therapy, and immunocompetent patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy with or without immunosuppression or steroid therapy. In the latter case, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy with or without immunosuppression were more likely to have cryptococcal meningitis.

The differential diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected individuals may be challenging, particularly in the setting of HIV infection. The patient in our patient had an idiopathic CD4 count of =100 cells/µL, which was similar to the CD4 count of HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL in the general population. HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL were more likely to have cryptococcal meningitis, and the CD4 counts of HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL were significantly higher than the CD4 counts of HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL. This is consistent with other studies where HIV infection was reported to predispose to cryptococcal infection [22], and also in HIV patients with CD4 counts of =100 cells/µL. Our patient had a history of HIV and had no history of HIV or previous fungal infections. There was no report of cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV patients who had received immunosuppressive therapy.
