## Abstract
The fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is a virulent agent that causes histoplasmosis, a life-threatening disease. Recently, we discovered that the cell wall is a target for a protein-degrading immune response called cytokine CD8+ T cell expansion, which is a critical step in the development of autoimmune diseases. Our previous work has shown that the cell wall of macrophages and dendritic cells express the Rim101 transcriptional repressor, which is important for the response to several immune factors, including cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) in the lung. We therefore hypothesized that Rim101 plays an important role in controlling the immune response to Histoplasma.

We found that the expression of Rim101 was upregulated in the lungs of infected mice. This was associated with the expansion of the cytotoxic T cell memory T-cell subsets.


## Introduction
Iron is an abundant nutrient and also a vital cofactor in the synthesis of numerous enzymes, including glycosaminoglycans (GlcNAc) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are formed in fungi by a variety of fungi and are involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall iron. In the presence of iron, the formation of GAGs is blocked and the enzyme active is then blocked, leading to the formation of iron-containing vesicles (Fe-Cs). These Fe-Cs are formed by the reduction of the active iron by specific cysteine proteases and the reduction of the free iron by enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (El-Din et al., 2007; El-Din et al., 2007). GAGs are considered to be the major players in iron uptake and are responsible for the biological functions of the ferroxidase and glutathione peroxidase (Gsp) in the Fe-Cs, respectively. Thus, GAGs are major players in iron uptake, facilitating iron uptake and facilitating iron storage in the cell.

The ability of ferroxidases to function as ferroxidases has been studied in several organisms (Kneale et al., 1997; El-Din et al., 2007). In fungi, the formation of GAGs is dependent on the ferroxidase (Fdr) enzyme. The role of Fdr is to catalyze the reduction of iron in the presence of ferroxidase to Fe-Cs, which are then transported to the cell surface, where they are degraded. In Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus nidulans strain, the role of ferroxidases is to degrade iron sources and hence uptake of iron has been shown (El-Din et al., 2007).


## Methods

The complete examination of the vessels was performed by a team of two of the paediatricians who have performed the evaluation and some of the clinical feature. The phagocytosis rate of the corneal epithelial layer and the phagocytosis rate of the epithelial layer were recorded. The phagocytosis rate of the corneal epithelial layer was calculated according to the following formula: phagocytosis rate (%) = 100 × (number of phagocytides per epithelial layer) / (number of phagocytides per epithelial layer) × (number of phagocytides per epithelial layer) × 100. The negative-control group consisted of the patients with complete serum and CSF; the positive-control group consisted of patients with complete serum and CSF.

Statistical analysis
All the statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 20.0.

Data were analysed by using SPSS version 20.0.

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of São Paulo (Permit number: A14-11-844-3-6-9). The study was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Patients were enrolled at the University Hospital, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of São Paulo, after informed consent of the patients. A patient was regarded as a suspected paracoccidioidomycosis if he or she had complete and stable positive CSF culture for paracoccidioides antigen (PNA) (Molecular Proteomics Laboratory, Difco, São Paulo, Brazil).

Determination of paracoccidioides antigen-specific IgE
The specificity of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antigens and paracoccidioides antigen-specific IgE was assessed using a previously described method [19]. Briefly, the concentration of the antigens was determined by using standard methods.


## Results
At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 67 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 18% (28/30) (Table 1. The mean CD4 cell count in patients with tubercular mycoses was 67 cells/µL. At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 62 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 18% (28/29) (Table 1). At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 48 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 21% (30/32) (Table 1). The mean CD4 cell count in patients with tubercular mycoses was 47 cells/µL. The median CD4 cell count in patients with tubercular mycoses was 62 cells/µL.

In the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 92 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 19% (38/40) (Table 1). At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 71 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 18% (22/24) (Table 1). At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 73 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 15% (23/24) (Table 1). The median CD4 cell count in patients with tubercular mycoses was 49 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 16% (23/24) (Table 1). At the end of the first 10 months after diagnosis of tubercular mycoses, the median CD4 cell count was 49 cells/µL and the proportion of neutrophils was 14% (23/24) (Table 1).


## Discussion
In this study, we have shown that patients with CD4^+ T cell lymphoma have lower CD4^+ T cell counts than those with CD4^+ T cell suppressio. The results of our study indicate that patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression have a higher probability of disseminated Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection than those with CD4^+ T cell suppression. These results indicate that patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression have a higher probability of disseminated Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection.

In the study of Eng et al. [15], the CD4^+ T cell counts in the presence of CD4^+ T cell suppression were higher than those in the absence of CD4^+ T cell suppression. In contrast, in our study, CD4^+ T cell counts in the presence of CD4^+ T cell suppression were lower than those in the absence of CD4^+ T cell suppression. Our results indicate that patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression have a higher probability of disseminated Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection than those with CD4^+ T cell suppression.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a CD4^+ T cell lymphoma in patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression. This is a rare finding and needs to be further investigated in a larger number of cases. We have found that CD4^+ T cell lymphoma is more common than CD4^+ T cell lymphoma in patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression. In addition, CD4^+ T cell lymphoma is also more common in patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression. We speculate that CD4^+ T cell lymphoma might be a result of CD4^+ T cell suppression.

In our study, we identified CD4^+ T cell lymphomas as the most common CD4^+ T cell lymphomas in patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression. However, we found that the CD4^+ T cell lymphomas in patients with CD4^+ T cell suppression were also more common than those in patients without CD4^+ T cell suppression. Our results suggest that CD4^+ T cell lymphomas are a result of CD4^+ T cell suppression.
