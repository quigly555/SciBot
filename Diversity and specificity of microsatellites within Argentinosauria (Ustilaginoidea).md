## Abstract
Fungal infections are the most common cause of human colonization. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent agent of invasive aspergillosis in humans, affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Despite the global burden of this infection, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We used comparative genomics to explore the role of RNAi during fungal infection. We identified over 9000 novel genes during the initial phase of RNAi research, including 1st- and 2nd-line cytokine-activated cell-mediated endocytosis genes (nAChG, nAChR, nAChRII, and nAChE), chemokines, and peptidases. Novel targets of RNAi include critical components of the immune response (e.g., cytokines, and chemokines), inflammatory molecules, and asexual morphs. The regulation of eosinophilia is shown to be regulated by multiple target genes and pathways, including the endocytosis system and Hog1. AY1, which is conserved from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the major target of RNAi. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the complex regulation of the immune response by the RNAi pathway. We suggest that the regulation of eosinophilia is controlled by multiple targets, including key immune cell regulators and proteins involved in signal transduction and cell signaling.

Fungi cause diseases that are difficult to diagnose and manage.


## Introduction
During the past two decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made significant progress in identifying major risk factors for the development of chronic fungal diseases (CFS) in the patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These include the use of antifungal agents, the use of laboratory or in vitro susceptibility tests, and the use of traditional clinical laboratory diagnostic and therapeutic techniques [1,2]. Although the number of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased, the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains at a comparable level in developed countries and low in developing countries [3,4].

For many patients with HIV-associated CM, there is currently no easy method to prevent and/or treat the development of CM. Conventional antifungals including amphotericin B (AmB) and flucytosine (5FC) are the most commonly used antifungals. However, additional antifungals are available, which are less expensive and can be more efficacious. In the past two decades, several new antifungal agents have been introduced in the clinic, mainly in combination with flucytosine [5].


## Methods
Strains and culture conditions
A. fumigatus strain R265, which carries the AfpCpGFP gene, was used in all of the experiments. The fungal strains used in this study were grown in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 25°C. All strains used in this study were obtained from the collection of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Maringândia, Paraná, Brazil.

Morphological characterization
Morphological descriptions of each of the fungal strains were based on their morphological characteristics [23,23,24]. The specimens were stored in the dark at room temperature. To observe the growth of the fungi in the natural environment, mycelia were harvested and cut into small pieces of about 5 mm in diameter. For visualization, the sections were stained with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and photographed with a CoolSNAP HQ2 digital camera.

Virulence assays
The virulence of the fungal strains was determined using the protocol previously described for the virulence of A. fumigatus [25] with minor modifications. Fungal strains were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates at 25°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was collected and discarded. The cells were then diluted to the same density and spread on SDA plates. The plates were incubated at 25°C. The colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted after incubation for 48 h. To analyze the influence of the strains on the virulence of A. fumigatus, the number of CFU/g of total fungal cell mass was determined after incubation for 24 h at 25°C.

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the fungal mycelium using the RNAiso Plus Plus Kit (Tiangen Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.


## Results
 M) and Calcofluor White (CFW.

A total of 323 microsatellites were analyzed using the diploid microsatellite selection in this study, and the concentration of UV was determined to be 0.4 M. These results are consistent with previous studies that have shown that the concentration of UV is highly sensitive to the concentration of UV-generating agents (Sakurai and Rink 2014).

For the comparison of the diversity in the isolates from the two species, we used the DGE method (Subramanian and Soares 1996). The maximum number of polymorphic sites (MVs) was calculated for 47 isolates. The average number of MVs was 4.6, compared to 5.2 in the cases of the cases of the isolates of the two species, while the average number of MVs was 2.9. The average number of polymorphic sites was 1.7 in the isolates of the two species, while the average number of MVs was 1.4 in the isolates of the two species. The percentage of the total number of polymorphic sites (PVs) in the isolates of the two species was very similar (Figure 1). The results are in good agreement with the results of the DGE method. The percentage of the total number of PVs was highest in the isolates of the two species. The percentage of the total number of PVs was highest in the isolates of the two species. The percentage of the total number of MVs was lowest in the isolates of the two species.

## Discussion
[6] for the genomes of other species of Argentinosauria [1], [2], [7], [8] and their comparison with the marine assemblage of the same group of species [1. In the present study, we have compared the phylogram of the genomes of seven Argentinosauria species with the assemblage of the same group of species reported by Vidal et al. [6], and we found that, of the four Argentinosauria species, the phylogram of the genomes from each species grouped together in a strongly supported clade (Figure 3). It has been shown that, although the assemblage of the same group of Argentinosauria species are different, there is a general consensus that the assemblage of the same group of species is phylogenetically well-supported [3], [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The assemblage of the same group of Argentinosauria species includes members of the same species found in the marine assemblage of the same group of species. Moreover, the phylogram of the genomes of the Argentinosauria species clusters together in a strongly supported clade (Figure 3). This may suggest that, when considering the same assemblage of the same group of Argentinosauria species, a certain variation in the taxonomic rank of Argentinosauria could be observed. In contrast to the Argentinosauria species, the phylogram of the genomes of the other species of the same assemblage clusters with the two other species of the same assemblage. The phylogram of the genomes of the other Argentinosauria species clusters with the other species of the same assemblage. This suggests that the assemblage of the same group of Argentinosauria species has a different taxonomic rank and that the two Argentinosauria species are phylogenetically different. However, as the phylogram of the genomes of the other Argentinosauria species is similar to that of the Argentinosauria species, the phylogram of the genomes of the other Argentinosauria species may indicate that the phylogram of the genomes of the Argentinosauria species has some genetic differences.

Prediction of the taxonomic rank of Argentinosauria species
A number of cryptic species in the group of Argentinosauria have been found, and the distribution of these species is mainly based on their position within the group.
