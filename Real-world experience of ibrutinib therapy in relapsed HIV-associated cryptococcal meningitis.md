## Abstract
Anti-GAD-related cerebellar ataxia has rarely been reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, despite its common occurrence in diabetes. Here, we report the first case of anti-GAD-associated cerebellar ataxia with underlying hypercalcemia caused by mutations in the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme calprotectin, which might explain the recurrent rash in patients with HIV/AIDS and autoimmunoglobulin (Ig)G. Similar to many other cases reported in the literature, the case report emphasizes the rarity of anti-GAD-associated cerebellar ataxia and highlights the difficulties in diagnosing it.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are both opportunistic human fungal pathogens that cause life-threatening cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common pathogen in AIDS patients, and C. gattii is responsible for nearly a third of all AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa [1-3]. Infection with C. gattii is acquired from the environment and causes disease when environmental spores are inhaled. Once in the lungs, these inhaled fungal spores settle into the alveoli, where they transform into yeast cells that invade the alveolar macrophages. Cryptococcal cells then disseminate from the lung to other organs, where they cause disease.

The nature of the immune response to C. neoformans and C. gattii is highly plastic. It is primarily composed of natural IgG, T and B cells. These B cells mediate the Th1 response and initiate the production of T lymphocytes, which then act as effector cells in the defense against intruders. On the other hand, Th2 responses favor resistance to infection and inhibit the proliferation of neutrophils [4]. Th17 cells are identified in the bone marrow and are the key cells initiating the immune response [5-7]. Th1 and Th17 cells induce IL-2 production and are important in the induction of the adaptive immune response [8-12]. Th2 cytokines are produced and activated by B cells, whereas Th1 and Th17 cells are produced and activated by Th2 macrophages [13].

The risk of acquiring cryptococcal disease increases in patients with compromised cell-mediated immunity, including AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis.


## Methods
The studies were conducted with patients admitted to the American College of Rheumatology Clinical Trial Registry (CLTRR) Clinical Trial Registry and the Clinical Trials Registry of Taiwa. The trials were registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and all participants gave informed consent. The ‘No action required' (No action required) strategy was adopted in this review, which included (1) direct participation in the study; (2) direct participation in the study with no laboratory intervention; and (3) direct participation in the study with no laboratory intervention. The studies included the following variables: age at admission; gender at admission; ART use; previous cryptococcal meningitis; and ART use at the time of admission.

The ART trial protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), University Hospital of New York, and University of New Mexico (UH-NM). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the National Taiwan University Hospital (TUNM). The data management and quality assurance measures were followed up, as per the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Data Collection
All patients in the study were enrolled from January 2000 through May 2010 at the National Taiwan University Hospital, and the data were collected on a standardized questionnaire. We reviewed the demographics of the study population, the clinical features, laboratory results, and the laboratory results. We categorized patients into four groups based on HIV disease stage (HDR, CD4+ and CD4+ = 100 cells/mm^3) and CD4+ and CD4+ group (or CD4+ = 200 cells/mm^3).

Patients who had received ART at the time of admission were enrolled into a subgroup for statistical analysis. These patients were enrolled into the study at the time of admission, and their demographic characteristics, HIV status, and laboratory results were recorded.


## Results
 2003; Bopadil et a., 2008; Al-Maghmedi et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2009; Gan et al., 2014). Thus, based on the definition of the term “ritual”, we define this definition as follows: “ritual” means a daily regimen of seven or more days of oral therapy prior to induction of a prophylactic proinflammatory cytokine, proinflammatory cytokine, or proinflammatory cytokine. The duration of these prophylactic proinflammatory prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis prophylaxis is 3-6 days.

For the purpose of this study, the three most commonly used drugs to treat meningitis, nelfinavir, itraconazole, and efavirenz, were determined for patients with a therapeutic relapse, and were summarized in Table 2. All drugs are classified as “other” drugs under the FLC-FAMRE (MORUM) guidelines and are available in a variety of drugs, including carbapenems, oral prednisolone, and amphotericin-based adjunctive therapy. Patients with relapse or who had been on antiretroviral therapy for a long time were included in the initial analysis (Table 2).

Clinical outcomes for the three most commonly used drugs to treat meningitis were compared between relapse- and treatment-resistant patients with or without HIV infection (Table 2). When the clinical outcomes of relapse and treatment-resistant patients with or without HIV infection were compared, we found that relapse-resistant patients with HIV infection had significantly higher mortality rates than the untreated controls (P = 0.046) (Table 2). We also found that treatment-resistant patients with HIV infection had significantly higher mortality rates than the untreated controls (P < 0.001). In addition, treatment-resistant patients with HIV infection had significantly higher mortality rates than the untreated controls (P < 0.001) (Table 2).

A striking difference in the mortality rates of relapse- and treatment-resistant patients with or without HIV infection was found (P < 0.001) (Table 2). HIV infection-associated mortality rates were higher than those of treatment-resistant patients with HIV infection.


## Discussion
, 12, 13, 14, 22, 23-26, 29, 30, 31 The remaining patients have been confirmed to be Cryptococcus neoformans serotype 3, and the disease has been reported to be much more common than previously recognize.1, 7, 28, 30, 31 In our patient, it is possible that she had a subclinical cryptococcal infection, as we were unable to confirm the diagnosis. However, given the recent increase in the number of patients with HIV and the use of antimicrobials, this is likely to be a future treatment protocol.

CNS Cryptococcus is a rare disease in which an immune response to Cryptococcus antigens is involved.5, 12 Cryptococcus neoformans typically infects the CNS with an immune response to Cryptococcus. In the case described here, Cryptococcus was initially identified as Cryptococcus neoformans by a serological test performed in a patient with a low CD4+ T cell count (n = 8), and then Cryptococcus was identified by CSF analysis of CSF for Cryptococcus neoformans antigen and by immunohistochemistry testing in the patient with high CD4+ cell counts (n = 6). Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of cryptococcal meningitis, and CNS involvement is a common feature in this infection.8, 13, 30

In a patient with HIV and a recent episode of cryptococcal meningitis, the patient had a history of travel to a clinic in Brazil, the location of which is a private clinic in Rio de Janeiro. She was diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans cryptococcal infection after a CD4+ T cell count of approximately 200 cells was increased to 350 cells. In the patient's serological laboratory, her serum cryptococcal antigen was positive, and the patient was successfully treated. She is known to have a low CD4+ cell count, and the patient was not treated with amphotericin B, which is the first-line therapy for invasive cryptococcal disease.

In the case described here, we observed a positive serum cryptococcal antigen in the patient's serological laboratory, and the patient was started on amphotericin B. The patient was treated with fluconazole, and the patient was cured with fluconazole.
