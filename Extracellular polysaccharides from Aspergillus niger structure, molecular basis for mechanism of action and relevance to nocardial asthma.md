## Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes is a zoonotic zoonotic disease caused by L. lactis strain LF580, which was acquired from a discarded excipitation vector in Brazil. The interaction between L. monocytogenes and an endogenous fungal host can profoundly affect the outcome of the infection. Here, we report the effects of acute and chronic L. monocytogenes exposure on the transcriptome of a wild type strain isolated from a rabbit gut. Exposure to L. monocytogenes had a significant up-regulation of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAs), secreted proteins, and small secreted endoproteases. Moreover, we observed that exposure to L. monocytogenes caused a significant reduction in genes encoding pathogenic enzymes and secreted immune effectors. Although we did not observe a significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in the host response to L. monocytogenes, we did observe a decrease in several genes. These results suggest that L. monocytogenes is an effective fungal pathogen that has evolved the ability to modulate the host response to the infectious agent. Our data suggest that L. lactis can modulate the transcriptome of infected arthropods, which could have a significant impact on the outcome of the infection.


## Introduction
The genus Conchaea, first proposed by Chauvet et al. (2014), is characterized by a broad host range, including more than 200 accepted species, and is characterized by a coniferous, wood-boring, brown, smooth-walled, hyaline, tubular, and 3-4-septate hyphae (Yamamoto et al. 2016). Conchaea can be found in a variety of substrates, including soil, water, plants, animals, and human skin (Cumay et al. 2012). Many species of Conchaea are pathogenic to humans and animals, causing diseases that are difficult to eradicate. For example, the first reported case of infection by C. neoformans was reported in a Japanese patient (C. neoformans var. grubii) in 1955 (Jokulski et al. 1954). Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is common in the majority of patients with cryptococcosis. Approximately 15-20% of cryptococcosis cases are associated with the CNS, and the incidence is highest in patients with impaired immunity (Hodges et al. 2002).


## Methods
niger (. niger CC 3g) is a pathogenic fungus isolated from a patient with clinical asthma in whom a lung infection was suspected. The pathogen was isolated from a patient with bronchiectasis, who was treated with the topical antifungal agents bortezomib and difasib. The disease was diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after treatment with the topical antifungal agents. The patient was treated with emulsified surfactant (100 mg/kg) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the same time. A. niger was isolated from the lung tissue and clinical features. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg) at the same time. A. niger was isolated from the lung tissue and clinical features. The patient was treated with emulsified surfactant (100 mg/kg) at the same time. All these steps were performed in accordance with the study protocol.

2.2. Preparation of Anti-Atrazine Propranolol (Atrazine-Propranolol)
Atrazine-propranolol (Atrazine-Propranolol) was obtained from Merck (Germany). It is an effective propranolol of Atrazine-Propranolol. It is used for antifungal screening in evaluating the antifungal effect. It was dissolved in a drop of 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the stock solution was stored at -20°C. The stock solution was prepared and diluted with 0.1% DMSO to give final stock solutions of 2.5 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml, respectively. The stock solutions were stored at -20°C. The stock solution was prepared with 50% (v/v) DMSO to give final stock solutions of 2.5 mg/ml and 0.1% DMSO to give final stock solutions of 5 mg/ml, respectively. The stock solutions were prepared with 50% (v/v) DMSO to give final stock solutions of 2.5 mg/ml and 0.1% DMSO to give final stock solutions of 5 mg/ml, respectively. The stock solutions were dissolved in 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with 0.


## Results
However, as shown in Table 3, this non-specific cationic conformation was similar to the . albicans cationic conformation and was conserved in all Aspergillus niger strains tested. We therefore next investigated whether Aspergillus niger was capable of non-cationic conformation, a function of the C. albicans gene. In addition to the cationic conformation, Aspergillus niger also showed a non-specific cationic conformation. We thus quantified the cationic conformation of Aspergillus niger in the presence of different concentrations of fumonisin, FUMO, and the cycloheximide. The values were similar to those reported previously for Aspergillus niger [8].

In order to determine if the non-cationic conformation was specific to the Aspergillus niger strain, we analyzed the same Aspergillus niger strains in the presence of different concentrations of FUMO, FUMO, and the cycloheximide, and found that the non-cationic conformation was not different between the Aspergillus niger strains in the presence of FUMO and the cycloheximide. This was also observed in our previous study where the non-cationic conformation was found to be conserved in all Aspergillus niger strains.

In addition to the non-cationic conformation of Aspergillus niger, the cycloheximide also exhibits a non-specific cationic conformation. The cycloheximide was found to be more potent than FUMO in reducing the nocardial asthma frequency in the lungs of BALB/c mice. FUMO and cycloheximide were found to be more effective than FUMO in the reduction of the asthma frequency of BALB/c mice in a dose-dependent manner, with FUMO causing an almost 50% reduction of the asthma frequency and FUMO causing a small reduction of the asthma frequency. The cycloheximide also exhibits a non-specific cationic conformation, as observed in the non-specific cationic conformation of Aspergillus niger in the presence of FUMO.
