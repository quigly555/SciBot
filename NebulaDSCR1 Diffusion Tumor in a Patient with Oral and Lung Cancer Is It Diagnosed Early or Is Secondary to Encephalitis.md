## Introduction
In healthy individuals, fungi are normally colonized mainly by filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus sp., Fusarium spp., and Penicillium spp. However, a small number of fungal species are able to cause invasive infections, such as Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. [1]. In immunocompromised patients, invasive fungal infections can develop due to exposure to contaminated soil, water, food, or contaminated surfaces [2].

Fungal pathogens cause a wide range of diseases in humans, ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive diseases in immunocompromised patients. The major pathogens that cause infections in humans include Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Aspergillus spp. [3]. The most common opportunistic fungal infection, invasive candidiasis, is caused by the ubiquitous Candida spp. The current available antifungal agents are limited to azoles and polyenes. The azoles inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis, which is an essential component of fungal cell membrane. Azoles are toxic to the host and cause a block in the synthesis of the ergosterol that may cause fungal cells to produce toxic sterols [4]. Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of the chitin deacetylase, which is also essential for fungal cell viability [5]. In addition, the antifungal caspofungin also acts as an antibacterial. Echinocandins are also fungicidal in the presence of fungi, and thus, their clinical use has been restricted [6].

Fungal infections are caused by different species of the genus Candida, and several species of the genus Pneumocystis are known to cause infections in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii, a gram-negative, encapsulated yeast, is the most prevalent species in the United States of America. It causes pneumonia, skin lesions, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, otitis media, and invasive infections. Pneumocystis pneumonia, also known as deep-seated infection (DSE), is a common and severe infection that may progress from the respiratory tract to the skin and other tissues, especially in immunocompromised patients [7].


## Methods
All patients were informed about the study and they were allowed to access medical record.

Data were extracted from medical records by medical records investigator from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Hospitalization data were extracted from the medical records of all patients who had a positive blood culture and the laboratory results of blood culture.

After the exclusion of all data generated from patients with non-surgical reasons, we generated a dataset that included 11,864 patients from the UHS. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database. We also included 1,586 patients with an underlying disease who did not meet the inclusion criteria. We searched the PubMed database of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus and entered the patient's name, date of birth, and date of diagnosis. We excluded patients who did not have a definitive diagnosis of the underlying disease. We excluded patients with a history of kidney, liver, or spleen transplantation, or patients who were without treatment for any of the diseases mentioned above. The data were analyzed using STATA (version 12.1; STataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We excluded patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or pulmonary and were unable to identify a definitive diagnosis of lung, liver, or spleen disease or pulmonary or inflammatory bowel disease, which could not be excluded from the data.

We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify factors associated with the outcomes of interest. We identified risk factors associated with outcomes of interest in a multivariable model using Cox proportional hazards regression. We estimated the risk of mortality by estimating the number of patients with a specific outcome of interest and the time to death. We calculated the risk of death by estimating the mortality rate per 100,000 persons per year. We determined the risk of death for all-cause mortality in the cohort with the following four categories: non-euthanized, died at known time of death, or were under the age of 18 years. We used the life expectancy of the cohort for the purposes of the analysis.

In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify factors associated with death by identifying the risk of death by calculating the hazard ratios. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and a Log-Rank test to identify the risk of death among patients with a specific outcome of interest and the time to death.


## Results
nidulans pathogenesis, the pathogenic growth of . niger was verified using a single mutant strain, T2399^T. Although the wild-type strain was unable to colonize the brain, a few other fungal species could be detected by a single single dilution of the A. niger strain (Fig 1A). In addition, a single mycelial suspension was generated in the absence of the A. niger a1 strain (Fig 1B).

A. niger is genetically susceptible to oxidative stress [30]. To assess the possibility that the sensitivity of A. niger to the oxidative stress could be due to the formation of superoxide radicals, the growth of the A. niger a1 and the T2399^T strain was tested for their ability to grow in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2. The growth of A. niger A1 was inhibited by 1 mM H_2O_2 (Fig 1C). The growth of the T2399^T strain was also inhibited by 1 mM H_2O_2, as indicated by the lower growth rate of the A. niger a1 strain in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2 (Fig 1C). The growth of the A. niger a1 strain was also inhibited by 1 mM H_2O_2, as indicated by the lower growth rate of the A. niger a1 strain in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2 (Fig 1C). The growth of the T2399^T strain was also inhibited by 1 mM H_2O_2, as indicated by the lower growth rate of the A. niger a1 strain in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2 (Fig 1C).

In a previous study, a strain of A. niger, designated as the A. niger a1 strain, was sensitive to the oxidative stress agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), acetonitrile, and propionic acid [31]. We tested the sensitivity of the A. niger a1 strain to these agents in a high-throughput assay. The sensitivity of the A.


## Discussion
 had significant and clinically relevant effects on the development of infection in mic. The combination of melanin and L-arginine, and the use of antibacterial agents, such as cycloserine, polyenes and methotrexate, to treat Candida infection in mice resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial load in the lungs of mice. It is likely that these results were attributable to the use of antibacterials against Candida spp., although this was not the case for melanin. Thus, although the combination of melanin and L-arginine was an effective chemokine, the combined chemokine (l-arginine) had significant and clinically relevant effects on the development of infection in mice.

The combination of L-arginine and L-meningosine, and the use of antibacterial agents, such as cycloserine, methotrexate, and chloramphenicol, resulted in a significant reduction in the development of bacterial loads in the lungs of mice. This reduced bacterial load was accompanied by the significant reduction in fungal load in the lungs of mice. The combination of melanin and L-arginine, and the use of antibacterial agents, such as methotrexate and chloramphenicol, resulted in a significant reduction in the development of infection in mice. This reduction was not accompanied by significant reduction in fungal load in the lungs of mice.
