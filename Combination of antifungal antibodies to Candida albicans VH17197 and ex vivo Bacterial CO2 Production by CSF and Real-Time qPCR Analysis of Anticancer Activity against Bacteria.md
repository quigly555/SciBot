## Abstract
Fungal biofilms are key components of indoor ecosystems and, as a consequence, are capable of inhibiting the growth of many microorganisms. In this context, it is important to understand the structure and function of fungal biofilms because these complex structures allow the formation of complex biofilms with varied characteristics and are often more conducive to interactions with the host antifungal drug. In addition, it is possible to identify and identify extracellular groups of fungal biofilms that are specific to the host, and to focus on the extracellular groups of these biofilms, which are often homologous to antifungal drug targets. Here we review the biology, molecular structure, and biological activities of fungal biofilms, focusing on the biofilms and their role during infection, as well as their role in shaping the fungal biofilm and the host defenses. In addition, we consider the possible link between biofilm formation and fungal resistance. In conclusion, our search for a link between biofilm formation and fungal resistance can be somewhatened, because it can be resolved as two fundamentally different phenomena. First, the biofilm formation versus the host is an integrated process, which leads to a common strategy for biofilm eradication. The other development is the integration of the biofilm, which depends on the fungal cell and on the fungal host. The biofilms form together with other biofilms a cell wall that protects the fungus from the host immune system, but also allow the fungus to penetrate the host barrier. The interactions between the biofilms and the host are highly structured and multifunctional and can shape the biofilm formation and resistance of fungi to the host. In this review, we consider the biology and molecular mechanisms of fungal biofilms and their interaction with the host. In addition, we consider the relevant connections between the host and fungal biofilms and the host defenses.


## Introduction
In the last decade, the prevalence of fungal infections has increased significantly, reaching 9% of the cases in the developed world [1,2]. Despite the availability of a wide range of antifungal agents, the number of effective antifungal drugs remains limited. As such, the number of patients with a compromised immune system is at a critical stage with aggressive treatment, e.g., with corticosteroids, ischemic, and/or central nervous system (CNS) therapies, is increasing. As such, there is a continuous need for a more effective and safe antifungal agent.

The development of new antifungal drugs has been slow compared to synthetic compounds.


## Methods
albicans

. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. brasiliensis ATCC 14053, and S. schenckii ATCC 6258 were used as positive control strains and CSF was used as negative control for each assay. For the antifungal activity assay, C. albicans ATCC 10231, S. schenckii ATCC 27853, S. brasiliensis ATCC 27853, and S. schenckii ATCC 34609 were used as negative control strains.

For the concomitant cytotoxicity assay, B. subtilis ATCC 12803, B. subtilis ATCC 191235, and B. kluyveri ATCC 2001 were used as positive controls and CSF was used as negative control for each assay. For the cytotoxicity assay, C. albicans ATCC 20004, C. albicans ATCC 12803, and C. kluyveri ATCC 2001 were used as positive controls and CSF was used as negative control for each assay.

For the oxidative stress assay, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. albicans ATCC 12803, and C. kluyveri ATCC 20004 were used as positive controls and CSF was used as negative control for each assay.

Assay of human Aspergillus fumigatus in the respiratory system
The respiratory system consists of the cell wall of the human erythrocytes (BB) and the respiratory epithelial cells (RES) and is characterized by the formation of a thick layer of erythrocytes. For each sample, 5 ml of PBST was added and the erythrocytes were allowed to adhere to the filter paper for at least 4 h. The erythrocytes were then lysed in the same volume of PBST. The erythrocytes were then extracted by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min, and the erythrocytes were then recovered by filtration through a 0.22 Âµm filter, and the contents were concentrated by adding 10 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and vortexing for 5 s.


## Results
In both Candida albicans and Bacterial CO2-producing Candida albicans VH17197, antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and Ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production was found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments, whereas in the non-Candida albicans VH17197, antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and Ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production was found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments (Fig 4A. In addition, the results showed that both Bacterial CO2 production and antigen-specific antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and ex vivo Bacterial CO2 production were found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments, whereas in the non-Candida albicans VH17197, antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and Ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production were found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments.

In the present study, we also used a second specific antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production by CSF and Real-Time qPCR, which also showed that both antibodies specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and Ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production were found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments, respectively. In both studies, both antibodies specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and ex vivo Bacterial CO2 production were found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments, whereas in the non-Candida albicans VH17197, antibody specific to Candida albicans VH17197 and Ex vivo Bacterial CO2 Production were found in the CSF and real-time qPCR experiments.


## Discussion
For example, combination therapy of fluconazole with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 6 to 12 months could reduce the number of invasive Candida infections in the setting of fluconazole therapy and thus reduce the occurrence of the infectio. Conversely, combination therapy with fluconazole with fluconazole 400 mg/day for 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. Both groups of antifungal drugs (fluconazole and fluconazole 200 mg/day) have the potential to reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. Combination therapy with fluconazole (fluconazole 400 mg/day) with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 6 to 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections in the setting of fluconazole therapy and thus reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. However, the agent used in combination with antifungal drugs (fluconazole) should be evaluated in the context of candidiasis in patients with severe immunosuppression such as HIV-associated PCP. Combination therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. The combination therapy of fluconazole and fluconazole 400 mg/day for 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. The combination therapy of fluconazole 400 mg/day for 12 months with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 6 to 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections. The combination therapy of fluconazole 400 mg/day for 12 months with fluconazole 200 mg/day for 6 to 12 months could reduce the incidence of invasive Candida infections.

While the number of invasive Candida infections caused by the pathogen of interest in HIV/AIDS patients is small, the estimated incidence of invasive Candida infections in the setting of HIV infection has been reported in the literature. The number of invasive Candida infections in the setting of HIV infection is estimated to be between 200 and 400 000 annually [21].
