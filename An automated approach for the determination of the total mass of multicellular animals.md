## Abstract
We present a case of ocular syphilis peritonitis in a young immunocompetent adult patient. The patient was referred to the tertiary referral hospital in Wuhan, China for evaluation of the status of his ocular lesions, which were considered to be syphilis co-infection. The diagnosis of ocular syphilis co-infection was confirmed by the use of a Whitehead staining analysis. The patient received appropriate treatment for syphilis and was discharged after completion of his hospital stay.


## Introduction
A new type of antifungal drug, polyenes, which selectively targets fungal cells, was synthesized by the group of nanotechnologists in the mid-1980s [1]. A variety of them, such as amphotericin B and azoles, have been extensively studied, and a variety of them, such as the pentavalent antimonials, are still being used. However, these drugs have a low therapeutic index and are often refractory to the clinical use. Azoles are the most commonly used agents, and resistance to azoles has been reported in the Azole-Fungi Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (AFL-NMR) and Resistance-Vetulence Surveillance (RVVS) studies [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].

Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungal species endemic to the subtropical regions of the Western hemisphere [15,16,17]. A significant number of cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia have been reported in the Western countries, and a few cases have been reported in Brazil, France, and Germany [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Among the factors associated with resistance to azoles in P. jirovecii is the presence of penicillin, a non-canonical type of penicillin, in the environment [16,25].

The emergence of azole-resistant P. jirovecii has been a major concern and an urgent threat to the treatment of patients with this pathogen. Thus, efforts have been directed to develop new drugs to treat azole-resistant P. jirovecii infections.


## Methods
The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plan. To determine the bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant, the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant. The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant. The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant. The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant. The result was obtained by using a two-step procedure using a standard method. The standard method was used to determine the microbial mass of the plant. The test samples were prepared from an old fungus and were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The concentration of the acid hydrochloric acid (HCl) (0.2%), and the organic carbon (IC) (0.5%) were determined using a standard organic carbon method. The pH of the culture was measured by using a pH meter (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The pH of the culture was determined using a pH meter (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in a volume of 0.4 L. The mean fluorescence intensity was measured at 1 h intervals. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

To determine the microbial composition of the plant, the standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the bacteriometric method. The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the bacteriometric method. The standard bacterial/fungal mass profiles of the plant were determined by gravimetric methods using the bacteriometric method.


## Results
As shown in Fig 3, the total biomass of the same size as the reference strains was not significantly different from that of the control (Fig 3. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 mutant, <U+0394>pck2 and <U+0394>pck3 strains was only 3.6% of that of the control (Table 2). The total biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 mutant, <U+0394>pck2 and <U+0394>pck3 strains was 3.7%, 3.4% and 3.4% respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains was 1.6 and 1.4%, respectively. The <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains produced only 0.3% and 0.3% respectively of the biomass. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains were the same as the control. However, the biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains was 1.4% and 1.2% of the control, respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains was 1.3% and 1.3% of the control, respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains was 1.3% and 1.3% of the control, respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains was 2.3% and 2.8% of the control, respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains were the same as the control. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains were 2.4 and 2.2% of the control, respectively. The biomass of the <U+0394>pck1 and <U+0394>pck2 strains were 1.


## Discussion
The selected compounds were identified and characterized by the LC-MS/MS technique, which was based on the same chemical analysis protocol used for other ROS detection systems [23], [24. The detected compounds included 8-chlorophenyl-4,8-dione-4,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid and 4,8-dihydro-2,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid. The primary compounds were 4,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid (4) and 8-chlorophenyl-4,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid (8). A second compound was 4,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid (8) and 8,8-dihydro-2-decanoic acid (8). All the identified compounds were also tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans.

The lipid composition of the tested compounds is shown in Table 2. The fatty acid composition of the tested compounds was mainly composed of linoleic acid and oleic acid, which is the main fatty acid of C. neoformans. The ester-carotenoid fatty acid (EAA) is the main fatty acid of C. neoformans.

The lipid composition of the tested compounds was mainly composed of palmitic acid and oleic acid, which is the main fatty acid of C. neoformans. The total fatty acid (TFA) of the tested compounds is shown in Table 3. The total fatty acid (TFA) of the tested compounds is higher than that of fatty acids from other species such as C. albicans and C. tropicalis.

The lipid compositions of the tested compounds were mostly composed of unsaturated fatty acids (SFA), such as palmitic acid and oleic acid, which is the main saturated fatty acid in C. neoformans. The total fatty acid (TFA) of the tested compounds is higher than that of unsaturated fatty acids in C. albicans. The total fatty acid (TFA) of the tested compounds is higher than that of saturated fatty acids in C. tropicalis.
