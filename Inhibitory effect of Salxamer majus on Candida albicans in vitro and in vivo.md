## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that causes human disease. The rapid emergence of the fungus in the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States in recent years has been related to the influx of nonendemic strains from endemic areas into healthy ones, which has been referred to as ‘remediation’. This study aimed to characterise the population genetic structure of strains recovered from infected chickens by analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribotypes. The genetic structure of the C. gattii strains recovered from infected chickens using Illumina MiSeq sequencing included characteristic groups: the Ziehl-Neelsen-Schmidt and Masson-Blaugger correlations were significant, whereas the bivariate non-redundant correlations of the GenBank database were significant only for infected chickens. The Ziehl-Neelsen-Schmidt and Masson-Blaugger correlation indices for the genetically characterized strains were significantly higher than for the bivariate non-redundant correlations. The distribution of genetic variation among C. gattii strains recovered from infected chickens was similar to that among wild chickens, but the Ziehl-Neelsen-Schmidt and Masson-Blaugger correlation indices for the Ziehl-Neelsen-Schmidt and GenBank strains were significantly higher than for the bivariate non-redundant correlations. This study shows that C. gattii is a complex organism that can evolve at a rapid pace and acquire new genetic structures rapidly. To gain additional insights into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation and virulence, it is important to identify the genetic clusters that are differentially adapted between infected and healthy chickens.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom is a complex and diverse community of microorganisms that play vital roles in various ecosystems (Dawson, 2008). At present, knowledge on the diversity of eukaryotic species in the fungal kingdom is limited and it is currently difficult to describe their life style, ecology, and physiological processes. Fungi are a major component of the human microbiota, colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs, and anywhere in between. The ability to live a simple and healthy lifestyle and to tolerate the stress of nutrient deprivation has driven the exploration of new ways to harness the biodiversity in this microorganism.

Fungi are ubiquitous and are found everywhere, including on the skin, in the respiratory tract, and in the intestines of animals (Fisher et al., 2009). They are also found in the blood, wound, and lung of animals and humans, where they are very important in establishing infection (Meyer et al., 2008). Inhalation of fungal spores is also common in the gut, skin, and liver of humans (Meyer et al., 2008). Although fungal species are present in the intestines, blood, and in the lungs, they account for most of the fungal infections (Liu et al., 2012).

The human gut is highly colonized by bacteria and the ability to colonize this site is essential for the development of health (Meyer et al., 2008). The human gut is colonized by eukaryotic microorganisms that reside in different forms in the human body (diarrhea, wound, feces), with the most prevalent being Candida and Aspergillus species (Odds, 1988).

Candida and Aspergillus species are considered opportunistic pathogens that cause infections in humans, although there are a few reports of cases of pulmonary Candida infections (Bratton and Gordon, 2009).

In terms of the number of species that are species of the genus Candida, the most common are Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata. However, other Candida species are rarely encountered in the human body, such as Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei.


## Methods

Salicylic acid (SMA) treatment was performed in a 96-well plate in triplicate and the concentration of SMA in each well was varied between .01 and 100 µg/mL. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the fungus-supplemented control wells contained no drug. The assay was performed in triplicate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SMA was determined as the lowest concentration of SMA that prevented the growth of Candida from the wells in comparison to the control.

Galleria mellonella infection assay
Galleria mellonella (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were purchased from the National Laboratory of Laboratory Animal Resources (Laboratory of Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). The assay was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 protocol and the results were read after 24 h of incubation at 37°C. The assay was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.

Virulence assays
The virulence of the bacteria was assessed by the method of Kaplan-Meier method, with a minimum bactericidal concentration of 5 × 10^6 CFU/mL as the endpoint, and the mortality rate was compared between groups at the end of the assay. Briefly, groups of 5-10 larvae were infected by inoculation with 10^6 CFU of Candida albicans in 100 µL of PBS. Each test was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.

Human foreskin microvascular endothelial cell (hMCEC) assay
Human foreskin macrophages (HMW) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G and streptomycin (100 IU/mL). Cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% l-glutamine and 1% L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

A total of 2 × 10^6 HMW cells/mL were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.


## Results
To assess whether salicylase activity is synergistic, we used Salxamer majus as a selective activator in vitro (Fig 4. The Salxamer-I2B antibody, which is not specific for Salxamer, inhibits Salxamer active in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4). Although this activity is dependent on the Salxamer production enzyme, the Salxamer-I2B antibody effectively inhibited the Salxamer activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4). This suggests that Salxamer is not the only factor responsible for Salxamer-mediated antifungal activity.

A synergistic inhibition of Salxamer activity was observed for Candida albicans (Fig 5). In order to test whether Salxamer may act synergistically with the Candida albicans antifungal activity, we tested the antifungal activity of Salxamer against the Candida albicans strain NRRL Y-9003. The antifungal activity of Salxamer against this strain was determined in terms of MIC and MFC against the tested Candida strains. In this assay, the MIC and MFC values of Salxamer against the Candida strains were 25-50 and 50 µg/mL, respectively, for Salxamer, I2B, and Q50, respectively (Fig 5). These results demonstrate that Salxamer can act synergistically with the antifungal activity of Salxamer.

In vitro Salxamer activity is inhibited by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis

In order to assess whether Salxamer can inhibit Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, we tested the activity of the Salxamer-I2B antibody against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Salxamer was used as a selective inhibitor to promote Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antifungal activity. The combination of Salxamer and I2B (Fig 6A) inhibited Paracoccidioides brasiliensis growth significantly (p < 0.0001) (Fig 6B). These data indicate that Salxamer has synergistic effect with I2B against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.


## Discussion
albicans was studied in vitro and in vivo, and the results are shown in Table . Candida albicans strains treated with salxamers, although no growth was observed, were unable to produce biofilm, and produced a higher level of biofilm than the untreated control, at both the early and late stages of the experiment.

In the early stage, Candida albicans cells were exposed to both growth inhibition and growth arrest. Candida albicans cells expressing ERG11 and ERG3 had significantly higher levels of biofilm formation than those expressing ERG1, suggesting that a higher level of biofilm formation was not due to a lower concentration of salxamers. A total of 12 biofilm forming C. albicans strains were incubated with salxamers and the biofilm formed on the untreated C. albicans strain, but the biofilm formed on the untreated C. albicans strain, in contrast to the untreated control, was not significantly different from that of the two groups. The biofilm formed on the untreated C. albicans strain was also significantly higher than that on the untreated control, suggesting that a higher biofilm formation occurred in this condition. At the later stages of the experiment, Candida albicans cells that did not have an ERG11 gene were still able to form biofilm. The biofilm formed by the untreated C. albicans strains was not significantly different from that of the untreated control. However, the biofilm formed on the untreated C. albicans strain was significantly higher than that on the untreated C. albicans strain, suggesting that biofilm formation was an independent process of Salxamers.

The biofilm formation of C. albicans strains was significantly higher than that of the control, suggesting that biofilm formation is a prerequisite of C. albicans growth in the presence of salixamers. The biofilm formation of C. albicans was also significantly higher than that of the control strain, indicating that biofilm formation is a prerequisite of C. albicans growth in the presence of salixamers.

The biofilm formation of C. albicans was significantly higher than that of the control strain, suggesting that biofilm formation is a prerequisite of C. albicans growth in the presence of salixamers.
