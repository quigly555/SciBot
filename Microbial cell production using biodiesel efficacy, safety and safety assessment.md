## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus gattii is the etiological agent of world's rare and endangered fungal pathogen C. gattii. Recent molecular studies indicated the existence of a unique genetic mechanism underlying the virulence of this fungal pathogen. However, the exact mechanisms and regulatory functions remain elusive. In this study, we identified a putative transcriptome-dependent gene cluster containing transcripts of C. gattii VGII and C. gattii VGIII, with 15 and 3 genes, respectively, from clinical samples, and expressed genes in the wild. These genes encoded putative proteins involved in cellular and molecular functions, as well as genes that contribute to virulence. Genes encoding putative proteins in C. gattii were identified, and the putative virulence genes were validated by reverse transcription. The putative virulence genes were also partly validated by in silico screening. This approach allowed detection of putative proteins that may contribute to pathogenicity and virulence in C. gattii. Finally, the transcriptome-dependent gene silencing approach could be extended to C.

## Methods
Briefly, biofilms were grown on a nutrient agar (NA) slant (40 .L^-1, 5% wt/vol) and then cultured for 24 h at 37 °C, in the presence of nutrient media. Then, the biofilm was washed twice with sterile distilled water and the suspension was adjusted to an optical density of 0.5 McFarland (OD_600). The biofilm was then washed three times with distilled water and then resuspended in distilled water and further cultured at 37 °C. The biofilm was counted using a hemocytometer and the percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated by the following equation:

As a result of the effectiveness of the program on the biofilm growth and the biofilm production, biofilm was defined as the biofilm that was the diameter (D) of the biofilm (s/0.5) at the time of the experiment, and the negative control consisted of biofilm that had not been cultured for 24 h. The percentage of inhibition of biofilm formation was calculated as follows:

To determine the viability of the biofilm, we performed quantitative analysis of the biofilm viability using the method described by the CLSI (formerly the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute) [33]. Briefly, the biofilm was washed with sterile distilled water and suspended in distilled water. The suspension was adjusted to an OD_600 of 0.5 McFarland (OD_600 = 0.5). Then, the biofilm was diluted with sterile distilled water to the equivalent of 1/10^7 CFU/mL. Then, 200 µL of the diluted biofilm suspension was pipetted onto a sterile filter paper (Sarstedt, Uppsala, Sweden). The biofilm was washed three times with sterile distilled water and then resuspended in distilled water and resuspended in distilled water. The biofilm viability was determined as described above.

Statistical analysis
The data obtained in this study were analysed using the Statistica version 6.0 software (Statacorp, Oslo, Norway).


## Results
We first examined the impact of biodiesel production on the metabolic activity of microorganisms (Fig 1.

The metabolic activity of the oils isolated from the six selected oils were determined at concentrations of 5% and 15% with the same control. Our results showed that all oils produced are highly active in terms of the enzymes and purines, as well as in terms of the enzymes, purines, and enzymes of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of other functional enzymes (Table 1). The inhibitory activity of the oils isolated from the oils was demonstrated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Table 2). The oil from the oils showed a negative molecular ion peak at m/z = 795.6931, corresponding to the molecular ion ion peak at m/z = 795.6933 of acetoacetate. Therefore, it can be considered as a potential antimicrobial compound.

The antimicrobial activity of biodiesel produced from biodiesel was evaluated in terms of ergosterol biosynthesis (Table 3). The fatty acid composition of the biodiesel produced showed high variability among the oils, with the exception of the D-mannan ester isolated from the D-mannan ester and the D-xylopyranoside isolated from the D-xylopyranoside complex (Table 3). The presence of steric hindrance to the biosynthesis of the steric hindrance was found to be the most prominent in the D-mannan ester. As a result, the ergosterol content in the oil from the D-xylopyranoside complex was significantly increased (Table 3). In addition, the steric hindrance to the biosynthesis of the steric hindrance was found to be higher in the D-xylopyranoside complex.

The ergosterol content of the oil from the D-xylopyranoside complex was significantly higher (Table 3). This was in agreement with the results from the D-xylopyranoside complex and the steric hindrance observed in the D-xylopyranoside complex. The overall ergosterol content was significantly increased in the D-xylopyranoside complex and the D-xylopyranoside complex (Table 3).


## Discussion

The biodegradation of fatty acids, eicosanoids, and terpenoids was evaluated using a series of four test compounds (Table 1) in the following conditions: a) the biodegradation of fatty acids, eicosanoids, terpenoids and fatty acids with a percentage of 50% or higher, b) the biodegradation of fatty acids, eicosanoids, terpenoids and fatty acids with a percentage of 50% or higher, c) the biodegradation of fatty acids, eicosanoids, terpenoids and fatty acids with a percentage of 50% or higher and d) the biodegradation of fatty acids, eicosanoids, terpenoids and fatty acids with a percentage of 50% or highe.

As shown in Table 1, both the biodegradation of fatty acids and the biomass production exhibited a higher amount of fatty acids, i.e., a higher biomass than that of the biodegradation of fatty acids. In fact, the biomass production produced by Fusarium sp. is reported as being higher than that of the one described for Aspergillus fumigatus [28].

3.2. Biomass Production by Fusarium sp.
Fusarium sp. was used to evaluate biodegradation of biodegradable materials using the EPR. The results obtained for biodegradable materials, as well as biomass production were used as controls for the analysis. Biodegradable materials were stored in liquid medium at room temperature for at least 3 days. In this test, all the tested compounds were degradable in liquid medium at room temperature for at least 3 days. As shown in Table 2, the initial biomass was reduced by 15% in a concentration of 1.5 g/L. The biomass was then increased by 4.2% and reached a maximum of 100.0 g/L.

The Fusarium sp. biomass was determined by calculating the molecular weight of the crude enzyme from the previous experiments and the maximum value of the metabolic product, resulting in a biomass concentration of 16.7 g/L.

The results showed that the crude enzyme from the previous experiment was able to degradate the biodegradable materials.
