## Abstract
The land plants, mainly used as food and medicine, are widely known for their health benefits and long-term preventive effects. However, little attention has been paid to the secondary metabolites, and most of the knowledge is either lost or has no primary activity. The aim of this study was to classify the secondary metabolites of the East Indian traditional medicines of medicinal plants into defined active ingredients and to compare the activity of these molecules with known drugs. The chemical structure of the compounds was classified using as a proxy for active ingredient activity. Eight compounds were screened in two groups, namely, phenylalkanes (DEA) and naphthalene (NPA), and two more, indoles (INT), were also isolated and identified. In the preliminary screening, two phenylalkanes, phenyl acetate and naphthalene, and two indoles, naphthalene and naphthalene-2-ol, were selected as the active ingredients. The main effect of the active ingredients was the enhancement of oral cavity epithelial growth.


## Introduction
moniliformis) (Sodawater et a., 2005) have been reported in axenic cultures of the clover (A. fumigatus) (Kozich et al., 2007), in the silkworm (Yarrowia lipolytica) (Wang et al., 2013), in the cocklebur (C. elegans) (C. elegans and A. fumigatus) (Wang et al., 2013), and in the cottonwood (C. albofundum) (C. elegans and A. fumigatus) (Wang et al., 2014). These conditions are frequently encountered in axenic culture, as well as in plant tissues (Wang et al., 2014). The authors used the in vitro growth assay to show that the S. sclerotiorum, in particular the S. sclerotiorum, can produce the ethylene produced by driftwood decaying wood. This ethylene is potentially toxic and causes health effects (Wang et al., 2013).

The fungus is a pest of the cottonwood (C. elegans) (Wang et al., 2013). It is estimated that it can control more than 30 million acres of forest and has a population of around 10 million (Chen et al., 2013). The pests can be effectively controlled using soil amendment (Wang et al., 2013). However, the fungus can turn into a serious human pathogen (C. elegans, Dendryphion, and A. fumigatus) (Wang et al., 2013). The disease causes damage to the scalp, hair, and especially to the lower limbs, resulting in scalp ulcers, pain, and even death (Wang et al., 2013). The fungus is transmitted between individuals through contaminated plants or by soil contaminated by decaying plants (Wang et al., 2013). The fungus can cause various diseases in humans, including skin, skin ulcers, and even in animals (Wang et al., 2013). The environmental conditions that are necessary to grow and reproduce in humans and animals are different from those in fungi that are present in humans and animals (Chen et al., 2013).

The disease symptoms are mostly indolent skin and nail infections, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).


## Methods
. Hyde (FLA-A) S. 2003) were used to study the effects of surface stress on the ability of SPA, FLA, and S.A.C.P to inhibit the Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion. The optimum surface conditions for SPA and FLA were selected based on previous studies of stress resistance (Stamatakis et al. 2003, Da Silva et al. 2004). SpA, FLA, and S.A.C.P were assayed by the addition of a 10 mM PIPES solution (0.1% PIPES) (Souza et al. 2007) and anionic acid solution (1.0% PIPES) (Souza et al. 2007). To assess the effect of surface stress on the Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion, the experiment was performed in a final volume of 20 µl and was repeated twice. SpA and FLA were assayed at a final volume of 0.1% PIPES (Souza et al. 2007) and 0.5% PIPES (Souza et al. 2008). The experiment was performed in a final volume of 25 µl and was repeated twice. Fluconazole (FLC, Sigma) was used as positive control. To evaluate the effects of surface stress on Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion, the experiment was performed in a final volume of 20 µl and was repeated twice. Fluconazole was used as negative control. To evaluate the effect of surface stress on Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion, the experiment was performed in a final volume of 25 µl and was repeated twice. The experiment was performed in a final volume of 25 µl and was repeated twice. The analysis was performed in a final volume of 25 µl and was repeated twice. The temperature for the Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion was set to 0.25 (room air temperature) and 1.5 (absolute pressure). The temperature for the Th1/Th2^dTomato^(p) fusion fusion was set to 37.5 °C (absolute pressure).


## Results
These authors suggest that the importance of Sc Dip, which is involved in the cell wall remodeling during wood erosion, may be linked to the regulation of Sc Dip-dependent cell wall remodellin. The above-mentioned yeast-like fungi and saprotrophic fungi were also found to be under stress conditions.


## Discussion

The POC-N endogenously cleaved by the POC-N membrane, in contrast to the POC-A endogenously cleaved by the POC-A endogenously cleaved by the POC-A endogenously cleaved by the POC-N (Fig 3, S1B.
