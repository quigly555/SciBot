## Abstract
Although azoles are primarily produced through the inhalation of airborne metabolites, the possibility that they could be used as a source of secondary metabolites has been raised. In this study, we used an in vitro model of the mycobiota to investigate the production of melanin, a secondary metabolite from the mycobiota of Candida glabrata. We show that melanin is not produced by the C. glabrata melanin synthase (CgM) strain. Instead, the CgM strain produces melanized conidia and conidia with the inosine triphosphate (ITP) and the amino acid isomerase (It) producing strains, which also contain the second largest subunit of melanin's genome, the cysteine-rich ß-1,3-dienolyl-e3, which is responsible for the structural variation in the two largest subunits of melanin. We have determined the order of fungal source of melanin by gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR and demonstrate that the C. glabrata melanin-producing strain has a gene expression pattern that differs from the C. albicans melanin-producing strain in which the second largest subunit is located. Further analyses show that the C. glabrata melanin production depends on the presence of genes that are hyperosmotic, have a nitrogen-rich environment and are able to access nutrients that are not present in the fungal cell wall. This is the first report demonstrating the presence of two kinds of melanin in C. glabrata and it provides the first evidence that the production of melanin by two different fungi is linked to two different kinds of source materials.


## Introduction
The ubiquity of natural products as an important source of therapeutic agents in medicine is well known. In fact, natural products, such as polyenes, polyenes, rifampicin, echinocandins, and liposomal compounds, have been used as drugs in the treatment of various diseases. In fact, the pharmacological use of natural products as drugs has gained popularity in recent years.

In the last decade, more and more researches have been focused on the isolation and identification of new natural products from various plants and animals. Among them, the polyenes, rifampicin, and liposomal compounds have received attention because of their good pharmacological properties.


## Methods
The blue dye was then transferred to a gel and incubated at room temperatur. The band of the infected onion was observed by microscopy.

In the present study, the percentage of killing by Rhodotorula sp., was calculated by using the following equation:

Infection rate (%) = 100×(100-100)*(2-100)*(0.5-100)/(1-100)*(0.5) × 100

Identification of causal agent
The following CDA-type antigens were used to identify the most likely CDA-associated CDA (Table 1):

## Results

As shown in Figure 2, the onion is covered with numerous layers of plant materia. In addition, the mycelial growth is covered by the mycelial growth. The results of the cell wall proteomic analysis indicated that the tomato onion has a high proteome of 97.2% and the cell wall proteome of 45.9% (Table 2). These results demonstrated that the onion has a high proteome with a significant proteome difference compared to the onion. The onion is more resistant to ultraviolet radiation than the other species.

The onion is more susceptible to the phagocytic enzymes from the phagolysosomal proteome. The cell wall proteome of tomato onion was analyzed by the enzymatic digestion of the M. pulcherrima proteins with the endo-1,3-ß-glucanase (S. pittii) [51]. The onion had a high proteome of 98.2% (Table 2) and the proteome of the phagocytic enzymes from the phagolysosomal proteome was 66.7% (Table 3). The onion was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The proteome of the phagolysosomal proteome was 43.9% (Table 2) and the proteome of the phagolysosomal proteome was 66.7% (Table 3). The proteome of the phagolysosomal proteome was 43.9% (Table 3) and the proteome of the phagolysosomal proteome was 65.6% (Table 3).

The onion was more sensitive to the oxidative stress from heavy metals. The proteome of the onion was more sensitive to the oxidative stress from heavy metals than the proteome of the other species. The onion was more sensitive to the oxidative stress from iron and zinc than the other species. The onion was more sensitive to the oxidative stress from heavy metals than the other species. The onion was more resistant to the oxidative stress from copper, zinc, manganese, and sulfur than the other species. The onion was more resistant to the oxidative stress from copper, zinc, manganese, and sulfur than the other species.


## Discussion

The results of this study clearly indicate that the outer layers of the onion, and particularly the wall, are important for the establishment of infectio. The cell walls of onion cells were fully remodeled during the course of infection, especially the outer layers of the wall. The decreased cell wall strength was not only related to the increased phagocytic activity and the establishment of infection, but also to the increased expression of the extracellular ß-glucan and the cellular protection from bacterial attack. Furthermore, the increased expression of the <U+0394>epi5 gene in infected onion cells suggested the expansion of the outer layer of the wall. The increased expression of the <U+0394>epi5 gene also suggested that the cell wall was remodeled. The ability to repair damaged cell wall is the main target of numerous pathogens. In the host, the cell wall is composed of three major layers: the cell wall of pathogens is composed of ß-1,3-glucans, which are chitin-rich and contain high amounts of chitin [24], [25]. The cell wall of the pathogen is composed of ß-1,3-glucans, which are rich in mannoproteins and are well-known as cell wall components and play an important role in maintaining cell wall integrity and integrity of the host tissues [26]. The cell wall of the pathogens is also composed of mannoproteins, which are abundant in the cell wall of fungi, but are also present in the cell membrane of other fungi, such as bacteria and archaea [27]. The cell wall of the pathogens is also composed of mannoproteins and is well-known to be a major factor for the protection against various stresses [28]. The cell wall of the pathogen is composed of ß-1,3-glucans, which are rich in mannoproteins and are well-known for their involvement in cell wall integrity and protection against various stresses [29]. The cell wall of the pathogens is composed of mannoproteins and is well-known to be a major factor for the protection against various stresses [30].
