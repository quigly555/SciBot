## Abstract
Melanizations of two different species of fungi, Rhodotorula polymorhea and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, were investigated in order to determine the underlying mechanisms of melanization. A combination of light, medium, and high temperature and presence of melanized amastins were found to regulate melanization in R. polymorhea. In addition, we found that both melanization and light resistance were induced in R. polymorhea by the addition of supernatant melanin. A fluorescence-labeled melanin-induced melanin-induced growth curve in R. polymorhea revealed that the growth was inhibited at high temperature and medium that contained high temperature. However, we found that heat-killed phenylacetic acid (HPD) treatment of the heat-killed phenylalanine (PAL) medium increased the growth rate but did not induce melanization.


## Introduction

Recent studies have suggested that a considerable number of patients with intractable mucormycosis may develop deep-tissue-restricted candidemia (SC) (van de Veerdonk et a., 2016; Plos ONE, 2017). These patients are mostly hypertensive (Sowell et al., 2013; van de Veerdonk et al., 2016) and tend to have lymphoproliferative conditions (Gow et al., 2017). Severe SC are associated with high mortality and morbidity, with about 1.3-million cases of mortality and 1.3-million cases of mortality and approximately 1.3-million infections per year worldwide (van de Veerdonk et al., 2016). However, this is still a relatively small population (Sowell et al., 2013; van de Veerdonk et al., 2016). Hence, there is a pressing need to better understand the pathogenesis of SC and to devise strategies to combat this disease.

The Candida albicans is an opportunistic organism which has emerged as a leading cause of opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV, cancer and other chronic diseases (Siewers et al., 2012; Yegori et al., 2015). It has been reported that in the United States alone, Candida albicans accounts for over half of the cases of candidemia (Siewers et al., 2012). Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive candidiasis (Kumaran et al., 2017). However, other Candida species including Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei also constitute an emerging problem (Siewers et al., 2012). The various Candida species are capable of causing SC and are responsible for more than 40% of all candidemia (Siewers et al., 2012; Sargsyan et al., 2015).

The main route of infection is the respiratory tract and the yeast cells usually colonize the lungs. However, some Candida species can also cause SC, and in the case of candidemia, it can be fatal (Kumaran et al., 2017). Among the Candida species, the most important types include Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei.


## Methods
.0.2011) was performed using the mouse monocyte-macrophage (M1) and M1-macrophage (M2) lines of the Cell Line Collection (CPL) at the Department of Pathology, University of Kolkata, India. The procedure was performed as per the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients received a complete blood count and routine chest radiography as per the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients received standard hospital care and follow-up follow-up in the period 2004-2007, when their symptoms returned.

In this study, we selected 11 patients with lung infection, 9 with percutaneous fungal infection and 8 with non-infectious hematological diseases, and five with bacterial and fungal infections, including oncogene, paracoccidioidomycosis, abscess, abscess, gastric, oral abscess, oral candidiasis, oral infection, blood abscess, respiratory syncytial fluid, oral herpes simplex (HSV) and oral herpes simplex (HSV-2). The patients were admitted to the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Kolkata, for further study.

Patients were divided into two groups of three: (1) patients with pulmonary infection were treated with FK506 and (2) patients with non-infectious hematological diseases were treated with FK506 plus oral fluconazole. The acute respiratory symptoms were classified as pulmonary inflammation, and the acute respiratory complications were classified as acute respiratory symptoms. The procedure was performed according to the standard protocol by the Clinical Laboratory of a Hospital, University of Kolkata, India.

The patients’ were treated with antibacterial drugs according to the standard procedure of the Clinical Laboratory of a Hospital, University of Kolkata, India. The treatment was started after the diagnosis of pulmonary infection, and started from the same day. Patients who had pulmonary infection in the first 5 days were treated with antibiotics, and then, from the first day, patients were treated with FK506 plus oral fluconazole.

The treatment was divided into two groups of three: (1) treatment with FK506 plus oral fluconazole and (2) treatment with FK506 plus oral fluconazole.


## Results
5) rates of meningeal irritation (11/12) in the lower respiratory tract of patients with meningitis (P<.05) in the group with a high CSF glucose level. This observation was in contrast to the findings of meningeal irritation, where the incidence of meningeal irritation was less in the group with a high CSF glucose level (Table 2).

3.3. MRI Scanning of the Lower Respiratory Tracts of the Lung and Brain
We next performed a brain MRI to confirm the presence of meningeal irritation. To this end, we used the CSF MRI to place the brain brain in a transverse orientation. Using the CSF MRI, we did not observe significant differences in the spatial and temporal organization of the brain in the two groups with the low CSF glucose levels. We also did not observe differences in the brain volume in the two groups with the high glucose levels.

3.4. Cytotoxicity of CSF Monolayers
Our results suggest that the CSF monolayers are not as toxic as the CSF monolayers. The CSF monolayers of the lung and brain are very thin and the CSF monolayers of the lower respiratory tract are more porous than the CSF monolayers of the lung and brain (Figure 3A and B). To further validate this finding, we used a fluconazole-conjugated microdilution approach for the safety assessment of the monolayers of the lungs and brains. The fluconazole-conjugated microdilution assay was performed at concentrations from 0.5 to 1 µg/mL. We used the same concentration to evaluate the safety of the monolayers. No differences in the toxicity were observed (Figure 3C).

3.5. Meningeal Pathology in the Lung and Brain
Our results indicate that the meningeal lesions in the lungs and brain of the patients with meningitis are typical of early meningeal signs, which we believe to be the most important in terms of protection from infection. We next performed a survival analysis in the lungs and brains of the patients with meningitis. The median survival was 7.2 days (range, 2.1-17.9 days) in the lungs and 4.


## Discussion
This is the first case report of a BSI case in a patient who had recently undergone operatio.

In the course of our patient’s hospitalization, the patient developed multiple pulmonary symptoms and a severe neutropenia. The initial presentation of this patient with bronchial candidiasis and TB was initially vague and nonspecific, with miasmus, dysphagia, and an asymptomatic fever. However, the first MRI of this case showed broadening of the lungs and narrowing of the bronchi, with variable intensities of the disease. The bronchial asthma was initially benign with no signs of inhaled aerosolized AFB, chest pain, or febrile illness. As the bronchial asthma progressed, the patient began to develop other symptoms and, more importantly, a variety of symptoms including cough, chest pain, and cough-like symptoms. The patient had a history of asthma with a history of hydrocephalus, and the history was of previous bronchial asthma. The bronchial asthma was initially characterized by cough, dysphagia, and tachypnea. However, the patient had a history of other symptoms, including febrile illness, a history of H. influenzae, and a history of dyspnea and an asymptomatic fever. This led to a CT scan to the lungs, and the patient was diagnosed with BSI. After an MRI, the patient was found to have pulmonary CT abnormalities, such as consolidation, bronchial, and bronchial consolidation. The patient was also found to have a history of bronchial asthma, and the bronchial asthma was diagnosed as BSI. The diagnosis of BSI was confirmed by bronchial biopsy.

A primary differential diagnosis was identified as BSI and found that the patient had a history of BSI, and a history of H. influenzae, and the diagnosis was confirmed by bronchial biopsy.

The diagnosis of BSI was established by bronchial biopsy and found that the patient had a history of H. influenzae, H. influenzae-associated pulmonary infection, and the diagnosis was confirmed by bronchial biopsy.
