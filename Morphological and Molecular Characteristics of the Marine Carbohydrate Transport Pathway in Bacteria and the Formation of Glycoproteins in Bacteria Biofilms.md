## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is the leading cause of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised patients. In order to identify the potential pathogens causing meningitis, we developed a conditional gene deletion strain (DG-DENP-cC1) with a novel mode of expression, expressing the genes for glucosylceramide synthesis and stress response components, located in the cDNAs of the germination tubes of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii. Deletion strains were used for in vivo growth inhibition studies in vitro. To determine the infection induced resistance in infected mice, we used in vitro-cultured C. gattii cells grown in the presence of various stressors such as glucose, sucrose, and xylose. We found that the cDNAs localized to the nuclei of germlings and phialides on the germlings surface and were located adjacent to plasma membrane of infected macrophages. In infected mice, we found that expression of five genes encoding transporters, a cyclosporine kinase, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor 1 (SAKF-1) complex was induced during infection. We found that strain-specific cDNAs were predominantly located within the nuclei of germlings and phialides but that C. gattii genes were exclusively located within the nuclei of germlings and phialides. We found that the expression of the mitochondrial melanin biosynthetic gene encoding a putative glucose transporter and the transcription factor Saccharomyces boulardii was induced during infection. Taken together, our results show that the cDNAs in C. gattii cells are primarily located within the nuclei of germlings and phialides but that the fungal melanin biosynthetic gene clusters are induced in response to the stress of infection. This study demonstrates the possibility of using fungal melanin as a virulence factor, which may overcome the limitations of current phenotypic markers.


## Introduction
Lung involvement in fungal infections is not well understood, although immunological investigations have revealed a high prevalence of pulmonary involvement in fungal infections. It is commonly recognized that immunocompromised patients who are ill with cancer or who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapies may develop fungal lung involvement, and the most commonly isolated organisms are Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans.1-6 However, other fungi, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, are also frequently isolated, although their incidence is low, with few cases reported.

Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic mycosis caused by the inhalation of conidia or mycelia, is a fungal infection that is caused by members of the genus Paracoccidioides, as well as a number of other genera (Table 1). A recent review of the available literature reveals that PCM is endemic in approximately 20 countries, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries.7-9 P. brasiliensis is the most frequent species reported in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for approximately 70% of all reported cases.10 In the tropical regions, P.


## Methods
The microbial biomass was calculated as the ratio between the bacterial cell mass and the total microbial biomas. The experiments were performed in triplicate.

The biomass of Bacteria from the bacteria biofilm was determined by measuring the optical density of the biofilm at 400 nm (OD_600) using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular devices, Inc., USA) with a spectrophotometer transmittance at 450 nm (Shimadzu UV-3170, Japan).

In order to determine the metabolic activity of Bacteria in the biofilm, an anaerobic chamber (Shimadzu UV-3170, Japan) was used. A mixture of RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as an anaerobic culture medium, with the optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) of 0.05. The biofilm biomass was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD_600) of 0.05 in a centrifuge.

The total biomass of bacteria was determined by measuring the amount of protein in the biofilm by the Bradford method [30]. The biofilm was treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, USA). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, followed by incubation with the primary antibody in TBS-T (PBS-T 0.05%) for 1 h, and incubation with the secondary antibody in PBS-T (PBS-T 0.05%) for 1 h, and then incubation with the second antibody in TBS-T (PBS-T 0.05%) for 1 h, and finally incubation with the 1-min incubation step of the second antibody in PBS-T (PBS-T 0.05%) for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times with PBS-T and then incubated with an equal volume of Tris-EDTA (TE-EDTA 0.


## Results
., Han et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2013; Han et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). However, the quantity of AMPs in the marine environment may be significantly different, especially for AMPs expressed during early phases of bacterial growth. In this study, we have analyzed the production of AMPs in the marine environment, during the early phases of microbial growth. We observed that AMPs in the marine environment are not efficiently oxidized and did not show consistent chemical changes with the pH of the environment, i.e., the levels of the free radical scavenger antifungal compounds, such as PGE_3, and the amounts of free radical scavenging compounds, such as PGE_2, in the presence of the purified AMPs (Figure 7). In contrast, AMPs from the marine environment were able to be efficiently oxidized and released in the presence of the purified AMPs, with a higher level of free radical scavenging compounds (Table 1).

For the two most important AMPs, the PGE_3 and PGE_2, we observed that the percentage of free radical scavenging compounds was significantly lower in the presence of AMPs, compared with the presence of purified AMPs (Figure 7). On the other hand, the PGE_3 showed a higher production of free radical scavenging compounds, compared with the absence of purified AMPs (Figure 7).

At the end of the bacterial growth period, the algal growth phase, the hydrolysis of the polysaccharide degradation (e.g., the hydrolysis of the polysaccharide degradation by the tricarboxylic acid cycle), and the growth of the cells (e.g., the cell growth and division of the cell cycle) were all significantly different between the two groups of bacteria (Figure 7). These data indicate that the abundance of AMPs in the marine environment is higher than that observed in the terrestrial environment, and suggest that the higher concentration of AMPs in the marine environment is associated with higher oxidative stress resistance in these organisms.


## Discussion
subtilis biofilms was determined by the fractionation of the BcGA-1 and BcGA-2 after incubation with BcGA-2 for 3 . The activity was determined by GC-MS in the presence of BcGA-2. The results showed that the BcGA-2 showed an excellent activity against B. subtilis. The enzyme activity of BcGA-2 was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis using the microarray, which showed that the BcGA-2 showed a high activity against B. subtilis. The total enzyme activity of the BcGA-2 was 10.6-fold higher than that of the BcGA-1, and 16.5-fold higher than that of the BcGA-2, which exhibited a strong activity against B. subtilis. The enzyme activity of the BcGA-2 was similar to that of the BcGA-1. The results showed that the activity of the enzyme showed an increase with the addition of BcGA-2 to the enzyme in the presence of the enzyme for the first 3 h, and then the activity increased to a maximum after the addition of BcGA-2 to the enzyme. The results also showed that the enzyme activity of the enzyme showed an increase with the addition of BcGA-2 to the enzyme after the first 3 h.
