## Abstract
In this study, we analyzed the biodegradation of the cationic element from Aspergillus niger MADS-C cultured in an industrial wastewater treatment system and its possible mechanisms of biodegradation in the environment. The cell walls of A. niger MADS-C cells were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, and the cell wall of wild type A. fumigatus A7F1 were analyzed by confocal scanning microscopy. The redox-responsive element in A. niger MadS-C cells was analyzed by Western blotting and enzyme activity assay. The presence of the redox-responsive element in the cell wall of A. niger MadS-C cells was demonstrated by Western blotting. The presence of the redox-responsive element in the cell wall of A. fumigatus A7F1 was not dependent on iron availability, and the cell wall did not show a significant decrease in ß-glucan as determined by the non-reducing plates at 40 °C. Inhibition of biodegradation of the redox-responsive element in MadS-C cells was determined by various concentrations of the redox-responsive compound.

## Methods

Microorganisms
The Malassezia sp. were cultured in Sabouraud broth, Yeast Malt Extract Agar (YMA), and Malt Extract Broth (MEB). Yeast cells were maintained at 37 °C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium (Difco) on a rotator at 150 rpm.

The bacteria were cultured in 50 mL of LB broth at 37 °C. Yeast cells were inoculated by taking the culture media into sterile glass vials, and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a shaking incubator. The culture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and then the supernatant was collected. The pellet was washed with sterile distilled water and dried at 40 °C for 10 min. The dried pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (Invitrogen). The inoculum was adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10^6 CFU/mL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h, and the fungal colonies were counted.

The fungi were cultivated in 5 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 24 h in a shaking incubator. The mycelium was extracted by using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Maidstone, UK) and the filtrates were then dried and re-suspended in 1 mL of RPMI-1640. The microbial and mycobiota were then mixed and then incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 24 h. The mycelium was removed by washing twice with sterile distilled water, and then re-suspended in 1 mL of sterile distilled water. The fungal colonies were counted.

The fungal isolates were kept in the dark at 4 °C for 24 h, and the results were recorded using a Nikon A1 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at different time-points of the study.

Antifungal activity of the antibacterial agents
The MICs were defined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent that prevented visible growth of the microorganism.


## Results
These plants were developed by South African sage, but also occur on grasses, and may have the ability to inhibit the growth of several fungi and bacteria, and even cause blindness and scab infections [8,9. After harvesting the leaves, two days of treatment with a 150 mg/L of green tea in the centre was sufficient to induce some early lethality (Figure 4). After another day of treatment, the leaves were completely cleared and the leaves were no longer able to cause disease symptoms. The leaf extract was not the main reason for the early lethality of the leaves. The leaves may have a greater impact on the fitness of the host compared to that of the medicinal plants.

In vitro antifungal potency of the dried sage leaves from the Australian continent was in good agreement with previous studies. These leaves were developed by South African sage, but also occur on grasses, and may have the ability to inhibit the growth of several fungi and bacteria, and even cause blindness and scab infections [8,9].

## Discussion
fumigatu. Our results showed that the antibiotic resistance was highest in the case of E. faecium, which was isolated from PPE and VEE, which were the predominant antibiotics in combination against A. fumigatus. This antibiotic resistance is most likely due to the synergistic effect of a combination of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which also includes antimycobacterial drugs (e.g., gentamicin and isavuconazole), antimicrobial peptides and echinocandins (e.g., ciclopirox, echinocandin-4-ones and ß-lactam) in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Our results are consistent with a previous study which showed that the combination of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a broad-spectrum antibiotic can significantly increase the antibiotic resistance of A. fumigatus by 70-100%. [28]

We found that the synergy of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a broad-spectrum antibiotic was dependent on the bacterial species. This could be due to the presence of an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The main bacterial species in combination with antibiotic drugs are E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella sp. Some antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are commonly used in combination with antibiotics. Our results suggest that synergistic antibiotics could be added to the antibiotic treatment to reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistance.

The synergistic effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on a broad-spectrum antibiotic could be due to the synergistic effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a broad-spectrum antibiotic in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which also includes antimycobacterial drugs (e.g., ceftazidime and ceftazole) in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The synergistic effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on a broad-spectrum antibiotic could be due to the synergistic effect of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a broad-spectrum antibiotic in combination with antimycobacterial drugs in combination with a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
