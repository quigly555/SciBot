## Abstract
To gain a clear understanding of the current and previous controversies surrounding the use of thymol isolated from the rarest of all yeasts, we systematically examined all articles reporting rare yeasts isolated from yeasts collected from different geographical locations. Data on geographical location was extracted from all available records, for all relevant geographical regions, and also from a variety of sources that did not belong to the same species. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and Fisher's exact tests. The statistical analysis revealed that most of the reports were related to geographical location, with Chi-squared test revealing a higher number of cases than a series of other statistical parameters. Four different clusters of yeasts were reported from human clinical records. The majority of the cases were of species of Candida and Cryptococcus, with the former being the most common species and the latter being less common. The association between opportunistic infections and the presence of yeasts in the setting of yeasts and yeasts with more than 1,200 ß-acid protein in the thymol was confirmed. The number of isolated yeasts was lower than reported, perhaps owing to the fact that the yeast isolates were mostly of less virulent species.

Abstract: Lung function is often compromised by HIV infection. Infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other infectious diseases, may lead to pulmonary dysfunction that leads to opportunistic infections (e.g., pneumonia) and, especially, to pulmonary fibrosis. The presence of abnormal lung function in patients with HIV-associated lung diseases is a clinical and pathological phenomenon that can be rapidly detected.

Introduction: HIV infection can lead to an acute disease known as acute HIV-associated lung disease (AHLD). It is estimated that between 500,000 and 1.5 million people per year in the United States acquire HIV infection and about 1.5 million people die from this infection. As the number of HIV-positive patients continues to rise, the number of patients with advanced disease will continue to rise.

The major clinical manifestations of AHLD are pyelonephritis and atopic dermatitis, with chronic pulmonary inflammation, lymphadenopathy and pulmonary fibrosis. These findings can be detected by histopathology and the clinical examination.

Introduction: HIV infection is known to be an important factor in the development of HIV-associated chronic pulmonary inflammation and atopic dermatitis. The association of HIV infection with atopic dermatitis is not proven, but the results of a randomized clinical trial showed that the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis was superior to the placebo. The investigators concluded that the reduction in the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the improvement of the clinical management of the condition were independent factors of the efficacy of antifungal therapy.

Introduction: Several studies have evaluated the treatment of patients with acute pulmonary fibrosis (ABF) with oral steroids (ATS) and polyene macrolides (PAM) in the presence of high doses of steroids and AM, respectively. The authors found that the combination of AM and PAM reduced the CFU of the BAL fluid and the number of patient's lungs. The effect of the treatment was proportional to the dose. The PAM and AM combinations have been used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and ABF. The combination of these drugs is considered to be the best choice in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The effect of the treatment on CFU and number of patient's lungs is insignificant, while the effect of PAM and AM was not dose-dependent.


## Methods
In this regard, the WHO Scientific Procedures for the Care and Use of Human Subjects (PROHP) document [28] is used to determine the clinical relevance of the proposed stud.

Two primary care physicians (HCP) from the HIV-Oncological Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UNAM) (n = 76) and four outpatients (IR) from the Teaching Hospital of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UNAM) (n = 38) gave their opinions on the ethics of the study. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committees of the University of Minas Gerais (Approval Number: 14.1.07.2013) and the University of Minas Gerais (Approval Number: 12.11.2008).

The study was conducted in the Clinical Research Institute of UNAM. The research team considered the following main criteria for each study cohort: (1) the presence of pulmonary TB, (2) the presence of pulmonary TB by pulmonary biopsy, (3) the existence of pulmonary TB by direct sputum smear, (4) the presence of pulmonary TB by smear on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or in the urine or on the blood bank of the Hospital of the University of Minas Gerais (UPM) [29].

The study was also conducted in the Teaching Hospital of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UNAM) and the University of Minas Gerais (UPM).

Data Sources and Sample Collection
Two major databases were used in this study: the HIV-Oncological Database (HOB) and the HIV-Oncological Database (HOB-DB). The HOB-DB contains 1,971,866 HIV-Oncological patients with pulmonary TB and 7,843,004 patients with pulmonary TB with the WHO stage 3 criteria. The HOB-DB contains 2,009,828 HIV-Oncological patients with pulmonary TB and 3,879,879 patients with pulmonary TB with the WHO stage 3 criteria. The HOB-DB contains 9,879 patients with pulmonary TB with the WHO stage 3 criteria.


## Results
The CD4 cell count was the most common CD4 cell count detected in the lung lesion. Of the 17 HIV-Oncological patients, 14 (61%) had a CD4 cell count <50 cells/µL, and the CD4 cell count was between 100 and 200 cells/µL. However, in 6 HIV-Oncological patients, a CD4 cell count of <50 cells/µL was found.

The CD4 cell count was significantly different between the 3 HIV-Oncological patients with or without a subarachnoidal infection (P<0.001, Table 1). The median CD4 cell count was 107 cells/µL, and the median CD4 cell count was between 125 and 150 cells/µL. The median CD4 cell count of HIV-Oncological patients with a subarachnoidal infection was significantly lower than those with a bacterial infection (P<0.001, Table 1). Among HIV-Oncological patients with a subarachnoidal infection, the median CD4 cell count was 468 cells/µL, and the median CD4 cell count was between 250 and 350 cells/µL.


## Discussion
 2012. However, we observed that our study population was stratified by transplant type rather than transplant method, and patients with lung involvement were more likely to present with nonspecific systemic symptoms. In addition, we observed that patients presenting with nonspecific systemic symptoms were more likely to present with nonspecific systemic symptoms, and as a result, were more likely to be included in the analysis. However, we observed that the incidence of nonspecific systemic symptoms was lower in patients presenting with nonspecific systemic symptoms, and as a result, our study population was stratified by the transplant method. Therefore, we conclude that the finding of nonspecific systemic symptoms in these patients with HIV-Oncological patients is not applicable to allogeneic lung transplants.

In this study, we also observed that patients presenting with nonspecific systemic symptoms were more likely to present with nonspecific systemic symptoms. This observation was also observed in the studies of Deng et al., (2010) and Nguyen et al., (2011) who conducted a retrospective cohort. However, the authors hypothesized that the nonspecific systemic symptoms could be explained by the nonreputation of the lung during invasive procedures. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that nonspecific systemic symptoms were not as common as reported by Dominguez et al., (2015) and Nguyen et al., (2015).

While the disease described by Dominguez et al. (2015) is the most common disease in AIDS-related cryptococcosis in the United States, the incidence of nonspecific systemic symptoms in other studies is less clear. In the current study, we found that nonspecific systemic symptoms were more common in patients presenting with nonspecific systemic symptoms. This observation was also observed in the study of Dominguez et al., (2015), but the authors hypothesized that the nonspecific systemic symptoms could be explained by the nonreputation of the lung during invasive procedures. In addition, Nguyen et al. (2015) reported that nonspecific systemic symptoms were rare in AIDS patients, but nonspecific systemic symptoms were common in patients presenting with nonreputation of the lung during invasive procedures.
