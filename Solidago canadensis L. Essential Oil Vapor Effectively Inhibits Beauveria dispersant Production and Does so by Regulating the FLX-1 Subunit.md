## Abstract
The evolution of the triazole resistance of Streptococcus zooepidemicus against the antimalarial and antimicrobial resistance of meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA and MRSA) is still poorly understood. Two new isolates, ST313 and ST104, were isolated from community members in the state of Bologna, Italy.


## Introduction
Pseudozyma thermophila is a thermophilic yeast that causes skin infection in immunocompromised and allergic individuals [1]. In the case of P. thermophila, the predominant form of infection is caused by P. thermophila infection [2]. The clinical form of P. thermophila infection is typically characterized by progressive necrotizing skin lesions, meningeal inflammation, and constitutional symptoms [2]. Symptoms of P. thermophila infection include erythema, swelling, discharge, and loss of limbs. In the case of immunocompromised individuals, meningoencephalitis (MEG) can occur [3]. Additionally, cases of infectious disease in immunocompromised patients can develop into pyoderma infection, a biofilm-like infection that can be cleared by antimicrobials or is necrotrophic [3, 4]. In the case of MEG, the infection starts with skin lesions and is usually asymptomatic; however, MEG can develop into pyoderma infection during treatment [5, 6]. In the case of the noninfectious form of P. thermophila infection, a disseminated infection, the infection is usually asymptomatic [7]. However, in the case of P. thermophila, pyoderma infection is a rapidly progressing disease that can be fatal. In the case of infection with P. thermophila, the predominant form of infection is caused by P. thermophila infection [2]. P. thermophila infection is diagnosed by its multispecies identification, and its multispecies identification system (MIS) allows detection in a wide range of species [8]. In the case of P. thermophila, the predominant form of infection is also identified by the identification of the ISSN. The ISSN is commonly used in clinical microbiology because it is an easy to use, widely available and highly sensitive method for the identification of MEG [9]. Although the ISSN has been used successfully in clinical microbiology, the ISSN system has not been used in the detection of P.


## Methods
This test is useful to know the effects of the tested method on the production of Beauveria in the process of reducing Beauveria viscosit.

The effect of the tested method on Beauveria surface permeability was evaluated in the Vanillization-Effect of Beauveria Substrate by the Blocking-Effect of Beauveria Substrate
The Blocking-Effect of Beauveria Substrate is performed by using a sealed bottle containing a large volume of Au-bound Au, which is used to protect the surface of Beauveria from moisture. The suspension of Au in the closed bottle is filtered through a disposable filter paper and evaporates under vacuum. The filter paper is washed with concentrated H_2O and discarded. The sealed bottle is shaken for 20 minutes, with a pre-equilibrated volume of 0.05% w/v. The diluted Au is applied to the paper and the volume is then measured. The decrease in Au concentration is expressed as a percentage of the control.

The inhibition zone of Beauveria substrate was estimated using the Blocking-Effect of Beauveria Substrate by the Blocking-Effect of Au-bound Au
The Blocking-Effect of Au-bound Au is based on the extent of inhibition of Beauveria viscosity in the Au-bound Au. This is calculated by the following formula:

Where, Au-bound is the concentration of Au in the bottle, and Au-control is the concentration of Au in the bottle. The formula is as follows:

This procedure is similar to the Blocking-Effect of Au-bound in the Au-bound Au. The Blocking-Effect of Au-bound in the Au-bound Au is also a measure of the probability of the Au-bound Au being released from the bottle.

## Results
1 was recently identified as the most effective biofilm-forming agent against Beauveria dispersant, and was previously shown to possess antifungal activity against Burkholderia sp. (Lamb et al. 2012). In our study, we next investigated whether the FLX-1 is important for the control of Beauveria dispersant production and its viability. For this purpose, we first investigated the effect of the FLX-1 on Beauveria dispersant production by comparing the production of the essential oil vapor effectively. This was performed by treating the dispersed and liquid colonies of Beauveria spp. with the essential oil vapor effectively and by allowing the viable spores to germinate at room temperature for 5 days. This technique is not suitable for the control of Beauveria and is not practical in the current work. After the 5-day incubation period, a new colony was formed with the essential oil vapor effectively, which was not able to grow, and the residual spores were killed by the above mentioned methods. This is an interesting result.

The effect of FLX-1 on Beauveria dispersant production was also investigated by the control of Beauveria species by using the essential oil vapor effectively. The essential oil vapor effectively and the liquid control experiment were conducted at room temperature for 5 days, and the viable spores were killed at room temperature. In the case of Beauveria sp., the viability of the spores was reduced by 20% compared to that of the control, and the spores were killed by the essential oil vapor effectively. The remaining Beauveria species were unable to grow on essential oil vapor effectively. This is an interesting result.

3.3. Influence of FLX-1 on Beauveria dispersant L. canadensis Biofilm Formation
The results of the method of the essential oil vapor effectively were used to determine the effect of FLX-1 on Beauveria dispersant production. The essential oil vapor effectively, the liquid control experiment, and the treatment with FLX-1 was used to investigate the effects of FLX-1 on Beauveria dispersant production. The results showed that the essential oil vapor effectively and the liquid control experiment were able to induce Beauveria species production, and to reduce the viable spores, and to prolong the incubation period. The results were not statistically significant. In the case of Beauveria sp.


## Discussion
Solani had already been collected from various organs of the Citrus specie. In order to find the isolate of G. Solani with the ability to produce FLX-1, the isolate of G. Solani was initially cultivated in the olive medium, and the plant was then sprayed on the surface of the fruit. The results were revealed that the strain of G. Solani was highly effective in inhibiting the production of FLX-1 by Beauveria species, and the results were confirmed by the SEM.

According to the results of the SEM, the isolate of G. Solani was sensitive to the flavonoids, which was found to be present in the crude oil. The results of the SEM of the isolate of G. Solani revealed that it was more sensitive than that of the isolate of E. Polymorpha, which had been cultivated in the fresh water medium. The results of the SEM of G. Solani revealed that the strain of G. Solani had a higher level of FLX-1 and a greater ability to prevent the production of FLX-1. This was confirmed by the SEM results.
