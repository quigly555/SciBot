## Abstract
The present study deals with the isolation of phytopathogenic fungi from seaweeds, while the yeasts of the genus Bipolaris were studied by using a sandwich-type system. Thirty-six samples were collected from 47 sampling points on 11 kelp/g of seaweeds and their culturable endophytic fungi. The majority of fungi were isolated from seaweeds with a mean of 6.5 × 108 CFU/g. The majority of yeasts were cultured for 9-12 months, with the majority of isolates being able to grow in nutrient-rich nutrient-rich conditions. The majority of isolates were able to form hyphae and form thick-walled colonies. Using this system, we could improve the yield of the most endophytic fungus (AS 179.5 µg/g) being able to grow in nutrient-rich conditions at 30 °C for 8 months. This new strain was able to grow indefinitely on the various nutrient-rich seaweeds and the ability to form thick-walled colonies was verified. This strain was able to survive in the mouth of 30 °C sea-ice temperature for 8 months. At the end of the study, AS 232.3 µg/g was able to grow indefinitely on these seaweeds and was the dominant strain, with a high degree of variability. The ability to grow indefinitely resulted in the isolation of a large number of endophytic fungi and their culturable counterparts. Their culturable counterparts were mainly characterized by a single morphotype, while the yeast isolates were mainly characterized by their genetic variation. The present study provides insight into the interactions between Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with both groups having fungal communities dominated by endophytic fungi.


## Introduction
The transformation of wastewater into organic compounds, with its long cycle from the industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to the industrial wastewater treatment plant (HDPT), is a major problem that is frequently discussed in the literature [1,2]. However, the process of water treatment and treatment has not received much attention in the literature. So, in the present study, the degradation of wastewater (TDW) was evaluated and the degradation of organic pollutants was reported. The degradation of organic pollutants (Pb, Pd, Pf, Pg, Ph, Pj and Pm) by a process of WTB was analyzed in comparison with wastewater treated with DPP, in which the degradation was performed under aerobic conditions. The degradation of organic pollutants (Pb, Pd, Pf, Ph, Pj and Pm) was evaluated in comparison with wastewater treated with DPP. The degradation of organic pollutants (Pb, Pd, Pf, Ph, Pj and Pm) was evaluated in comparison with wastewater treated with DPP.


## Methods
) [12]

The analysis of the different morphotypes of the different morphotypes was performed by the yeast isolation from the headspace of the yeast strains, by the analysis of the morphology of the fungal colonies, and by the assimilation of the different morphotypes into the cell culture medi. To determine the interaction of the various morphotypes, the yeast strains were cultivated in 2 mL of cell culture medium, with the addition of 200 µL of 0.02% (w/v) glucose (w/v) and 150 µL of 0.02% (w/v) glycerol (w/v) at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 g, and washed three times with distilled water to remove the medium and then centrifuged at 1,200 g. The biomass was then re-suspended in 5 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and then filtered through 0.45-µm filter paper (Whatman). The mycelium was then washed with sterile distilled water to remove the medium and then re-suspended in 50 mL of PBS. After filtration of the supernatant, 100 µL of the yeast suspension was added to a 96-well plate, and the plate was then incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The number of colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter of cell culture medium was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (MicroTek, Tokyo, Japan). The comparison between the different morphotypes of the different morphotypes was performed by comparing the number of colony forming units per milliliter of cell culture medium.

The assimilation of different morphotypes by a yeast strain was performed by growing the different morphotypes on YPD medium for 18 h at 30°C, after which the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 g, washed with PBS, and then re-suspended in sterile PBS. The mycelium was then washed with PBS and re-suspended in 50 mL of sterile PBS. Then, 200 µL of the yeast suspension was added to the 96-well plate and the plate was then incubated at 37°C for 18 h.


## Results
However, it is not clear whether this would be a simple operation or a complex of multiple fermentation facilitie. The first step towards this conclusion was a feasibility study of the proposed bioreactor, and then to identify the best economic development potential of the proposed new bioreactor. To this end, the highest concentration of carbon for the new bioreactor was used for fermentation. After the fermentation was carried out, the fresh material from the feedstock was used to make the appropriate bioconversions. The initial use of fresh material was initially carried out as a pre-requisite for the development of the new fermentation facility, but later, the initial consumption of the bioconjugates from the bioreactor was necessary to make the necessary adjustments. Therefore, the use of fresh material during the bioconjugations of different species of yeast species complex was pursued to test the feasibility of the new bioreactor. The use of fresh material as a pre-requisite for the development of the new bioreactor was undertaken for the purpose of testing the feasibility of the new bioreactor. In this regard, the use of fresh material as a pre-requisite for the development of the new fermentation facility was undertaken for the purpose of testing the feasibility of the new bioreactor.

The results of the present study are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 describes the results of the fermentation process for the bioconjugation of various species of yeast species complex. The bioconjugation of different species of yeast species complex was carried out using a total of 54 different bioconjugation systems for the bioconjugation of a variety of yeast species, from low- to high-affinity fermentations. The bioconjugation system used in this study was the same system used in the previous study [11], [12]. The fermentation processes for bioconjugation of different species of yeast species complex were conducted in parallel, and the bioconjugation systems were the same in terms of the use of different bioconjugation systems. The bioconjugation system used in this study was the same for all the bioconjugation systems used in previous studies [11], [12].


## Discussion
In this study, we describe the identification of two novel species of Caenorhabditis elegans: a teleomorphic species (C. elegans) and a parasexual one (C. briggsae) and the novel species (C. elegans). These two teleomorphic species are not closely related but share a similar ecological niche. The teleomorphic species, C. elegans, is characterized by the presence of spore-forming and conidial hyphal structures that are associated with pseudoparaphyses. The conidial structures of C.
