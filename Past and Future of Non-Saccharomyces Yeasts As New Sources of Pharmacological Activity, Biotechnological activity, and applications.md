## Abstract
In recent years, microbial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems has become more important than ever, and this diversity is expected to increase in the future. However, there is still much to learn about microbial community structure and ecology of terrestrial ecosystems, and the impacts it has on terrestrial habitats. In this review, we focus on the impact of land use on microbial community structures in the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean plain, grassland, vineyards, tidal zone, and grasslands. We discuss the importance of land use for microbial communities and the relationship between land use, salinity, and microbial communities in terrestrial habitats. We also discuss the effects of land use on microbial communities in terrestrial and marine environments. In particular, we highlight the importance of soil nutrients, salinity, and soil-based nutrient utilization for microbial community structure and community functioning in terrestrial habitats. Finally, we address the impacts of soil nutrient utilization and land use on microbial community structures in terrestrial and marine environments.


## Introduction
Meningitis and meningoencephalitis are common conditions in HIV/AIDS patients [1-3]. AIDS-associated meningoencephalitis is often very rapid, nonspecific and is characterized by decreased intracranial pressure, headache, confusion, seizures and other clinical symptoms. Imaging studies have indicated that HIV-associated meningoencephalitis is more common in patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/µl [4, 5]. Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous fungus found in soil, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. It is the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in patients with CD4 < 200 cells/µl [6].


## Methods

Cultivation of yeast cells in MM
Cultivation of yeast cells in MM was carried out in a shaking incubator (200 rpm, 18 h, 16°C. Yeast cells (50 µl) were added to 5 mL of MM and cultured at 37°C for 24 h and then cooled to -20°C. Cells were harvested, washed in saline, and adjusted to a density of 2.0×10^8 yeast cells/mL. The number of yeast cells in MM was determined by counting the number of cells in MM by trypan blue dye (10% final concentration) and measuring the optical density at 532 nm.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Cultivation of yeast cells in MM was carried out in a shaking incubator at 30°C. Yeast cells were inoculated into 200 µl of MM at a density of 2.0×10^6 yeast cells/mL. The number of yeast cells in MM was determined by counting the number of cells in MM by trypan blue dye (10% final concentration) and measuring the optical density at 532 nm. The samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min and washed with distilled water three times to remove non-specific binding of the sample. Samples were post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by post-fixation in methanol (15% final concentration) for 10 min, and post-photobleaching with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min. Samples were post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by post-fixation in methanol (15% final concentration) for 10 min, and post-photobleaching with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min. The sample was post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by post-dissolving in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and post-dissolving in 3% formaldehyde for 10 min.


## Results
The cAMP-PKA pathway regulates the mRNA expression of the mycobiocins
We recently demonstrated that C. albicans strains lacking pkcA, a putative pkcA-binding site, and mycobiocin A, a putative pkcA-binding site homologous to the histidine kinase domain, are hyperactive in vivo against C. albicans (5). To test whether the C. albicans pkcA-binding site is important for the regulation of the C. albicans mRNA expression, we used a C. albicans strain with loss of pkcA, pkcA-binding site, and mycobiocin A (Fig 1A) to secrete cAMP-PKA. The C. albicans pkcA-binding site was highly expressed by wild-type C.


## Discussion

Biotechnological Activity
The following discussion of the Biotechnological Activity of Yeasts and their applications in Biological Materials Management is provided in the following tex.

Yeasts are organisms that utilize a wide variety of substrates for biomass production. The use of different types of biomass substrates can be used to feed the industrial application, such as in biofuel production, ethanol production, biotechnology, and food production. Yeast metabolism is highly dependent on the type of carbon sources used for biomass production, such as glucose, mannitol, and trehalose. Yeast metabolism is also highly dependent on the specific carbon source used for biomass production. For example, the majority of yeast species, including C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, and C. parapsilosis, use glucose as the carbon source. Furthermore, the use of glucose is linked to the production of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, such as the following yeast strains: C. albicans (0.69-1.30 g/L), C. tropicalis (1.4 g/L), and C. dubliniensis (1.7 g/L). Additionally, the use of glucose is linked to the production of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, such as C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and C. parapsilosis. In the following discussion, the term “non-Saccharomyces yeasts” refers to yeast strains that are able to utilize a variety of substrates.

The yeast species involved in the biotechnological applications are characterized by the presence of the N-linked glycosidic linkages, a glycolytic pathway, a fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, a glycerol pathway, and a cell wall biosynthesis pathway. Generally, yeast species present in industrial scale comprise C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, and C. albicans. The use of these yeast species as bioreactors is an effective strategy for the biotechnological application of bioconversions. The utilization of N-linked glycosidic linkages in the biosynthesis of sugars, proteins, and lipids is one of the best bioreactors for bioconversions.
