## Abstract
Candida albicans is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, with the majority of its burden in healthcare. Patients with hematogenously disseminated candidiasis are thought to have a skewed immune load, and there is no clear consensus as to which systemic components contribute to this burden. We aimed to compare the relative contributions of granulocyte count, CD4+ T-cell count, melanin production, and urease activity in patients with hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, using the adherent granule contrast enhancement images in one standardized clinical model.

Twenty one patients with clinical stages of candidiasis, 17 with hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, and 2 with peripartum candidiasis were studied. Altered mental status, peripheral blood mononuclear cells counts, and serum white blood cell and CD4+ T-cell counts were compared. A correlation between these variables was analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA).

Increased granulocyte counts and higher CD4+ T-cell counts were associated with a greater risk of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Patients with peripartum candidiasis had higher granulocyte counts and higher CD4+ T-cell counts. The results of PCA and urease activity in patients with peripartum and granulocyte counts above the limit of detection were compared.

The results indicated higher cell counts and higher CD4+ T-cell counts in patients with peripartum and granulocyte counts below the limit of detection, but no correlation was found for these variables. In addition, urease activity was not associated with the risk of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis.

## Introduction
 2017. The Enteric Microorganisms In The Enteric Microbial Cycle: From Bacteria to Bacteria in The Enteric Microbial Cycle: Are The Enteric Microorganisms In The Enteric Microbial Cycle Intracellularly Important? From a (Pro)verbationistic Point of view, Enteric Microorganisms have been shown to form a bridge between the enteric and the phagolysosome systems, and they act as key players in the intracellular and extracellular signaling that modulates the activity of these two systems (Fortwendel et al., 2017). In addition, they have been shown to have a role in innate immunity, as evidenced by the recognition of bacteria by macrophages and the induction of phagocytosis by macrophages (Fortwendel et al., 2017). They may also have a role in host defense against intracellular bacteria and fungi. Indeed, a study by the members of our group demonstrated that Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause decreased resistance to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa did (Fortwendel et al., 2017).

## Methods
In addition to this, a recently developed kit in the form of a round-bottom 96-well plate reader (Biotek, Germany) was also used for bacterial growth inhibition studie. In brief, 5 × 10^6 E. coli OP50, E. coli OP50, and E. coli OP100 were incubated at 37°C for 18 h in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA). After a centrifugation step, 10 µl of the bacteria were added to the wells of the 96-well plate. Then, 1 mL of RPMI-1640 with 0.5% glucose was added to the supernatant of each well. To measure intracellular bacteria, the bacterial suspension was added to the wells of the 96-well plate and the plate was read at 540 nm. The percentage of cell growth inhibition was calculated using the following equation: % inhibition (%) = [(C - C_control)/(C - C_control) × 100] × 100.

2.5. Ethanol Binding to Cells
To assess the effect of acetylacetate on the binding of E. coli OEB-1, a previously described method was used [55]. Briefly, 10^6 E. coli OP50, E. coli OP50, E. coli OP50, and E. coli OP100 were incubated in 5 mL of RPMI-1640 at 37°C for 6 h in a humidified incubator. Afterward, 1 mL of 0.2% (w/v) NaCl was added to each well, and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. Subsequently, 1 mL of 0.2% (w/v) NaCl was added to each well and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mL of isopropanol, and the plate was read at 540 nm. The percentage of cell growth inhibition was calculated using the following equation: % inhibition (%) = [(C - C_control)/(C - C_control) × 100] × 100.

## Results
While PAMP is a key enzyme in the antimicrobial PAMP pathway of Gram-positive bacteria, there is also a PAMP (PAMP-binding site) pathway in the . pombe PAMP pathway, where antimicrobial peptides such as penicillin are synthesized [24]. PAMP peptides are composed of aqueous oligosaccharides, and their antimicrobial peptides are derived from the PAMP-binding sites. The presence of the PAMP peptide in the bacterial peptide-binding site increases bacterial killing by the Pseudomonas bacterium [25], [26]. Thus, the presence of a PAMP peptide in the bacterial peptide-binding site can facilitate the bacterial killing by the PAMP peptide-producing bacteria. The observed differences in the effect of penicillin and streptomycin on bacterial killing are consistent with the antimicrobial effect of both antibiotics and antibiotics on S. pombe, S. pombe, and S. pombe (Figure 4A). However, the PAMP peptides may have different effects on bacterial killing by the PAMP or PAMP-binding site, especially at the bacterial level. In this regard, the PAMP peptides have different effects on bacterial killing, especially at the bacterial level. These differences may suggest that the bacterial killing effect of the PAMP peptides is dependent on the mechanism of action of these antibiotic and antimicrobial peptides.

Antimicrobial peptides are produced by the PAMP or PAMP-binding site in bacteria [27]. The PAMP-binding site is a site of cleavage of the PAMP-binding domain, leading to the formation of a sequence of amino acids, which can be used for binding to the PAMP peptide. The PAMP-binding site is the site of cleavage of the PAMP-binding domain, which is a site of cleavage of the PAMP-binding domain, leading to the formation of a sequence of amino acids that can be used for binding to the PAMP peptide.


## Discussion
The biofilm formation of . bacillaris was enhanced by the addition of antibiotics, in addition to polymyxin B [24]. In this study, the antimicrobial effects of the antibiotic treatment could be associated with bacterial community compositions in the biofilm, which could be associated with the detection of T. bacillaris biofilms. Our results are in accordance with previous studies that have shown the significance of the antibiotic treatment in the antibacterial effect of antimicrobials. In our study, the antibiotic treatment was not associated with the changes in the bacterial community composition in the biofilm, but the presence of T. bacillaris and Klebsiella pneumoniae were associated with the changes in the bacterial community composition in the biofilm [25].

Bacterial community structure in the biofilm of T. bacillaris
The biofilm structure of T. bacillaris was modelled and compared with that of the Bacteroides fragilis, which is a Gram-negative bacterium, in the present study. The biofilm of T. bacillaris is highly variable, ranging from less than 0.3% to 100% of the total bacterial biomass [26]. The biofilm of T. bacillaris is composed of polymicrobial microorganisms, with the most typical microbiota, including strains of the genera Bacteroides, S. pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae, which are considered to be members of the genus Streptomyces [27]. In our study, the biofilm of T. bacillaris was composed of strains of the genera S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis, which are considered to be Gram-negative, and strains of the genera S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. In the present study, the biofilm of T. bacillaris was composed of strains of the genera S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The biofilm of T. bacillaris was composed of strains of the genera S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The biofilm of T. bacillaris was composed of strains of the genera S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The biofilm of T.
