## Abstract

We provide a global analysis of the fatty acid metabolism in these fruits by analyzing gene expression data from 138 strains and isolates representing seven known fungal pathogen. High expression levels of several enzymes were found for the essential fatty acid methyl esterase (FES), which is crucial for the survival of these pathogens in the host. In addition, high expression levels of the secretory enzymes were found for the ß-glucan synthase (FSY1), which is also relevant for the survival of these pathogens in the host. Our analysis identified many important enzymes (e.g., alkaline-fast A-450 glucosylceramide synthase, arachidonic acid dehydrogenase, urea-permeable glucosylceramide synthase, and alkaline-fast A-methyl esterase) which have enzymatic activities against a broad range of pathogenic fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans. We also identified several important enzymes (e.g., alkaline-fast A-450 glucosylceramide synthase, arachidonic acid dehydrogenase, urea-permeable glucosylceramide synthase, and alkaline-fast A-methyl esterase) which are either highly enzymatic or highly enzymatic in nature. These enzymes were also found to be essential for virulence in a mouse model of infection. These data strongly suggest that these enzymes are of biotechnological interest for the production of anti-fungal drugs.

IMPORTANCE The global burden of fungal infections is increasing world-wide, and Candida albicans is the leading cause of fungal bloodstream infections. A polysaccharide capsule that may be secreted through dietary or heme-mediated pathways is the first line of anti-fungal drugs, which may provide an opportunity for C. albicans to overcome host defenses and acquire virulence. In this sense, the fatty acid biosynthesis and secretion of the fungus may be important for its virulence. In this study, we investigated the role of a heterologous protein lacking in the human FES in C. albicans. This protein plays a role in the evolution of virulence, since it lacks several key components of the cell wall, including the ß-glucan ring.


## Introduction
The use of transgenic plants for the production of biofuels and biochar has increased recently due to their favorable environmental conditions [1]. The use of plant derived renewable energy sources such as lignocellulosic biomass, can replace fossil fuels for energy generation [2]. The use of biogas-derived biochemicals (BBBS) and their derivatives has gained popularity recently due to their economical, eco-friendlier, and biodegradable properties [3]. In this regard, the use of biogas-derived biofuels for the production of biofuels is a matter of increasing interest because of their economic and environmental benefits [4]. Currently, the most important producers of lignocellulosic biofuels, with a total global market worth over $6.6 billion, are the United States, Europe, Japan, and China, and their products are widely used in agriculture, pulp and paper, and pulp and paper manufacturing [5]. However, in countries with strict environmental regulations, such as China, the use of biogas-derived biochemicals for biofuels is still restricted.

Biogas-derived biofuels have been developed as a byproduct of the biodiesel industry. It is a polymer made of glucose, fructose, lactose, or choline that is produced by a variety of organisms from the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. The ability of biogas-derived biofuels to deliver high performance in high volume and in low cost is a feature of their potential industrial potential that can be exploited by biogas-derived biofuels [6].


## Methods
fumigatus homology with the RQM2^® homology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [18. The A. fumigatus RNA was extracted from the A. fumigatus clinical isolate F_1 with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using the Bio-Rad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The A. fumigatus genomic DNA was isolated using the phenol-chloroform method [19]. The primers for the A. fumigatus A. fumigatus gene specific gene (gfpA) and its corresponding mCherry-tagged promoter were designed with Primer3 software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were purified using an AMPure XP beads (Agencourt Biotechnology, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and quantified using the Bio-Rad CFXReal-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The products were then sequenced by an ABI Prism 3730XL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay
A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in A. fumigatus A. fumigatus and A. fumigatus-infected A. fumigatus RQM2^® cells using the A. fumigatus SYTO-PCR assay and the primers for the A. fumigatus A. fumigatus gfpA and gfpB [20] and the internal control (0.3 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl_2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.


## Results
The enzymes identified as having the highest expression in Aqueous and Vacuole-free Kefir grains are Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Fusarium verticillum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pomb. Interestingly, Aspergillus niger was the most abundant protein, and is associated with the glyoxylate cycle in the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains (Figure 4B). However, A. niger has a distinct role in the glyoxylate cycle and a deletion of ATG2 in A. niger (Figure 4C), and thus a significantly higher expression level of A. niger genes in Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains is likely to be associated with the glyoxylate cycle.

Aspergillus niger Is Involved in the Extracellular Metabolism of Glucose, Glucose, and Lipids
Aspergillus niger was the most abundant protein in both Aqueous and Vacuole-free Kefir grains (Figure 4D), and is associated with the glyoxylate cycle in the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains (Figure 4E). The majority of A. niger genes were associated with the glyoxylate cycle (Figure 4F). However, the expression level of genes associated with the glyoxylate cycle was increased in A. niger in both the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains, suggesting the glyoxylate cycle is repressed in A. niger. Thus, the expression of the A. niger gene, encoding the major facilitator superfamily protein of Glucose and Glucose, was higher in the Aqueous and Vacuole-free Kefir grains than in the Aqueous and Vacuole-free Kefir grains. However, the expression levels of A.


## Discussion
 (Table 3. Although we have not identified the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the main components of the Aqueous and Vacuole-free Kefir Grains, it seems that the fatty acid synthase or aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was decreased in the Beauveria strains, which were obtained from the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains, respectively. In the Beauveria strains, the enzymes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the main fatty acids of Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains, were found to be inhibited at pH 5.0, which corresponds to the pH at which most of the bioactive enzymes of the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains are present, compared to the Beauveria strains. In the Beauveria strains, the enzyme aldolase and aldolase were found to be inhibited at pH 5.0 at pH 5.0 (Table 3).

At pH 5.0, the enzymes of the aldolase were found to be inhibited at pH 5.0 at pH 5.0, which corresponds to the pH at which most of the bioactive enzymes of the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains are present.

It is important to note that the enzymes of the aldolase and aldolase of Beauveria strains showed a significant decrease at pH 5.0 (Table 3), which corresponds to the pH at which most of the bioactive enzymes of the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains are present, compared to the Beauveria strains (Table 3).

The aldolase and aldolase of Beauveria strains showed a significant decrease at pH 5.0 (Table 3), which corresponds to the pH at which most of the bioactive enzymes of the Aqueous and Vacuole-free grains are present, compared to the Beauveria strains (Table 3).
