## Abstract
The high incidence of pancytopenia, recently increased in interest, should promote continued efforts to combat this infection.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that is the most common cause of fungal infection in humans and can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis. It is often difficult to distinguish its pathogenicity, however, because the different strains are able to undergo distinct morphologies. To address this, we analyzed the genomes of eight clinical isolates of C. neoformans and seven clinical isolates of C. gattii.

We identified 188 genes encoding putative virulence factors and 220 genes potentially affected by growth phase transition (PTC) and physiological (PFOA) switch (PPFOA), respectively. In addition, we found a number of genes whose expression is differently altered in the two C. neoformans strains in the studio compared to the two non-caucasian clinical isolates. This indicated that the two C. gattii strains have adapted their PTC and PFOA life-cycle stages. We also identified three genes whose expression is differentially expressed in C. neoformans isolates compared to C. gattii isolates in the studio. These results are important results because they establish a link between PTC and PFOA and define the PFOA-PPFOA pathway as a nexus of adaptation in the virulence of C. neoformans.


## Introduction
Melanins are pigmented molecules with extraordinary properties, which are used by a variety of organisms, including fungi and bacteria, to resist environmental stress and thus provide their survival in the environment. ^1 Melanin is a high molecular weight polymer with high surface area and a high degree of stability. ^2 It is involved in a wide range of biological activities, including photosensory, respiration, cellular processes, and so on. ^3

Melanin is one of the most abundant natural pigments and is an essential component of most living organisms. ^4 It is present in the fungal cell walls and secreted into the extracellular space of the outer layer of fungal cells, where it can react with oxygen to form singlet oxygen (^1). ^5

Since the 1940s, research on fungal melanin has increased enormously. ^6 In the 1950s, the number of publications on the subject has increased by more than 50%. ^7 Today, several journals cover the topic of melanin: “Journal of Bacteria, in its most recent issue, June 2018, 13. Available”; “Journal of Bacteria, in its latest issue, September 2018, 13. Available”; and “Journal of Bacteria, Current Protocols and Applications, “Brief overview”.

There are many kinds of fungal melanin, some of which are as insoluble as keratin or as hydrophilic as keratin, and others insoluble in organic solvents. ^8-16 These molecules can be attached to proteins, peptides, lipids, and so on and can interact with them. The most common insoluble fungal melanin molecules are keratin and polyphenols, which are insoluble in organic solvents and hydrophilic molecules, and are water-soluble, canalkic, and hydrophobic, and can be produced by fungi and bacteria.


## Methods
Strains and media
The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The C. albicans SC5314 strain was used as a model strain for the complementation study. The SC5314 strain was constructed by insertion of a wild-type C. albicans allele of pJAF into the pDONR vector. The pJAF-C. albicans strain was constructed by insertion of a wild-type C. albicans allele of pJAF into the pDONR vector. The <U+0394>cfa gene was amplified with primers pDONR-CFA-F and pDONR-CFA-R and inserted into the pDONR vector to construct the p<U+0394>cfa<U+0394>comp1 mutant. The <U+0394>cfa mutant was created by deletion of the hygromycin resistance gene in the pDONR vector. All strains were cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium.

C. albicans strains and growth conditions
The C. albicans strains were cultured on YPD agar plates at 30°C for 48 h.


## Results

Interactions of caspofungin with the in vitro anti-fungal drug efflux pump Triton X-100
In vitro studies have shown that caspofungin inhibits . albicans and C. neoformans growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the in vivo efficacy of caspofungin against human fungal infections has been demonstrated [22], [23].

In this study, we evaluated the in vitro activity of caspofungin against C. albicans, C. neoformans and C. Gattii in the in vitro assays using the in vivo MIC assay.

## Discussion
A study of 34 patients with . albicans infections in South Korea (9) also found that the association of C. albicans and C. albicans was only weakly related to the infection severity of the patient. This study also demonstrated that the association of C. albicans and C. albicans was weakly correlated with the clinical severity of the patient (14). Therefore, it is possible that in these patients C. albicans infection was not associated with C. albicans infection, but rather with the severity of the disease itself.

In summary, our study showed that the association between C. albicans and C. albicans was weakly related to the severity of the disease itself, but the association was weakly associated with the severity of the patient.

The study also demonstrated that the association of C. albicans and C. albicans was weakly related to the severity of the disease itself, but the association was weakly associated with the severity of the patient.

In summary, we have shown that the association between C. albicans and C. albicans could be weakly related to the severity of the disease itself, but the association was weakly associated with the severity of the patient.

P10. Cryptococcus gattii and C. parapsilosis
This article was originally published as ‘Astrobiology’ in 2006. ^1

The Cryptococcus gattii strain H99 is distributed worldwide and it is the third most common cause of invasive fungal infections (1). ^2 In the past, the two main strains, H99 and R265, were investigated as potential pathogens causing invasive fungal infections. ^3

In the present study, the Cryptococcus gattii strain H99 was isolated from human blood. The strain was initially isolated from diseased individuals, and it was confirmed that it was not related to C. albicans. However, it was shown that the strain could be transferred to the human serum for detection of C. albicans and other related pathogenic fungi (18). ^18 This is the first report that the strain was isolated from human blood.
