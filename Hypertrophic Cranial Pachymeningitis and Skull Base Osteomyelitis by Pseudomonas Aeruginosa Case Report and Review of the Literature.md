## Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of adult morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. In the last decade, oxygen therapy has become the standard therapy of choice for severe ALI. However, there is a growing number of patients developing resistance to azole therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of auranofin, a class 2 inhibitor of the amyloid ß-1,3-glucan pathway, to SLE patients.

Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the concentrations of: (i) the amount of amyloid-ß-1,2-dieno-oligosaccharides (BDOS), (ii) the percentage of cells that were resistant to ß-1,2-dieno-oligosaccharides, (iii) the percentage of cells that were resistant to ß-1,2-dieno-oligosaccharides, and (iv) the number of viable cells.

The results revealed that: (i) azole treatment resulted in an increase in the proportion of ß-1,2-dieno-oligosaccharides; (ii) azole-treated SLE patients had significantly lower concentrations of amyloid-ß-1,2-dieno-oligosaccharides, (iii) the proportion of viable cells was significantly decreased, and (iv) the proportion of viable cells were decreased.

These results suggest that azole therapy is safe and effective for the majority of SLE patients. However, there is a significant variability in the tolerability of this class of drugs.


## Introduction
Cladophialophora bantiana is one of the most common opportunistic human pathogens and is a typical dematiaceous fungus found in soil contaminated with insects and other plant material [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].


## Methods
The clinical and laboratory results were both recorde. The diagnosis of meningitis was based on the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (CLSI, 2008) and was considered to be a probable meningitis if there was a positive microbiological result. The CSF specimens were subjected to DNA extraction and/or bacterial culture according to the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [21].

The data included the following: age, gender, underlying diseases, underlying conditions, underlying causes, underlying complications, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hematologic characteristics. Diagnostic criteria for meningitis were as follows: 1) presence of multiple intracranial and/or pericardial abscesses, and 2) a large suture was not allowed.

Definition of a broken cranial bone in a child’s skull was regarded as an inguinal lesion if the child had a bilateral and a triple inguinal lesion. If a child had a single fracture, a noncontiguous lesion was considered as a fracture.

4.4. Clinical and Laboratory Standards
CSF and blood cultures were performed at the emergency department of the hospital. Two patients were treated with triamcinolone and one with penicillin and streptomycin, respectively, in the emergency department. One patient received prophylactic treatment with flucytosine and/or amphotericin B (AmB) and one patient received other antibiotics. The microbiological results of CSF and blood cultures were evaluated at the department of hematology and pathology.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hematologic features were evaluated using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search algorithm in the PubMed database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the online tool for hematologic specimens (www.openmicrobiology.org/). A clinical data entry form was downloaded and the results were checked manually. The microbiological results of CSF and blood cultures were evaluated at the hospital ethics committee.

## Results
In addition, . fischeri, C. albicans and M. grisea were considered to be three of the most common Enterocysts with infections caused by N. fischeri (Table 1), whereas C. albicans and M. grisea were the most common Enterocysts with infections caused by C. neoformans. The diagnosis of P. chrysogenum infection was based on histopathological findings and the most common symptoms were headache and swelling of the cranial walls (Figure 2). All N. fischeri and C. albicans infections caused by N. fischeri were diagnosed by the use of an N-terminal GFP fusion protein as the only known homolog of this organism [12]. In our study, N. fischeri was isolated from the culture of the microsatellite of P. chrysogenum and a genealogical strain of the S. cerevisiae strain H99 was isolated (Table 1). The H99 strain, which was initially identified as a true pathogen of S. cerevisiae by its homologous recombination in C. albicans, had been shown to be an opportunistic fungal pathogen in S. cerevisiae [10]. N. fischeri has been reported to cause headache and swelling of the cranial walls of clinical and immunocompetent individuals [12, 13].

The most common strains with clinical signs were C. neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii. In the N. fischeri study, the most common clinical signs were headache, swelling of the cranial walls, and a fever. N. fischeri isolates from both clinical and immunocompetent individuals also caused cranial swelling and a fever (Table 1). In addition, the pathogenicity of these isolates was considered to be very high as the proportion of the identified C. neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii isolates was approximately 25% and approximately 45%, respectively. In the case of the C. neoformans isolate, a clinical culture of the patient and a clinical culture of the isolate were conducted. The results demonstrated that all the isolates were able to cause clinical signs, such as headache, swelling of the cranial walls, and fever. However, the C. neoformans isolates caused by these isolates were extremely resistant to antifungal agents.
