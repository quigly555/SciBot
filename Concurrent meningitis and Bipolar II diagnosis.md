## Abstract

Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of death in individuals with HIV infection, and this treatment strategy is instrumental to reduce morbidity and mortalit. A retrospective chart review study was conducted to determine the proportion of patients with cryptococcal meningitis and the proportion with autoimmunity, which may be related to the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF.

Between January 2010 and May 2011, a retrospective chart review study was performed at our facility. A total of 57 patients were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, and 35 (28.8%) had autoimmunity. Among these, autoimmunity was the most common type of meningitis, and it was the predominant type in our patient population. Among cryptococcal meningitis patients without autoimmunity, autoimmunity was the predominant type in our patient population for all time points examined. In multivariate analysis, autoimmunity was significantly associated with the occurrence of serious fungal infection, the duration of Cryptococcus infection, and CSF white blood cell count.

We found no differences in the proportion of patients with cryptococcal meningitis and those without cryptococcal meningitis by the presence of autoimmunity.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a very common cause of death among individuals living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the proportion of HIV-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningitis is increasing among African patients, especially in patients with advanced AIDS. Cryptococcal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, even though there are no treatment strategies for cryptococcal meningitis. Our goal was to identify factors associated with cryptococcal meningitis and evaluate if these findings may be clinically relevant or relevant to the management of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with advanced AIDS in Ghana.

We performed a multicentre, open-label clinical case series analysis of 12 HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis treated with HAART from January 2010 to April 2011.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease caused by two different species of the genus Cryptococcus: var. grubii (serotype A) and var. neoformans (serotype D). It is an infectious disease and the disease is commonly contracted by inhalation of infectious propagules. The spores are either deposited into the alveoli or reach the circulation through skin and lung. There, they are covered by a protective capsule and the fungus grows slowly.

The human body's innate immunity is highly restricted. We are not able to clear the infection or the infection-causing organisms from the body because of our weakened immunity and inability to combat the pathogens with immune evasion and antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, a comprehensive approach based on the recruitment of innate and adaptive immunity is necessary for the host's defense against infection.


## Methods
Strains and media
The following C.


## Results
Of these, 31 were male, 5 were from a rural area and 4 were from a metropolitan are. The mean age was 52.3 years (range 18-80). The median CD4+ T-cell count was 87 cells/µL (range 50-900). Forty-three of the 37 meningitis patients (82%) had a CD4+ T-cell count of =100 cells/µL. The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 213 cells/µL (range 83-550). The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 943 cells/µL (range 309-1250).

Causes of meningitis in patients with Bipolar I
The diagnosis of meningitis was based on the presence of BPI, CMV, cryptococcal meningitis, and neurological sequelae. The most common underlying disease was C. neoformans infection, followed by tuberculosis (Table 2). Of the 42 patients with Bipolar I, 20 were male, 9 were from a rural area and 4 were from a metropolitan area. The median age was 57.5 years (range 24-72). The median CD4+ T-cell count was 2,89 cells/µL (range 1,613-5,237). The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 9,938 cells/µL (range 303-14,958). The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 2,700 cells/µL (range 2,153-6,456). The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 13,927 cells/µL (range 2,073-15,379). The median CD4+ T-cell count in the meningitis group was 100 cells/µL (range 95-185).

Mortality in the Bipolar I-Deficient Patients
Of the 47 Bipolar I-deficient patients with BPI, CMV, cryptococcal meningitis, and TB, 34 died within 12 months of diagnosis. The mortality rate was 15.6/100, 30.6/100, and 0.75/100, respectively. The median age was 59.


## Discussion
First, many patients have a well-established disease history, which is common in HIV/AIDS patients [5], and it is difficult to ascertain the patient’s HIV status in the initial diagnosi. Second, an HIV-infected patient with Bipolar I disease might have a better prognosis. Third, in the majority of cases, a patient might be identified by DNA and/or magnetic resonance imaging [6], as well as by CSF biochemistry [8], and/or by the presence of various cryptococcal proteins. Finally, the patient’s gender might also contribute to the clinical diagnosis.

The initial diagnosis of AIDS can be a challenging one. In many cases, AIDS is a paradoxical condition. The patient may be found by CSF or magnetic resonance imaging. The patient may have a very low CD4 cell count and probably presents with a transient immunodeficiency, which is not likely to be caused by Bipolar II. The patient may have a very low CD4 cell count, might have a low viral load, and may present with altered mental status, such as headache, confusion, and altered mental status with reduced T2 interstitial fluid (T2-IFN-<U+03B3> - T2-IFN-<U+03B3>+T2-IFN-<U+03B3> (T2-IFN-<U+03B3>-T2-IFN-<U+03B3>)) which may be a sign of a latent infection [7]. The patient may also have a very low CD4 cell count and probably present with a mild CSF inflammatory syndrome, which is not likely to be a direct result of Bipolar II [9]. A patient with cryptococcal meningitis may also have a very low CD4 cell count and present with a transient immunodeficiency which is not likely to be a direct result of Bipolar II.

The patient might also have a severe or non-specific fever, which is very common in HIV/AIDS patients [5], and/or a decrease in the normal CSF inflammatory parameters (cytokines, IL-2, IL-13, and IFN-<U+03B3>). These may suggest a localized infection.
