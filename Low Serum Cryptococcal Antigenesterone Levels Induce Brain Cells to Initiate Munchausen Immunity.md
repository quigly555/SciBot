## Abstract
The incidence of fungal infections has risen dramatically in recent decades due to the growing proportion of people with immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) who are unable to tolerate or fail to get adequate antibiotic treatment due to resistance to many antibiotics. Amphotericin B (AMB) is a drug used widely in clinical medicine to manage immune deficiency and is therefore well-tolerated. However, the spectrum of resistance to AMB in patients with HIV/AMB-deficient syndrome is extremely diverse. This paper outlines the spectrum of resistance to AMB in HIV/AMB-deficient patients with HIV/AMB syndrome. Using a case-based approach, we describe the common adverse effects of AMB and its overused derivatives in HIV/AMB-deficient patients with HIV/AMPII-deficient syndrome. We also describe the common adverse effects of the derivatives on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and on the kidney fungal burden. By establishing the range of clinical and epidemiological outcomes that AMB-deficient patients with HIV/AMB syndrome would experience, we conclude that the most severe forms of HIV/AMB-deficiency can be treated with limited and incremental improvement of both immune recovery and oncological performance.


## Introduction
2016), which suggests that these antibodies can be used to recognize and recognize multiple species of pathogens (Deepe et a. 2015).

The key event in the CNS activation of immune cells is the release of the cell-bound immune globulin, globin. The globin binds with high affinity to the neuronal chaperones, which are cell-surface proteins that mediate the anti-inflammatory immune response (Donlan et al. 2006; Boekhout et al. 2007). Although many studies have focused on the expression of the globin, its primary function is to induce and activate the cell-bound immune globulin (Mao et al. 2016). During the CNS inflammatory process, cells release the cell-bound immune globulin, globin, and their maturation into cytokines correlates with the activation of the immune-related protein (IRP). IRP has been described as a key inflammatory cytokine that influences the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) immune responses (Donlan et al. 2006; Cai et al. 2008; Jepsen et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016). The cytokines are recognized by cytokines receptors (IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IL-23) that mediate their release into the brain tissue. The receptor on the cell surface recognizes the pathogen and activates the cell-bound immune globulin, which can then be internalized by the cell (Liu et al. 2016). Once the immune globulins are internalized, they can be activated by the host immune response, leading to systemic inflammation and brain death (Donlan et al. 2006).

In addition to the immune globulins, other signaling molecules in the brain that mediate inflammation are the cytokines that mediate the inflammatory process (Liu et al. 2016). For example, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-12 (IL-12) are both known to induce the inflammatory cascade. IL-12 induces IL-12B and IL-12F production, respectively, and IL-12B and IL-12F production are tightly regulated (Mendes et al. 2004). In the immune-competent host, IL-12F is released into the circulation and the circulation is blocked (Santos et al. 2015).


## Methods
We isolated cells from whole blood, separated the blood, and cultured them in RPMI-1640 medium, which contains .5% (v/v) FBS. After centrifugation, cells were collected by gentle pipetting and passed through a 40 µm syringe filter. The collected cells were filtered through a 0.22 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). For serum, we used a new serum-free blood serum-free (MBI, Austin, TX) with 2% (v/v) BSA, and supplemented with 20% (v/v) nonessential amino acids. For serum, we used a buffer solution containing 1% (v/v) BSA, 1% (v/v) methenamine silver, 0.05% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% (v/v) sodium borohydride, and 0.05% (v/v) sodium ferrocyanide) at 37°C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1% (v/v) BSA and 1% (v/v) methanol. The remaining supernatant was resuspended in 1% (v/v) BSA and 1% (v/v) methanol, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0. Then, 0.5 mL of the suspension was added to 200 µL of RPMI-1640 medium. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 1% (v/v) BSA and 1% (v/v) methanol. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 1% (v/v) BSA and 1% (v/v) methanol. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere.


## Results
In this study, we examined whether sera from HIV infected patients could induce anti-cryptococcal antibody by an ELIS. The anti-cryptococcal antibody in the serum of HIV infected patients could induce antibody responses. As shown in Figure 2, there was no difference in the level of anti-cryptococcal antibody in the sera of HIV infected patients and the control group.

Epistasis of Cryptococcus
The immune response in the brains of HIV infected patients is known as the immune response. In the CNS of HIV infected patients, the immune response is dependent on the cytokine or protein secreted by the CNS. The cytokine is the primary antifungal cytokine and is produced by the CNS, the immune response and the immune system. The cytokine secreted by the CNS is the major cytokine of the immune system. The proteins secreted by the CNS are secreted by the immune system, which is the main component of the CNS immune response [23,24]. The sera from HIV infected patients were analyzed by ELISA to determine whether the antibodies that induce brain cell immune responses were also secreted by the CNS. The proteins that were secreted by the CNS were not detected by the ELISA in the HIV infected patients. As shown in Figure 3, the antibodies that induced brain cell immune responses induced by HIV infected patients were detectable in the sera of HIV infected patients, but not in the control group.

Epistasis of Cryptococcus
We identified the sera of HIV infected patients that could induce antibodies against cryptococcal antigens by ELISA. The antibodies that induced brain cell immune responses induced by HIV infected patients were detected in the sera of HIV infected patients, but not in the control group. The antibodies that induced anti-cryptococcal antibodies in HIV infected patients were not detected by ELISA in the HIV infected patients. The antibodies that induced anti-cryptococcal antibodies in HIV infected patients were not detected by ELISA in the control group.
