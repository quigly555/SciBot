## Abstract
Biofilms formed by the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans are often resistant to antifungal drugs, which make identification of the molecular mechanism of drug resistance a major challenge in therapeutic drug development. We previously reported that hygromycin B inhibits the growth of C. albicans in vitro. Here we show that BcB affects the gene expression profile of the biofilm isolate designated as “C. albicans.” Hygromycin B treatment of C. albicans increases the expression of the genes involved in cellulose and urease production in the fungus, and also increases the expression of cellulases involved in urease production in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Treatment with BcB caused a reduction in the biofilm protein colocalization, which correlated with a decrease in the extracellular cell number of the biofilm strain. Treatment with urea (a major antifungal agent) also reduced the biofilm protein colocalization. In vitro, treatment with BcB resulted in a decrease in the expression of the ureA, ureB and ureC genes, the gene responsible for the dectin-1 enzyme and the dectin-2 enzyme, which were also reduced. In addition, Hygromycin B treatment of C. albicans increased the expression of ureA, ureB and ureC genes, suggesting that BcB also increased the expression of these genes. These results indicate that BcYAK1 plays a key role in the regulation of the cell wall integrity pathway, which is also affected by the biofilm infection state. This work demonstrates that BcYAK1 is required for the regulation of cellulose degradation and the production of ureA and ureB in the biofilm infection model, which is similar to the fungal infection model.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Invasive fungal infections are increasingly recognized in patients with hematologic malignancies or neutropenia, but also in patients undergoing organ transplantation and chemotherapy, hematologic diseases or other conditions with limited access to antifungal agents (e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, sarcoidosis). In addition, patients with underlying neoplasms, AIDS, chronic kidney disease, or corticosteroid therapy may be at increased risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI) [1-5].

The term “immunosuppressive antifungal therapy” (I-AT) was first proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1992 [6]. The aim of this guideline was to harmonize antifungal therapy and clinical management according to IFIs in patients with underlying neoplasms.


## Methods
Briefly, fungi cells were inoculated in 30 mL of YPD media, at 30°C with shaking, for 5 day. A sterile filter paper was applied over the agar and then the suspension was gently shaken for 3 minutes. Then, 1 mL of cell suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate cells from the media. The supernatant was removed and 1 mL of the cell suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. Finally, the supernatant was removed and 1 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The supernatant was then removed and 1 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The supernatant was then removed and 1 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension. The tube was then rinsed with PBS and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell suspension.


## Results
neoformans under different environmental conditions and the growth rate of the pathogenic fungus, . neoformans var. grubii (Figure 2). We found that the growth rate of C. neoformans var. grubii was lower than that of C. neoformans var. neoformans, which indicates that the regulation of virulence is regulated by BcYak1.

BcYak1 is Involved in the Regulation of Vegetative Stress Resistance and Virulence of the Pathogenic Fungus Cryptococcus neoformans

To investigate the role of BcYak1 in the regulation of virulence, we investigated the effect of BcYak1 activity on the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of B. cinerea. The growth of C. neoformans was inhibited by BcYak1 activity and the growth rate of C. neoformans was decreased by 1.5-fold (Figure 3A). As B. cinerea is an osmoprotective growth factor that stimulates the cell wall stress response [24], the growth rate of B. cinerea was also reduced by 1.5-fold. In contrast, the growth rate of C. neoformans was not inhibited by BcYak1 activity and the growth rate of C. neoformans was not inhibited by BcYak1 activity. B. cinerea had a significant negative effect on the growth rate of B. cinerea and the growth rate of C. neoformans was not inhibited by BcYak1 activity. Moreover, the growth rate of B. cinerea was inhibited by BcYak1 activity and the growth rate of C. neoformans was not inhibited by BcYak1 activity. The growth of C. neoformans was also inhibited by BcYak1 activity.

To investigate the role of BcYak1 in the regulation of virulence of the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, we analyzed the virulence of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans using the nematode model. The virulence of C.


## Discussion
neoformans)
In the context of the above-mentioned studies, we speculate that BcYak1 plays a role in the regulation of the inducible promoter of the virulence factor BcYak1 in . neoformans. While our data demonstrate that BcYak1 is required for the development of the virulence factor BcYak1 (BcYak1-1), the transcription factor BcYak1, which regulates the transcription of BcYak1-2 in C. neoformans (Fig 2), is dispensable for the development of the BcYak1-1 strain. It is known that BcYak1-1 is the transcription factor of BcYak1-1, which has been proposed to be a transcriptional regulator [47]. In addition, we found that deletion of BcYak1-2 in C. neoformans results in the down-regulation of the transcription of BcYak1-1 (Fig 2). This suggests that the regulation of BcYak1-2 by BcYak1-1 is also the effector of BcYak1-1.

We also found that deletion of BcYak1-3 in C. neoformans results in the down-regulation of BcYak1-3 (Fig 2). This suggests that BcYak1-3 is a transcriptional regulator of BcYak1-3. It is possible that BcYak1-3 mediates the transcription of BcYak1-3 in C. neoformans by its transcriptional repressor, BcYak1-1. This may be the reason why BcYak1-1-3 is dispensable in the development of the BcYak1-1 strain.

Furthermore, we found that deletion of BcYak1-1 in C. albicans resulted in the down-regulation of the transcription of BcYak1-1 (Fig 2). This suggests that BcYak1-1 mediates the transcription of BcYak1-1 in C. albicans by BcYak1-1. In addition, we found that deletion of BcYak1-1 in C. neoformans results in the down-regulation of the transcription of BcYak1-1 (Fig 2).
