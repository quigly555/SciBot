Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract
In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in the characterization of the fungal community associated with mushrooms. In particular, it is now apparent that fungi are a very important group in many areas that benefit from the mushrooms’ edible products. This article reviews the main fungi found on mushrooms and discusses the evolutionary relationships that underlie their food-inspired biology.


## Introduction

Based on a megablast search of NCBIs GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Piper aduncum (GenBank KX8608.1; Identities = 521/640 (94 %), 10 gaps (2 %)), Piper perpumum (GenBank KP0192.1; Identities = 521/640 (93 %), 10 gaps (2 %)) and Piper perpum (GenBank KP0192.1; Identities = 521/640 (93 %), 10 gaps (2 %)). Closest hits using the LSU sequence are Piper perpum (GenBank MK7339.1; Identities = 804/857 (99 %), no gaps), Piper perpum (GenBank KX8273.1; Identities = 820/876 (99 %), no gaps) and Piper perpum (GenBank KP0192.1; Identities = 823/843 (99 %), no gaps). The LSU sequence of Piper is 99 % identical to those of Perpum, but Perpum is 93 % larger. The LSU sequence of Piper is 10 times more similar to that of Piper perpum than to those of Perpum and Perpum areq. showed.

## Methods
niger seed (.S.A.) was used to prepare essential oil. One gram of total mycelium was inoculated in a 0.2 ml of 1% v/v lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 1% v/v lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were then extracted by filtration using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and the supernatant was collected. The concentrations of the essential oil were determined using the method of Arras et al. [19].

The commercial essential oil A. niger seed (U.S.A.) was used as a control to evaluate the antibacterial activity of A. niger seed. A. niger seed culture was maintained at 37°C in a 10% CO_2 atmosphere. The culture medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 10 min and then filtered using a 0.22 µm syringe filter to remove the endotoxin. The control A. niger seed culture (0.3 ml) was mixed with A. niger seed culture (0.1 ml) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. A. niger seed (1.0 ml) was used as a reference for the antibacterial activities.

2.6. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for Essential Oil
The MIC was determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [20] with minor modifications. The essential oil (1.0 g) was mixed with A. niger seed (1.0 ml) in a 96-well plate and incubated at 35°C for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, washed twice with sterile distilled water and then resuspended in a PBS buffer (0.05% Tween 20) to the desired concentration. The cells were then disrupted by bead beating for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatant was collected. The collected supernatant was then used as a final concentration of essential oil (1.


## Results
The most active and effective antifungal peptides, which are used for a wide range of applications, are described in Table . In particular, the most active peptides were found in the essential oil of Piper aduncum (Table 4).

Table 5 summarizes the antifungal activity of Piper aduncum against all the tested strains. Piper aduncum was inactive against all the tested strains except the susceptible strains CBS 12939 and CBS 1304. The most active and effective antifungal peptides were also found in the essential oil of Piper aduncum (Table 5).

For further investigation, the MIC and MBC were determined for the tested strains and the essential oil of Piper aduncum were used for further development. The MIC and MBC values were lower than those for the reference drugs amphotericin B, itraconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole. The MIC values of Piper aduncum were found to be 64 µg/ml and 64 µg/ml for itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively. In addition, the MBC values of the essential oil of Piper aduncum were found to be 6.5 µg/ml and 6.5 µg/ml for itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin, respectively.

In vitro and in vivo activity of Piper aduncum essential oil against Cryptococcus neoformans
The antifungal activity of Piper aduncum essential oil against Cryptococcus neoformans was evaluated using a panel of 10 clinical strains of C. neoformans and three clinical strains of C. gattii. The MIC_50 value of Piper aduncum essential oil was found to be 0.03 µg/ml for all the strains except the susceptible strains CBS 12939 and CBS 1304. The MBC values of Piper aduncum were found to be 0.125 µg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml for itraconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, fluconazole, and itraconazole, respectively.


## Discussion
In addition to biological activities, antimicrobial activity has been described for other products [31-33. These compounds are known as flavonoids, hydrophiles, and terpenoids [31,32,34]. The compounds identified in the current study are representative of these compounds.

The antimicrobial activity of flavonoids was evaluated based on the ability to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The MIC of this compound was determined against five Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter sp. P4, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC values were determined for this compound against Candida albicans, which was selected due to its excellent activity against this bacterium [35]. The MIC value for this compound against P. aeruginosa was determined to be 512 µg/mL.

The activity of the flavonoids against P. aeruginosa was evaluated against five different types of bacteria. MIC values were determined for this compound against these five bacteria. The MIC value for this compound against these four bacteria was determined to be 512 µg/mL.

The activity of the flavonoids against P. aeruginosa was evaluated against the strains S. aureus ATCC 27751, Enterococcus sp. ATCC 55460, Enterococcus sp. P4, and S. aureus ATCC 10231. The MIC value for this compound against these four strains was determined to be 64 µg/mL.

The antimicrobial activity of the flavonoids was evaluated against five different kinds of bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, S. aureus ATCC 27751, Enterococcus sp. ATCC 55460, Enterococcus sp.
