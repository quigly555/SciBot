## Abstract
In this study, we used the genome of Mucor circinelloides NRRL 516 to show that Mucor circinelloides is an evolutionarily ancient fungal parasite with a prominent role in fungal pathogenesi. M. circinelloides is a member of three clades comprising highly diverse lineages: M1 (M2), M3 (M1 only), and M2/M1 (M2/M1). M1/M2/M2, a member of M1/M2, and M1/M2 are morphologically and phylogenetically related, are synonymized, and are treated as independent groups. M1/M2/M1 are filamentous fungi that are distributed along the perithecia and in the cytosol, whereas M3 are basidiomycete fungi that are dispersed in the perithecium and are thought to be a separate lineage. Although not shown to be highly invasive on animals, Mucor circinelloides NRRL 516 is clearly shown to form tetrapods and to have a full sexual cycle with its partner. These are sexual properties that, if fully understood, should aid to minimize the environmental impact of its translational effects.

IMPORTANCE The influence of radiation on the behavior of a panel of eight neutrophilic and neutrophilic (SZ) human cancer cell lines is poorly understood. We therefore used the SpengA protein to define the nature and scope of the radiation effects in a neutropenic mouse model of breast cancer. We found that SZ cells exposed to highly elevated doses of radiation (200 Gy or 500 Gy) had reduced expression of the genes for any two or more genes responsible for the regulation of caspase-3 activation and the use of SZ-induced hypoxia. Furthermore, SZ-induced hypoxia did not appear to be affected by the effects of supernatant from untreated controls upon growth under standard laboratory conditions. SZ-induced hypoxia was also independent of the use of deoxycholate treatments. SZ-induced hypoxia did not affect the expression of the genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes involved in energy production, or the initiation of carcinogenesis in a zebrafish model.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an increasing threat to human health and food safety worldwide. Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most common fungal pathogens and causes severe, often fatal allergic reactions that are the cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals (Segal and Foster, 2010; Aamer et al., 2015; Li and Huang, 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). The pathogen is a mold that causes disease in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals, and it is commonly found in the respiratory tract and skin of animals and humans (Di Luca and Sanchez, 2003; Moreno et al., 2013; Van Rensburge et al., 2014). In fact, the prevalence of IFIs in immunocompromised patients ranges from 0.6% to over 3% in Italy (Segal and Foster, 2010).

There are approximately 1 million fungal species and about 500 species of pathogenic fungi worldwide. Currently, there are only a few antifungal drugs available for treatment of IFIs. The available antifungals are synthetic, structural derivatives of the plant antifungal and selective. The treatment of IFIs is associated with their long-term administration, high toxicity and problems associated with the toxicological mechanism of the drug (Rosenquist and Mazzola, 2010; Rizzo et al., 2015).

## Results
cerevisiae is supported by the data from a murine model of . cerevisiae infection [21,22]. For example, the Chinese encephalitis (DEN) model is a direct mimic of the global chytrid model, in which we have used the non-chytrid model to target the p53 and other components of the innate immune system, while using the chytrid model to target the plasma membrane [22]. The use of the Chinese encephalitis model in S. cerevisiae is akin to the global chytrid model in which we have used the non-chytrid model in the P_i_p model of infection, but we have used the chytrid model in the P_i_p model of infection, where we have used the p53 model to target the plasma membrane [22]. Furthermore, we used the murine model of S. cerevisiae infection to target the p53 model of infection, in which we have used the murine model to target the plasma membrane [22].

In this study, we observed that the translational stuffies in H99 and H99-1 were also translocated to the p53 and plasma membrane in the P_i_p model, in contrast to the P_i_p model, in which they were translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1). The translational stuffies in H99-1 were also translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1).

We also found that the translational stuffies in H99-1 were translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1). We also observed that the translational stuffies in H99-1 were translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1).

The translational stuffies in H99-1 were also translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1). However, the translational stuffies in H99-1 were translocated to the plasma membrane in the P_i_p model of infection (Figure 1 and Table S1).


## Discussion
In this work we have developed a large-scale, recombinant genome of the H. capsulatum pathogen. This large-scale genome is completely unique and represents the best genetic tools yet for the research of this pathogen. The genome of H. capsulatum encodes genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, but also genes involved in signaling, biosynthesis of cell wall components, and cell wall components for stress tolerance and virulence. H. capsulatum is a unique pathogen with a genome of unique structure and a genome with two distinct mating types, one type with single haploid cells and the other with haploid cells. We have developed a genome-wide transcriptional profiling program to identify genes that encode genes that are involved in cell wall biosynthesis and stress response, and to identify genes that are essential for adaptation to these conditions.

Genome sequencing and the identification of genes required for cell wall biosynthesis and stress resistance has been a priority for genome sequencing and annotation of genome-wide transcriptional profiling programs [16]. We successfully used two of these two types of profiling tools to identify genes required for the production of cell wall components. We have identified 46 cell wall related genes from the H. capsulatum genome.
