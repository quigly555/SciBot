## Abstract
Inositol is a major constituent of the fungal cell wall, whose structure has been subjected to many different modification processes during evolution. A number of fungal species, especially the saprobes, have undergone genetic and morphological diversification programs to adapt to the varied levels of inositol availability and exert an increased amount of oxidative activity. However, many of these fungi also undergo morphological and metabolic changes. Some of these include: changes in the inositol levels in fungal colonies; alterations in the inositol metabolism of fungal cells; the growth of non-fungal organisms such as fungi; and alterations in the inositol levels of other organisms. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of the inositol biosynthetic mechanisms in the following species: Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pichia guilliermondii, Sordaria macrospora, and Vibrio cholerae.


## Introduction
gattii [15,16,17,18,19. In this report, we describe the biosynthesis of the Biallelic BUB-1 and BUB-2 proteins, which are involved in the intracellular biosynthesis of the biallelic irkU+2P and irkU+2P. They are both substrates for the biosynthesis of both branched and unbranched proteins, which are found in the fungal cell wall. The BUB-1 and BUB-2 proteins are induced in response to environmental stimuli and are collectively known as the ecdb2 and ecdb3 proteins. In addition, they regulate several downstream pathways, e.g., the cell cycle checkpoint, the chaperone system, and the stress response pathway. They are also involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall proteins, which are synthesized as xenosiderophores.

As Cryptococcus gattii is ubiquitous in the environment, it has been estimated that more than 2.5% of the world’s population resides in endemic regions, such as Australia, Canada, and parts of Africa. The most common environmental source of infection in immunocompromised individuals is bird droppings, which is prevalent in the southern and eastern regions of the world, especially in the tropics [20,21,22,23,24,25]. The fungus is divided into two varieties, namely, C. neoformans and C. deneoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is characterized by the production of yeast-like cells that invade the brain tissue and invade the central nervous system, and to cause meningoencephalitis. C. deneoformans is characterized by the production of dark yeast-like cells in vitro and by the production of spores and desiccated yeast cells during cultivation in acidic media [26]. Differences in virulence have been reported, and the difference in the expression levels of the two genotypes is linked to the host immune response [27].

In this study, the role of the BUB-1 and BUB-2 proteins in the synthesis and secretion of biallelic irkU+2P and irkU+2P was investigated.


## Methods
brasiliensis was performed according to the method described by Livak and Oksunde [49] with minor modification. Proteins from a spore suspension of the fungal isolate were added to the agarose discs (2 mm^2) and incubated at 28°C for 24 hours. The fungal material was removed by centrifugation and washed with distilled water. The supernatant was discarded and the cell suspension was precipitated with methanol and was re-suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 and 2 mM DTT and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with sterile distilled water and resuspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mM EDTA and 1% NP-40. The sample was diluted with 10 mM MES (pH 7.5) and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. To visualize the formation of pycnidiospores, the pycnidiospores were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and visualized with an Olympus BX-1 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DMI 6000 digital camera. The spore number was measured by counting the number of spores on the plate and the mean value was expressed as the number of spores in a spore per spore.

For the analysis of the mycelial growth rate of the P. brasiliensis isolate, the mycelium was harvested from a PDA plate and frozen at -20°C, rinsed with ice-cold distilled water, and lyophilized. Total protein was extracted from lyophilized mycelium by using a phenol-chloroform method. The lyophilized mycelium was ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. The lyophilized powder was transferred to a 50 ml microtube and the suspension was poured into a glass tube. The tubes were shaken at 200 rpm for 30 min and the aqueous phase was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min.


## Results
Therefore, the putative potential of these two paralogs in . bassiana is still unknown. The ability of the B. bassiana B. bassiana BRI/BRI-1 to produce biallelic and paralogic BRI-1 and BRI-2 peptides is unclear [19, 20]. The BRI-1 is a paralog of the BRI-2P, which was originally identified as a paralog of the BRI-2P family. However, the BRI-2P is a paralog of the BRI-2P family and was not identified in the BRI-1 family. In addition, the BRI-1 family is a sister group of the BRI-2P family. The BRI-2P peptide family also contains a putative secondary HxxK and HxxL peptide-like protein (Table 1) [21]. In addition, the BRI-1 peptide family also contains a putative BRI-2P-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide (Table 1). The BRI-2P peptide family also contains a putative BRI-2P peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide-like peptide (Table 1).
