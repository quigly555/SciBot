## Abstract
The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of fungal illness in the immunocompromised population. Although this fungus is naturally resistant to multiple antifungal drugs, such as flucytosine and azoles, it is capable of adapting to these drug environments. This adaptation is necessary for its overall virulence. In this study, we show that murine cryptococcal infection is not limited to the presence of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) mutant but is also imposed by the presence of two normal strains, either a normal or a low density one, in a renal transplant recipient (FTL). We also employed a model of cryptococcal infection that included the prior receipt of an experimental antifungal agent to show that the infection of the LDL is not triggered by the host-derived antifungal drug fluconazole. We also show that the host-derived drug inhibits the splenic activity of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the LDL-PKG cascade in the presence of a LDL mutant strain. In addition, the LDL mutant strain is more sensitive to several antifungal drugs and has a higher survival rate when exposed to a fluconazole-resistant, low cost, non-targeted, drug that targets the phosphofructokinase (PFK) of the phosphatase phosphatase D69 in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our work reveals that the LDL is not only a target for FKP phosphatase but is also sensitive to antifungal drugs and contributes to the understanding of pathogenesis and drug resistance in C. neoformans.


## Introduction
 2008; Srikantha et a., 2008). This is in contrast to the situation with other fungi, where drug-induced changes in gene expression are thought to be a useful approach for drug-induced repression of genes. For instance, the C. neoformans fceR mutant exhibits a hyper-susceptible phenotype in a mouse model of systemic cryptococcosis (Hammond et al., 2005; Hammond and Farris, 2007), while the C. gattii fceR mutant exhibits a more severe phenotype in a mouse model of disseminated cryptococcosis (Kaur et al., 2009). This difference in phenotype may be attributed to the C. gattii fceR mutant being hyper-susceptible rather than virulent, although it is still unclear how this difference is due to differences in gene expression.

The importance of the C. gattii fceR mutant as a model of cryptococcosis has been well established, but the molecular mechanism by which this mutant exhibits hyper-susceptibility has not been identified. C. gattii fceR mutants are mostly primarily found in the environment and are mostly associated with saprophytic conditions (Hammond et al., 2005; Hammond and Farris, 2007). In the initial stages of infection, the C. gattii fceR mutant is primarily associated with the central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with environmental conditions such as pigeon droppings, soil, insects, and decaying vegetation (Hammond et al., 2005; Hammond and Farris, 2007). However, in later stages, the C. gattii fceR mutant appears to be more prevalent in the lungs of mice, which is consistent with previous reports suggesting that the lungs are the site of pulmonary infection by the C. gattii fceR mutant (Hammond et al., 2005; Hammond and Farris, 2007). Furthermore, the ability to cause disease by inhaling fungi from the environment is an alternative strategy used by the C. gattii fceR mutant in a clinical setting, as a strategy that leads to disease relapse. Indeed, the ability of C. gattii fceR mutants to cause disease in mice has been previously demonstrated by several clinical strains (Hammond et al., 2005) and a phase 1/phase 2 study revealed that the strain could be recovered by the injection of a drug solution containing a C.


## Methods
Based on the prior work, we have shown that Paracoccidioides sp. are characterized by both a lipid-dependent lipase and a laminin-dependent lipase [51, 53].

In this study, P. brasiliensis has been selected as the primary organism because its main structure is composed of six carbons, the six cysteine residues 2-4, 6-7, 8-9, and 11-12, and the seven carbons 3-4, 6-7, 8-9, 10, 11-12, and 13-14, respectively. The amino acid sequences of P.


## Results
In the rat model, Pectinier Markov Model of Paracoccidioidomycosis was used to evaluate the effect of Pectinier inhibitors on lipid accumulation of the fungus [12. Pectinier Markov Model of Paracoccidioidomycosis was used to evaluate the effects of Pectinier Markov Model on lipid accumulation of a mouse model of Paracoccidioidomycosis. In this study, the Pectinier Markov Model of Paracoccidioidomycosis was used to evaluate the effect of Pectinier Markov Model on lipid accumulation of a mouse model of Paracoccidioidomycosis.

The results of the lipid accumulation assay were compared with the lipid content of the control rat model. In this study, the lipid content of the mouse model of Paracoccidioidomycosis was 4.4%, which was much higher than the control rat model. This finding indicated that the Pectinier Markov Model of Paracoccidioidomycosis has a high effect on the lipid content of the fungus.

## Discussion
[28, 29, 30, 31, 32] and the two hemicelluloses from which these genes are derived [32, 34. In addition, Pectinases from the hemicelluloses of the fungus can also be produced by the fungus in vitro [32]. Therefore, to understand the Pectinase activity of the fungus in vitro, we analyzed the genes encoding the Pectinases Pectin-2 and Pectin-3 in this fungus. The genes encoding Pectin-2 and Pectin-3 were identified in the genome of the plant pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig 1). The homologs of these genes in Paracoccidioides spp. were found to be 4, 16, and 36-fold higher than those of the wild-type fungus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (PBS), and two-fold higher than those of the fungus in Paracoccidioides tibetensis (PBS) (Fig 1). A comparison of these two groups of genes (Fig 1) revealed that the Pectinases Pectin-2 and Pectin-3 could be expressed in P. brasiliensis and in other Paracoccidioides spp. The expression of these genes was detected in Paracoccidioides spp. in vitro [32] and in the fungus in vitro [32].

A single gene encoding the Pectinases Pectin-2 and Pectin-3 was found to be expressed in P. brasiliensis and in P. tibetensis in vitro [32]. The expression of these genes was detected in P. brasiliensis and P. tibetensis in vitro [32]. In addition, two Pectinases were expressed in P. tibetensis in vitro [32]. The expression of these genes was detected in P. brasiliensis and P. tibetensis in vitro [32]. The expression of these genes was detected in P. brasiliensis and P. tibetensis in vitro [32]. This could explain the ability of the fungus to produce a large number of Pectinases in vitro [32]. These genes were also expressed in P.
