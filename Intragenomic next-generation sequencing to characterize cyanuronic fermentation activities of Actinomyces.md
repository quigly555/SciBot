## Abstract
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a leading cause of death in patients with AIDS. IFD is characterized by immune deficiency, such as immunocompromised patients, drug toxicity, drug resistance, or infectious complications, and the availability of tissue biopsy material. The most common and causative agents of IFD are Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans-K0), Candida albicans (C. gattii), and Aspergillus fumigatus (Fusarium). A more in-depth understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for development of IFD is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies to combat this pathogen. Here we investigate the immunomodulatory properties of the giant cell wall of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the interaction between the cells of C. neoformans and the giant mycelia. We reveal that the cells of C. neoformans are capable of inhibiting IFD by an immunosuppressive regimen of four different antibody subsets, and that these have different mechanisms of action. We also show that the cells of Fusarium mycorrhizalum, a fungal pathogen of humans, are strikingly resistant to IFD and are more sensitive than C. albicans to macrophage killing. We provide evidence that IFD is the most prominent immunostimulatory molecule in C. neoformans that contributes to the development of the human fatal opportunistic fungal infection S. cerevisiae.


## Introduction
Cryptococcosis is a disease that affects both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. The prevalence of the disease ranges from 3-25% in patients with no identifiable immunological defect.1-3,4 This disease is usually acquired from environmental contaminated soil. The contaminated soil can be contaminated with soil particles or contaminated water, or contaminated plants or animals. Cryptococcus spp. is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes pulmonary disease, and its lung lesions are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a common complication in patients with AIDS, with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis being the most common cause of death in patients with organ transplantation and cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, which are associated with high mortality rates.5-7 The high mortality rates caused by cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients are largely attributed to the delayed diagnosis and the limited antifungal therapy available.

The detection of Cryptococcus spp. in clinical samples is difficult. Isolation of the organism is required by the organism and can be performed by isolation of the yeast from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or from a sample from a patient with suspected cryptococcal disease. Isolates with a positive cryptococcal culture result in the isolation of yeast from the CSF. Detection of Cryptococcus spp. from clinical specimens is possible, but isolation is usually difficult due to the yeast being small and the growth rate is low. Isolation of Cryptococcus spp. from CSF is difficult. Detection of Cryptococcus spp. from CSF is difficult. Isolate detection of Cryptococcus spp. from CSF is difficult.

There are no studies regarding the identification and susceptibility testing of the isolates of Cryptococcus spp. from CSF, although a strain of Cryptococcus named Cryptococcus ovoides has been isolated from the CSF of HIV-negative patients.


## Methods

The Actinomyces sp. agar was prepared with glucose and acetate, and the agar was autoclaved at 121 °C for 10 min. The agar was adjusted with distilled water to pH 8 and then filtered to remove the residual starch. The slurry was shaken at 160 rpm for 18 h at 25 °C. The slurry was then filtered and concentrated to yield an equal volume of concentrated slurry. The concentrated slurry was then diluted to the desired density of 1.0×10^8 CFU/mL. The diluted slurry was used as a template for assaying the ability of the Actinomyces spp. to produce the L-4, L-6, and L-7 glucuronoxylases and to inhibit the L-5, L-6, and L-7 malondialdehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities.

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)
The NTA (Malaysia) was performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking System (NTA) version 1.0 (Malaysia).

The NTA is an automatic method for analyzing the formation of NTA due to the difference in temperature and temperature coefficients of the NTA. The initial time of the reaction is repeated for a duration of 0.5 min and the temperature and temperature coefficients are measured every 0.5 s, after which the samples are separated and analyzed in a final volume of 1 mL and the concentration of the NTA is calculated. The temperature coefficient is calculated using the following formula:

Time-dependent (TDE) measurements were performed on NTA-generated images for 30 min using a temperature controller (Malaysia) in a temperature range of 30-400 °C, with a cutoff of 50 °C. The experiments were performed at three different experimental conditions: (1) an initial temperature of 30 °C, (2) an initial temperature of 200 °C, and (3) a temperature of 300 °C.

## Discussion
This will be the first to report on the results of this stud.

The ability to grow and produce biofilms on solid agar is a unique trait for this species. C. lusitaniae has been used for the cultivation of biofilms on solid-based agar [10,12,22,24], however, its ability to grow on biofilms and biofilm structures is not yet documented. Based on our results, we propose to treat C. lusitaniae as a biotrophic species, based on its ability to grow and produce biofilms on solid-based agar.

Cyanuronic fermentation is a phenomenon known as “dry fermentation” that consists of aerobic fermentation of yeast sugars and other nutrients. It is often associated with the production of volatile compounds that are produced by other yeasts in the fermentation process. In this study, we demonstrated that the ability of C. lusitaniae to produce volatile compounds and other volatile compounds was dependent on its growth condition. Additionally, C. lusitaniae exhibited the highest production of volatile compounds, ethanol and acetone, as well as the highest production of other volatile substances. However, the other C. lusitaniae strains were able to produce volatile substances, such as, acetone, ethanol and aceturonic acid. A previous study reported that C. lusitaniae could produce a large number of volatile substances [25].

The fermentation process of C. lusitaniae was characterized by the production of volatile substances. However, these volatile substances could not be distinguished using chemical-based methods. On the other hand, the fermentation process of C. lusitaniae was characterized by the production of volatile substances. The production of volatile substances, such as, ethanol and acetone, was very efficient. The fermentation process of C. lusitaniae was not efficient, but other volatile substances were produced. It is reported that the formation of volatile substances by the yeast species is relatively rapid compared to other yeasts, such as C. albicans and C. neoformans [26]. These results indicated that the C. lusitaniae strain may be a reliable strain for the production of volatile substances. However, the fermentation process of C. lusitaniae was very efficient and the other C. lusitaniae strains were not able to produce volatile substances.
