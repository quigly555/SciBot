## Introduction
The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic but were concerned about the ethical issues of the pape. In the Reviewer letter, the reviewers’ comments were read and discussed. The Reviewing editor and I were then asked to minimum hit the minimal harm policy for this journal. The reviewer’s concern was well taken and the paper should be re-edited. I believe the reviewers’ comments were read and discussed.

The reviewers concerned about the ethics of the paper are concerned about the publication of a biased and out-of-date study that should be left at the journal level. In the Reviewer letter, the reviewers discussed the comments, which are to be addressed. In the Discussion, the reviewers also mentioned that the authors should not rely only on their own data, but should consider the experiences of others who have independently evaluated this work and add their own insights to the paper.

I am a bit concerned about the ethical issues. There were two reviews that thought that the authors should not do an ethical investigation and should be investigated carefully. The Reviewers’ comments were read and discussed. The reviewers are concerned about the ethical issues, and should be concerned about the ethical issues of the paper. In the Reviewer letter, the reviewers discussed the comments, which are to be addressed. In the Discussion, the reviewers discussed the comments, which are to be addressed. The reviewers also mentioned that the paper should be re-edited.

The authors have written to the editor to suggest a possible move to ethics. Please elaborate and explain the rationale for that consideration.

The manuscript is well written and all the experiments and results are clear and understandable. However, the statistical analysis is lacking and the discussion that needs to be included in the manuscript is lacking.

I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

The manuscript is well written and all the experiments and results are clear and understandable. However, the statistical analysis is lacking and the discussion that needs to be included in the manuscript is lacking.

The authors should consider including more controls in the statistical analysis because the manuscript could use a more open-ended approach.

Reviewer #1:

The manuscript is well written, and the experiments and results are clear and understandable.


## Methods
Each of these activities are also conducted with the reference date and current location and date of stud. For each of these studies, participants signed a statement that they were an informed consented participant.

Data Source and Data Collection
In this study, we used a dataset of data from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) from which this study was registered. This IRB, consisting of 15 accredited, non-profit clinical research centers, is a registered office of the FDA. The IRB and its member institutions are not responsible for the privacy of patients or the conduct of the studies. The IRB's main purpose is to identify the clinical characteristics of patients who are affected by HIV/AIDS and/or who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, and to provide information on the HIV status of the population, and on the management of the patients. The IRB has access to data from all individuals enrolled in the study. The IRB has access to all the relevant data such as demographics, symptoms, physical signs and symptoms, medications, and laboratory tests. The IRB also checks and analyzes all the data of the patients. The data of the patients are collected on a regular basis. The study was approved by the IRB’s institutional review board (IRB).

Data Collection
Data collection was conducted through electronic health records (HRS) as previously described [13]. Briefly, a diagnosis of HIV infection was made by a positive India ink test (Figure 1) or an immunophenotypic test for HIV by a positive India ink test (Figure 2). The diagnosis of HIV infection was made by the presence of visible AIDS symptoms on the diagnostic microbiology test and by the presence of an HIV antibody test. The diagnosis of Candida infection was made by positive India ink test (Figure 3) and by the positive India ink test (Figure 4). The diagnosis of Candida carinii infection was made by positive India ink test (Figure 5). The diagnosis of Aspergillus infection was made by positive India ink test (Figure 6). The diagnosis of Candida metapsilosis was made by positive India ink test (Figure 7). The diagnosis of Cryptococcus infection was made by positive India ink test (Figure 8). The diagnosis of Histoplasma infection was made by positive India ink test (Figure 9).

To calculate the taxonomy of the country, we used taxonomic distance from the nearest neighbor with ITS1 and ITS2 sequence data. In the future, we will work to derive taxonomy on the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences. Based on the data from the previous two publications, taxonomy of the country was defined based on the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences.

Taxonomy of the country
The country is represented by a series of small islands, located on different parts of the island. They are located on different continents, which are often geographically separated. The country has been recorded as a refuge for hundreds of years, and a refuge for millions of years. The country is densely populated with people living in the localities.

Taxonomy of the country
The country was represented by five islands with different ranges.

Taxonomy of the country
The island of Manandu lies in the subtropical region of the South China Sea. This region is close to the coast of the Indian Ocean and has been reported as a refuge of thousands of years. It is the only place on Earth in the world where human activities are carried out. The island is surrounded by islands with different ranges of vegetation. There are no reports of human activities in this region. The island also has the highest altitude (16,000 m) and the highest latitude (30,000 m). The island is a refuge of thousands of years and is believed to be the highest altitude in the world.

Taxonomy of the island
The island of Manandu lies in the subtropical region of the South China Sea. This region is close to the coast of the Indian Ocean and is known as the Desert of Manandu. The island is surrounded by islands with different ranges of vegetation. There are no reports of human activities in this region. The island also has the highest altitude (16,000 m) and the highest latitude (30,000 m). The island is a refuge of thousands of years and is believed to be the highest altitude in the world.
