## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous human pathogen that can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals.


## Introduction
Many species of fungi are dimorphic and exhibit a wide range of morphological transitions (Hawksworth et al. 1999, 2012). They are found in a wide variety of environmental conditions including on dead plant material, decaying plant material, soil, and indoor air (Cooper & Wingfield 2001). Dimorphic fungi have a diverse life cycle including both budding and maturation processes (Hawksworth & Wingfield 2001). These morphological transitions are initiated by the cell wall remodeling and eventually physical transitions such as conidiophore development (Hawksworth et al. 1999). Once established in the host it can spread to other parts of the plant, including trichoderms and medulloblastosis trichomonads (Hawksworth et al. 1999, 2002). For example, dimorphic fungi can switch between the budding and the filamentous states in response to changing environmental conditions such as changing nutrient sources, temperature, and osmotic stress (Büttner et al. 1998).

The morphological transitions observed in dimorphic fungi are governed by several signal transduction pathways, including the cyclic adenosine 3',5' adenine dinucleotide (CADH) kinase (CDK), adenylyl cyclase, and adenylobotrytase (ADH) (Klingau et al. 2000).


## Methods
.


## Results
%) had SRED, and eight patients (.9%) had no SRED. Three patients had SRED and one had no SRED, with a dose of 75 µg/ml. The clinical and demographic information of the patients in each group are presented in Table 2. In addition, the results of the independent analyses are presented in Table 3.

Comparison of Microbiome and Microbiome-based Clinical and Hospital Characteristics
The microbial community profiles of the patients with hypogonadism are presented in Table 4. The communities in the first group were dominated by B. subtilis, a pathogen that was common in Hypogonadism patients and that was also detected in one or more patients with SRED. In the second group, the microbiomes in the patients with hypogonadism were dominated by S. aureus, a pathogen that was common in Hypogonadism patients and that was also detected in one or more patients with SRED.

A total of 488,939,938,918 and 477,746,924, respectively, were identified as being associated with hypogonadism in the first group, and 310,917,958, respectively, were identified as being associated with hypogonadism in the second group. The total number of identified pathogens in the first and second groups were 294,865, and 313,636, respectively, and the number of identified pathogens in the first group was 205,451.

The microbiome of the patients with hypogonadism was dominated by the microorganisms involved in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages. In the first group, 497,836,744, and 2,024,843, respectively, were identified as having a microorganism associated with the first group, and a total of 6,821,948, and 1,979,466, respectively, were identified as having a microorganism associated with the second group.

In the second group, the numbers of identified pathogens in the first group were 131,946, and 2,956, respectively, were identified as having a microorganism associated with the second group.


## Discussion
This suggests that the disease burden in the community of hypogonadism patients is higher than in healthy individual. The study of fungi in hypogonadism patients has been published in one study [4], and a number of studies reported that the proportion of fungi in the community is lower than the proportion in healthy individuals. However, we did not find a significant difference in fungal community in the community of patients with hypogonadism, suggesting that fungal communities in the community of hypogonadism patients are not significantly different.

Microbiome in Hypogonadism Patients
The most abundant genera found in the current study were Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Penicillium. The genera Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Penicillium are among the most abundant genera in hypersaline environments [13], and the fungal communities were generally dominated by the genera Alternaria and Penicillium [18]. Penicillium, on the other hand, is a common genus in hypersaline environments [19]. In our study, Penicillium was present in all patients, but it was absent in patients with hypogonadism. The prevalence of Penicillium in the community of hypogonadism patients was higher than the prevalence in healthy individuals. The prevalence of Penicillium in patients with hypersaline skin lesions was higher than the prevalence in healthy individuals. It is interesting to note that the proportion of Penicillium was higher in patients with hypogonadism. These results suggest that the prevalence of Penicillium in hypogonadism patients is higher than that in healthy individuals. The finding of Penicillium in patients with hypogonadism may be associated with the fungal colonization by fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Penicillium species were also reported to be more abundant in hypersaline environments [20]. Therefore, these results suggest that fungal communities in the community of hypogonadism patients are more diverse than the fungal communities in healthy individuals.
