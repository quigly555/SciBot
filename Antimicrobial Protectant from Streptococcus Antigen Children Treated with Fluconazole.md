## Abstract
The human microbiome is composed of thousands of microbial species, many of which are beneficial human health interventions. In this context, the present review discusses how the different members of the microbiome contribute to health and disease outcomes in different parts of the world. This review also discusses how the different members of the microbiome contribute to the different types of healthcare settings. We focus on how the different members of the microbiome contribute to health, while acknowledging that other aspects of the human health systems also have distinct mechanisms by which they contribute to this. We also discuss how the different types of healthcare settings might benefit from the innovations in next-generation therapeutics to which the microbiome members may contribute.


## Introduction
Pathogenic fungal infections can be classified into histopathologic, infectious, inflammatory, and necrotic forms (1-3). A review of the literature suggests that most histopathologic forms of mycobacterial infections are not caused by fungi but rather by viruses, bacteria, or fungiic symbionts (4-6). Mycobacterial infections are considered to be “host-driven” because they are not caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi but rather by “virulent” organisms. Virulent organisms are thought to be the principal cause of the infections caused by pathogenic fungi such as Histoplasmosis, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans (7).

Histoplasmosis is a complex disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in the lung and subcutaneous tissue, with dissemination from the lung into the blood stream, often resulting in serious central nervous system (CNS) and pulmonary complications. It is a common respiratory infection, occurring most commonly in immunocompromised patients, including those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

In the past two decades, numerous studies have investigated the incidence of histoplasmosis and its clinical manifestations. However, most of these studies used animal models to evaluate the infection process and the pathogenesis of histoplasmosis. The major histopathological manifestations include infiltrative lesions on bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural effusions, as well as abscesses and pulmonary nodules.

Culture is the gold standard for histopathological investigation of invasive fungal infections. In this study, we report the first case of histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma in a Japanese patient.


## Methods
15%) in the Treatment of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (P8-MIC) by MIC test (P8-MIC) in the MIC test (pH .0) (Liu et al. 2007). The MIC for C. albicans was defined as the lowest concentration of the drug that inhibits growth of the organism in the absence of resistance.

Laboratory testing of antibacterial activity
The MICs of the various antibiotics used were based on a 96-well microtiter plate assay (MIC) [34]. The antifungal activities of the various antibiotics were evaluated in a 96-well microtiter plate assay (MIC) using the concentration of the test agent in a final volume of 1 mL of RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% glucose. The microtiter plate was incubated for 24 h at 37°C with agitation. The lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibited growth was considered as the lowest concentration of the test agent that did not inhibit growth of the organism. The antifungal activity of the tested agents against C. albicans was compared with that of the control group (without antibiotics).

The bacterial culture of the isolated samples was performed on agar slants prepared by inoculating with 2 mL of sterile distilled water and washing with sterile 0.85% NaCl. The slants were then placed on a slide and sealed with Parafilm (NEO, Germany) and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The growth of the microorganism was considered the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibited the growth of the organism. The microbial culture of the isolates was performed on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates by incubation at 37°C and 30°C for 48 h. The fungi were counted using a hemocytometer and the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibited growth of the fungus was considered the lowest concentration that did not inhibit growth of the organism. The MIC of the tested antibiotics was determined using a 96-well microtiter plate assay (MIC). The antifungal activity of the tested antibiotics was evaluated in a 96-well microtiter plate assay (MIC) using the concentration of the test agent in a final volume of 1 mL of RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% glucose.


## Results
Among patients with candidiasis, only fluconazole was found to be effective against 32 patients (49%. Compared with fluconazole, fluconazole was more efficacious against 5/10 (19%) patients (26.5%) with penicilliosis, 7/12 (21%) patients (26.5%) with lupus, and 1/6 (1.5%) patients (2.5%) with bloodstream infection. In addition, fluconazole was more efficacious against 4/11 (15.5%) patients (10.5%) with penicilliosis, 3/6 (4.5%) patients (4.5%) with lupus, and 1/5 (1.5%) patients (1.5%) with bloodstream infection. For Listeriosis, fluconazole was more efficacious against 5/11 (21.6%) patients (16.7%) with penicilliosis, 7/12 (21.6%) patients (25.1%) with lupus, and 1/6 (1.5%) patients (1.5%) with bloodstream infection. For disseminated infection, fluconazole was more efficacious against 13/23 (28.2%) patients (21.5%) with lupus, 5/16 (24.7%) patients (22.6%) with bloodstream infection, and 1/6 (1.5%) patients (1.5%) with bloodstream infection.

In the present study, the efficacy of fluconazole against Listeriosis and disseminated infection was found to be significant (P < 0.05). The highest percentage of patients with disseminated infection were found in the group of patients with lupus (44.7%) and bloodstream infection (47.6%) (Table 5). In addition, patients with disseminated infection were more likely to be on fluconazole-containing PBS than those with lupus (54.1%) and bloodstream infection (41.4%) (Table 5).


## Discussion
C. neoformans is a ubiquitous opportunistic yeast causing opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported to cause invasive cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS [17], [18], and in a number of cases it has also been identified as a causative agent of cryptococcosis [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
