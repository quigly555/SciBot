## Abstract
Candida species are an important and growing group in Candida species and the fungal community in the healthy and immunocompromised patients has evolved according to their immunodeficiency status, age, gender, sexual identity and pathogenesis. Candida albicans and C. glabrata are the most commonly isolated Candida species from healthy individuals and the majority of the cases reported. However, C. glabrata is the one with the highest risk of invasive candidiasis. The genetic makeup of the C. glabrata population is largely unknown. This study investigated the population structure of C. glabrata in three main populations using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. The MLST identified two putative clades (other C. glabrata, var. glabrata and C. auris) and two clades (VGI and VGI). The VGI comprised genetic diversity of > 95% in five isolates, with the other clade comprising > 95% in one isolate. Phenotypic diversity was assessed by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and 28S rRNA gene (rrs), and phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian evolutionary analysis. The VGI comprised both C. glabrata and the VGI in all examined Candida species. The rrs grouping showed that C. glabrata was a monophyletic group and the other two clades did not statistically cluster with any other Candida species. The dominant C. glabrata genotypes were VGI and VGI in all examined species. The two major lineages in C. auris were identified as C. glabrata and C. auris. The majority of isolates recovered belonged to VGI, but the other C. glabrata and VGI lineages were not identified. This study provides the initial characterization of the C. glabrata population, which may facilitate the development of new antifungal agents.


## Introduction
Fungi are of great significance as producers of bioactive compounds that have wide applications, such as drugs, vaccines, and bioactive products. In recent decades, fungi have been known to produce several different bioactive compounds. Among them, carotenoids, carotene and pyrrolnitrols are the most common bioactive compounds, which have been isolated from fungi, such as C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, and other mushrooms, and from many other fungi, including the plant pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and several fruit and fruit-associated fungi. These bioactive compounds can be divided into four main categories, namely, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alcohols. Conventional chemical identification systems have been developed, and these classification has been modified to recognize fungi in three classes: black yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and other fungi. In the last years, the molecular identification system (MID) was developed and used to study the various molecular processes that are involved in the biogenesis of bioactive compounds [1]. In the last years, the application of molecular biological methods to the identification of fungi has gained increased attention. In the last few years, molecular methods have been successfully applied to the identification of fungi in several systems [2]. Molecular identification techniques include PCR amplification, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), melt extrusion, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme immuno-electrophoresis (EIS), and gapdh (also known as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) [3]. These methods have allowed the identification of several biologically active compounds, including a wide range of fungal compounds and metabolites [4-7].


## Methods
We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of antigen therapy on the outcome. The analysis was conducted using the Chi-square test, and the odds ratios (OR) were compared between the treatment groups. We estimated the risk of mortality after antigens therapy using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model, which were used to describe the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antigens (IPs), interferon-<U+03B7> (IFN-<U+03B7>) and neomycin (NE) treatments. We evaluated the impact of antigens therapy on mortality after treatment with IFN-<U+03B7> (IFN-<U+03B7>) and neomycin (NE) treatments. For the RCTs, we examined the relationship between treatment with IFN-<U+03B7> and mortality after treatment with IFN-<U+03B7>.

## Results
cruzi-toxin-mediated improvement in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CDL) who are receiving cyclophosphamide (cAMP) and . cruzi toxin (T. cruzi toxin), is effective in reducing the risk of IRIS.

Treatment with T. cruzi toxin was established as the most effective therapy during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Two patients with IRIS were excluded from this study and were subsequently compared with the control group. IRIS was a significant risk factor for IRIS with a risk ratio of 1.40; the IRIS-adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 3.17 (95%CI 1.14-9.14) and the AOR was 3.23 (95%CI 1.19-7.96) after adjustment for baseline CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and baseline CD4+ lymphocyte counts.

To evaluate the effectiveness of T. cruzi toxin in reducing IRIS in patients with IRIS, we treated patients with T. cruzi toxin and subsequently evaluated their morbidity and mortality. The AOR was 3.46 (95%CI 1.09-6.89), with a risk ratio of 1.44 (95%CI 1.06-6.89). Compared with the control group, the IRIS-adjusted AOR was 1.11 (95%CI 1.06-4.90) and the AOR was 2.94 (95%CI 1.13-5.10). Patients with IRIS were more likely to be alive at the end of the study period, with a risk ratio of 0.79 (95%CI 0.56-4.91). AORs for IRIS were 1.59 (95%CI 0.70-6.82), 1.05 (95%CI 0.89-3.85) and 1.00 (95%CI 0.82-5.85) after adjustment for baseline CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and baseline CD4+ lymphocyte counts.

A similar trend was observed for the AOR for the entire study period, with a risk ratio of 0.55 (95%CI 0.46-2.89) after adjustment for baseline CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and baseline CD4+ lymphocyte counts.


## Discussion
However, it is important to note that, although the results of the present study have demonstrated that IL-10 plays a protective role in the management of . gondii infection, other mediators, such as immunoglobulin (IgG) and PAS, which are the most common mediators in HIV-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis, have not been identified in the present study. The interplay of IL-10 and IL-13 is likely to be a major factor in the management of P. gondii infection in this patient.

In this study, the clinical and radiological characteristics of the patient were documented, and the results of the current study were confirmed to be accurate. The patient’s pulmonary manifestations included symptoms of cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, sputum, weight loss, and hemoptysis, all of which are consistent with the presentation of pulmonary cryptococcosis in the present study. The patient’s clinical presentation was also documented. The patient’s condition was also documented to be low in quality, and a majority of the patients did not show any chest pain. This low-quality presentation of pulmonary cryptococcosis in the present study may be attributed to the fact that pulmonary cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients is a rare disease and most of the patients are immunocompromised. In contrast, patients in HIV-infected patients are more likely to have chronic symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, and shortness of breath, which are not typical of pulmonary cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients.

The present study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective study, and the study population was not representative of all patients with HIV-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis. The study population was geographically small, and we could not determine the exact geographic location of the patient. Second, the study was conducted among patients with HIV-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis, and the results may not be generalizable to other populations. However, the present study has a larger sample size than other studies that have reported geographic differences in cryptococcosis. Third, although our study has been performed in a relatively large cohort, the patients’ presentation and radiological characteristics in the present study may not be generalizable to other patients with HIV-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis.
