## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is common in immunocompromised patients, and can be diagnosed by lung biopsy.

We evaluated the accuracy of a polymerase chain reaction-based lateral flow assay (LFA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis in adult patients with severe immunodeficiency, and the ability of this assay to distinguish non-small cell lung organisms (NSWBCs).

Twenty-one patients with severe immunodeficiency, who had not received immunosuppressive therapy during follow-up, were evaluated by the LFA. Lungs, sputum, and samples were subjected to LFA, and clinical and microbiological characteristics were evaluated.

The results indicated that the LFA was accurate in discriminating P. brasiliensis from other non-small cell lung organisms (NSWBCs). However, the accuracy of the LFA in discriminating P. brasiliensis was lower than that of the standard serology serology test. In the detection of NSWBCs, the sensitivity and specificity of the LFA were 93.9%, and 100%, for the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis, respectively. The LFA could distinguish NSWBCs in the detection of the acid fast bacilli test.

The LFA is a sensitive and specific test that may be used in the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with severe immunodeficiencies, such as severe immunodeficiency. The LFA may be useful for the routine diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with severe immunodeficiencies.

10. In the Discussion, the following points should be mentioned:

(1) The authors should discuss how the antimicrobial stewardship role was established in the 1970s. The authors should discuss how the authors can change their title.

(2) The authors should comment on Figure 2, which is an underestimate. It might have been better to have Figure 2.

(3) The authors should comment on Figure 4, which is an overestimate. Figure 4 shows that Figure 4 is not statistically significant.

(4) The authors should comment on the Results: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/? term=PLUS_Results

(5) The authors should comment on Figure 5. It is not possible to see how the figure shows.

(6) The authors should comment on the Discussion: https://www.theclin.org/sub_sections/microbial-epidemiology-and-microbial-epidemiology-have-an-important-sense-in-proceedings/microbial-epidemiology-and-microbial-epidemiology-2013).

(7) The authors should comment on Figure 3. The authors should not use the abbreviation "as" in the Discussion.

(8) The Figure 4 should be changed to "Figure 4C.".

(9) The discussion section needs to discuss the neglected disease and antibacterial stewardship role. The authors should discuss the role of antibacterial stewardship in the neglected tropical disease (NTD).

10. In the Materials and methods section, the following errors should be corrected:

a) in the number of references, the authors should use the abbreviation "as" in the Abstract and Introduction.

b) In the Abstract and Introduction, the word antibiotic should be "bacterium" and "epidemic" in the NTD.

c) The word "epidemic" should be "epidemic" in the NTD.

d) The word "epidemic" should be "epimastigote" in the NTD.

4.2. Microorganism and Culture Conditions
The fungus isolates, which were obtained from our laboratory, were used for further analysis. The clinical isolate was collected from a patient undergoing treatment with a systemic infection of the skin. The clinical isolate was cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) and the culture was maintained at 4 °C for 48 h. After incubation, the mycelia were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 000 g for 5 min) and washed twice with distilled water. The mycelium was extracted with 1 M HCl (10 000 g for 10 min) for 2 h. The mycelium was dried on a rotator and then washed twice with distilled water. The dried mycelium was stored at -20 °C.

4.2. Microorganism and Culture Conditions
A. fumigatus strain Af293 (accession number Mfs.00000000) was used as a host strain for the experiment. A. fumigatus strain Af293 was cultivated in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium at 30 °C with agitation (150 rpm) for 14 days. The mycelium was harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 000 g, for 10 min) and washed twice with distilled water. The mycelium was dissolved with distilled water and resuspended in 1 M NaOH (pH 8.0). After shaking at 100 rpm for 2 h, the suspension was filtered through a 0.45 µm pore-size filter (Pall, NY, USA) and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The mycelium was dissolved with distilled water and resuspended in 1 M NaOH (pH 8.0). The suspension was filtered through a 0.45 µm pore-size filter (Pall, NY, USA) and resuspended in 1 M NaOH (pH 8.0). The mycelium was dissolved with distilled water and resuspended in 1 M NaOH (pH 8.0).


## Results
The Medicinal Products Regulatory Agency (PCRA) is composed of 21 members that are united by 437 member. All members are FDA-approved agents with active ingredients and/or mechanisms of action. The CDA is responsible for the management of drugs to treat diseases and prevent adverse effects.

The CDA was established in 1999 and it is composed of 35 members. Members have been on the CDA since 1982 and have been trained as physicians, pharmacologists and nurses. Members have demonstrated high patient safety, efficacy and safety. The CDA is generally regarded as a regulatory body and has been used to monitor antifungal drug activity, to prevent the development of candidiasis and to evaluate the effectiveness of antifungal therapy. The CDA is also used to promote research on the development of new agents that will be useful for the treatment of serious infections in humans.

The CDA is based on the principles of drug-tolerance, co-application of antifungal agents and the reduction of side effects. It is also responsible for regulating the use of antifungal drugs. The CDA is regulated by the B. dermatitidis B. dermatitidis Act (BDA) of 1978 and the B. dermatitidis Act of 1997. The B. dermatitidis Act regulates the use of antifungal drugs in B. dermatitidis. The BDA is composed of six members and the BDA is regulated by the BDA Act of 1978. The BDA is composed of three members and is composed of two members. The BDA is composed of two members and is composed of one member. The BDA is composed of five members and is composed of one member. The BDA is composed of two members and is composed of one member. The BDA is composed of seven members and is composed of one member. The BDA is composed of four members and is composed of one member.

The FDA's Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) is established to recommend the use of B. dermatitidis for treatment of clinical and laboratory diseases.


## Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of cryptococcosis in HIV patients in Botswana. Our results confirmed the presence of cryptococcal infection in both sexes and showed that males were more susceptible to infection than females. This difference could be due to the age difference of HIV-infected men and females. However, the frequency of cryptococcosis was not significantly different among the age groups. The gender difference could be related to the difference in immune function of the two HIV populations. The different immune function of males and females could be due to different viral load in both populations. The results of the present study showed that males were more susceptible to infection and females were more susceptible to infection.

The prevalence of cryptococcosis in HIV patients was lower in females than males. The reasons for this could be due to the fact that females tend to have higher BMI, which is not healthy, and thus are more prone to disease. In addition, the sex-determining factors such as age, gender, and the sex-determining factors, such as age, were not different in females.

The prevalence of cryptococcosis in HIV patients in Botswana is lower than in adults. This difference could be due to the difference in the immune system in males and females.

Cryptococcal disease is a skin disease caused by C neoformans, C gattii, and C neoformans.
