## Abstract
The use of antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can lead to breakthrough tuberculosis (TB) disease. However, despite its benefits, TBM is an important complication in patients living with HIV (PLWH) and has very low mortality. Understanding the role of TBM in PLWH is important not only for the management of this fatal complication of HIV-associated TBM but also for the clinical management of TB in PLWH.


## Introduction
Arythromyces dermatitidis is an ascomycete (teleomorph: Janus dermatitosis) that causes chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis (CVC) in domestic catfish (Sutton 1980, 1984; Boekhout et al. 1992; Gold and Mims 1990; Boekhout et al. 1998; Rozen et al. 2001; Pfaller et al. 2006).


## Methods
Patients and design
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the American Society for Clinical Laboratory [15]. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were treated with fluconazole (FLC) in the clinical setting. In brief, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who were treated with the FLC group and the non-FLC group, as well as all those patients treated with the other group. The first cohort consisted of the patients with proven or probable IA from the other group and the patients with proven or probable IA from the FLC group. The latter cohort consisted of the patients with proven or probable IA from the other group. We assessed all patients with proven or probable IA using the ICD-10 criteria for IA [16]. The ICD-10 criteria for IA [17] were used for the evaluation of the safety of the FLC group. The safety of the non-FLC group was also evaluated using the criteria of IA [18]. In our cohort, the only patients who were not treated with the FLC group were those who were seen by the medical team who had not received any treatment with the other group.


## Results
In vivo susceptibility testing and pathogenicity
The effect of the previously described combination of LPS, PDI, and anti-LPS on the virulence of C. albicans was determined in a murine model of invasive candidiasis (Figure 1). No statistically significant differences were observed in the pathogenicity of LPS alone or in the combination of LPS or PDI with anti-LPS (p = 0.33) and compared to the virulence of the control group (Figure 2). In contrast, LPS significantly reduced the growth of C. albicans in the systemic circulation in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.002) (Figure 3). In the model, LPS and PDI are used alone, whereas LPS and anti-LPS were used together (Figure 3).

In addition, the results of the pathogenicity test (Figure 1) showed that LPS alone could inhibit the growth of C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., i.e., in a dose-dependent manner, when compared to the growth of the control group, and not when combined with PDI (Figure 1). The pathogenicity of LPS alone or in combination with anti-LPS was significantly different from the virulence of the control group. The only significant differences in the virulence of the groups were observed in the groups treated with LPS alone and the combination of LPS with anti-LPS (p = 0.099 and p = 0.011, respectively). The result of the pathogenicity test (Figure 4) showed that LPS alone could also inhibit the growth of C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.003), i.e., in a dose-dependent manner, when compared to the growth of the control group, and not when combined with PDI (Figure 4).

## Discussion
Molecular phylogenetic analyses of fungal, bacterial and archaeal species support the hypothesis that the fungi of this order are phylogenetically distinct from the bacterial species, especially the phylum Proteobacteria, and that the fungi represent an independent group from that of the other phyla. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, LSU, TEF1 and RPB2 rDNA regions and the ITS sequence data from Proteobacteria support the hypothesis that the fungi are distinct from the bacterial species, and that the fungi represent a separate taxonomic entity.

Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the order Sphingobium and the order Eurotiomycetes constitute two distinct groups. Sphingobium and Eurotiomycetes are, in some ways, the two most distant bacterial phyla from Sordariomycetes and the two most distant taxonomic groups from other orders. Sphingobium is the only genus with which we have found multiple species from the two classes.
