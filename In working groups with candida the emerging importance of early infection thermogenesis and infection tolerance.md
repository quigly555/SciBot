## Abstract
The white rot fungus, Xylodon vogishioides, has been used as a Chinese traditional medicine for diseases such as liver diseases, glanders, as well as meningitis and arthritis for thousands of years. Recently, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the X. vogishioides species complex has opened up a gap in the knowledge of the biological effects of this Chinese herbal medicine. In this study, we used comparative proteomics to compare the proteome of X. vogishioides strains isolated from different tissues in various tissues and tissues with or without rapamycin (US) treatment to predict differentially the protein profiles of X. vogishioides proteins.

X. vogishioides strains from different tissues from the kidney to the bone marrow produced differentially the proteins in the kidneys. The protein profiles in the bone marrow were compared with those of the kidney taken from the same adult. Protein N-terminal processing in the bone marrow was determined by comparing the proteomes of X. vogishioides and X. lymphocarpa. A comparison of the protein profiles of X. vogishioides with the T-helperboxy of the two species was also made.

X. vogishioides had a higher abundance of proteins involved in T-cell activation compared with X. lymphocarpa, whereas the percentage of proteins involved in T-cell activation was higher in X. vogishioides than in X. lymphocarpa. A significant difference in the abundance of proteins involved in T-cell activation was found between the X. vogishioides strains and X. lymphocarpa, while the T-cell was significantly less stimulated in the X. vogishioides strains.

Our results indicated that X. vogishioides is a potential source of proteins involved in T-cell activation in the X. vogishioides species complex. This work suggests that X. vogishioides is a source of protein that could be useful in the treatment of various diseases and conditions such as glanders, glanders-related arthritis, glanders-related arthritis, periodontal disease and osteoarticular disease.


## Introduction
The human body's microbiome is inhabited by diverse microorganisms with diverse physiological and immune functions (1). The broad-range of commensal microorganisms, which include both commensal and pathogenic bacteria, is of major interest because of their health benefits and also because of their potential risks. The commensal microbiome is characterized by the high levels of nutrient absorption, such as from food, water, and other environmental sources, and the presence of cells with altered physiology, such as increased expression of virulence factors (2), and the presence of toxins and pathogenesis-related genes (3). The pathogenic fungi, including C. albicans and C. glabrata, can cause chronic infections of the oral and vaginal tracts, and the associated mycobiome, such as the gut mycobiome, can be found in the gastro-intestinal tract (4). In addition, the colonization of humans and animals can be complicated by the aggregation of other microbes, which may also be of interest as they can be present in the bloodstream and contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases (5). The intestinal mycobiome is composed of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and their association with other microbes can be complicated. In fact, the fungal mycobiome is now well-known to be associated with a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, asthma, and allergic airway hyperresponsiveness (6, 7).

Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment and are present in the intestine, spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (8). It is also known that the fungal mycobiome is present in different body sites (9), which results in an increased susceptibility to several types of infections, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gastrointestinal staphylococci (GIst), and mucormycosis (SMC).


## Methods
. albicans (ATCC 90018) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were used as the outgroup. The C. albicans (ATCC 90018) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were also used as the outgroup. In addition, the Candida albicans (ATCC 90018) and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were also used as the outgroup.

In order to evaluate the influence of the pathogen and the host disease on the evolution of C. albicans, we tested whether the pathogen was changed in C. albicans. In this regard, we used four species: C. glabrata (ATCC 90028), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), C. krusei (ATCC 6258) and C. tropicalis (ATCC 90018).

In order to evaluate the influence of the pathogen and the host disease on the evolution of C. glabrata, we used five species: C. glabrata (ATCC 90028), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258).

Since C. glabrata has been used as an indicator species for clinical disease development of C. albicans, we tested the impact of the pathogen on the pathogen development of C. parapsilosis. C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were used as the outgroup. The C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were also used as the outgroup. C. krusei (ATCC 90018) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258) were used as the outgroup.

In order to evaluate the influence of the pathogen and the host disease on the evolution of C. parapsilosis, we used five species: C. glabrata (ATCC 90028), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), C. tropicalis (ATCC 90018) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258).

In this regard, we also used five species: C.


## Results
The bioinformatic tools and the online tool were used to extract the total bioinformatic data for the Bayesian analysis of the EAF dataset. The data were processed as described in the Methods section. The resulting datasets are represented by EAF, and the data are available in a public repository available at the following: http://bitbucket.org/stevebert/zeitlin/index.

The dataset was assembled into 16,848,928 contigs. The average number of contigs per contig is 11,225. Of these, 3,559 were represented by single contigs (1,623 contigs) and 542 by all contigs (1,814 contigs). The largest number of contigs was represented by contig 522, which contained 2,038 contigs. The second largest number of contigs was represented by contig 2,714 contigs, of which 1,732 contigs. The largest number of contigs was represented by contig 2,922 contigs.

The BCP2 datasets contained 1,943 contigs, representing 2,835 contigs of which 2,317 contigs were represented by single contigs. The BCP2 datasets contained 1,096 contigs representing 1,834 contigs of which 1,846 contigs were represented by single contigs. The largest number of contigs was represented by contig 1,732 contigs, of which 1,633 contigs were represented by single contigs. The largest number of contigs was represented by contig 2,714 contigs, of which 1,732 contigs were represented by single contigs. The BCP2 datasets contained 752 contigs representing 652 contigs of which 565 contigs were represented by single contigs.


## Discussion
The only exception is azole drugs that alter the hyphal morphology and morphology of . albicans (Fig 3).

The genus Candida is characterized by a large number of isolates, many of which are resistant to azole drugs, such as azole-resistant (A. fumigatus) and azole-susceptible (A. fischerii) strains (32). In contrast, C. tropicalis and C. albicans are the two species that have been described to be resistant to azole drugs (Table 1). C. albicans is the only species that has been described to be resistant to azole drugs (Table 1), although both species are resistant to fluconazole, a potent inducer of the enzyme CYP2C19 (33). C. albicans was described to be resistant to azole drugs (Table 1), although C. albicans is also resistant to fluconazole (Table 1). In contrast, in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole and azole drugs was observed in C. albicans, which is similar to that of C. albicans. In our work, the authors observed that the MIC of azole drugs was higher in the C. tropicalis group than in the C. albicans group. In our experiments, MIC of azole drugs was higher in C. tropicalis group than in the C. albicans group. In our study, the authors observed that the MIC of fluconazole was higher in C. albicans group than in C. albicans group.

The authors observed that C. albicans is less sensitive to azole drugs than C. tropicalis, which is consistent with the results of a previous study (6). Our results demonstrate that C. albicans is not only resistant to azole drugs but is also susceptible to azole drugs. Although the activity of fluconazole against C. tropicalis is not as potent as that against C. albicans, the authors found that the MIC of fluconazole was higher in the C. albicans group than in the C. albicans group.

In our work, the authors observed that C. albicans is less resistant to fluconazole than C.
