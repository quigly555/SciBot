## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous fungus capable of causing life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we investigated the activity of Amphotericin B (AmBisome), Depo Lipid (1-3), and Flucytosine (5FC) in vitro against C. neoformans. Our results showed that the fungicidal activity of AmBisome and/or Depo Lipid combined with Flucytosine was dose-dependent and synergistic against C. neoformans with a mean survival time of 84.4 days. The use of 5FC alone was not effective against C. neoformans with a survival time of 94.4 days, whereas 5FC and combination therapy resulted in survival rates of 96.2%, 87.2%, and 96.5%, respectively. In vivo tests indicated that combinations of 5FC and AmBisome could be effective in vivo.


## Introduction
Treatment of fungal infections is a complex interplay between the host and microbe. It is a challenge for clinicians to consider the response to treatment when the treatment choice is limited. Immunocompromised patients are at risk of developing severe fungal infections and require aggressive management. An understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these pathogens is crucial in predicting appropriate treatment.

The clinical picture of a primary cutaneous fungal infection varies depending on the causative agent. In general, this picture is a complex one, with the pathogen likely to be most strongly associated with the skin, hair, or nails of patients, while the skin and nails of those with less severe lesions tend to be less strongly associated with the fungus (Lachance et al., 2014). However, in immunocompromised patients, the skin and nail are the most commonly implicated sites of infection, followed by the nail and other extremities (Lachance et al., 2014; Lipova et al., 2015). Invasive fungal infections are usually caused by the ascomycete fungus Candida albicans, followed by C. neoformans, and the fungus can be recovered from the skin, mucous membrane, and other tissues (Chen et al., 2016). In contrast, infections caused by other fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans, can be associated with the central nervous system (CNS) (Chen et al., 2016).

In contrast to C. albicans, many other species of fungi can be isolated from the skin and/or mucocutaneous regions of humans. These organisms are often associated with infections in otherwise healthy individuals (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01660451) (Pfeiffer et al., 2016). These skin and mucocutaneous sites can be associated with other fungi such as Cryptococcus spp.


## Methods
brasiliensis complex isolates, as previously described (Zhao et a., 2018). To identify the presence of polysaccharides, the presence of Pb01 as a protein in Pb01 complex was analyzed by using the protein content as a measure of the total protein content. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot PVDF membrane Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:250, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to the 3’ end (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 4°C for 1 h, followed by incubation with a 2:1 dilution of the monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG-APC conjugated to the 1’ end of the 3’ end secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 4°C for 1 h, followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG-APC conjugated to the 1’ end secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 4°C for 1 h at room temperature.


## Results
We also examined the correlation of protein content, size distribution and time to disease onset for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates in a separate experimen. As shown in Fig 2, the percent of Paracoccidioides proteomes that varied among the isolates was significantly higher in the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex isolates than in the control isolates. The percent of Paracoccidioides proteomes that varied among isolates was also significant in the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates compared to the controls.

To assess whether differences in protein content in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates were associated with differences in disease severity, we performed a time-varying analysis of proteome data between Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates and controls. Our analysis identified a significant association between protein content and disease severity in both isolates (Table 4). In addition, the percent of Paracoccidioides proteomes that differed among the isolates was significantly higher in the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates compared to the controls.

Transcriptome analysis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates
A significant transcriptomic change was identified between Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates and controls during the course of the study (Table 5). The expression of the genes that were up-regulated and those that were down-regulated in the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis isolates was observed in all isolates.


## Discussion

The clustering of paracoccidioides strain populations and their phylogeny, with the aid of PDBD, revealed that some isolates clustered within the comple. However, many isolates from the complex were different from the typical clinical isolates in the clinical isolates. The phylogeny revealed that the most isolates clustered within the complex (M16-M18-M19, M24-M26 and M35-M38), which is supported by sequence data, PDBD and PCR amplifications and gene sequencing data. In general, the clinical isolates were clustered together. The presence of paracoccidioides species in the complex led to the phylogenetic inference of their genetic differentiation and the correlation of protein content and time to disease onset. In contrast, the clinical isolates clustered with the clinical isolates, while the clinical isolates clustered with the clinical isolates. This suggests that the clinical isolates may have been introduced through the local environment. The clinical isolates are distributed in geographical locations and were identified as Paracoccidioides spp. by PDBD and PCR analysis. The clinical isolates clustered with the clinical isolates. However, in a previous study, they were not found in the clinical isolates of Paracoccidioides spp. The clinical isolates from the clinical isolate were found to be paracoccidioides-like isolates. The clinical isolates were clustered together.

The present study confirmed that the clinical isolates were paracoccidioides-like isolates. The sequence data revealed that the clinical isolates were paracoccidioides-like isolates. The sequence data revealed that the clinical isolates were closely related to the clinical isolates. The clinical isolates were clustered together.
