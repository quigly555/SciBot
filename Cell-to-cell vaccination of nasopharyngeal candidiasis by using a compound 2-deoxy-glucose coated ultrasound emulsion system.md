## Abstract
While most of the bacteria in human communities are adapted to human presence, several bacteria species are also adapted to live in non-accompressible environments. A key step in adaptation is environmental adaptation. Environmental adaptation is defined as the ability of a microbe to adapt to different environmental stresses, such as oxygen, temperature, pH, and pH, by responding to those stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate the adaptation of Acanthamoeba castellanii to hypoxic stress in a non-culturable microorganism model. A total of 10 strains were isolated from apple fruit cultivated in a natural laboratory and tested for phenotypic traits associated with hypoxia. The strains were then used to identify the cellular components that are regulated in response to these stresses. The strains showed high expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are known to be involved in the recognition of fungal pathogens. Seven of the strains showed elevated expression of polymorphisms in the transcription factor PRR1, which is involved in the response to oxidative stress, and in response to different stress conditions. One strain was resistant to multiple classes of antifungal drugs, including caspofungin, itraconazole, and 5-flucytosine, suggesting that other immune factors are involved in the response to infection. In addition, three distinct phenotypes were observed in the strains when it was exposed to different carbon sources, such as osmotic and carbon sources, and in response to different stress treatments. The expression of PRR2 was also induced in response to these stress conditions.


## Introduction
The most common opportunistic fungal infection is candidiasis, caused by the pathogen Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is characterized by the invasion of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and mucosa, usually in patients with underlying disease or immunosuppression, or with defective cell-mediated immunity. This infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, especially among patients with underlying disease.

With the advent of intensive antifungal therapy, the incidence of invasive fungal infections has declined significantly over the past decades. However, these fungal infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The opportunistic yeast-to-hypha transition, particularly cryptococcal disease, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients, particularly in patients with underlying disease and immunosuppressive disease. In contrast to the incidence of other fungal infections, Candida albicans is typically associated with a low prevalence in clinical settings, with a low prevalence in intensive care units [1].

C. albicans is an opportunistic yeast pathogen that can cause mucosal and/or systemic infections. It is ubiquitous and can be found in a variety of niches, and can cause life-threatening systemic infections. In the United States, it accounts for more than half of all cases of systemic candidiasis [2], [3].

C. albicans can be isolated from environmental sources, such as soil, air, and water, as well as from human tissue, especially in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity. In general, the limited incidence of systemic candidiasis in patients with HIV/AIDS, in whom the infection is not cleared, or in patients with chronic diseases like diabetes, is attributed to the limited number of antifungal drugs available.


## Methods
The procedure was carried out at a final volume of 20 µl, including 1 µl of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and .5 µl of PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The samples were vortexed at maximum speed for 1 min and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to detect bacteria. The images were taken with a digital camera and the number of bacteria was counted using the crystal violet method.

4.6. In Vitro Bacterial Staining
The bacterial staining procedure was carried out in a 1% agarose gel to visualize the fluorescently labelled fungal cells. The agarose gel was stained with calcofluor White (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 30 min and the gel was washed three times with PBS. The stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager A1, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The staining was performed in a 10% (v/v) agarose gel.

4.7. In Vitro Pulsed-field Immunofluorescence
In order to assess the polarization effect of the BSA and S. schenckii in the culture supernatants of candidiasis, the antibody Pfu-VßRV-FITC (anti-BSA) and the peptide Pfu-VßRV-PE (anti-PfS) were used. The cell wall fraction of the Candida spp. were collected from an infected human lung, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were collected. The supernatant was subjected to PFA (PFA-PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as described previously [11]. The pellet was washed twice with PFA and then resuspended in PFA. The samples were incubated in PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and subsequently PBS with 0.5% (v/v) PFA. The supernatants were collected, and the cell wall fractions were collected. The cell wall fraction of P. brasiliensis was obtained by washing the cell wall fraction of P. brasiliensis with PBS and PFA.


## Results
3.1. Chemistry
As the C. albicans pathogenicity assay described in vitro for the C. albicans-specific IgG-RFP-expressing mouse monoclonal antibodies was performed on C. albicans isolates, the strains were obtained from the respiratory tract, blood, and spleen of healthy volunteers.


## Discussion
The isolation of N. pullulans from a variety of environmental and clinical samples is a rare and unique finding. Although N. pullulans is very closely related to N. pullulans, they are only one of many species in the genus and N. pullulans is an important and widespread genus in nature. In addition, N. pullulans is a member of the opportunistic yeast species and the major cause of candidemia in humans (2, 4, 7, 12). N.
