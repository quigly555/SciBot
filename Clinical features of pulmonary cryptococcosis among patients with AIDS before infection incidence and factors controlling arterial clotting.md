# Clinical features of pulmonary cryptococcosis among patients with AIDS before infection: incidence and factors controlling arterial clotting
Quaglee Dragontacos


## Abstract

We included two reviews of the literatur. Firstly, we considered the characteristics of patients who had died before the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis (n=34), and secondly, we focused on the third type (TB, n=25), which was more frequent among patients with AIDS before infection.

In this retrospective study, we included two reviews of the literature. Firstly, we considered the features of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients who had died, and secondly, we assessed factors controlling arterial clotting, acidosis, and acidosis.

In our study, we found that CD4+ T-cell count was the most common vascular risk factor (1.9/100 L), and it was associated with shorter duration of pulmonary cryptococcosis (median=2.5 years; range=1-5.5 years; P<0.05).

Our results suggest that CD4+ T-cell count may be a risk factor for pulmonary cryptococcosis in individuals who have AIDS and are in high risk of severe infection, and these patients should be screened for this infection before they are transferred to a tertiary referral hospital.

What is the aim of this study?

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the antifungal drug amphotericin B (AMB) in a critically ill patient with HIV infection, and to assess its effect on the progression of radiculopathy and mycoses in a non-HIV related setting.

Methodology

The study was a case series evaluating the effects of the three antifungal drugs, rilpivirale (itraconazole) and posaconazole (amphoterol and rifampicin), on an HIV-infected patient with suspected radiculopathy and mycoses. A post hoc analysis of post hoc analyses was performed. Data were extracted and analysed using Epi-data-But and Chi-3.

Results. The study revealed that the antifungal drug alone was not to be compared to the other antifungal drugs. Rilpivirale and posaconazole were more efficacious in the treatment of radiculopathy and mycoses than amantacine. Rilpivirale was associated with significantly higher survival rate in the study compared to other studies, while the comparison group showed no differences in outcome.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella comprises a wide range of saprobic, keratinized and non- keratinized fungi which are commonly isolated from plant debris. They can be found in association with plant debris, especially leaves, branches, roots and seeds of a wide variety of plants, especially gymnosperms and cress (Osmundsham and Smith, 2006; Simona et al., 2015; Chaibry et al., 2016; Courtecuisse et al., 2018). Mycosphaerella graminicola is a member of the group of “ulmiores”, which are a group of fungi that live in soil and plants (Simona et al., 2015). This group is typically found in soil, where it causes disease on many plant species including many economically important plants including pepper, sugarcane, mango, cottonwood and many more (Jacques et al., 2005; Xufre et al., 2016). Mycosphaerella graminicola is a major cause of aflatoxicosis and several other diseases on a wide range of plants (Simona et al., 2015). The species can cause serious economic and health problems, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), but rarely produce acute or chronic infections.

The genus Mycosphaerella has been traditionally classified in the order Capnodiales and can also be found in the family Mycosphaerellaceae (Simona and Smith, 2006). Mycosphaerella graminicola is considered a cosmopolitan and polyphyletic group that can infect a wide range of plants including gymnosperms and cress (Osmundsham and Smith, 2006), and black cress and beercqin (Simona et al., 2015).


## Methods

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (approval number: CPC#2739. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.

Study design
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of M. tuberculosis, as a disease, was a factor that influenced the clinical course of the patients. This was the case of this retrospective study, and there were no predisposing factors.

Study design
The study was performed in a hospital-based setting, which included a tertiary hospital in Mato Grosso do Sul, the capital city of Mato Grosso do Sul Province. This was chosen as a national referral hospital in which to treat tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and also to serve as a model for other regional referral hospitals in the country. In addition, the hospital serves as the center for infectious diseases in the region. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice, with the aim of optimizing the patient’s well-being, and to be able to provide a high quality of life for all patients.

Study design
The study included patients with HIV-1 tuberculosis, other-than-tuberculosis, and other-than-tuberculosis patients. These patients were screened for tuberculosis based on the India-HIV International AIDS Screening Database (http://www.indicator.org/). The study included all HIV-1 patients who were considered to be HIV-1TB patients by the hospital-based guidelines.

Study design
The study included HIV-1 tuberculosis patients with a chronic form of tuberculosis and other-than-tuberculosis patients. The HIV-1 patients were screened for tuberculosis based on the reference registry (http://www.unipro.org/translabs/). The HIV-1 patients were screened based on the international HIV-1 registry (http://www.unipro.org/translabs/index.html).

Study design
The study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as revised in 2009 [11]. The study included all animals with an adapted cage, a large cage, and a small cage.


## Results
. Chemistry and Selection of Antimicrobial Stresses
The most widely used antifungal compounds are azole antifungal drugs, including aminoglycosides, aminotransferrin, isotype-matched polymyxin B, aminotransferrin and isotype-matched polymyxin B.
