## Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in many bacterial genomes prior to sequence analysis. The microRNA processing (Prp) pathway has been shown to be important for the production of inorganic dyes and secondary metabolites. Here we review the functions of miRNAs in a wide range of organisms, with an emphasis on Pseudomonas species. Pseudomonas species contains three miRNAs (rna1, rna2 and rna3) encoding the Prp pathway. The genes involved in Prp transcription are expressed under different growth conditions and are responsible for different cellular responses. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro Prp knockdown and overexpression mutants suggests that both models are viable independent organisms. Further in vivo studies in a mouse model of P. graminis suggest that miRNAs are not required for the Prp production of the Prp biosynthetic enzymes.


## Introduction
Candida glabrata is the most common cause of candidiasis in humans and can cause up to 15% of candidemia in the United States (Henderson et al., 2006). Although Candida glabrata is a normal part of the human body, it can cause severe and recurrent infections in susceptible patients (Kasama et al., 2007). As an opportunistic pathogen, C. glabrata has the potential to cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients (Kasama et al., 2007; Milus et al., 2009; Lamarre et al., 2010), and has become an important cause of food-borne illness in recent years (Milus et al., 2009). The most common C.


## Methods
. Fungal Isolates
The yeast strains used in this study were isolated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) (Table 1).


## Results
As shown in Fig 1, Aspergillus niger can survive within the lung of animals as it has a less efficient pathogenicity than . niger, and thus, we were interested in investigating the viability of Aspergillus niger in the lungs of mice. To assess the viability of Aspergillus niger in the lungs of these mice, the liver and kidneys were harvested on day 7 after infection, and the fungal burden in the lung and liver was determined by measuring the percentage of CFU per gram of tissue. As shown in Fig 2, Aspergillus niger was completely killed in the lungs of mice on day 7. The lung of mice infected with Aspergillus niger had a lower fungal burden in the liver and kidneys compared to that of mice infected with A. niger. In contrast, mice infected with A. flavus had a higher fungal burden in the lungs of mice infected with Aspergillus niger. The lungs of mice infected with A. flavus showed a higher fungal burden in the liver compared to those of mice infected with A. niger, which was not significantly different from that of the mice infected with A. flavus (Fig 2). These results indicate that Aspergillus niger is capable of infecting lung and liver of humans, and that in A. niger infected mice there is a lower fungal burden in the lungs than that in those infected with A. flavus.

Treatment with Aspergillus niger induces an inflammatory response in the lungs
The immune response in the lungs is characterized by the production of several cytokines, which are responsible for the induction of several immune responses in the lungs [24-26]. In order to determine whether Aspergillus niger elicits a strong inflammatory response in the lungs, we pretreated the lung with different concentrations of Aspergillus niger. As shown in Fig 3A, Aspergillus niger pretreatment induced a strong inflammatory response in the lungs of mice, while that of Aspergillus niger-treated mice showed no significant difference. The lungs of mice infected with Aspergillus niger in the pretreatment with Aspergillus niger showed a higher inflammatory response compared to that in the infected mice.


## Discussion

In this study, we found that WBC cells are capable of responding to the biofilm-associated fungal growth, and that WBC-infected cells were less resistant to WBC-mediated antifungal and antifungal-associated growt. These results are consistent with a previous study that reported that WBCs from W. dermatitidis treated with IFN-<U+03B3> and MIP-2 enhanced the fungal growth in vitro. In contrast, WBC-infected cells were more susceptible to MIP-2, a fungistatic agent in the M-CA, and amphotericin B, a selective antifungal, in vitro, and to CIP, an inhibitor of the CYP51A cyclin-dependent kinase (CICK) inhibitor, in vitro, and to LIP, a lipopeptide inhibitor, in vivo. The results of this study support a previous study that revealed that the expression of CYP51A cyclin-dependent kinase, including CYP51B, CYP51C, CYP51D, CYP51E, CYP51F, CYP51G, and CYP51I, was significantly increased in WBCs from W. dermatitidis treated with IFN-<U+03B3> and MIP-2 and increased in WBCs from W. dermatitidis treated with IFN-<U+03B3> and MIP-2, as well as in WBCs from W. pombe treated with MIP-2, IFN-<U+03B3>, and VCZ [25]. The enhanced antifungal activity of MIP-2 and VCZ was also seen in the early stages of the infection, suggesting that MIP-2 may be a novel virulence factor in W. dermatitidis.

In conclusion, we identified a novel, inhibitory, antifungal-associated cell wall component, WBC, as a novel host to monitor the interaction with fungal biofilms. We further revealed that WBCs are less susceptible to WBC-mediated antifungal and antifungal-associated growth. We also observed that WBCs from W.
