## Abstract
Fusarium graminearum is the major causal pathogen of Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. Infection is initiated by inhalation of fungal spores that are morphologically identical to Aspergillus species, but with distinct internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and large subunit of ribosomal RNA gene sequences. However, the evolution of FHB regulation has been studied in the Aspergillus fumigatus species complex (AFC), a heterothallic ascomycete order that includes more than 95% of the known fungi. This heterothallic order is more structured than the A. fumigatus species complex by its multiple loci, genome sequence content and multiple developmental processes. AFC genes are enriched for operases, secondary metabolisms, chemotactic loci, secondary metabolites and virulence factors. Some of these genes are associated with fungal development. The importance of many of these genes for fungal growth is highlighted here. The data presented here are not available for the heterothallic A. fumigatus species complex, but for the A. nidulans complex it contained the most repressed (at least 80%) subset of genes. Some of these genes are important for virulence, but the data presented here are not available for the heterothallic order, which is based on a smaller number of genes. The data presented here are not available for the pterodactylum Aspergillus species complex. The data presented here are not available for the pterotrophic order Fusarium. Although several of these genera are associated with necrotrophy, the data presented here are not available for Pterocarya or Tremellomycetes. In contrast, the data presented here are available for Tulaspora, Alternaria, and Fusarium. These are fungi that are associated with a wide range of morphological and physiological traits, including leaf spot development, conidiation, secondary metabolites, secondary metabolites and infectious life styles.


## Introduction
For example, the genes encoding Gcn4p and Gcn5p are expressed during growth on . crassa and during infection in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Further, genes encoding proteins such as transporters of the bacterial cell wall, c-a-terme, are expressed during infection in the rice-colonizing fungus Fusarium graminearum. The intracellular trafficking of Gcn4p and Gcn5p is not only related to their membrane-bound nature but also to their action on protein folding and protein sorting in the extracellular matrix [2]. The intracellular trafficking of Gcn4p and Gcn5p is also related to their membrane-bound nature and their active transport in the extracellular matrix.

In addition to Gcn4p and Gcn5p, another gene encoding the a-subunit of the G protein family, which is also known as a-defensin, also encodes a family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, resistance to environmental stresses, and virulence in the plant pathogen F. graminearum [3]. The FGS analysis of gene expression in F. graminearum revealed that a-GTPase and chitinase activity were induced by different growth conditions (cell wall and extracellular matrix) and all proteins involved in the cell wall remodeling were expressed in the cell wall and the active transport of GTP to the extracellular space [3]. The FGS analysis of gene expression in the wheat pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum revealed that Gcn4p and Gcn5p are involved in the cell wall modification and are essential for growth, morphogenesis, and pathogenicity [4].

The high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and the high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq-HTS) technologies allow for the detection of several different gene groups, and they are very fast. This makes them an ideal tool to study gene expression in plant pathogen. Although RNA-Seq is a very fast technology, compared with HTS, the proteome analysis can be performed in minutes. This is important for studying protein expression in plant-pathogen interactions. The proteome analysis can be performed in minutes, making it possible to study gene expression in different phases of plant infection.


## Methods
Strains and media
The C. albicans SC5314 strain and the mutant strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains were cultured on YPD (0.7% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) plates at 30°C.

C. albicans
C. albicans cells were cultivated in liquid YPD media at 30°C for 24 h. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Fractionated cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS. The suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/ml and 50 µl of this suspension was used for a single-cell assay. In addition, a cell-cell interaction assay was performed using a cell-cell cross-linking assay. For this assay, cell suspension (1 × 10^6) was added to a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight at 4°C. Next, the plate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed and replaced by fresh PBS. The optical density at 595 nm (OD_595) was determined by using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Osaka, Japan).

## Discussion
However, in the absence of exogenous iron, expression of iron-related genes was not repressed in the absence of exogenous iron [38. Taken together, our results indicate that the transcription of genes involved in iron acquisition and iron supply in eukaryotes is repressed in the absence of exogenous iron. The transcription of genes involved in iron-related genes was repressed in the absence of exogenous iron and the transcription of genes involved in iron-regulated genes was repressed in the presence of exogenous iron. The result indicated that the intracellular iron concentrations in the cells were low enough to allow the expression of these genes.

The most repressed genes in the yeast cells were those involved in the synthesis of the protein encoded by the phospholipase B, which is the substrate of the enzyme Sirolimus, which is a major component of the Sirolimus pathway [41]. This enzyme is required for the biosynthesis of sirolimusin [42]. The C-24-phosphatase was repressed in the yeast cells, which is essential for the biosynthesis of sirolimusin [43]. In the absence of exogenous iron, this enzyme was downregulated in the yeast cells, which was sufficient to allow the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sirolimusin. The C-24-phosphatase was repressed in the yeast cells, which was sufficient to allow the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sirolimusin. The C-24-phosphatase was downregulated in the yeast cells, which was sufficient to allow the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sirolimusin. The C-24-phosphatase was repressed in the yeast cells, which is sufficient to allow the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sirolimusin. The C-24-phosphatase was downregulated in the yeast cells, which is sufficient to allow the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sirolimusin.

Sirolimus biosynthesis is the second important pathway of sirolimus in eukaryotes.
