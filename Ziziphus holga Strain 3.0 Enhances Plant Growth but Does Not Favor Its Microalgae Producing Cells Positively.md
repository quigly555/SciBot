## Methods
Mycelia was collected by filtration and the mycelia was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °. The culture was inoculated with the pure culture using a sterile swab and incubated at 25 °C for 24-48 h in a shaking incubator. The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration and the mycelia was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C.

Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
To examine the mycelia from the colonies grown on MM plates, a single colony of Stramenopila was cultivated on a 5% (w/w) yeast extract (HyClone®) agar plate for 3 days at 25 °C. The mycelia was harvested by filtration and the mycelia was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C. The samples were kept in an icebox until analyzed. The samples were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C.

Analysis of the surface of the MMM plates
To examine the surface of the MMM plates, the number of ascospores and the number of fungi were measured. For each pathogen, three colonies (2.5 cm diameter, 10 cm height) of Stramenopila were cultured on the same plate for 3 days. The mycelia were harvested by filtration and the mycelia was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C.

MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the surface of the MMM plates
For the MS analysis, the spore suspensions were prepared by dissolving 1 × 10^7 spores/mL in sterile water. The samples were crushed in liquid nitrogen and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were dried by vacuum centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). The dry weight was estimated from the dried pellets. For the extraction of proteins, the mycelia were inoculated on MMM plates with different concentrations of the protein extract.


## Results
The Nucleotide Sequencing Project analysis of the ITS1 region of the microalgae strain also confirmed the presence of the species of the genus Microalgae (Table 3. However, the ITS1 region of the microalgae strain was different from the ITS2 region of the microalgae strain (Table 3). Therefore, this strain was not considered suitable for further investigation.

Microalgae are also reported to produce yeasts, especially in the Red Sea, which are aquatic pathogens [26]. To evaluate whether the microalgae strain was a true microalgae strain, we isolated a microalgae strain, including the type strain, from the marine environment. As shown in Table 3, the microalgae strain was found to be closely related to the type strain, which was not previously isolated from the marine environment.

Microalgae Microalgae Strains Are Differentially Expressed in Response to Stress Conditions
In order to evaluate the biological processes that are affected by the microalgae strain, we compared the expression of the response markers of the microalgae strain and the wild type strain under various stress conditions. As shown in Table 4, the expression of the response markers was significantly upregulated in the microalgae strain (Table 4), indicating that the microalgae strain is capable of coping with stress conditions.

The microalgae strain showed the highest expression of the genes that are directly involved in microbial response to oxidative stress. The response marker, the N-acetylglucosamine synthetase (N-Glucosamine 4-phosphate dehydrogenase) was upregulated in the microalgae strain, which is a potential cause of the stress that is being encountered in the marine environment. However, the microalgae strain is not able to grow on glucose-containing medium. The expression of the genes that are directly involved in the response to oxidative stress was significantly downregulated in the microalgae strain (Table 4), indicating that the microalgae strain is capable of coping with stress conditions.

Amino acid metabolism
The microalgae strain was found to be highly expressed in response to stress conditions.


## Discussion
It is possible that some of these extracts can be more efficient in extracting DNA from microalga. The results presented in Figure 4B and C, in which some of the extracts and the ethanol/yeast extract are more potent than the ethanol/yeast extract, suggest that the ethanol/yeast extract might be more efficient in extracting DNA from microalgae. However, the ethanol/yeast extract is less potent than the ethanol/yeast extract and therefore the ethanol/yeast extract was not selected. Although ethanol/yeast extract is only weakly potent compared to chloroform extraction, it is still superior in terms of the DNA extraction, as shown in Figure 4B, as compared to the other three methods, since this extract is the best one. This extract is therefore recommended for further research.

Effects of ethanol and yeast extract on the growth and lipid production of C. curvatus
The lipid production and lipid production of C. curvatus were assessed on the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract. The results were displayed in Figure 5A, where the highest amount of biomass was obtained for the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract. The biomass obtained for the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract was 15.16 g/L. The yeast extract was consumed by the yeast cells at a significant rate, but the biomass yield was only 0.23% and it was lower than the biomass yield of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract. The lipid content of the medium increased from 4.15 g/L to 9.14 g/L and the lipid content of the medium containing yeast extract was 10.43 g/L. The lipid content of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract was 1.76% and 10.33% respectively, which was similar to the biomass content of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract. However, the lipid content of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract was almost the same as that of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract. The results indicated that the lipid content of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract was higher than that of the medium containing ethanol and yeast extract.
