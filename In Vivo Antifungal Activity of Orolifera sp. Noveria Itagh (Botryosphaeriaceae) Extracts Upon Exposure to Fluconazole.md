## Abstract
Arctostaphylomyces marneffei is a cosmopolitan arthropod pathogen causing losses and losses of both mange and mangrove production in crops. To survive in host tissues, Arctostaphylomyces has evolved a variety of plasticity mechanisms, i.e. the ability to undergo cell fusion and undergo multicellular morphologies.

The genomic information of A. marneffei is encoded in large and compact clusters that are flanked by large and small clusters. The size of the clusters is related to their multigenic nature. We recently reported a genome-wide analysis of the genome content of A. marneffei, and identified the genome-wide expression patterns of 26 scaffolds. These results expanded the database of gene content of A. marneffei into a resource of annotated genes that was of interest to molecular geneticists.

We first compared the expression of 26 scaffolds in wild-type strains and Ssowia kluyveri strains, which are sensitive to the azole drugs fluconazole and voriconazole.


## Introduction
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a reversible neovascularization of the thrombus, thrombus, or nonthrombus in which the oxygen tension is relaxed by the flow of blood through a blood vessel. This reversible neovascularization leads to a narrow gap in the endothelial cell's oxygen supply allowing the cells to migrate to the vessel, oxygenate, and allow the blood vessels to penetrate into the vascular endothelial layer.

CNV is a rare complication of pulmonary or pulmonary hypertension and is reported to be the most common cause of thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and mortality. Rarely, CNV has been reported as a secondary or end-organ transplant. Herein we report a case of CNV in a patient with end-organ transplantation-myocardial infarction, in which the patient developed thrombotic complications without obvious underlying condition.


## Methods
Inocula were prepared in Petri dishes containing rice-soy agar and grown at 28 °C for 24 . The leaves were disinfected with 70% ethanol, and the mycelium was harvested. The mycelia was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a blender. The suspension was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and the dried mycelia was weighed and partitioned into two fractions, the first for the purpose of analysis of the antifungal activities, and the second for the purpose of studies on the antifungal activity of orolifera sp. Noveria Itagh (Botryosphaeriaceae) Extracts Upon Exposure to Fluconazole and Amphotericin B. Inocula were prepared in Petri dishes containing rice-soy agar and grown at 28 °C for 24 h.

Noveria Itagh (Botryosphaeriaceae) Extracts Upon Exposure to Fluconazole and Amphotericin B. Inocula were prepared in Petri dishes containing rice-soy agar and grown at 28 °C for 24 h. The leaves were disinfected with 70% ethanol, and the mycelia was crushed using a mortar and pestle. The suspension was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and the dried mycelia was weighed and partitioned into two fractions, the first for the purpose of analysis of the antifungal activities, and the second for the purpose of studies on the antifungal activity of orolifera sp. Noveria Itagh (Botryosphaeriaceae) Extracts Upon Exposure to Fluconazole and Amphotericin B. Inocula were prepared in Petri dishes containing rice-soy agar and grown at 28 °C for 24 h.


## Results
extract had antifungal activity against . neoformans, we tested the ability of the extracts obtained from Orolifera sp. extract to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of the antifungal agent fluconazole. We observed that the extracts of Orolifera sp. extract had no activity against the C. neoformans, although the extract from the culture of the isolate was slightly more effective than the other extracts (Table 1).

Orolifera sp. Extracts Produce Antifungal Activity Against C. neoformans
In order to test whether the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract had antifungal activity against C. neoformans, we tested the ability of the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract to inhibit the growth of C. neoformans in the presence of fluconazole. To this end, the extracts from Orolifera sp. extract were tested for the antifungal activity of the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract against C. neoformans and the results are presented in Table 2. The results showed that the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract induced a dose-dependent antifungal activity against C. neoformans. The results are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract induced a dose-dependent antifungal activity against C. neoformans, while the extracts derived from the Orolifera sp. extract induced a dose-dependent antifungal activity against C. neoformans.

## Discussion
Interestingly, treatment with the . wrtii strain did not result in an increase in the activity of the antifungal agent, since the extract of O. wrtii was previously detected in the oral cavity of healthy subjects. However, the application of fluconazole to the oropharyngeal mucosa of patients infected with C. neoformans and C. gattii sensu stricto strain (P. acnes) may explain this finding. Interestingly, a similar finding was reported by the same group in another study involving two different isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans [23].

The O. wrtii isolate was isolated from the oral cavity of a patient who had a history of Pneumocystis carinii infection, which is known to cause the oral cavity infection of immunocompromised patients [24]. In this study, the isolate was reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, both of which have been reported to have antifungal activity against C. albicans [25]. In this study, the isolate was reported to have antifungal activity against C. neoformans, which is a yeast pathogen that has been reported to have antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. gattii [25].

In the present study, the O. wrtii isolate was isolated from the blood of a patient who had a history of B. dermatitidis infection, which is known to cause the blood infection of immunocompromised individuals [26]. B. dermatitidis has been reported to have antifungal activity against C. albicans, which was also reported to have antifungal activity against C. albicans [26].

In the present study, the O. wrtii isolate was isolated from the sputum of a patient who had a history of B. dermatitidis infection. In addition to the isolates from the sputum of patients with a history of B. dermatitidis infection, the isolate from the sputum of the patient with the history of B. dermatitidis infection was also isolated from the sputum of a patient with a history of B. dermatitidis infection.
