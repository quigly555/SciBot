## Abstract
Nosocomial infections by fungi remain a major challenge in immunocompromised patients. Although Candida albicans is the leading cause of invasive mycoses, the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is a well-established opportunist pathogen, with its frequent use as a model for candidiasis. In this study, we report a novel case of C. glabrata-induced peritonitis in a patient receiving oral fluconazole for the treatment of metabolic endophthalmitis and colonic cancer. This patient presented with fever, diarrhea, and chest pain while undergoing treatment for colon cancer.


## Introduction
The genus Hypericum L. (Hypericaceae), also known as hypericolla, is distributed from the north-western USA to the south-western China and Japan [1].


## Methods

Fungal cultures and DNA extraction
Fungal strains of Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans were cultured in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for 7 day. Fungal cells were harvested from the culture broth by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and lyzed with 0.5% Tween 80 (v/v). The lyzed cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 µl of 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and the samples were vortexed for 10 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove debris. The supernatant was then removed and the pellets were washed with sterile distilled water to remove residual enzymes. DNA extraction was carried out using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with minor modifications. Briefly, the fungal genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit contains two sets of columns (column A is a QIAprep Cufflinks kit, Qiagen) which includes Qiagen’s second column for the QIAprep spin miniprep column. The QIAprep column has a buffer composition of 3 µl of DNA extract and 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin Gel (Qiagen). Column B consists of 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel, 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel and 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel. Column C contains 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel and 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel. Column D contains 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel and 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel. Column E consists of 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel and 1 µl of QIAprep NucleoSpin gel.


## Results
and . albicans. The remaining four isolates were identified as C. neoformans.

As shown in Figure 2, all isolates of C. albicans were identified as C. albicans, but they also had one isolate of Candida dubliniensis, which is a common clinical isolate of C. albicans. C. dubliniensis is associated with a history of encephalitis, including injection of 3 days of intravenous amphotericin B or 5 days of intravenous amphotericin B and was isolated from an unknown patient.

The three C. dubliniensis isolates were identified as C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. C. parapsilosis was isolated from a patient with an intermittent mycotic intestinal disorder and is described in detail below.

Candida parapsilosis
The isolates C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis were identified by both PCR- and culture-based methods. The PCR products were derived from the upper GI tract. The sequences of C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis were 99% and 97%, respectively. The isolates of C. parapsilosis were identified by the culture method (Figure 3). Both C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis were identified by culture, but they were identified by PCR-based PCR (Figure 4). The PCR products were derived from the upper GI tract. The sequences of C. parapsilosis and C. dubliniensis were 99% and 97%, respectively. The isolates of C. parapsilosis were identified by PCR-based PCR and culture (Figure 5). Both isolates of C. parapsilosis were identified by PCR-based PCR and culture (Figure 6). The isolates of C. dubliniensis were identified by PCR-based PCR and culture (Figure 7). Both isolates of C. parapsilosis were identified by PCR-based PCR and culture (Figure 8). The isolates of C. parapsilosis were identified by PCR-based PCR and culture (Figure 9). Both isolates of C.


## Discussion
This study builds on previous studies, in which the genome of . fumigatus was found to be composed of only 1,184 protein-coding genes [10,11,18,37] and the genomes of a diverse group of fungi, including A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. awamori, A. terreus, A. parasiticus, and A. parasiticus [19-21,38]. In addition, we have also constructed phylogenetically informative markers for each of the 14 fungal species (Table 1) and have annotated a total of 4,000 genes in the A. fumigatus genome, with the total number of putative genes in this species of fungi 7,099 (Table 1). The complete annotation of the fungal genome was first reported by Chang et al. [11] and is available as GenBank and GenBank, respectively.

The three major classes of fungal genes involved in sexual reproduction were defined by their predicted expression patterns in all of the species analyzed. Two of the genes, RAR1 and RAR2, were uniquely expressed at the same time as the corresponding gene in the two A. fumigatus isolates and were associated with the sexual development of A. fumigatus in a different way. Both RAR1 and RAR2 are located on the surface of the sporangium and are known to be involved in vegetative growth of A. fumigatus [39]. In the A. fumigatus strain CBS 10492, a RAR1 gene was found to be constitutively expressed at both the sporangium and the spore stages, and was required for asexual sporulation of A. fumigatus [40]. In addition, the A.
