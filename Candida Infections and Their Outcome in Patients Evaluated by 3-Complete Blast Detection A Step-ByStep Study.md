## Abstract
Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging fungal pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. The molecular manifestations of cryptococcocal disease in immunocompetent individuals range from mild respiratory complaints to fulminant meningoencephalitis.

We report on a 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. She was referred to the hospital for further evaluation of a fever, leukocytosis, and suspicion of invasive pulmonary and cerebral cryptococcosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed multiple small nodules in the inferior frontal lobes and in the periventricular lobes showed diffuse infarcts. An imaging study of periventricular lesions revealed a Thymus-type lesion, which is thought to be from an infection with the serine protease inhibitor tacrolimus.

This is the first report of cryptococcosis in a type 2 patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with confusion, irritability, slow to respond memory memory decline, and an increased frequency of leukocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed multiple small nodules in the inferior frontal lobes and in the periventricular lobes, and the patient was referred to the hospital for further evaluation. The diagnosis was confirmed with tissue biopsy.

This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing cryptococcosis and emphasizes the importance of early evaluation and type 2 evaluation, especially when cryptococcosis is found in cerebral and CNS tissues.


## Introduction
 2017. In addition, the new technology of 3-Complete Blast Detection (3-CT) has been successfully used to detect a variety of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and other less common viruses (Leste et al., 2017; Wellings et al., 2017). The three-component assay relies on the detection of two antigen molecules namely, a streptomycose modified liposome (SPL), which is prepared by adding 1-2% lipids to the yeast cell membrane and then a short peptide (PL) to the yeast cell membrane, followed by a phase 1 assay. The method is used to detect the presence of various pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (Wellings et al., 2017). The SPL contains peptides of the following types: a-galactosylceramides that have been shown to be able to trigger the apoptosis of certain bacterial species (Al-Hassi et al., 2007; Wellings et al., 2017), ß-galactosyring-like peptides (ß-galactosylceramides) and short peptides of the class of short peptide toxins (Srikantha et al., 2009; Wellings et al., 2017), and is produced by Streptomyces spp. and Mycobacterium spp. The presence of ß-galactosyring-like peptides in SPL results in the inhibition of phage activity (Al-Hassi et al., 2007), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection (Al-Hassi et al., 2007), and influenza A virus (AIVV). Other bacteria that have been shown to be able to trigger phage activity include Bacillus anthracis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Al-Hassi et al., 2007; Wellings et al., 2017). In addition, macrophage phage activation in the presence of phage-specific lipopeptides has been reported (Ding et al., 2007; Wellings et al., 2017). Other phage-specific lipopeptides are produced by Streptomyces spp.


## Methods
neoformans infections and their associated burden. An initial panel of 100 patients was composed of 12 Caucasians, 11 Chinese, and 13 Middle Easterner patients, and a third was randomized to groups consisting of four Caucasians (Table 2). The panel of five patients was composed of 25 Caucasians and 10 Chinese, and the remaining five patients were randomized to groups consisting of two Caucasians (C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. syringae) and one Indian. The procedure was performed according to the 3-stage Blast Detection protocol with the following modifications: patients were first divided into two groups, then divided into four groups, and finally, the patient was randomly assigned into three groups, and each group was independently analyzed in triplicate. The results of this panel were compared with the results of the second stage of the 3-stage Blast Detection. The patients in each group were treated as previously described (3-3.5) with different doses of the tested compound. In addition, the patients in the first and second stage of the 3-stage Blast Detection were treated with fluconazole (4 mg/kg) and, in the third stage, the patients in the third stage were treated with itraconazole (5 mg/kg).

The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 14.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics. The comparison of the survival data between the 3-stage and the 2-stage Blast Detection was done by the log-rank test using the Statistica version 6.0 software.

Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Graz (approval number: 2011-01-16). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients, and the study was performed according to the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital of Graz. The data were analyzed anonymously.

Strains and growth conditions
The C. neoformans strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. Yeast strains used in this study were routinely grown on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) at 30°C for 48 h.


## Results
neoformans infection, we next investigated the effect of macrophage-derived antigens on . neoformans infection. Mice were inoculated with 10^6 fungal cells (100^7 C. neoformans cells), and the frequency of the infection was determined daily using flow cytometry. We found that macrophage-derived antigens (CD11c^+CD68^+CD14^+) and macrophage-derived antigens (CD4^+CD69^+CD18^+CD25^-) were the most effective in controlling C. neoformans infection (Fig 1A). Mice were then sacrificed at 1, 5, and 7 days postinfection and the fungal burden in the brain was determined. Mice infected with 10^6 C. neoformans cells (100^7 C. neoformans cells), or those infected with 100^7 C. neoformans cells (100^7 C. neoformans cells), had the highest fungal burden in the brain at 1 day postinfection (Fig 1B). At 7 days postinfection, the brain fungal burden in the brain was lower in the mice infected with 100^7 C. neoformans cells, but no statistical difference was observed (Fig 1B). In contrast, mice infected with 100^7 C. neoformans cells were still able to cause brain infection at a similar rate to those infected with 100^7 C. neoformans cells.

C. neoformans Infections and Their Outcome in Patients Evaluated by 3-Complete Blast Detection: A Step-ByStep Study
Since a combination of macrophage-derived antigens and CD11c^+CD4^+ T cells were the most effective in controlling C. neoformans infection, we next investigated the effect of macrophage-derived antigens on C. neoformans infection. Mice were inoculated with 10^6 fungal cells (100^7 C. neoformans cells), and the frequency of the infection was determined daily using flow cytometry.


## Discussion
In fact, the ANOVA results showed that the treatment with a small amount of antibiotics and fluconazole increased the risk of developing severe infection. The antifungal treatment and fluconazole treatment showed no difference in the three-way ANOVA. The treatment with 5-flucytosine, 5-flucytosine, or 5-flucytosine showed no significant difference in the three-way ANOVA.

The patients in the treatment groups were evaluated for the two main conditions in the clinic: A1, which was known to be an invasive infection and a bacterial infection.

In the three-way ANOVA, all patients had a good outcome after treatment with azithromycin, posaconazole, and caspofungin.

In the two-way ANOVA, the patients in the treatment groups had a good outcome after treatment with posaconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin. The patients in the treatment groups had a good outcome after treatment with azithromycin, posaconazole, and caspofungin.

In the two-way ANOVA, the patients in the treatment groups had a good outcome after treatment with azithromycin, posaconazole, and caspofungin.
