## Abstract
The iron-requiring metabolic pathway of Aspergillus fumigatus involves the A. fumigatus thioredoxin 1 (AT1) dehydrogenase and Aspergillus galactomannan (GM), two iron-requiring enzymes from the hemolymph of infected mice. In the present study, we elucidated the role of GM in iron homeostasis in A. fumigatus-infected mice infected with A. fumigatus. GM was found to enhance iron stress-induced gene expression in A. fumigatus-infected wild type (WT) mice. Furthermore, induction of GM accumulation in the GM-enriched medium in A. fumigatus-deficient mice was associated with reduced levels of iron, and loss of the host metabolite ferrioxamine. GM deficiency in A. fumigatus-infected WT mice significantly attenuated both the virulence of A. fumigatus in the mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis and the ability of the host strain Pichia pastoris to resist GM depletion. These results suggest that GM is involved in iron regulation in A. fumigatus, and GM deficiency in A.


## Introduction
In the lungs, these species are able to cause diseases ranging from chronic bronchitis to asthma [1, 2. Among the most common clinical forms of lung disease are allergic and inflammatory airway diseases, which in most cases are caused by respiratory bacterial (S1 and S2), fungal and ocular (F1, F2 and F3) and viral (I1 and I2) [3]. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) can be severe and include, among others, aspergillosis, candidiasis, mucormycosis, and mucormycosis, as well as asthma [4-6]. Invasive fungal infections are considered to be a major threat to public health, and the World Health Organization has designated them a global problem [7].

IFIs are a group of diseases which include, but are not limited to, mucormycosis, chronic bronitis, and mucormycosis [8]. The most common IFIs are allergic airway disease and otitis media (OCD) [9]. Invasive fungal infections are estimated to cause 1.6 million deaths annually in the USA alone [10]. In addition, fungal infections are difficult to diagnose and treat, and this is mainly due to the limited number of effective antifungal drugs available [11]. In the USA alone, there are over 300,000 reported fungal infections, of which the most common ones are candidiasis and mucormycosis [12, 13]. The main fungal causative agent is Candida albicans, but there is an increasing incidence of other fungal infections, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus [14].

Although the incidence of IFIs is decreasing, the number of deaths due to these infections continues to climb. A total of ~1100 cases occur each year in the USA [15], with candidiasis being the most common cause of death [16]. Moreover, the mortality rate due to invasive fungal infections is very high, reaching up to 40% in patients with severe immunosuppression [17, 18]. The prevalence of these fungal infections varies according to geographical region, patient population and patient outcome [19]. The mortality rate is even higher in immunocompromised patients.


## Methods
The test organisms were defined as . cinerea, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, F. solani, C. albicans, C. neoformans, S. cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe. The percentage of fungal growth inhibition was calculated by standard methods, except for B. cinerea, which was used as an internal control. The mean time-to-event time was calculated for each isolate and the mean time-to-event time for each treatment.

Fungal inocula were prepared using a 0.25% w/v mycological extract from the fungal culture using a sterile spreader and used to inoculate 1 mL of 0.9% saline in a Petri dish. The mycelial mat of the inoculated Petri dish was inoculated with 500 µL of 0.9% saline solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 week. The fungal growth rate was estimated by measuring the radial growth diameter of the fungal colony using a spectrophotometer (MACH Lab Instrument GmbH, Herrenberg, Germany). The fungal growth rate was calculated as the mean ± SD of the previous day and the values were rounded to zero. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Assessment of Compounds and Antifungal Activity
To determine the antifungal activities of the tested compounds, a standard reference broth microdilution method was used, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 [33], with modifications. Briefly, 10^6 conidia/mL of each tested compound was dispensed into 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) and incubated for 24 h at 35 °C in the dark. The MIC (in milliliters) was defined as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that inhibited visible growth of the tested organisms. The microdilution results were confirmed visually by the appearance of inhibition zones around the wells. The assay was repeated at least three times for each compound.


## Results
Cultures and pathogenicity
In the presence of 10^5 CFU/ml of L. alni, the incubation for 3 h decreased the growth of C. neoformans and C. gattii. However, the growth of C. neoformans was significantly suppressed by L. alni with increasing L. alni concentrations (p<0.0001, Fig 2A). L. alni also inhibited the growth of C. neoformans and C. gattii. Therefore, the fungicidal activity of L. alni against the C. neoformans and C. gattii was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig 2B). The wild-type strain of C. neoformans (Table 1) was used for the experiment.

Antifungal activity of L. alni against C. gattii
The antifungal activity of L. alni against C. neoformans was evaluated by the MICs and MFCs. The MICs and MFCs for L. alni were 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3, and 4 µg/ml, respectively. The MFC for C. neoformans was 2.5 µg/ml.

In the presence of 10^5 CFU/ml of L. alni, the growth of C. neoformans was suppressed by increasing L. alni concentrations (p<0.0001, Fig 2A). In the presence of 10^3 CFU/ml of L. alni, the growth of C. neoformans was suppressed by increasing L. alni concentrations (p<0.


## Discussion
The oral microbiota of children was generally dominated by bacteria and fungi, but the bacterial communities were mostly dominated by fung. The relative abundance of bacteria and fungi varied widely among the water environments. This pattern was observed in a wide range of water environments, including two commonly used agricultural water systems (Tianfen and its tap water) and two urban water systems (Raland Water, its drinking water, and its wastewater). Children’ water microbiomes were dominated by fungi, while their bacterial communities were dominated by bacteria. The relative abundance of fungi was relatively stable over the study period, but was dramatically changed in the study period. The relative abundance of bacteria and fungi in water environments ranged from 6.8% to 12.7% over the study period. In contrast, the relative abundance of fungi was stable over the study period. The relative abundance of fungi varied substantially between water environments, but was significantly increased over time. The relative abundance of fungi varied significantly from one water environment to another over the study period. The relative abundance of fungi varied substantially between water environments and children’ water microbiomes. The relative abundance of fungi varied significantly from one water environment to another over the study period. Children’ water microbiomes were dominated by fungi, while their bacterial communities were dominated by bacteria.
