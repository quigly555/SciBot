## Abstract
Phytophthora infestans is a rice-blast pathogen that can devastate crops or cause disease in non-ornamental hosts. Survival of Phytophthora infestans in the absence of sex is crucial for the fungus to establish and progress in sexual development. In mating systems, sexual reproduction involves two individuals with opposite mating types, a haploid and a diploid progeny. These diploids switch between fertile haploid and diploid states to form a viable population with limited sporulation. Phylogenetic transitions in P. infestans are less well-studied. We used genome sequencing and gene expression analyses to map sex-specific genes to 14 species of the fungal kingdom and found that several inbred lineages are divergent from the population of non-ornamental strains and that larger numbers of non-ornamental haploids are more similar to non-lesions in the non-lemonoid or diploid kingdoms. The analysis also showed that the changes in gene content and inbreeding variation among lineages were driven primarily by species and not by sex. Our work identifies specific sex-specific genes that influence gene expression, suggesting that sex-biased gene expression may have driven major changes in reproductive success in Phytophthora infestans.

Phytophthora infestans is an important rice pathogen that can devastate rice production and cause drought and dieback. Sexual reproduction is a form of mitotic recombination that is controlled by two individuals with opposite mating types, a trait that is frequently found in the non-lemonoid kingdoms.


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The increasing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, development of new drugs, and development of vaccines has made the incidence of IFI a reality. Furthermore, many pathogens remain at a constant state of development, development, and resurgence due to the recent advances in medical technology. The etiologic agents of IFI are a group of opportunistic fungi that can cause either asymptomatic or severe infections in immunocompromised patients. The most common are Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (1). The other opportunistic fungi are the causative agents of skin infections, pneumonia, liver abscess, and skin lesions in otherwise healthy individuals. The global incidence of IFI in patients with hematologic malignancies is estimated at over 300,000 per year and the mortality is almost 40% (2). The morbidity of IFI is high with mortality rates of up to 80% in the absence of other risk factors (3). In the absence of effective antifungal therapy, the incidence of IFI can rise to as high as 80% and is as high as 70% (4). The mycosis in sub-Saharan Africa is the third most common cause of fungal meningitis in adults and the third most common cause of fatal fungal pneumonia in this region in 2016 (5). The high mortality rate and high lethality rate of IFI have led to a search for new antifungal agents with improved safety profiles and reduced toxicity, especially against pathogenic fungi.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that approximately 1.5 million people develop IFIs annually, with 1.


## Methods
For the test, a fungal pathogen was isolated from a human erythrocyte cultur. The fungal pathogen was identified with the method of Banerjee et al. (2009) and the results of the UPLC-TO-PCR were as follows: positive identification of pathogen was confirmed by growth on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30 °C for 1 h and by the presence of visible colony morphology on PDA at 30 °C for 20 h. The fungal pathogen was then purified with the PDB system and tested for the presence of fungal growth in the form of a thick, circular erythrocyte erythrocyte mycelium and the absence of visible erythrocyte granules. The determination of fungal infection was carried out in terms of number of macrophages per erythrocyte per macrophage colony by a standard assay method [15].


## Results
If the phagocytosis assay detects a single spore, it is possible that all spore fragments contained in the cuticle were differentially abundant in the parasites of the same specie. If the spore fraction were classified as a mixture of free and the donor, the total number of spore fragments would be lower (see Figure 4). We found that the total number of spore fragments was higher in the parasitic parasites of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata than in the other parasites. However, the number of spore fragments in the host (total number of spore fragments in each species) was higher in the parasite of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata than in the other parasites.

To further examine the parasitism of different species of fungi, we infected mice with different numbers of parasites from the C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis groups. We first examined the susceptibility of mice to the different parasitism groups by measuring the rate of the infection in the infected lung. We found that, of the infected mice infected with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, the parasites were more resistant to the infection of C. parapsilosis than the other parasites. In contrast, the infected mice infected with C. parapsilosis showed a lower susceptibility to the infection of C. albicans than the other parasites. The parasite efficiency of the infected mice was evaluated by the evaluation of the fungal burden (Figure 5). Parasite loads of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis were 3.3×10^4/ml, 3.3×10^5/ml, and 5.6×10^5/ml, respectively, and the infection of C. parapsilosis was 1.4×10^7/ml. In contrast, the fungus load of C. parapsilosis was 3.9×10^5/ml. The fungal burdens of C. parapsilosis, C. parapsilosis, and C. parapsilosis groups were 3.


## Discussion
The results showed that the Lepiotropic nematode parasite (JapC) was the most efficient larval parasite in this study, and the parasite-killing mechanism of this parasite was highly efficient against both parasites (Figure 2A and 2B. However, the Lepiotropic nematode parasites (JapC) and the larval parasite (JapH) were the least efficient, and the larval parasite (JapC) was the most efficient parasite against Lepiotropes (Figure 2A). In addition, the Lepiotropes were the most efficient parasite against Lepiotropes (Figure 2B).
