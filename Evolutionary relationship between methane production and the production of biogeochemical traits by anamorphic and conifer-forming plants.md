## Abstract
The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii is the etiological agent of world-wide decline, as it undergoes rapid genome transformation to evade the immune surveillance of the host cells. The ability of the fungus to transition from yeast to hyphal growth and replication is a hallmark of its virulence, and the switch from yeast to hyphal growth is controlled by a secretory pathway. The CWR pathway controls filamentous growth and development, and we now show that the CWR pathway is also controlled by a secretory pathway that is dispensable for normal development and reproduction. Our work addresses the origin of the hyphae, which the CWR pathway controls, and also the key virulence traits that underlie this difference.


## Introduction
The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent model for studying zebrafish interactions with nematodes. The high-affinity nematode-specific innate immune system in the zebrafish provides a platform to explore host-to-host interactions with nematodes [1-3]. Zebrafish nematodes are also equipped with a variety of specialized body systems including the trophic apparatus, immune system, and venom, which allow the zebrafish to interact with nematodes. The trophic apparatus consists of specialized organs that are enclosed by a complex network of specialized organs [4-7]. In addition to the well-conserved immune system in many animals, the immune system in the zebrafish is also well-conserved [8]. The trophic system is composed of specialized organs that are enclosed by a complex network of specialized organs [9-13]. The immune system in zebrafish is also well-conserved [14-18].

The trophic system is composed of specialized organs that are enclosed by a complex network of specialized organs. There are two major immune cell types (type 1 and type 2) [7]. Type 1 cells are neutrophils and macrophages, which are specialized for killing the invading pathogens. The type 2 cells are dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes, which are specialized for intracellular killing. The type 1 cells are macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) and they are specialized for the killing of intracellular pathogens. The type 2 cells are eosinophils and lymphocytes, which are specialized for the differentiation of microorganisms. The phagocytic system consists of macrophages and eosinophils, which are specialized for phagocytosis [19-22].

## Results
For the analysis, we sequenced the combined ITS, tef1, and rpb2 sequences for the four subgenomes of Pleosporale. From the combined dataset, we found that the majority of the sequences were identical (90.6%), indicating that the three main groups in Pleosporales are taxa with distinct taxonomic groups. The most similar sequences were identified in all four subgenomes (Tables 1 and 2), but the results were not consistent with those in the other analyses (Figure 2). However, the low sequence similarity of the ITS sequences in the four subgenomes is a sign of a recent divergence from the core fungal lineages in the genus Pleosporales.

The Pleosporales fungal taxon is dominated by members of the orders Pleosporales and Tremellales. Both Tremellales and Pleosporales are frequently found in the subgenome of Pleosporales species, but in Pleosporales species, Pleosporales taxa are widespread, particularly in the subgenome of Pleosporaceae. In addition, Pleosporaceae taxa are ubiquitous and sometimes occur in terrestrial ecosystems [10]. For our analysis, we chose to focus on Pleosporales taxa that were recently described in Pleosporales. These taxa include, for the first time, two highly supported lineages of Pleosporaceae: Pleosporales taxa Dothideomycetes and Tremellales (Figure 3).

The current Pleosporales taxon is poorly supported by bootstrap analyses and therefore can not be used for phylogenetic analyses. The two most parsimonious trees (Figure 3) of the results obtained with the concatenated data are presented in Figure 4. The first tree (Figure 4) showed that the Pleosporales taxon is well supported by concatenated data, but also shows that the taxon is poorly supported in the concatenated data (data not shown).

Analysis of the mtSSU sequences of Pleosporales
The results of the concatenated data of the two most parsimonious trees (Figure 3) were consistent with the trees obtained with concatenated data.


## Discussion
2012. However, the results from our study indicated that hydrocarbons and hydroxycinnamic acids (especially hydroxycinnamic acids and cinnamic acids) in the soils of tomato, Populus, and Prunus were mainly responsible for the biotic and abiotic stresses induced by the presence of these hydroxyls, which are also present in the rhizosphere of P. gigantea and P. tricornutum (Fig 5B). However, in contrast to these results, previous studies indicated that the biotic and abiotic stress caused by hydroxycinnamic acids is largely related to the production of secondary metabolites, and therefore its use was mainly inhibited by the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids in the soils of P. gigantea and P. tricornutum (González-Ocampo et al. 2007). In contrast, the current studies showed that the biotic stress caused by hydroxycinnamic acids is mainly related to the formation of secondary metabolites, which are generally distributed in the rhizosphere of P. gigantea and P. tricornutum (González-Ocampo et al. 2007). The carbon source and biosynthetic intermediates of these secondary metabolites could be taken up by the fungal pathogens P. tricornutum, P. gigantea, and P. tricornutum in the rhizosphere of P. gigantea and P. tricornutum (González-Ocampo et al. 2007). Moreover, the genus Populus was isolated from the rhizosphere of P. gigantea and P. tricornutum (González-Ocampo et al. 2007), which was a high relative of the genera Pichia, Aspergillus, and Aspergillus in the studies (González-Ocampo et al. 2007).
