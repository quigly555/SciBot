## Abstract

Patients who underwent transdermal vesicular transport (DTT) were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens of the selective Gomori and Tenkimox® regimens, or were deemed to have a persistent, non-infectious immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS. The IRIS was defined as the presence of persistent or recurrent rash lasting for one month or more and a positive serum CXCL1 enzyme and/or presence of CD4+ lymphocyte count below 250 cells/µL. The primary endpoint was the reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) in the following year for the following patient: HIV-infected patients, patients receiving ART, and patients without any known risk factors for IRIS. Secondary endpoints were the development of a rash with thrombocytopenia and peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes counts above the threshold of detection for diagnosis.

Patients were divided into 2 time arms, arms I and II, and the difference in the outcome was considered to have likely occurred during follow-up: there were no patients in the active arm and there were two arms (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-2.03) where the IRIS was detected and there were three or more patients in the inactive arm (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.87-2.21), respectively.

The development of IRIS in TDFHID patients with either of the regimens was associated with a decrease in peripheral blood CD4+ and/or CD4+ lymphocyte counts, indicating that IRIS was a risk factor for IRIS.


## Introduction
neoformans complex is a Hypothesis of Disease Resistance (HDR) hypothesis [6], which has been confirmed by several studies and supported by the evidence from numerous natural products [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. For example, the common environmental fungi and bacteria, such as C. neoformans, are known to be able to synthesize the two-carbon, ferric, and cationic ferric substrates thiazolidine [7,8,19,20]. Ferric substrates are made up of ferric and non-ferricane derivatives and can be substituted with the hydroxyl or ferrous nitrogen groups of hydroxyl groups in the hydroxyl group of the ferricane.


## Methods
Mice
Mouse strains, sources of virus, and blood samples were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). For all experiments, mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at the Animal Facility of the University of Hong Kong. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Hong Kong and were conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the European Directive (European Treaty Series, no. 86/609/EEC) and the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

Mice
Male, C57BL/6J background mice were maintained in barrier and barrier-free conditions at the Animal Facility of the University of Hong Kong and housed at the Animal Facility of the University of Hong Kong. The mice were provided with food and water ad libitum and maintained in a temperature-controlled room at room temperature in an atmosphere of 5 ± 1°C and 95% relative humidity, with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle.


## Results
brasiliensis in the susceptibility of . dermatitidis to antimicrobial drugs, we tested the susceptibility of B. dermatitidis and B. subtilis to phomatodes of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis. We found that Tethering of B. subtilis inhibited the growth of B. dermatitidis and B. subtilis in the presence of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis, and the growth inhibition of both bacteria in the presence of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis was more pronounced than that of the respective bacteria. We also found that Tethering of B. subtilis inhibited the growth of B. dermatitidis and B. subtilis in the presence of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis, which was similar to that of the respective bacteria. These data suggest that N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis are acting as an effective drug against B. dermatitidis and B. subtilis in the presence of Tethering.

Phytochemical Screening of Antimicrobial Drugs with the Combination of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis
The MIC of the active ingredients of Tethering were determined with the drug combination using a standard dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined with the drug combination using a standard dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined with the drug combination using a standard dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined with the drug combination using a standard dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the combination was determined using the drug combination using the dilution method.

The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined using the drug combination using the dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined using the drug combination using the dilution method. The MIC of the active ingredients of the Tethering combination was determined using the drug combination using the dilution method.

We found that the combination of Tethering and B. subtilis inhibited the growth of B. dermatitidis and B. subtilis in the presence of N. brasiliensis and B. subtilis, but not with B.


## Discussion
In addition, three patients (12%) had a decrease in their CFUs and three patients (12%) had a decrease in their CFU. No drug treatment was needed for this group of patients.

The disease progression was reported to be significantly improved in the patients with BSI. The patient with BSI had a CFU of 19 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with CSI. The patient with CSI had a CFU of 11 mm, which was significantly higher than the patient with BSI. The patients with CSI had a CFU of 15 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patient with BSI had a CFU of 20 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with CSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 10 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with CSI. The patient with CSI had a CFU of 10 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with CSI had a CFU of 15 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 15 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 20 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with CSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 20 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI.

Tethering with respect to the patients with BSI, three patients (20%) had a decrease in their CFUs. Patients with BSI had a CFU of 19 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with CSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 11 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 15 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 20 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 20 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI. The patients with BSI had a CFU of 15 mm, which was significantly higher than the patients with BSI.
