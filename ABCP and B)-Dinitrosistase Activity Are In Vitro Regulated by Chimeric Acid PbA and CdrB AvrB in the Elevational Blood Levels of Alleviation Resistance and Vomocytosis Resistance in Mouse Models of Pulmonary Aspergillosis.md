## Abstract
We investigated the effects of treatment with anidulafungin, anidulafungin, anidulafungin, or ß-d-glucosidase inhibitor (epentasin, ecotin, or eugenol) on growth, morphology, and cytokine expression in Aspergillus fumigatus. The treatment of the inoculum with anidulafungin, ecotin, or eugenol resulted in a decrease in the mycelial growth, a decrease in the enzyme activity, and a decrease in cytokine expression. The growth and the cytokine expression were not affected by treatment with epentasin, ecotin, or eugenol. These data suggest that, in A. fumigatus, pentasin has an inhibitory effect on the growth, the enzyme activity, and the cytokine expression. In addition, the inhibition effect of epentasin and eugenol on both mycelial growth and cytokine expression were opposite. This indicates that, in the absence of epentasin, ecotin, or eugenol, growth and cytokine expression were not affected by treatment with epentasin, ecotin, or eugenol.


## Introduction
The genus Acanthamoeba contains a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. Some species are opportunistic pathogens such as A. baumannii, A. lentulus, A. nomius, A. niger and A. terreus [1,2,3]. A. baumannii is considered to be an emerging pathogen in tropical and subtropical regions and has been responsible for infection of thousands of people in the Americas, including the Caribbean islands [4]. A. terreus is a frequent soil saprophyte and a major threat to crop production in the sugarcane industry in the USA [5]. A. terreus is also a human pathogenic fungus and causes keratitis, allergic contact dermatitis, ocular infection and chronic rhinosinusitis [6,7]. A. baumannii is a saprophytic, filamentous and obligate symbiont of the Acanthamoeba genus, which produces a large number of secondary metabolites, including mycosporines, sespeclinines, tetracycline, dicyclone compounds and trypsin [8]. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is a major source of energy in the production of biofuels and chemicals [9,10].

The global annual production of oil and gas mainly consists of agricultural, forest, industrial and non-agriculture residues such as paper, pulp and agricultural commodities [11]. In the last two decades, the global production of agricultural residues such as fertilizers and chemicals increased substantially.


## Methods
W303 is a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis, which was routinely cultured in DMEM for at least 3-4 month. W303 cells were cultured in medium containing 10% FBS. For visualization, W303 cells were pelleted and resuspended in DMEM and cultured in 96-well plates. The cells were then labeled with 10 µM of p-nitrophenyl-ß-D-propionic acid (pNPG), 1 µM of biotinylated chitin (Amp) and 1 µM of chitosan (S-35B). The cell culture was then incubated at 37°C for 30 min, washed twice with PBS and stained with DAPI (Pall) at 4°C for 10 min. To visualize the pulmonary epithelial cells, the cells were observed by confocal microscopy (Olympus BX51, Tokyo, Japan) and fluorescence was quantified by determining the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells. The amount of the p-nitrophenylated N-glycosylation was estimated by using the ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2014).

The amount of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was also assayed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).


## Results
fumigatus, the expression of the chimeric acid precursor chsA was examined by Western blot analysi. Analysis of the chsA transcript level in a murine model of pulmonary aspergillosis was also performed to test for changes in the expression of chsA in response to environmental conditions. As shown in Figure 7, a significant increase was observed in the expression of chsA in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2 or 0.5 mM K_2NO_2, and the amount of chsA was increased by approximately 30-fold in the presence of 0.5 mM H_2O_2, compared with the absence of H_2O_2, suggesting that the chsA expression was induced by H_2O_2 and not by K_2NO_2, as shown in Figure 7A. This result indicates that chsA expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM H_2O_2, and that the chsA transcript level was induced in the presence of 0.5 mM K_2NO_2.

To further explore the function of chsA in A. fumigatus, we used a deletion mutant of the endogenous gene of the chitin synthase gene chsA (GenBank: AY44291) in which the corresponding gene was deleted. As shown in Figure 8A, the expression of the gene was significantly increased by approximately 40-fold in the deletion mutant. Expression of the gene was further increased by approximately 30-fold in the presence of 0.5 mM H_2O_2, compared with the absence of H_2O_2, which was not accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of the gene in the presence of 1 mM H_2O_2, indicating that the chsA transcript level was induced by 1 mM H_2O_2 or K_2NO_2, compared with that in the absence of H_2O_2. The expression of the gene was also increased by approximately 30-fold in the presence of 0.5 mM H_2O_2 or by approximately 30-fold in the absence of H_2O_2, compared with that in the presence of 0.5 mM K_2NO_2.


## Discussion
COPD is defined by chronic pulmonary inflammation affecting the lungs, affecting the lungs in multiple organs, such as liver, lungs, lungs, and brain [5. The pathogenesis of COPD is related to the production of prostaglandins and other proinflammatory mediators. COPD is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty acid alterations that are associated with a high lipid content [6]. Over the past two decades, there has been an increasing trend of increasing levels of proinflammatory mediators and glyoxylate and citrulline (GAP) [7]. The GAP is synthesized by G-CSF, which is the main component of the G-CSF complex, which is composed of two large G-CSF rings with the first one containing the proinflammatory mediators TNF-a and IL-6 and the second one containing the glyoxylate and citrulline (GAP) molecules [7]. In addition, the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are regulated by G-CSF and increased GAP levels have been reported [8]. The modulation of the expression of the various cytokines and chemokines by G-CSF in the pulmonary lung, in addition to the GAP complex, suggests that the interrelation of G-CSF and the activation of G-CSF is linked to COPD.

The differential expression of the GAP and the GAP complex in the lungs and the other organs suggested that the cells in the lung are infected with a Th2-like cytokine and, in some cases, that the pulmonary infection is accompanied by a Th1-like cytokine, which induces a strong inflammatory response [8]. The induction of Th2-like cytokines and chemokines in the lungs suggests that the infected cells are infected with a Th2-like cytokine and, in some cases, that the pulmonary infection is accompanied by a Th1-like cytokine, which induces a strong inflammatory response [8]. This phenomenon was also reported in the lungs of patients with COPD [9].
