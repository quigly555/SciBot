## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen causing life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IFPA) in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus fumigatus causes the most frequent invasive disease of crops, livestock, and humans. Aspergillus fumigatus infections are usually caused by strains of the fungus responsible for the majority of Aspergillus fumigatus human and animals infections. This variability in disease prevalence and variability in the number of different species involved in each species group is a challenge to diagnosis and management. Here, we report the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data of 25 patients with Aspergillus infections, 17 patients with Aspergillus fungemia, and 15 patients with Aspergillus fumigatus infections. Fifty-two patients had confirmed invasive aspergillosis. Ninety-one patients had proven/probable fungemia. Five patients had skin infection and 24 had probable invasive aspergillosis.


## Introduction
 2017; Thomas et a., 2017). The disease is named as such due to the lack of the immune system of the human host.

Besides the existence of immune cells, the role of the immune system is also implicated in the survival of pathogens and the development of disease. Moreover, the ability to produce extracellular traps has been reported in some pathogens (Zea mays and nematodes), leading to infections of the urinary tract and central nervous system (Klemen and Mena, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2014). Moreover, the immune system of animals has been implicated in the development of disease and has a role in the interaction of pathogens and the host (Rintala and Maniak, 2012; Nguyen et al., 2014). For instance, the immune system of the pig avoids bacterial infection by producing antibodies against mast cells (Santos and Tabarelli, 2010; Tabarelli, 2014). Furthermore, in some pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the immune system triggers a phage-mediated phagocytosis system that kills invading pathogens (Nguyen et al., 2014).

Infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites typically cause a low-grade fever, usually asymptomatic or mild at first, with symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, weight loss, nausea, diarrhea, and myalgias. However, in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy, the development of viral infections such as those caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cryptococcus neoformans can cause a primary inflammatory infiltrate of the central nervous system and disseminated infection. The most common forms of infection in patients with HIV/AIDS and those undergoing chemotherapy are associated with the encapsulated yeasts and filamentous fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neo) and Trichosporon asahii (C. neo-sp.) (Brennan et al., 2009). In addition, there is an emerging concern about the development of resistance to antifungal agents by Cryptococcus neoformans and the development of resistance to antifungal agents by other Cryptococcus neo species (Moss et al., 2007; Bhattacharyya et al.


## Methods
The clinical stage was defined as follows: (1) disease, (2) fever, (3) hypothermia, (4) severe fever, (5) cough, (6) purulent thymus, (7) meningitis, (8) acute myelitis, (9) aseptic meningitis, and (10) othe. For HIV-1 isolates, the mean duration of antifungal therapy was 3 months and the median duration of antifungal therapy was 3 months. HIV-1 isolates were defined as those with a history of at least one of the following: (1) herpes simplex virus (HSV) [40]; (2) syphilis [41]; (3) others [43]; (4) other CNS infection [44]; (5) other CNS infection [45]; (6) other CNS infection [46].

The median duration of antifungal therapy was 6 months. The median duration of viral suppression was 4 months. The median duration of non-HIV-1 isolates was 1 month. The median duration of bacterial meningitis was 1 month. The median duration of other CNS infection was 2 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 3 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 3 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 4 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 4 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 5 months. The median duration of other CNS infection was 8 months.

In the first few days of ART, antifungal therapy was considered as effective, if it had been stopped within 2 weeks of ART. If the patient started ART within 3 weeks after ART, and the median duration of antifungal therapy was 5 months, the median duration of antifungal therapy was 3 months. If the patient started ART within 3 weeks after ART, the median duration of antifungal therapy was 5 weeks. If the patient started ART within 4 weeks after ART, and the median duration of antifungal therapy was 5 weeks, the median duration of antifungal therapy was 7 weeks.


## Results
The mechanism of the epidemics is not know. The case fatality rate for HIV was approximately 3%.

Table 2 presents the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in the United States and China, using the CDC's latest estimate of the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis (2013). The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in the United States was estimated to be 0.11% (95% CI 0.09-0.15%) per 100,000 persons. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 1.3% (95% CI 0.2-3.3%) per 100,000 persons (2.9% per 100,000 persons).

Cases of cryptococcal meningitis were estimated to have a risk ratio (RR) of 1.68 (95% CI 1.22-2.08) per 100,000 persons. The RR of the underlying cause of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 1.13 (95% CI 1.13-2.03) per 100,000 persons.

In contrast, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 0.11% (95% CI 0.09-0.15%) per 100,000 persons. The RR of the underlying cause of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 0.11 (95% CI 0.06-0.15%) per 100,000 persons. The RR of the underlying cause of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 1.23 (95% CI 1.22-2.08) per 100,000 persons. The estimated risk of cryptococcal meningitis was 0.22 (95% CI 0.04-0.27) per 100,000 persons (0.43% per 100,000 persons).

Efficacy of the antifungal agents
We evaluated the efficacy of antifungal agents. The efficacy of the tested drugs was compared with the results of the individual case-fatality rate. For the United States, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 0.11% (95% CI 0.09-0.15%) per 100,000 persons. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis was estimated to be 0.11% (95% CI 0.09-0.15%) per 100,000 persons (1.


## Discussion
Evaluation of the stability and biological functions of the P. microsporus species complex
The P. microsporus complex is composed of seven species: P. microsporus, P. polymorpha, P. fuckeliana, P. microsporus var. polymorpha, P. polymorpha var. trichophorum, and P. microsporus var. blakesleeanus. These species form distinct groups of fungi that have been reported from different environments [20], and thus, phylogenetic analyses are used to determine the phylogeny of these fungi. In this study, we used two P. microsporus species, P. microsporus var. polymorpha and P. polymorpha, to investigate the stability and biological functions of the P. microsporus species complex. The P. microsporus species complex was originally described by Klassen et al. [20]. The P. microsporus complex is characterized by a large number of genetic clusters, including the MAT locus, the mating type locus, the ÃŸ-tub and the exon-intron loci. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the P. microsporus species complex, which is well-studied in the literature, and which has been subjected to numerous phylogenetic analyses [21,22]. The results showed that the P. microsporus species complex contained six species, with the most common and rare clades in this study, as well as several phylogenetic clusters, including several distinct genera, subfamilies, and species groups.

In this study, we compared the P. microsporus species complex to other fungi. The P.
