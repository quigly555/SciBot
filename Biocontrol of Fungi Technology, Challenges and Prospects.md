## Abstract
In recent years, advances in diagnosing cryptococcosis have led to increased availability of limited-needle aspiration bronchodours (BECs), which are the first line of defence against cryptococcosi. These fine-needle aspiration biopsies are commonly conducted to establish a disease structure or profile, but have their inherent biases limited interpretation using standard laboratory techniques that are not sensitive enough. This study aimed to develop a computational diagnostic test to deal with these biases and to test the impact of various sample size factors on a lateral flow BEC tomography (LFBL) biopsy.

We tested three BECs samples with different sample sample samples per sample: 0.5 ml (C. albicans) and 10 ml (F. neoformans). We tested three sample types: 0.5 ml (F. neoformans) C. albicans, 10 ml (F. neoformans) and 0.5 ml (F. grubii) using LFA. We compared sample features with results from the T1-weighted non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and the logit-categorical t-test statistic.

We generated a pipeline and used it to explore the sample features with differences in sample sample samples sample size factors (ml:w, ml:h, h:v). The analysis pipeline used 512 BECs samples were divided into 12 groups. The difference between groups was significant (P < .0001). The overall procedure involved using LFA and T1-tetramer t tests to compare sample features with T1-tetramer t-values (P < .0001) and T1-t-values (P < .0003).

For this study, the sample size factor T1-tetrameric acid (T1-TB) samples were divided into 13 groups. The difference between the 13 groups was significant (P < .0001) and there was significant heterogeneity (P < .0001). The overall procedure involved using LFA and t1-tetrameric acid t-values (P < .0001) and T1-t-values (P < .0003). The overall result was performed by computing the t-value (P < .0001), and the statistical analysis was conducted by R software.


## Introduction
In the United States, the most common manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients is cryptococcal meningitis with a mortality rate of 44% [2, 3. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cryptococcal meningitis is the third leading cause of death from AIDS in Africa and the Americas [4]. However, Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients is often associated with a low incidence, and is not recognized by the WHO until HIV patients are admitted to the ICU. The early detection and early diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients is essential to improve outcomes.

A diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is always delayed. The clinical presentation varies from an early meningitis to diffuse diffuse shock, and sometimes life-threatening measures must be taken in cases of severe immunosuppression [5]. In the absence of an accurate diagnosis, early laboratory tests often fail to detect cryptococcal meningitis and require hospitalization [6]. Diagnostic laboratory tests are sensitive, specific, and specific for cryptococcal meningitis. Therefore, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing is the gold standard for CrAg detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the CrAg test is used to identify cryptococcal meningitis. However, the CrAg test is insensitive and time-consuming [7]. Therefore, a rapid CrAg test is recommended as an alternative to the CrAg test.

In the United States, national CrAg prevalence rates are estimated to be 2.6% in the meningitis population [8]. Of these, 3.1% may be due to a non-specificity of clinical presentation, and 3.7% may be due to a non-specificity of cryptococcal disease. The meningitis incidence may be as high as 10 cases per 100,000 inhabitants [9]. CrAg is detectable in CSF and is a valuable diagnostic tool for CrAg detection in the CSF. However, a lack of CrAg in the CSF is a major reason for the low prevalence rate of CrAg detection in the CNS [10].

## Discussion
The presence of opportunistic infections, such as cryptococcosis, tuberculosis, and HIV infection, are the most common causes of immunodeficienc. Although the occurrence of HIV infection has been increasing, the overall incidence of HIV infection has been declining.2 The incidence of HIV infection has been declining rapidly, although it is still increasing.3, 4, 5 The incidence of tuberculosis is increasing.6 In addition, tuberculosis is now the most common cause of non-AIDS-related death.8, 9, 10

The pathogenic mechanisms of tuberculosis infection are diverse. Both human and microbial pathogens, such as influenza virus, influenza-1, and Influenza-2, are capable of causing severe pulmonary infections in humans.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 However, the pathogenic mechanisms of tuberculosis infection remain unclear.

In the present study, a high prevalence of tuberculosis was observed in five patients. The prevalence of tuberculosis was higher in patients with HIV infection. In addition, several clinical characteristics were identified, such as low CD4 counts, hepatitis C virus infection, and hepatitis C virus infection. HIV infection is the most common infection in HIV-positive patients. Although the clinical manifestations of HIV infection are different from those of HIV infection, the presence of HIV infection complicates the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection. HIV infection is often associated with high mortality. The prevalence of HIV infection has been increasing in recent years.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 The prevalence of HIV infection in patients with HIV infection has increased over the years, and the incidence of HIV infection in HIV-infected patients is increasing.

Although tuberculosis infection is a rare disease, the incidence of tuberculosis infection is still significant.2, 3, 24 In the present study, tuberculosis infection was the main reason of death among HIV patients.

The most common causes of death in HIV-infected patients were abscesses, the skin and mucous membranes, as well as the central nervous system. The highest mortality occurred in patients with leukemias, and the most common skin lesions were molluscum contagiosum, peritonitis, and cellulitis. The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis infection are similar to those in HIV infection. The main causes of death among HIV patients were abscesses, skin lesions, and cellulitis.
