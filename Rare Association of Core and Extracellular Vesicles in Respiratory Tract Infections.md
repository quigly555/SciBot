## Abstract
Meningeal biopsies have been widely used to diagnose various diseases. Cryptococcus gattii is a human pathogen that causes cryptococcosis. However, the sensitivity of biopsy samples is unknown.

We used an immunocompetent patient with pulmonary lesions for imaging and a history of atypical antibody responses to fluconazole in the hope that a biopsy sample might reveal cryptococcosis.

Imaging showed multiple encapsulated yeast colonies on a slide, and microscopic examination revealed many yeast cells. However, the microscopic results for antibody responses to fluconazole were poor.

Immunocompetent patients with pulmonary lesions had a higher sensitivity of cryptococcosis compared to immunocompromised patients.

The cryptococcosis in the biopsy was more rapid compared to immunocompromised patients.

Immunocompetent patients with pulmonary lesions had a higher sensitivity of cryptococcosis compared to immunocompromised patients.

The antifungal susceptibility of the patient population was high compared to immunocompromised patients.

The patient was a immunocompetent patient for more than 2 years. The patient had multiple organ failure, and the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly.

The patient's biopsy revealed the presence of various yeast colonies on a slide, and the biopsy revealed a high burden of fungi.

The patient's condition improved rapidly after the administration of fluconazole.

The patient was a immunocompetent patient for up to 2 years.


## Introduction
2009) have been identified in all three major subtypes of sepsis and the major subtypes of HSI (Jami et a. 2012). While most cases of sepsis and meningitis are not caused by viruses or other microorganisms, sepsis and meningitis caused by other etiologies are, nevertheless, caused by both bacterial and fungal organisms (Yasmin et al. 2005; Rasche et al. 2012).

The etiology of sepsis remains unclear, although it is thought that etiological agents can be divided in three broad groups: those that cause disease in healthy individuals, those that cause disease in immunocompromised patients, and those that are associated with malignancy, such as transplant recipients, patients with underlying immunosuppression, and patients receiving chemotherapy (Chen et al. 2014). A high prevalence of etiologies that lead to sepsis is thought to be found in those with underlying disease, but there is also evidence for a low prevalence in those with more severe disease (Gill et al. 2013).

Nontypeal enteric pathogens (ETGs) are an emerging group of pathogens that are associated with infection in both healthy and immunocompromised patients (Chen et al. 2014). Approximately one-half of all individuals develop at least one bacterial infection, and about half succumb to bacterial infection (Kong et al. 2008). The etiologies of infections in this group of pathogens are not well understood. However, the incidence of enteric pathogens has increased in recent years, and is now thought to be increasing in patients with septicemia or a history of septicemia (Bhattacharya et al. 2015). Additionally, the etiologies of other etiologies have increased in recent years, including Chlamydia pneumoniae (Chlamydi and Johnson 2005), non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pneumonia (Dujisit et al. 2010), and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pneumonia (Liu et al. 2014).

NTM pneumonia is an uncommon respiratory infection caused by the thermally dimorphic NTM pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.


## Methods
 × 10^6 . albicans cells in the 3-mL Falcon tubes were added to 5 mL of RPMI-1640 medium (without bicarbonate and ammonium sulfate), and the incubation was continued for 24 h. A solution of 3,4-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) was then added, and the plates were kept at 30°C. The adherent cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed with RPMI-1640 medium. The number of adherent cells was counted.

The cells in the 3-mL Falcon tubes were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 medium, and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 10^6 cells/mL. Then, 200 µL of this suspension was added to 1 mL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 1 × 10^6 C. albicans cells and the incubation was continued for 24 h. A solution of 3,4-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) was then added, and the plates were kept at 30°C. The adherent cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed with RPMI-1640 medium. The number of adherent cells was counted.

For quantitative evaluation, the C. albicans cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium for 24 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (150 rpm). Then, 2 mL of this suspension was transferred to a sterile 0.45-µm filter (0.22-µm pore size, Perkin Elmer, Germany) and the number of adherent cells was counted.

2.3. Statistical Analysis
The data was analyzed with the statistical software program SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The numbers of errors for the tests are 2^-<U+0394><U+0394>^2, and the number of observations for each condition were compared with the control group. The experiments were performed in triplicate.


## Results
However, little is known about the role of the immune system in the clearance of the respiratory tract infectio. As described previously, we found that the extracellular contents of the defecated abscesses of C. albicans are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity, and that the effect on extracellular Vesicles is more pronounced in the defecated abscesses than in the normal cavity. Thus, our data are consistent with the idea that the extracellular contents of the defecated abscesses are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity. In addition, the extracellular contents of the defecated abscesses are similar to those of the normal cavity, suggesting that the extracellular Vesicles have not the ability to cleave the abscesses and thus were not responsible for the abscesses being cleared.

In the absence of a basal immune system, abscesses can be cleared by direct physical and biochemical means. For example, the extracellular contents of the defecated abscesses of C. albicans are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity. Similarly, the extracellular contents of the abscesses of C. albicans in the absence of an immune system are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity. In this case, the extracellular contents of the abscesses are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity. In addition, the extracellular contents of the defecated abscesses of C. albicans in the absence of an immune system are not significantly different from those of the normal cavity. Thus, the extracellular Vesicles are not the cause of the abscesses being cleared. The extracellular Vesicles are also not the cause of the abscesses being cleared.

The ability of the extracellular Vesicles to cleave the abscesses of C. albicans was examined by using a staining assay (Figure 2). The extracellular Vesicles were found to cleave the abscesses more efficiently than the normal cavitary Vesicles, and that the extracellular Vesicles also cleave more efficiently than the normal cavitary Vesicles (Figure 2).
