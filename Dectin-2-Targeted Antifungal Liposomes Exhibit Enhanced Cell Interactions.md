## Abstract
Marine organisms have been used in many industries, including the study of marine-derived organisms, bio-oil, and pharmaceuticals. As a result of these studies, many different marine organisms are commonly used in the treatment of illnesses related to diseases, pests, and infections. Many of these studies have been conducted using marine-living organisms, including mollusks, free-living amoebae, and yeasts, and this review covers the most recent studies on the use of marine-living organisms in the treatment of various ailments. The research on antimicrobial activity of marine-living organisms, whether microbial or solid-liquid-based, has been going on since the early 1980s. This review covers research articles published up to the present, including the most recent studies, as well as the most recent advances in the treatment of various illnesses caused by amoebae and microorganisms.


## Introduction

. neoformans has an important role to play in both as well as in agrochemical and biotechnology contexts. The main feature of C. neoformans glycoconjugates is their ability to bind to the ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. In the presence of the fungal cell membrane, C. neoformans activates sterol biosynthesis, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol. Ergosterol is a membrane sterol with an amide link to it. This interaction is required for ergosterol synthesis, and ergosterol synthesis itself is required for the synthesis of ergosterol and cell wall integrity [22]. The cell membrane also interacts with ergosterol and other sterols in C. neoformans. For example, the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in C. neoformans is inhibited by inhibition of ergosterol synthesis. In addition, inhibition of cell wall synthesis results in increased susceptibility to environmental stresses, such as heat and oxidative stresses, as well as from AMF and cycloheximide (CZ)-cycloserine-reactive (CR)-cyclobetasol (CZ)-cycloserine-reactive (CR-CR-CR). Furthermore, C. neoformans also activates the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in cells in response to temperature stress, which is similar to the response to heat shock in C. neoformans. Thus, C. neoformans glycoconjugates can bind to ergosterol, and binding of ergosterol to ergosterol in a cell membrane can induce cell death.

The global burden of cryptococcal disease is estimated to be as high as 1 million cases/year [23]. Indeed, in contrast to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcal meningitis, which is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is rare. Nevertheless, it is an important complication and an important cause of mortality in HIV-infected patients. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is also a major opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV disease. This condition is also associated with a high burden of mortality in patients with other immunocompromised conditions, such as those with cancer, who may require aggressive treatment.


## Methods
albicans was assessed using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) assa. The assay was performed in accordance with the previously described methodology [6], [7]. Briefly, the test was performed in 96-well plates in triplicate. The cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1% gelatin and 0.1% DMSO in complete medium (CM) (Becton Dickinson) for 24 h at 37°C. The A-HA or PbA-treated cells were added to the CM solution at a final concentration of 1.25 µM. The cells were then incubated with different concentrations of the A-HA or PbA-treated A. fumigatus in complete medium for 24 h at 37°C. The assay was performed in duplicate in 96-well plates.

## Results
coli induced by bile acid were significantly more effective than those of liposomal lipids of . coli. These results indicated that the liposomal lipids induced by bile acid induced by E. coli might be inducing cell membrane stress. In addition, the liposomal lipids induced by E. coli induced by bile acid induced by E. coli might be inducing an inflammatory response. These results suggested that the liposomal lipids induced by E. coli might be inducing a protective immune response against infection.

## Discussion
tuberculosis infection was associated with reduced proteolysis of PAMPs in vitro [28] and in vivo [29], [30], [31], [32], [33. In our experiments, we were able to increase the proteolytic activity of PAMPs from P. brasiliensis after incubation with the fungus. A notable difference in the proteolytic activity of PAMPs was the decreased ability of these strains to metabolize fatty acids, which is in line with the results of previous studies [29], [32].

The proteolytic activity of PAMPs is dependent on the presence of the Fenton reaction. This reaction is required for the degradation of lipids, a process that may be enhanced by the increased proteolytic activity of the fungus. In addition to the Fenton reaction, other Fenton reactions include the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (DHN-melanin) and the a-ketoacyl-acyltransferases (ALT-1 and ALT-2) that are produced by fungi. The synthesis of these enzymes is important for the transport of proteins from the extracellular space, such as proteins, to the extracellular space. The enzyme ALT-1 converts acetyl-CoA, a type of fatty acid, into acetyl-CoA, a precursor of triglycerides and oligosaccharides, which are required for the synthesis of triglycerides and glycerol [34]. The enzymes ALT-2 and ALT-1 are also important for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA [34], [35]. In addition, the enzyme ALT-2 is also required for the synthesis of oligosaccharides [35]. However, there is no previous report on the use of M. tuberculosis PAMPs as antifungal lipids.

The proteolytic activity of PAMPs was enhanced in vitro and in vivo following the stimulation with the fungus. It is known that M. tuberculosis PAMPs inhibit the growth of the fungus but not of the host. Previous studies have shown that PAMPs have a strong ability to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis [28], [30], [31]. The antifungal activity of PAMPs was not enhanced in vitro, but the proteolytic activity of PAMPs was increased in vivo.
