## Abstract
The acid protease subfamily CrzA is a key enzyme in the plasma membrane trafficking pathway that is essential for membrane trafficking and plasma-membrane tight junctions in most living cells. In this study, we identified and characterized a putative CrzA protein that encoded a unique core motif in the human C-terminal domain (CysD), which is induced upon encountering microorganisms that target this protein for degradation. Mutants lacking CrzA were unable to form biofilms or to form active nanovesicles, and the protein degraded in a manner consistent with the model yeast CrzA. Further analyses indicated that CrzA is required for the biosynthesis of the polyketide metabolites that are important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans. The deletion of the CrzA gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduced the virulence of C. albicans. The CrzA deletion mutant did not show any phenotypes other than hyphal growth, indicating that CrzA is required for the biofilm formation and the interaction with the host. Taken together, these results suggest that CrzA is essential for the survival of C. albicans in the host.

Cells rely on CrzA for important cellular functions. A deletion of the CrzA gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces the virulence of the yeast-growing pathogen. Cells lacking the CrzA gene in S. cerevisiae were unable to form biofilms and did not form active nanovesicles, suggesting that CrzA is essential for the biosynthesis of the polyketide metabolites that are important for the pathogenicity of C. albicans.


## Introduction
The commensal microflora of humans includes an extensive diversity of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and algae. Although the composition of the commensal microflora varies in healthy individuals, the composition of the commensal microbiota in healthy individuals varies between individuals. For instance, the commensal microbiota is more abundant in individuals with compromised immunity compared to healthy individuals. The richness of the commensal microbiota in healthy individuals has been estimated to be in the range of 10-20% of the total microbiota.7, 8 The diversity of the commensal microbiota in healthy individuals has been attributed to a high degree of taxonomy, including strains that are distributed in three phyla, namely phyla Dicostroma, Microsphaerium, and Epidermophyton.9-11 Microsphaerium and Dicostroma are closely related to fungi, whereas Microsphaerium and Dicostroma are morphologically indistinguishable.12 However, recent studies have shown that the diversity of the commensal microbiota in healthy individuals has been underestimated, due to the lack of taxonomical resolution and the lack of a well-described reference strain collection.9, 12 The composition of the commensal microbiota in healthy individuals has not been characterized, and in many cases the composition of the microbiota in healthy individuals has not been.

Diversity of the microbial community is defined as a community of microorganisms associated with one another and responding to environmental and host conditions.13, 14 One of the most important factors in determining the composition of the commensal microbiota is the number of individuals with at least one known reference strain. Because of the high diversity among strains, this number of individuals is expected to increase over time. Several studies have found that the number of individuals with known reference strains is highly correlated with the number of individuals who have at least one known reference strain.12, 15, 16

Many studies have utilized microsclerotia as markers to detect the diversity of the commensal microbiota. However, few studies have used microsclerotia as a marker of the diversity of the commensal microflora in healthy individuals.


## Methods
[14. Briefly, 10 µl of the assay solution was added to a 96-well plate and mixed with a solution of 0.1% Tween 80. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 90 min. The absorbance of the solution was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5R; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a UV transilluminator at a wavelength of 550 nm. The final compound concentration was 0.064 µg/ml. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that caused 80% inhibition of growth. The final concentrations of the compound were prepared in sterile water.

The MIC and the MIC_50 values of the compounds were determined for S. aureus ATCC 25923, C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. krusei ATCC 6258, and C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019. The test was carried out in triplicate. The drug was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain the desired concentrations. The test was performed in a 96-well plate at the final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the compound, which was then further diluted to achieve the desired final concentration. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 590 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5R; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a UV transilluminator at a wavelength of 550 nm. The final concentration of the compound was 0.064 µg/ml. The final concentration of the compound was prepared in sterile water.

The compound diameters of the antifungal drug were measured by measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5R; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The compound diameters were measured after incubation for 2 days at 37°C.


## Results
The results showed that the Peptide Capsular Polyphony and its antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were found to be at least six-fold higher than that of the Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans strains tested with the standard Candida albicans and Candida albicans strains, respectivel.

The MIC values of the peptides were determined to be 256 µg/ml for all the Candida albicans strains tested (Table 2). The MIC values of the peptide capsule were found to be between 256 and 1024 µg/ml for all the Candida albicans strains tested. The MIC values of the peptide capsule of the C. neoformans strain tested were found to be between 128 and 1024 µg/ml, but the MIC values of the C. neoformans strain were found to be between 1024 and 2048 µg/ml.

## Discussion

Based on our data, the compounds (15 and 18) could be considered as the potential antifungal compound. The structure and chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Table 1. The structure of compounds 15 and 18 showed the chemical structures of the compound 15.

The compounds 15 and 18 were found to be highly active against the strains of C. albicans ATCC18481 and C. krusei ATCC18482. However, in our study, the compound 18 was not found in the fungal extracts. Thus, our results indicate that the compound 15 and 18 could be considered as a novel antifungal agent.

The antifungal activity of compounds 15 and 18 against C. albicans ATCC18481 was evaluated against C. krusei ATCC18482.
