## Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of the bark bark of Cymbopogon winterianus leaves and the fractions from the roots of Crivellia subulata collected at Duesse, Ghana. The extract from the roots of Crivellia subulata showed the lowest antibacterial activity. The crude extract was fractionated by high-pressure methanol column separation and the fractions were separated using ethanol microdilution and the results were identified as xylan-hexosaminidase, xylan-hexosaminidase, xylan-methanolic extract and a-amylase. The xylan-hexosaminidase activity was higher than the other fractions tested. The a-amylase activities of the crude extracts and fractions were higher than those of the xylan-hexosaminidase. The xylan-hexosaminidase activities were higher than that of the other fractions tested. The xylan-hexosaminidase activities were also higher than the other fractions tested. Cymbopogon winterianus, Crivellia subulata and Curvularia tubulatum were the main pathogens of this study.


## Introduction
The genus Pristionchus contains important plant pathogens that cause a variety of infections in various plants. The plant pathogen P. japonicum (Japonicum sativus) is a frequent and serious problem in traditional Chinese medicine, where its infection is known to have been traditionally used for the treatment of rheumatism, fevers, depression, lethargy, insomnia, cough, constipation, urinary disorders, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, muscle pains, cough, and muscle pains (1). P. japonicum is a member of the tribe Japonicus in the family Japonulaceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of bioactive compounds (2). The isolation of P. japonicum from rice has been reported in 1879 by the Chinese medical botanist T.L. T. Chen, who proved the isolation of the compound amphotericin B. The compound has been used for the treatment of cough and dyspepsia in China for more than a century (3). The development of the last decades of the past century, have revealed the therapeutic potential of amphotericin B in the treatment of various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and hypertension (4). In this context, P. japonicum has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and anti-oxidant activities (5).

The most important features of P. japonicum are the production of exospecific and phenolic acids. These compounds can be synthesized in many techniques, such as by alkyl esters, lipases, and esterases (6). However, the most widely studied are the polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenols (7). In addition, the main compounds in P. japonicum have been characterized as alpha-pinene and chalcone, which are responsible for their phytochemical compositions and activities (8).


## Methods
In order to understand the role of VESV in the virulence of the Aspergillus sp. in the life cycle of these fungi, we used a previously described methodology [12]. Briefly, a culture of the fungal strains was grown in a fresh malt extract broth (MEB) medium at 37°C and used to inoculate a sterile 9 cm Petri dish with 0.5 ml of MM broth (PAA) and a 1:1 mixture of 1% (w/v) V8 juice (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% (w/v) v/v glucose. The cells were cultivated for 1 week at 37°C in a rotatory shaker at 180 rpm, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and kept at 37°C in the presence of 150 rpm shaking. The mycelium was collected by filtering through sterile miracloth, and subsequently cultivated on PAA slants for 7 days. The mycelium was then harvested by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper, washed with sterile distilled water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

2.4. Pathogenicity and Histology
C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. krusei ATCC 6258, and C. glaucus (ATCC 90028) were used as virulent and virulent control strains. The cells were cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 37°C and were routinely cultured in complete media. For histology, the mycelium was collected from seven-day-old culture cultures of C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, and C. glaucus ATCC 90028, and incubated at 37°C in a rotatory shaker at 180 rpm, and then washed with sterile distilled water and suspended in 100% methanol. The mycelium was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the residual mycelium, and then placed in a 37°C water bath and embedded in paraffin wax. The mycelium was treated with 0.5% agarose in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.

## Discussion
albicans were also thickened at the base of the hyphal cell, and that hyphae of . albicans were more polarized and organized than that of C. glabrata (Figure 4C). This finding suggested that this fungus, which was originally isolated from the lungs of human patients, is likely to be present in the tissues of humans, and that the fungal cells are migrating from the lung to the subarachnoid space.

We next sought to determine whether VTSV and VTSV-derived EVs can be transferred into and integrated into the hyphae of C. albicans. We selected three EVs from C. glabrata and three EVs from C. albicans and found that the three EVs could be transferred into C. albicans hyphae through the EV-like cell-like structures identified in VTSV-infected cells (Figure 5A, Figure 5B and Figure 5C). After addition of the EVs to the cell-like structures, we found that all three EVs had similar structures. To assess whether the EV-like cell-like structures observed in the hyphae of C. albicans were functionally similar to those in the cells of C. glabrata, we used two different EVs (Figure 5A and Figure 5C) for the EV-like cell-like structures of C. albicans and C. glabrata cells. We found that the C. albicans EVs could be transferred into C. glabrata hyphae through the EV-like cell-like structures identified in VTSV-infected C. albicans cells (Figure 5A, Figure 5C), but we also found that the C. albicans EVs could be transferred into C. glabrata hyphae through the EV-like cell-like structures identified in VTSV-infected C. albicans cells (Figure 5A, Figure 5C). These results suggest that the EV-like structures observed in the C. albicans EVs could be functionally similar to those in C. glabrata cells.

To assess whether EVs were functionally similar to those in the cells of C.
