## Abstract
In this study, the effect of different levels of solvent extraction on the protease production, gel degradation, mycoflora content and survival of Aspergillus fumigatus in a two-year period was examined. The results showed that the highest survival rate (95% and 94%) was obtained for the three days after incubation, while the concentration required for the viability of the fungus was the lowest. Among the tested protease substrates, fatty acids had the highest inhibitory activity (IC50 values of 0.48 µM) and the least activity for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (IC50 values of 0.39 µM). The most efficient substrate for A. fumigatus protease production was olive oil, with a significant decrease in the mean of 6.7 ± 1.8 g/L, compared with a mean of 4.9 ± 1.7 g/L, after two days of incubation. The results also revealed a dose-dependent influence of the oil dose on the survival of A. fumigatus in the experimental setup. The low IC50 values obtained in this study indicate that olive oil could be a viable and low-dose substrate for A. fumigatus protease production. However, a low-dose dose of 1.


## Introduction
In bacteria, the first two copies of each gene are expressed at different stages of infectio. For example, the genes encoding for ß-glucan synthase (gliotp1), laccase (laac1), and cellobactericidal protein (cbp) are induced at the beginning of the infection phase by the presence of ß-glucan synthases. The expression of these genes is essential for the establishment of a biofilm. The presence of these genes is not only beneficial for the growth of bacteria but also facilitates their interaction with the host immune system and control of microbial pathogenesis [3]. In addition, the expression of these genes may play a role in the regulation of the bacterial microbiome [4].

The global burden of nosocomial bloodstream infections is estimated to be over 50 million people with invasive bloodstream infections, with an estimated mortality rate of 100 to 1,000 deaths per year [5]. Moreover, a few bacterial species are able to invade other body sites and cause nosocomial infections in a relatively small number of patients [6]. The ability of these bacteria to cause infection in the host is linked to a combination of virulence factors, such as a high concentration of antibiotic resistance in the gut and antibiotic secretion in the alimentary tract, which triggers bacterial adaptation to the host environment and virulence-related genes [7].

Bacteria are able to undergo metabolic transitions through transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that are regulated by nutrient-responsive and metabolic genes [8]. For example, in the case of Lactobacillus species, the constitutive expression of a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH) and the lack of a complement of pro-oxidant microorganisms allow these bacteria to transition between metabolic states. This transition is regulated by iron homeostasis, and there is an iron-sensing and transcriptional reprogramming machinery in the bacteria [9]. Additionally, a-ketoglutarate is known to be released by a-lactobacilli, and this is a key factor in the transition between iron-dependent and -dependent adaptation to the host environment [10].


## Methods
Isolation of C. albicans From the L. donovani Genome
In order to obtain genomic DNA from C. albicans, a single PCR amplification of ITS gene of C. albicans was performed using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4, which contain the ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequence, respectively.


## Results
neoformans in host-pathogen interactio. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the four loci in the hosts of the two clinical C. neoformans strains that cause meningitis in mice. The loci were located in a common orthologous region in the two strains and located adjacent to each other on the phylogenetic tree (Fig 1). In order to identify putative gene roles in C. neoformans pathogenicity, we deleted the wild-type alleles of CNAG_06486 and CNAG_06546 in the two strains and compared their phenotypes to the alleles of the other three strains that caused meningitis in mice (Fig 2). In this study, the alleles of the CNAG_06486 and CNAG_06546 alleles were located in the same common orthologous region, which was previously shown to be essential for pathogenicity in C. neoformans [19].

The CNAG_06486 allele of the C. neoformans var. grubii strain was also found to have high levels of pheromone genes. In order to confirm that the pheromone genes are important for C. neoformans virulence, we tested the pheromone genes of the three C. neoformans strains using the pheromone receptor (PR) reporter (S4 Fig). When the wild-type and the C. neoformans var. grubii alleles were tested, the wild-type strain had the highest number of pheromone genes (Fig 2). When the pheromone receptor (PR) reporter was used to identify PR-repressed genes, the PR-repressed PR gene in the wild-type strain was found to be very high (Fig 2).

We also evaluated the expression of two PR-responsive genes in the wild-type and C. neoformans var. grubii strains, PR8 and PR10, in the presence or absence of the pheromone receptor, and found that the two PR-responsive genes were highly up-regulated in the wild-type strain compared to the cnbR^- strain (Fig 2). In addition, we found that the PR-responsive PR gene was up-regulated in the C. neoformans var.


## Discussion
albicans cells is the interaction with the host cells (Fig 8. The yeast-to-yeast interaction, involving the plasma membrane, occurs as the first step in the interaction between the yeast and the host cells. The interaction is further followed by the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the yeast. It is observed that the yeast-to-yeast interaction occurs through the interactions of the yeast with the host cells through the interactions of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interactions of the yeast with the host cells through the interactions of the yeast with the yeast. These interactions are likely mediated by a variety of yeast cell-surface receptors (SCR) that are present in yeast cells. In addition, a large number of SCRs have been reported to mediate the interaction between the yeast and the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the yeast through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the yeast through the interaction of the yeast with the host cells through the interaction of the yeast with the yeast (Kuo et al., 2013). In yeast cells, SCRs are recognized by a variety of receptors and have been demonstrated to mediate the interactions between the yeast and the host cells by being recognized by the yeast cell surface receptors such as the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and p62-ATPase (P68) (Lee et al., 2016).
