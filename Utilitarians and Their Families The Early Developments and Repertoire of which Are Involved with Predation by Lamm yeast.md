## Abstract
Lippia javanica is a medicinal fungus used for the treatment of various ailments. In traditional medicine, it is also used in the treatment of rheumatism caused by the nematode Clomiphene melanosum. The aim of the present study was to determine the antifungal activity of the methanol extract from L. javanica against C. albicans and C. neoformans.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the tested drugs were determined using broth microdilution method. The antifungal activity was determined by the disc diffusion method.

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, and nystatin were determined using the agar well diffusion method. The minimum antifungal concentrations (MICs) were determined by the broth microdilution method.

The antifungal activity of L. javanica extract was dose-dependent and MIC dependent compared to amphotericin B and itraconazole. The concentrations of the tested antifungal drugs amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and nystatin were higher in the cerebriform extract of the extract than in the extract of amphotericin B.

The antifungal activity of the extract was dose-dependent and MIC dependent compared to amphotericin B and itraconazole. The concentrations of the tested antifungal drugs were higher in the extract of the extract of the extract of Lippia javanica than in the extract of C. albicans and C. neoformans.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Lippia javanica extract against C. albicans and C. neoformans are 2.15- to 4.0-16.0-fold higher than that of amphotericin B and itraconazole.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is the most common cause of fungal meningoencephalitis in humans [1]. C. neoformans primarily affects immunocompromised hosts, particularly those with AIDS, cancer, organ transplantation, and patients with HIV/AIDS [2,3]. Inhalation of aerosolized fungal spores and desiccated yeast cells into the lungs results in a pulmonary infection and is fatal without antifungal treatment. The incidence of cryptococcosis has declined in apparently immunocompetent hosts due to better management of immunosuppression [4,5].

The central nervous system (CNS) is the primary site of C. neoformans infection. Inhalation of infectious propagules leads to brain infection and mortality in otherwise healthy individuals [6]. C. neoformans has a variety of virulence factors that enable it to evade host immune recognition. The most important virulence factors are capsule, melanin, and cell wall integrity [7,8]. Melanin contributes to the biofilm formation and fungal virulence [9,10]. The melanin contributes to the ability of the fungal cell to survive in various environmental conditions, including the human body [11,12]. Melanin contributes to melanin’s ability to adhere to the surface of the pathogen and can act as a barrier to inhibit phagocytosis and to penetrate host tissues [13]. The ability of melanin to prevent phagocytosis also enables the pathogen to escape host immune recognition and to persist in the host [14].


## Methods
Primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et a., 1990; Lamm, 1990) were designed to amplify the full-length partial ribosomal DNA region, which was inserted by PCR. The PCR product was then cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to confirm the fragment was inserted in the correct orientation of the insertion site. The resulting plasmid pTST1 (bio-Muse2:4:1:0) was used to transform L. pneumophila strain 3(B5) at its <U+0394>pra1-1 strain and obtain the pTST1-pra1-1-sRNA strain.

Proteinase K-mediated transformation of L. pneumophila strain 3(B5) was carried out as described by Taylor et al. (1998) with some modifications. Briefly, L. pneumophila (L. pneumophila) cells were grown in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C. At the indicated time points, the media was removed and the cells were harvested and homogenized using a Precellys® 1290 (Bertin Technologies, Liechtenstein). Then, the cells were washed twice with sterile distilled water, suspended in 1 ml of 1 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and plated on LB agar (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% FBS. After incubation at 37°C for 1-2 days, the S. cerevisiae-like strain of L. pneumophila was transferred to MMK (0.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bactopeptone, 0.05% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.01% MgSO_4, 0.02% CaCl_2, 0.01% CaCl_3, 0.02% MgSO_4, 0.02% KCl, 0.02% K_2HPO_4, 0.02% KCl_3, 0.

The model organism . fumigatus was isolated from amyloid-beta-glutamylase-producing and non-prosthetic amyloid-beta-glutamylase-producing amyloid-beta-glutamylases (AMBLs) [53].
