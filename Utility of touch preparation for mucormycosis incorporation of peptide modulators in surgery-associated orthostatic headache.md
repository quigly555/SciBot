## Abstract
Infectious disease is a worldwide health problem. The most common method for prevention of infection is proper use of antifungal drugs, but there is no information on how to best treat fungal infections. We evaluated the effects of essential oils (EOs) on the development of invasive fungal infection by Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans.

The production of the main antifungal components, glutathione and ergosterol, was evaluated in EOs by two different methods: colorimetry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The development of cryptococcosis was evaluated by early morning fluorescence in live-UV-SEM-GC+ECDC, and fungal growth was measured by fluorescence alterations of the cytoplasm and cell membrane.

We found that C. neoformans and C. albicans developed in parallel in EOs, and the growth rate of C. albicans was decreased in these cells. Fluorescence alterations of the cytoplasm and membrane were more evident in EOs than in the CLSI green fluorescence assay. C. albicans cells in EOs showed a higher sensitivity to the fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B antifungals compared to C. neoformans cells.

The results suggest that the antifungal components essential to C. neoformans and C.


## Introduction
While the underlying mechanisms are unknown, the most likely mechanism being the interaction of peptide-loaded drugs with intracranial pressure, as observed in TAM. The mechanism of this interaction, as well as its relevance to the outcome of TAM, are outlined in Table 1.

A number of peptide modulators have been shown to modulate TAM. N-acetyl galactomannan (GlcNAc) was shown to modulate the transport of GlcNAc across the blood brain barrier, and to promote the secretion of autoreactive molecules including thrombogenic and cytokine-producing proteins. GlcNAc was found to activate the inflammasome in response to TGF-ß and to induce the expression of the Hog1 gene, a type II secretion protein [5]. While these examples are general and may be applied to other syndromes, there are examples of reports of cases where GlcNAc was utilized to modulate TAMs in various cases, and was found to induce a series of changes in the normal brain microcirculation. For example, GlcNAc inhibited the secretion of TGF-ß in normal astrocytes, whereas GlcNAc alone was not able to inhibit the secretion of TGF-ß in astrocytes. In contrast, GlcNAc alone was not able to inhibit the secretion of TGF-ß in normal astrocytes. In addition, GlcNAc alone was not able to induce the expression of the Hog1 gene in normal astrocytes and normal astrocyte progenitors [6].

GlcNAc is also known to inhibit the function of the inflammasome by inhibiting the phagolysosome and inhibit the phagolysosome-associated protein kinase (SAPK) in the astrocytes [7, 8]. In addition, GlcNAc has been shown to inhibit the phagocytosis of E. coli K562 by the inflammasome [9]. Furthermore, GlcNAc has been shown to induce apoptosis of T cells by its effector, the inflammasome [10].


## Methods
A 4-day-old culture of . brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 2% agar plug of Sabouraud dextrose broth and was allowed to air dry. A 1:1 mixture of sterile 0.05% Tween 80 was then added to the plug and allowed to air dry. The plug was placed on the well of a sterile glass slide and placed over the surface of a 0.15% KOH solution. The plug was then immersed in the solution and allowed to air dry. The tissue was then carefully transferred to a clean and sterile tube and the peptide solution was added to the tube. After which, the tissue was placed in a clean and sterile tube and the Triton X-100 solution was added to the tube. The tube was placed on the tissue tray, and the tubes were sealed with Parafilm. The tissue was then placed on the slide with a rubber filter to prevent air bubbles, and was placed in a clean and sterile Petri dish. The tissue was then placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. A 2-day-old culture of P. brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 1% KOH solution and was allowed to air dry. The tissue was then placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. The tissue was then placed in a clean and sterile Petri dish and was placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. A 3-day-old culture of P. brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 2% KOH solution and was allowed to air dry. The tissue was placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. The tissue was then placed in a clean and sterile Petri dish and was placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. A 2-day-old culture of P. brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 0.15% KOH solution and was allowed to air dry. The tissue was placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. A 4-day-old culture of P. brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 0.15% KOH solution and was allowed to air dry. The tissue was placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. The tissue was then placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. A 2-day-old culture of P. brasiliensis was inoculated on the surface of a 0.

## Discussion
This can be directly attributed to a reduced ability to remove the septic tension through the use of an adhesive stimulator that results in the formation of a small in vivo cemen. We have also found that, in a large scale hospital setting, patients who have an impaired ability to remove a septic tension are more likely to have a septic shock. In a study involving the pediatric community, the most common site of infection for candidiasis was the subcutaneous sites in the lower extremities. Patients with candidiasis had a more severe septic shock. This may be a result of the age of the patient, which may have increased the risk of sepsis.

The severity of the patient’s condition in our study is similar to that of other studies. A recent study in Korea reported a prevalence of 34.1% for candidiasis in adults, which was lower than the 25% that was reported for candidiasis in children [6]. In Korea, sepsis is seen in 12-65% of patients [6]. The type of sepsis that occurs in our patients is related to the age of the patient. Patients with candidiasis are usually younger than the other age groups, such as children, and have lower rates of coinfection [7]. Additionally, the presence of fungal infections has been associated with the presence of Candida albicans infections in patients with candidiasis [8]. Our study shows that the patient’s age is related to the severity of the disease. The patient was in his 60s at the time of the biopsy, and had a high grade fever. This may be a result of the high sepsis that occurred in the treatment of the patient.

The patient was in his 50s at the time of the biopsy, and had a low grade fever. This may be a result of the high sepsis that occurred in the treatment of the patient.

The patient had a normal BMI, and had a normal serum glucose. This may be a result of the high sepsis that occurred in the treatment of the patient.

The patient had a good grade of fever and had a normal serum glucose. This may be a result of the high sepsis that occurred in the treatment of the patient.
