## Abstract
This review provides an update on the status of the immunotherapeutic and therapeutic use of nystatin A1-like immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of opportunistic infections.

A1-like immunosuppressive agents have gained increasing interest in the treatment of various human diseases, from oral and mucosal lesions to tuberculosis and malaria. Nystatin A1-like immunosuppressive agents have been synthesized by various approaches of chemical synthesis. However, the development of new antimicrobial agents has increased the demand for these agents, especially in view of the increase in the population of patients with opportunistic infections, and their significant adverse effects.

The objective of this review is to describe the status of the preparation of nystatin A1-like immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of opportunistic infections of patients with opportunistic infections.

Several classes of nystatin A1-like immunosuppressive agents were synthesized in the preparation of nystatin A1-like immunosuppressive agents, including azoles, echinocandins, and alemtazoles. Amongst the most promising candidates, the development of alemtazole-resistant Candida species was highlighted.

The in vitro antifungal activity of alemtazole- and alemtazole-susceptible and resistant Candida species were also highlighted.

The development of alemtazole-resistant Candida species is a topic that is rapidly evolving in the literature. Although the number of studies is very small, nystatin A-like immunosuppressive agents may represent a promising alternative to existing antifungal drugs. As such, the aim of this review is to collect the status of nystatin A-like immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of opportunistic infections and evaluate their alternatives.

This paper covers the period from January 2009 to February 2013, in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICCEU) “Research and Development Laboratory” of Switzerland.

A significant number of nystatin A-like immunosuppressive agents have been synthesized, most of which have been synthesized using chemical synthesis methods.


## Introduction
The PUFA pathway can be divided into two pathways: the first is the “squalomonic acid” pathway, which converts the primary metabolite squalomonic acid to oxaloacetate (OAc), which is transported to the cell membrane by the “squalomonic acid” catabolis. The second pathway involves the synthesis of oxaloacetate by a sulfhydryl group (Sr) and subsequent reduction of OAc to water, by the hydroxyl radical (H^+) and subsequent oxidation to acetyl-CoA (acetyl-CoA). The sulfur alcohol-squalomonic acid pathway also plays a role in pathogenesis in C. albicans [20], [21]. Both the sulfur alcohol-squalomonic acid and acetyl-CoA pathways require S-allylation of serine or threonine to control the enzyme activity, which is essential for the formation of the sulfhydryl groups on the acetyl-CoA [20], [21]. Therefore, the sulfur alcohol-squalomonic acid pathway is considered to be a sulfhydryl-squalomonic acid-squalomonic acid pathway. The sulfhydryl group on the acetyl-CoA is converted to water, and then the sulfur alcohol is oxidized to water by the oxidative polymerization of squalonate and squalonate to acetyl-CoA. The latter is then transported to the cell membrane and excreted as harmless water by the action of hemolytic enzymes [21].

In this study, we identified the PUFA reductase gene, which encodes a sub-family of <U+03B3>-proteins, and investigated its function. The <U+03B3>-proteins are responsible for the production of <U+03B3>-carotene, <U+03B3>-folic acid, and <U+03B3>-proteins in a sulfhydryl-squalomonic acid-squalomonic acid (ST) metabolism.


## Methods
solanum melanin (mRNAi) using an in vitro-peritoneal assa. M. solanum melanin (mRNAi) is a black pigment used as a growth medium for fungi and molds. The fungal strain was cultivated in liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) at 30°C for 24 h. Next, the mycelium was harvested and washed twice with 0.5% Tween 80, dried, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. The solution was stirred for 5 min at 100°C, and then it was centrifuged for 30 min at 4,000 g. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 10 ml of water to remove the residual solvent. Then, the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water and the assay was performed using a hemocytometer. The assay was performed in duplicate and repeated three times. The results were expressed as the mean value of three independent experiments.

Growth assays
For the evaluation of the effect of M. solanum on the growth of F. graminearum, 10 µl of the mycelium was inoculated onto PDA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and incubated for 24 h at 30°C. Next, the mycelium was harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. The mycelium was homogenized with a tube of a bead beater (Bertin Instruments, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and then the homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 g. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of water. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of water and the assay was performed using a hemocytometer. The results were expressed as the mean value of three independent experiments.

Microscopy and microscopy

## Results
In contrast, virulence of the <U+0394>gpa1 mutant was attenuate.

To identify genes that are differentially regulated in response to osmotic stress, we tested the <U+0394>pmr1 and <U+0394>pdr1 mutants in a series of stress-inducing and oxidative stress-inducing conditions. The <U+0394>pmr1 and <U+0394>pdr1 mutants formed more pronounced hyphal tips than the wild type in the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant, whereas the <U+0394>pdr1 mutant did not differ in the diameter of the conidiophores (Figure 4D). In contrast, the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant formed smaller hyphal tips than the wild type in the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant. The pdr1 mutant formed more pronounced hyphal tips than the wild type in the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant, but the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant did not differ in the diameter of the conidiophores (Figure 4D). We also compared the phenotypes of the wild type and the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant in a series of stress-inducing conditions and found that the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant exhibited significantly decreased growth in a liquid medium containing 5% FBS, 6% sorbitol, 5% NaCl, and 10% glycerol as compared to the wild type. However, in a series of oxidative stress-inducing conditions, the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant showed a similar phenotype to the wild type. These data indicate that Pdr1 is required for optimal growth in response to osmotic stress, but not in response to oxidative stress.

Pdr1 is required for asexual development but not sexual development
As pdr1 deletion mutants were unable to form conidiophores or produce hyphae in the <U+0394>pmr1 mutant, we hypothesized that Pdr1 functions in the same pathways as the other two GPCRs, Gpa2 and Gpa3. To test this, we generated a pdr1 null mutant in which the GPCR Gpa2 was replaced by the GPCR Gpa3.


## Discussion
brasiliensis genome encodes over 120 genes (Figure 1) (Figures 2 and 3. For comparison, the P. aeruginosa genome is composed of 43 genes, which encode for a number of fatty acid-type fatty acids (Table 1). The P. brasiliensis genome has a genome size of approximately 33 Mbp (Figure 3) and is highly similar to that of P. aeruginosa (Figure 1). This genomic size could be explained by the large size of the P. brasiliensis genome, which has been proposed to be an additional advantage of P. brasiliensis for industrial applications. However, this is the first genome of P. brasiliensis reported in this study.

P. brasiliensis has a high sequence similarity to P. aeruginosa, which is one of the most common species for the production of biodiesel (Figure 4). The sequence similarity of P. brasiliensis was reported by other researchers, including a BLAST search against the NCBI (nuclear ribosomal protein database) database. However, the NCBI sequence database does not include these types of genes [12]. A comparison of the NCBI nucleotide database with other databases showed that P. brasiliensis is the most closely related species to P. aeruginosa, with a relative similarity score of 98% (Figure 5). This result is in agreement with a study of P. aeruginosa using an Illumina platform [13]. This difference in gene content could be explained by the fact that P. brasiliensis has a much longer genome, which is generally in the range of other species in the P. brasiliensis species complex.

The P. brasiliensis genome encodes over 100 genes (Figure 1) and encodes over 200 transporters (Table 1). The genes encoding these transporters are classified into four sub-classes: e.g., polyol alcohol dehydrogenase (POMD) (Table 1), a lipid-specific ATPase (POMD1) (Table 1), a laccase (POMD2) (POMD3) (Table 1), a sub-cellular ATPase (POMD4) (Table 1), and a lysosomal protein (POMD5) (Table 1). The P.
