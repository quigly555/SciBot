## Abstract
This study was designed to determine the diversity, distribution, and phylogeny of the Fusarium avenaceum myrmica populations across three continents using amplicon-based multiple sequence analyses (ASU/SUD) combined with macroscopic morphology. Population phylogeny was determined by two-fold hierarchical tree alignments using sequence identities. To estimate the phylogeny of Fusarium, population genomic data were derived from molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results were compared to previously published population genomic data, and the maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probabilities (FAR) estimates were calculated for F. avenaceum. Bayes estimated the maximum likelihood to be at least 95% high, while the posterior probabilities were at least 100% and high enough to justify further study. The results showed that F. avenaceum is a monophyletic assemblage with a maximum likelihood of about 90% and a posterior probability of about 90% for the topology, respectively. This assemblage is not monophyletic, and the topology of the Fusarium taxa in the Arctomiaceae is not much more complicated than expected. The assemblage of Fusarium was dominated by fast-growing saprotrophic Rhizotypes, which is clearly not a good sign for F. avenaceum as a monophyletic assemblage. Our results suggest that the Fusarium myrmica is a poorly studied assemblage with a low maximum likelihood of high probability.


## Introduction
The ubiquitous and extremely resistant Echinocandin antifungal drug fluconazole (FLC) and the recently introduced clotrimazole antifungal clotrimacilide (FLCZ) both have significant adverse effects on immunocompromised patients. In this regard, the mechanism of action of FLCZ remains unclear. FLCZ exhibits antifungal activity against a broad spectrum of fungal pathogens and has a narrow spectrum of activity against a limited number of clinically relevant fungi (1-3).

In this study, the antifungal activity of fluconazole against a panel of clinically relevant fungal species was investigated in two fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans, and for the first time, fluconazole treatment efficacy was assessed in clinical specimens of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Further, it was evaluated for the clinical efficacy of FLCZ using a plasma membrane-based assay.


## Methods
The microbiology was performed by using a sterile cotton swab or a sterile cotton swab with Gram stainin. A single colony of Candida spp. was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. After incubation at 30°C for 7 days, the culture was washed three times with sterile distilled water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The cell density was adjusted to 2.5 × 10^6 CFU/mL using a hemocytometer.

The screening strategy for pathogen resistance was used to identify different types of pathogenic organisms, and their susceptibilities to fluconazole, itraconazole, or voriconazole, and to determine the susceptibility of the susceptible to azoles. This strategy was followed in our previous work [27]. Antimicrobial activity of Candida spp. was determined by using FITC-conazole, fluconazole, or voriconazole as the tested drugs. The susceptibility of Candida spp. to FITC-conazole was determined using the MIC determination method. The susceptibility of Candida spp. to voriconazole was determined using the MIC determination method, as described in our previous study [28].

To establish the probable etiology of fungal infection in the animal model, we determined the risk of infection by the method as described in our previous work [28]. We obtained animals by intravenous inoculation of 1 × 10^6 CFU of C. albicans and C. glabrata with 0.5 ml of saline solution. The animal model was established by using a cercalibur model, which was operated under a light/dark cycle. The animals were injected with sterile saline solution containing 0.5 ml of saline solution, 0.5 ml of bile fluid, and 0.3 ml of saline solution. Three days after the infection, the animals were sacrificed, and the kidneys were harvested for histopathology analysis. The fungal burden in the kidneys was determined by the use of a standard curve.

The use of the antifungal agents was also performed as a control for the fungal burden in the organs of the animals. These agents included amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and voriconazole.


## Results
The Q1 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first and second ancestries (Table 1) and in the first ancestries (Table 2), and was highly prevalent in the first ancestrie. The Q2 genotype was present in the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q3 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q4 genotype was present in all the isolates of the second ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q5 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q6 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q7 genotype was present in all the isolates of the second ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries.

To further investigate the taxonomic distribution of Q5 and Q6 genotypes, the Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5 genotypes were grouped into three subclades. The Q1 genotype was present in all isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q2 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q3 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q4 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries.

The Q5, Q6 and Q7 genotypes were grouped into three subclades (Table 3). The Q5 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q6 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries. The Q3 genotype was present in all the isolates of the first ancestries and was highly prevalent in the second ancestries.


## Discussion
The fungal endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia were studied for their potential roles in the host-pathogen interaction. The majority of the fungal endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia are from the genera Hypocrea, Blumeria and Trichosporon (Table 1), and a few species from the genera Melampsor and Chrysosporium (Table 1). However, in contrast to their occurrence in other studies of the fungal endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia, the majority of the fungal endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia were from the genera Chrysosporium and Trichosporon (Table 1). The dominance of the genera Chrysosporium and Trichosporon in the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia is in line with the distribution of Chrysosporium and Trichosporon among the fungal endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia [16]. The presence of Chrysosporium and Trichosporon as endophytes in the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia is also in line with the results of other studies, in which species of the genera Chrysosporium and Trichosporon were detected in a wide variety of plant hosts [12, 16].

The major endophytes of the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia are ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, but the majority are saprophytic fungi, including Tremella, Phialocephala, and Candida [17, 18]. The majority of the species studied in this study were not found in the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia. The genera Cystobasidium, Dioszegia, and Cryptococcus were also isolated in the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia but their distribution and relative abundance was unknown. Cystobasidium, Dioszegia, Cryptococcus, and Cryptococcus were also isolated from the Xpertrophic Fungal Community of Australia.
