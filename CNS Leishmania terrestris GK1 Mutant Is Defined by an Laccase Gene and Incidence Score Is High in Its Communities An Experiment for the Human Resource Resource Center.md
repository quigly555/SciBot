## Abstract

As a result of the use of genetic information from the . isola-reproducing bacteria from the H. major vector, the species richness of the sclerotial and bacterial communities was characterized. In addition, a description of the genetic diversity and community structure of the sclerotial community is provided based on the community structure and membership in the H. major Laccase vector population. The Sclerotiales are an important group of bacterial-reproducing organisms and the Sclerotiales have been the subject of many studies that have demonstrated the benefits of vector control for human health. One such study was published in PLOS Pathology in 1996. The PLOS Pathology paper described the contamination of the murine intestinal epithelial cells with a recombinant Sclerotium lopinavir, an active recombinant antigen, and pointed out several examples of non-natural contaminants that might be harmful to the health of animals. Other studies reported that the vector was able to induce resistance in sclerotial cells, and the study on Sclerotium sclerotiorum infection identified a group of bacteria able to survive in the blood of mice vaccinated with a vector carrying the resistance gene, Lopinavir. In this paper, we report the results of this study, which described a novel sclerotial-like group of bacteria, and discuss the significance of these findings in the management of a patient with Sclerotium lopinavir-resistant Sclerotium trachomatis infection.

Human infection with Sclerotium sclerotiorum is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals and is mainly caused by non-albicans Candida spp., the majority of which is S. lopinavir-resistant. The effective range of antimicrobial therapy for bacterial and fungal infections has greatly increased and an increasing number of patients present with multidrug-resistant infections. The initiation of therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, i.e., liposomal amphotericin B or 5-flucytosine, has the highest success rate in controlling infection and is a promising alternative to chemical fungicides. In this study, we have investigated the potential of Sclerotium lopinavir as a novel natural vaccine candidate against bacteria and fungi.


## Introduction
The burden of disease is very high in Ethiopia and Tanzania, and it is estimated that over 20 000 people die each year from invasive fungal infections [19. The high mortality rate of fungal diseases is attributed to the lack of a commercial vaccine and the lack of current therapies [20]. In Kenya, cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most common fungal infections, causing more than 220,000 deaths each year [21]. Although there are currently no vaccines against cryptococcal meningitis, it is believed that cryptococcal infections occur through inhalation of infectious particles or conidia. In healthy individuals, the initial infection usually occurs asymptomatically, and the patient may reactivate later if needed. However, when cryptococcal infections occur in immunocompromised patients, the immune system fails to clear the organism. This condition may then progress to meningoencephalitis, which is typically asymptomatic but presents a series of symptoms that include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [22].

The main fungal species causing meningoencephalitis are Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. These yeasts have been classified as two different species, C. neoformans and C. gattii. C. neoformans infections are more common in immunocompromised patients. However, the high burden of cryptococcal disease in immunocompromised patients is linked to the use of antifungal prophylaxis [23]. The major species involved in the infections are C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A), C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) and C. neoformans var. gattii (serotype B and C) [24].

C. neoformans infection occurs by inhalation of fungal spores in the environment. Once inside the host, the fungus may cause pulmonary disease, usually asymptomatic infection, or reactivate as a life-threatening systemic infection. The incubation period of C. neoformans infection varies according to the species involved, and C. neoformans infections are most commonly diagnosed in immunocompromised patients [23]. Individuals with advanced disease, usually acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), are at high risk of cryptococcal meningitis. This is also true for HIV-positive patients.


## Methods
rhd.org/) [36] and by molecular biology evidence, as described in [37] and with a few modifications (see Additional file 2).

A typical P. terrestris GK1 strain (S1 Table) was isolated from a patient with P. terrestris-associated histoplasmosis, which is caused by Leishmania sp. A clinical isolate (i.e., a culture obtained from the liver of a healthy donor) was obtained from a patient with histoplasmosis. In order to confirm the FASTFAM1::LAC1 interaction, the A. fumigatus strain was isolated from a patient with histoplasmosis, and the mean number of A. fumigatus A1163 cells in the lung and spleen was recorded.

To ensure the FASTFAM1::LAC1 interaction was not due to a disruption of the F-actin gene, we amplified the A. fumigatus A1163::FAM1::LAC1 fusion with the primers listed in Table 2. The FAM1::LAC1 sequence was amplified from pLC3-CAGGAATTTCTGGTCAGCATCTCATATGC with the primers listed in Table 2. The A. fumigatus GK1-FK506 fusion sequence was amplified from pLC3-CAGAGGAATCTGGTCAGCATCTCATGC with the primers listed in Table 2.

To validate the FASTFAM1::LAC1 interaction, a 1.1 × 10^6 cells/ml culture in PDA was cultivated for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2. The culture was then transferred to a 12-well plate containing 200 µl of PDA. The culture was then transferred to the 12-well plate containing 200 µl of FK506 (1.0 µg/ml) and incubated for 5 h at 37°C. The cell-free culture was then removed by filtration, and the FK506-induced cell death was observed by microscopy.

To test for the impact of LAC1 on the F-actin fusion, the same 5.8 × 10^6 cells/ml culture was cultivated for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO_2.


## Results
terrestris GK1 deletion strain has an independent . amazonicus-type laccase, and we found that L. amazonicus-type laccase is associated with a significantly higher incidence of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the samples of its ITS2 and LSU rRNA gene loci (Fig 1A). The L. amazonicus-type laccase is associated with a lower frequency of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the ITS2 dataset (Fig 1B), but the frequency of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the LSU rRNA dataset is still significantly higher than the rate of L. amazonicus-type laccase (Fig 1B). The L. amazonicus-type laccase frequency in the ITS2 dataset is also higher than the rate of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the LSU rRNA dataset. We also found a significant difference in L. amazonicus-type laccase frequency in the ITS2 dataset (Fig 1C), and the L. amazonicus-type laccase frequency in the LSU rRNA dataset is higher than the rate of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the ITS2 dataset (Fig 1D). These results suggest that the L. amazonicus-type laccase frequency in the ITS2 dataset is significantly higher than the rate of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the LSU rRNA dataset.

Laccase-deficient L. amazonicus-type laccase is associated with a lower frequency of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the ITS2 and LSU rRNA datasets
We next asked if the L. amazonicus-type laccase-deficient L. amazonicus-type laccase-deficient strain was associated with higher frequencies of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the ITS2 and LSU rRNA gene loci, and we found that L. amazonicus-type laccase-deficient strain is associated with a lower frequency of L. amazonicus-type laccase in the ITS2 and LSU rRNA gene loci than the L. amazonicus-type laccase-deficient strain. The L.


## Discussion
Previous studies showed that C. neoformans induces the expression of a number of genes and functions including capsule production and hyphal morphogenesis in response to C. neoformans infection [14], [25], [26]. In addition, several C. neoformans genes and functions, including a cell wall-degrading enzyme, are also required for the survival of C. neoformans in the host [15]. Our previous studies have shown that the expression of several genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and trafficking is induced by C. neoformans infection in vitro [11], [26]. In addition, several C. neoformans genes and functions are required for the survival and virulence of the pathogen in the host [9], [12], [13]. In this study, we characterized the expression of a novel gene, RdRP-AAD, which encodes a protein with a glycolytic activity.
