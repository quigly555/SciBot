## Abstract
The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize microbes in the indoor environment is emerging as a promising tool for identifying novel beneficial microbes in complex biological communities. However, the ability of NGS-trained individuals to accomplish this task remains to be explored. In this study, we used a microbiome-based NGS approach to characterize a group of 2200 subjects (55 male and 40 female) aged 79 to 83 years, and the primary outcome was the proportion of blood neutrophils (bial cells that support the growth of the microorganism) in each of the four anatomical sites. We utilized both culture- and agarose (conjugation of the active fraction) culture-based approaches to compare microbial communities in the four anatomical sites using 16S and 18S rDNA sequence data. We found that microbial communities were dominated by the fungal and bacterial phyla Ascomycota (n = 37), Chytridiomycota (n = 34) and Basidiomycota (n = 26) and the class of Glomeromycota (n = 9) was high. Furthermore, we observed that microbial communities were dominated by Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota phyla.


## Introduction
The family known as “Lamiaceae” was established in the Dominican Republic in 1883 and has approximately 200 species (Lamiaceae) and currently comprises over 50 genera (Bates et al. 2017, de Beer et al. 2018). The family has been traditionally used as a source of bioactive compounds (e.g. Naumann et al. 2015) and also as source of essential oils (e.g. Naumann et al. 2017). Essential oils are mainly composed of a- and ß-propenoids, terpenoids and their derivatives, coumarins, alkaloids, and phenylalkylamides, with the largest number of new species (Lamiaceae) in the last two decades (Cao et al. 2018). The genus Naumannia is composed of naphthoquinone alkaloids, naphthoquinones, aromatic and aliphthoquinones, and four tannins, the first two of which are 6- and 10-naphthoquinone and the second six, the last six, and the last two compounds (Sardi et al. 2012) are from the a-propenoid genus. According to Cocolinha et al. (2014), the genus Naumannia is a relatively large genus that is mainly composed of naphthoquinone alkaloids and naphthoquinones and coumarin derivatives (Cocolinha et al. 2014). The genus Naumannia is a monophyletic group of naphthoquinone alkaloids and coumarins, which is found in the a-propenoid genus Naumannia, although the naphthoquinone species is rarely found (Cocolinha et al. 2013).


## Methods
The case report form was used to evaluate the impact of treatment on the health status of the human bod. In addition, the case summary form was used to assess the health status of the human body in terms of general health status and functional status, and to evaluate the health status of the human body in terms of disease progression and functional status. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated by a study score of 0, no intervention, and no treatment effects on the health status.

The median follow-up time (CT_50) was calculated by dividing the number of events observed in the first 48 h of the treatment in the group of BALF-FSA patients by the number of events observed in the group of BALF-FSA patients in the same period. The differences in CT_50 between groups were tested for significance using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Student's t-test. The cumulative effect of treatment on CT_50 was estimated as follows: (CT_50 in the BALF-FSA group/CT_50 in the BALF-FSA group) × 100.

Determination of the effect of treatment on fungal burden in bone marrow aspirate biopsy
The microbe burden in the bone marrow aspirate was determined using the flow cytometry (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the method described by Stajich et al. [13]. Briefly, BALF-FSA patients (n = 5 per group) were anesthetized with xylazine (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and lysing enzymes (100 µg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The samples were collected in the peripheral blood of the patient with a positive coagulase-conjugant test and a negative coagulase-negative staining. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected, and the concentration of the fungus in the supernatants was determined using the method described by Liu et al. [14].


## Results
The patient had a history of renal failure, renal transplantation, and metastatic encephalomyelitis, and his renal transplant was performed in 201. The patient was a white-purple kidney transplant patient, and the kidney was resectioned in 2015. The patient was a white-purple kidney transplant patient, and the kidney was transplanted in 2015. The patient had a history of kidney rejection, renal rejection, and renal transplant in 2016 and 2017, and the kidney was transplanted in 2017. The patient was a white-purple kidney transplant patient, and the kidney was transplanted in 2016 and 2017. The patient had a history of liver failure, liver transplantation, and kidney metastatic encephalomyelitis in 2016 and 2017, and the liver was transplanted in 2017. The patient had a history of kidney failure, liver transplantation, and kidney metastatic encephalomyelitis in 2017 and 2018, and the kidney was transplanted in 2018. The patient was a white-purple kidney transplant patient, and the kidney was transplanted in 2016 and 2017, and the kidney was transplanted in 2017. The patient had a history of liver failure, liver transplantation, and kidney metastatic encephalomyelitis in 2017 and 2018, and the liver was transplanted in 2017. The patient was a white-purple kidney transplant patient, and the kidney was transplanted in 2017 and 2018, and the kidney was transplanted in 2018.

The patient had a history of liver failure, liver transplantation, and kidney metastatic encephalomyelitis in 2017 and 2018, and the kidney was transplanted in 2017 and 2018.

A case of liver transplantation was diagnosed in a patient with hematoma (Figure 3) and metastatic encephalomyelitis (Figure 4). The patient had a history of liver failure, liver transplantation, and kidney metastatic encephalomyelitis in 2016 and 2017, and the liver was transplanted in 2017.


## Discussion
While we did not identify any differences in fungal-infected patients' age, we found that the median time to diagnosis was 30 days in a study of patients with invasive fungal infections in a solid organ transplant recipient (8 months v. 18 months).

In addition, the median time to diagnosis was 43 days in a study of patients with invasive fungal infections in a solid organ transplant recipient (37 days vs. 45 days) and only a small proportion of patients had detectable fungal infection. Furthermore, our study found that the median time to diagnosis was 38 days in a case series of patients with invasive fungal infections in a transplant recipient (2 weeks vs. 24 weeks) and not in a case series of patients with invasive fungal infections in the bone marrow transplant recipient (17 days vs. 5 days) [12].

In our study, we found that the median time to diagnosis was 17 days in a study of patients with invasive fungal infections in a solid organ transplant recipient (16 days vs. 5 days) [12]. Another study found that the median time to diagnosis was 32 days in a solid organ transplant recipient (2 weeks vs. 2 weeks) and not in a case series of patients with invasive fungal infections in the bone marrow transplant recipient (16 days vs. 2 weeks) [12].

It is interesting to speculate that the median time to diagnosis in this study was not as long as those in previous studies. The median time to diagnosis in our study was not long enough for fungal-infected patients to be diagnosed at the time of fungal infection in their bone marrow transplant recipient, which was early in the study.

This study also found that the median time to diagnosis in this study was not as long as in previous studies of invasive fungal infections in bone marrow transplant recipients (8 months vs. 18 months) [12]. However, we found that the median time to diagnosis was not as long as that in previous studies of invasive fungal infections in bone marrow transplant recipients (6 months vs. 8 months) [12].
