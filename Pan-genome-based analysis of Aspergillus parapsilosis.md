## Abstract
The fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is a leading cause of late onset, high mortality, and increased morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplantation (SOT). This SOT has evolved with the development of a wide range of therapeutics, including, but not limited to, anti-microbial agents and immunomodulatory therapies. Our understanding of the roles of various transcription factors and their roles in fungal virulence are outlined in this review. We also discuss the importance of the development of novel antifungal agents and the potential of this emerging factor as a source of new leads. For this review to gain pace in the research community, the number of papers, multiple research articles, and a growing body of evidence need to be updated.


## Introduction
Fungi are ubiquitous and ubiquitous in the environment, with more than 10,000 species being described [1]. Within the vast majority of fungi, yeasts are found in all ecological niches [2]. However, yeasts are also found in a very limited number of niches: in soil, water, air, inside a catheter, inside the human body, on implanted devices [3,4,5,6,7,8]. They are also found in dead or dying tissues, on implanted devices, inside catheters, on implants, in the skin of a human being and even in a dog bed [9]. In addition, some yeasts can be found in various body sites, such as in the lungs, skin and nails. However, there are only a few reports of invasive fungal infections in humans, including in severely immunosuppressed patients [10,11]. In addition, some fungi have been found in different parts of the body and their pathogenic potentials are still unknown.

In the healthy person, the yeast can be isolated from the blood, skin, mucosa, nails, sinuses, lymph nodes, and even from the heart, lungs, and bones [12]. However, in immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with neutropenia or patients with invasive fungal infections, yeast growth can be problematic, with growth of over 1-2 cm in diameter, which can occur for weeks or months at a time [13].


## Methods
The full-length parapsilosis coding sequences were aligned with MUSCLE [65] and translated with CodonCode Aligner (Ccelag) version .7.5 [66] and imported into CodonCode Aligner (Ccelag). We then screened the parapsilosis gene sets of Aspergillus spp. in the Aspergillus genome.

For the parapsilosis orthologs, the open reading frames of the Aspergillus spp. gene set were aligned using MUSCLE and the translated gene sets were aligned with CodonCode Aligner. For the orthologs of the Aspergillus parapsilosis gene set, the orthologs of all other Aspergillus species were aligned using MEGA6. The resulting alignment was used to construct the first-round alignments using CodonCode Aligner. All parapsilosis orthologs were aligned using CodonCode Aligner, and the final alignment was used to construct the first-round alignments with MEGA6. All parapsilosis orthologs were aligned using CodonCode Aligner and the final alignment was used to construct the first-round alignments with MEGA6. The sequence alignment of the parapsilosis genes was checked and corrected with CodonCode Aligner. All parapsilosis orthologs were aligned using MEGA6.

The parapsilosis orthologs of A. flavus and A. terreus were aligned using MUSCLE [65] and the translated gene sets of A. terreus were aligned with CodonCode Aligner. The final alignment was used to construct the first-round alignments with MEGA6.


## Results
The gDNA encoding the ASP1 gene was identified in all Aspergillus species except . terreus (Table S2). In this analysis, all of the A. terreus and A. terreus alleles were present in the basidiomycete U. maydis, which was found in all Aspergillus species except A. terreus (Table S2). ASP1 gene analysis showed that the Basidiomycete species A. terreus and A. terreus had the highest ASP1 gene abundance.

Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus have two putative ASP genes that are located on different scaffolds (Figure S4). In A. terreus, a putative ASP1 gene is located on the left arm of the intron. The putative ASP1 gene was identified in Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus. In A. terreus, a putative ASP1 gene is located on the right arm of the intron. The putative ASP1 gene was identified in Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus. In Aspergillus terreus, a putative ASP1 gene is located on the left arm of the intron. The putative ASP1 gene was identified in Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus. In A. terreus, a putative ASP1 gene is located on the right arm of the intron. The putative ASP1 gene was identified in Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus. In A. terreus, a putative ASP1 gene is located on the left arm of the intron. The putative ASP1 gene was identified in Aspergillus terreus and A. terreus.

In the Aspergillus species, the putative ASP1 gene was found in all species except A. terreus (Table S2). In A. terreus, a putative ASP1 gene was located on the left arm of the intron. In A.


## Discussion
fumigatu. In addition, some fungi are more closely related to Mucorales than to Cryptococcus neoformans, which is consistent with the phylogenetic studies, as well as the fact that they were also found in several species of other genera (e.g. Laccaria, Aspergillus, and Penicillium) (Maz-Mazzolla et al. 2012). In addition, the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has been detected in a number of other species (e.g. Hanseniaspora, Cryptococcus neoformans, and A. fumigatus), which might be related to the fungal lifestyle. The presence of the fungal-like genus Alternaria and the genus Trichosporon in this study strongly suggests that this fungus can be considered as a member of a new genus, which is described here as Mucorales.

Among the fungal genera detected in this study, the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Tuber melanosporum are species of Penicillium and Mucorales, respectively (Table 3), which is in accordance with previous studies (Mazzolla et al. 2012). The species in this study are morphologically very similar to Penicillium, and have a similar substrate preference, which suggests that they are also able to produce secondary metabolites.

Based on the distribution of the fungi in the fungal kingdom, the genus Alternaria was most frequently detected in this study (Table 3). This genus was previously reported from wood-decaying wood-decaying fungi (Mazzolla et al. 2012), and is also related to the Aspergillus species (Maz-Mazzolla et al. 2012). In addition, the species are morphologically very similar to Penicillium and Rhizopus species (Table 3). The species in this study are morphologically very similar to Rhizopus species, which is described from wood-decaying fungi (Maz-Mazzolla et al. 2012).

The fungal species Aspergillus and Penicillium were detected in this study, which suggests that these fungi are closely related to each other.
