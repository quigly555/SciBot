## Abstract
Cryptococcus species are increasingly described as a cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections, with a number of possible outcomes including meningitis or neurotoxicity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a wide range of fungal burdens and has the potential to be used as a surrogate marker of bacterial burden. However, it is not clear whether CNS cryptococcosis is associated with specific antifungal drugs, or whether its occurrence is associated with specific drug interactions.

We report a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with AIDS treated with anti-fungal therapy. The patient had a low CD4 count, which, to our knowledge, has never been reported as CNS cryptococcosis. We also report the first case of neurotoxicity in an AIDS patient.

Cryptococcus species are increasingly described as a cause of CNS infections, with a number of possible outcomes including meningitis or neurotoxicity. CSF presents a wide range of fungal burdens, and most of them are associated with antifungal drugs. However, we do not yet know whether Cryptococcus species impact on immune responses or the CNS symptoms or consequences of CNS infections. If so, which components are associated with the CNS symptoms, we discuss their potential associations with anti-fungal drugs and their proposed roles in immune responses.


## Introduction
Microbial biofilms are highly structured communities of microorganisms attached to and enclosed within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) [1]. The matrix is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), mainly hydrocarbons, such as phenol, propionic acid, fatty acids, fatty acids-like substances (FLSP), hydroxyl and terpenoids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), glycolipids and lipids, and enzymes [2]. EPSs are important in various biological processes, such as food production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation and wastewater treatment [3]. They play important roles in biofilm formation, as they are required for biofilm formation [4], [5].

Isolation and purification of a-chymotrypsin
A-chymotrypsin (Cp) (Sigma) was isolated from a red, chytrid colored yeast by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an electrophoresis system (Sigma-Aldrich). The stock solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl_2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM Na_3VO_4, 1 mM PMSF, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 µg mL^-1 a-chymotrypsin) was prepared by addition of Cp to 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl_2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM Na_3VO_4, and 1 mM EDTA. The a-chymotrypsin peptides were purified by reaction with a-chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) as described by Shukla et al. [9].

The purified a-chymotrypsin was concentrated by vacuum filtration using a column chromatography system (Silica Gel 60 F254, Nalge Nunc International, NJ, USA) with a solvent system consisting of EtOAc, H_2O_2, CH_3CN, Na_2MoO_4, and Et_3C_6. A volume of 100 µL was injected into the column. A-chymotrypsin peptides were separated by reversed phase (RT) reversed phase (RP) extraction (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using a gradient of solvent B (0.1% w/v) and a gradient of 0.1% w/v of EtOAc (0.1% w/v). A-chymotrypsin peptides were eluted with a gradient of EtOAc and 0.


## Results
The taxonomic revision of Staphylococcus aureus was recently proposed to resolve the genus into four species, namely Staphylococcus aureus (Vogel et a. 2016), Staphylococcus aureus var. aureus (Roubenc et al. 2016), Staphylococcus aureus var. longisporus (Broussal et al. 2016) and Staphylococcus aureus var. longisporus (Takaki et al. 2016) [12]. The STM analysis of ST. aureus’s single genome (http://stm.mp-bsf.fr/stm/index.php) shows that it is clearly distinguishable from other Staphylococcus aureus species by using an average of 1.7 genes per gene (Table 1). The gene content of the single genome is different in Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species. The genome of ST. aureus is composed of 61.5% (56.3%) of the coding sequence of STM. A total of 41.4% (11.4%) of the genes are homologous to STM genes, and only 2.5% of the genes are highly conserved between ST. aureus and other Staphylococcus species. The average number of STM genes in ST. aureus is 52.7% (22.2%) compared with 54.8% (23.1%) in the other Staphylococcus species.

The genome of Staphylococcus aureus’s single-gene coding region (CDR) is similar to that of other Staphylococcus species (Table 1). The STM gene content is higher in the CDR of Staphylococcus aureus compared with other Staphylococcus species (Table 1). Staphylococcus aureus STM genes are most similar to those of Staphylococcus aureus’s coding region (Fig 2). The STM genes in ST. aureus and other Staphylococcus species are also the same as those of other Staphylococcus species (Table 1).

## Discussion
The genus Staphylococcus is considered to be a monophyletic genus with three species, namely Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus luteus, and six strains, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, in which the strain of Staphylococcus aureus is unique and the species is similar to Staphylococcus epidermidis in its morphology and phylogen. The genus Staphylococcus is considered to be monophyletic, with seven species, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, in which the strain of Staphylococcus aureus is unique and the species is similar to Staphylococcus epidermidis in its morphology and phylogeny.
