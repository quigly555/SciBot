## Abstract
We previously reported that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subtype CD4+ T-cell lymphotropic subtype 1 (Th1) and Th cell-dependent viral T-cell cytokines were able to downregulate the expression of CD4 and T-cell cytokines in CD4+ T-cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of these genes in Th1 cells in response to heat shock induced by HIV-1. We found that heat shock promoted the downregulation of CD4 and T-cell cytokines. Furthermore, heat shock induced heat killed CD4+ cells in vitro. The downregulation of CD4 and T-cell cytokines in heat was suppressed in CD4+ cells after stimulation with heat shock. These results demonstrate that heat shock promotes the upregulation of CD4 and T-cell genes in CD4+ T-cell lymphotropic subtype 1 (Th1) T-cell subsets, and downregulation of these genes in Th2 cell-dependent T-cell subsets. These results suggest that heat stimuli are able to upregulate CD4 and T-cell genes in CD4+ T-cell lymphotropic subtype 1 (Th2) T-cell subsets. Furthermore, we found that heat shock promoted upregulation of CD4 and T-cell genes in Th1 and Th2 subsets, and downregulation of these genes in Th1 and Th2 cell-dependent T-cell subsets.


## Introduction
The genus Arthrinium was first proposed by Von Recklinghausen [1] as the genus of ecto-amyloid fungi.


## Methods
Fungal Isolates
The fungal isolates used in this study were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the Microbial Diversity Collection (MD) of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), and the culture collection of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) at the Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology (IMB). A total of 721 of the species (Table 1) were used in this study, and the fungal isolates were maintained in the culture collection of the Joint Genome Institute. A total of 1,062 yeast isolates were used in this study, and they were maintained at -80°C in 50% glycerol.

Fungal strains
Fungal isolates were isolated from a total of 9,224 samples from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFW). The culture collection was maintained at -20°C in 50% glycerol. Fungal isolates were isolated from the subculture collection of the Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology (IBB) at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) at the Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology (IMB). The subculture collection was maintained at -80°C in 50% glycerol. Fungal isolates were isolated from the culture collection of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) at the Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology (IMB).


## Results
Trichoderma is a recently described fungal species [35. The structure and molecular mechanisms of fungal phyletic evolution have been previously described [35]. The fungal phyletic evolution is defined by the duplication of genes in a multigene cluster that typically includes genes involved in various biological processes, especially in defense, virulence, and pathogenesis [35]. To test whether the observed differences in phenotypic characteristics of fungal isolates suggest differences in their phyletic evolution, we compared the phenotypic characteristics of the Trichoderma and A. fumigatus isolates. For this purpose, we generated strain H99, which was previously described as a diploid (Table 1) and therefore was not included in the analysis. The same strain was used for the present study, and the two isolates were collected from different geographical regions and the same grape cultivar. The colony size of the strain H99 was similar to that of the isolate CBS 13979 (Fig 2A). The colony morphology of the new strain was similar to that of the CBS 13979 strain, although the red color of the colony was more pronounced on the surface of the agar, indicating that this strain is a diploid. This result is in agreement with the data obtained in the previous study [35], which indicated that the phyletic development was not optimal in the new strain. The colonies of the new strain were similar to those of the CBS 13979 strain, indicating that the isolates were diploid. This result indicates that the strain CBS 13979 is not a diploid.

The analysis of the colony morphologies of the strains CBS 13979 and H99 revealed that the isolate CBS 13979 has the characteristic brownish brown colonies with a yellowish brown outer surface and an outer layer of cream colored mycelium and whitish brown colonies on the agar surface, with a thin, medium to high mycelial outer layer composed of cells with a distinct yellowish brown, yellowish brown, and greenish color (Fig 2B).


## Discussion
In this study, we have identified a previously unknown molecular target of M. restricta in a pathogenic fungus and successfully identified a novel gene responsible for antifungal resistance. In addition, we have also identified a novel gene for the NADP-dependent sugar catabolic pathway that is essential for fungal growth and reproduction. These findings suggest that M. restricta uses a conserved transcription factor that has previously been characterized for its ability to adapt to stress conditions. In addition, we have identified a new gene that encodes a highly conserved domain for a sugar-responsive transcription factor in other fungi.

M. restricta is a unique species in that it has been reported to have a unique sugar-responsive transcription factor system. This is particularly interesting because the genes involved in the sugar-responsive transcription factor are found in the order Mycosphaerellaceae (the order Basidiomycota, the order Ascomycota, and the order Pezizomycotina), and in the order and molecular phylogeny of Tremellomycetes (the order Tremellomycetes). The fungus M. restricta produces a variety of sugar-responsive genes that are involved in sugar metabolism and the metabolism of different sugar compounds, including sugar-specific dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DPHP) and sugar-responsive mannitol dehydrogenase (SADH) [26]. The M. restricta genes have been characterized in detail for sugar-responsive transcription factors. The most similar genes are those encoding a sugar-responsive mannitol dehydrogenase (SADH) and a sugar-responsive sugar-catabolic pathway (SPR) that are both involved in sugar metabolism and the sugar-responsive mannitol dehydrogenase (SADH) and the sugar-responsive sugar-catabolic pathway that are involved in sugar metabolism [26].
