## Abstract
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are life threatening infections that are difficult to diagnose and are often self-limiting in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis and treatment are key in the management of IFIs. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the recently available AHRF (Agar Langerhans) smear test for the diagnosis of IFI in patients with proven or probable IFIs.

Agar smear test was performed on 155 cases of disseminated mycoses and 70 controls in the Oromia wards of Harare Hospital,lio Province, Brazil. Baseline clinical data, laboratory results, and results from laboratory examinations were collected and analyzed.

Agar smear test was able to detect Aspergillus spp. and anastomosis in 102 of the 155 cases, as against 91 of the control samples. But, the detection of the new smear test was not as high as that of the old one. The sensitivity and specificity of the new smear test were 92.7% and 98.4% respectively. But, the sensitivity and specificity of the old and the old smear tests were not similar. The new smear test had higher sensitivity and specificity than the old smear test.

In patients with proven or probable IFIs, the detection of the new smear test is useful in diagnosing the infection. However, IFIs could easily develop again during the course of treatment.

The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the new smear test in patients with proven or probable IFIs, compared to those with patients with patients without IFIs.

The new smear test was able to detect Aspergillus spp. and filamentous growth, especially in the presence of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes. But, the sensitivity and specificity of the old and the new smear tests were 98.7% and 93.7% respectively.


## Introduction
High rates of secondary metabolite production, as well as high rates of mutagenic potential are characteristic factors of wheat contaminatio. Several studies have reported on the high rates of secondary metabolites in wheat contamination, and the accumulation of mutagenic potential. The accumulation of mutagenic potential is the major factor in wheat contamination, as it is the reason why the global yield loss is estimated to be more than 50% in the case of wheat, while the yield losses of other crops are reported to be in the range of 10-40%. The presence of several toxic compounds in grain grains has been reported as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of wheat contamination. These compounds include trichothecenes, thiabendazole, sabinogalactosides, and sabinogalactosides. In the case of wheat, the most toxic compounds, such as chanoflagellates, furazin, furanactosides, tetracycline, and aflatoxin, are the main metabolites producing the primary metabolites of wheat. These compounds have been isolated from various sources, and are responsible for the toxic effects, such as toxicity, formation of stuck bodies, formation of lesions and diseases, and the production of toxic metabolites. Some of the toxic compounds are produced by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, which is a common pathogen that produces cholesta-like metabolites. The cholesta-like metabolites are classified into two types, namely, denaturing and toxic metabolites. Cholesta-like metabolites are produced by the fungus in the form of a conidial, and their production has been reported to be highly localized. The effects of cholesta-like metabolites are mainly found in the acute phase, and in the chronic phase, which includes the period of dormancy. Cholesta-like metabolites are produced by the fungus in the form of a conidiophore and the conidia are produced in the form of mycelia. The concentration of cholesta-like metabolites is much higher than that of other fungal metabolites, as reported by the study of Yuan and Zhang, which showed that cholesta-like metabolites were involved in the metabolism of fungal conidia. These compounds were active in the presence of cholesta-like metabolites.


## Methods
The cultivars “Bactan,” “Bactan Wheat,” “Bactan Wheat with Pestal Colors” were used in this stud. The cultivars “Cressen,” “Cressen Wheat,” “Cressen Wheat with Pestal Colors” were used in this study. The wheat cultivars “Triticum,” “Triticum Oil,” “Triticum Oil,” “Triticum Oil,” and “Triticum Oil,” “Triticum Oil,” “Triticum Oil,” “Beef,” “Beef with Pestal Colors” were used in this study.

The fermentation processes were conducted according to the method described by Nobileff and Reiss [19]. The components used in this study were: the production of sugar alcohols, the production of lactate monohydrate, the sugar alcohol of wheat, the sugar alcohol of barley, the sugar alcohol of sorghum, and the sugar alcohol of wheat cereal. The fermentation process was divided into two phases. Phase 1 consisted of the initial fermentation phase, which consisted of wheat cultivars, and the second phase of the fermentation phase. The initial phase was started by adding sugar alcohols. The final phase was started by adding lactate monohydrate, sugar alcohols, and the sugar alcohol of barley. The sugar alcohols were concentrated by mixing with a blender at a speed of 10 rpm, and the residual sugar alcohols were purified by centrifuging at 10,000×g for 15 min. The supernatants were stored at -20°C.


## Results
For this study, wheat crystal melanin was used as the source of secondary metabolite produced in whea. Wheat crystal melanin was first isolated from the leaves of Leucadendron sp. and was subsequently isolated and purified by centrifugal digestion by centrifugal centrifugation with a yield of approximately 25 g/g. The purified wheat crystal melanin was used in a column chromatography column and hydrolyzed by anhydrous fluoride. The fluorophores were separated and analyzed by LC-MS-MS, with the exception of the methylene side chain, which was not detected by LC-MS-MS. The methylene side chain was not detected in any of the other tested sugars (Table 1). The methylene side chain was also absent from all the tested sugars.

In order to study the production of secondary metabolite by wheat crystal melanin, the production of secondary metabolite by wheat crystal melanin was analyzed by GC-MS. Wheat crystal melanin produced two peaks, one of which was identified as the methylene side chain, which was absent from all the tested sugars (Table 1). In order to investigate whether wheat crystal melanin was produced from the methylene side chain, the production of secondary metabolite by wheat crystal melanin was analyzed by GC-MS. Wheat crystal melanin produced two peaks, one of which was identified as the methylene side chain, which was absent from all the tested sugars (Table 1). In the production of secondary metabolite by wheat crystal melanin, the production of secondary metabolite by wheat crystal melanin was evaluated by using the GC-MS analysis. Wheat crystal melanin produced two peaks, one of which was identified as the methylene side chain, which was absent from all the tested sugars (Table 1).

## Discussion
hansenii
In this study, we examined the frequency of wheat mycelial mycelial genotypes in wheat cultivars from Höhnel and Sö. (S. exigua). Wheat monocultures are composed of a large variety of wheat cultivars with different genetic compositions and climatic conditions, and also wheat cultivars with different genetic compositions. Wheat monocultures are usually monocultured in the winter season and usually have a high level of genetic variation, and the cultivars with high genotype diversity are used for breeding. Wheat cultivars in Finland are mainly dominated by the type of cultivars, which have a high genetic diversity, and are used to improve the wheat cultivars. In contrast, cultivars with a lower genetic diversity are used for breeding. The genotypes of wheat monocultures showed a more diverse genetic composition than those of the type cultivars. Although some genotypes of wheat monocultures were found to be highly polymorphic in the RAPD test, they were mostly from different strains. A large number of genotypes of wheat monocultures were also found to be highly polymorphic. These results are in agreement with the results of other studies conducted in Europe (Mills et al., 2007, Miao et al., 2007, Weems et al., 2010). However, this study is the first to use the wheat cultivars studied in Europe for the study of genotype diversity of wheat cultivars.

Genomic diversity of wheat cultivars was relatively low in the genome of D. hansenii. However, the genotypes of D. hansenii were significantly higher than those of the type cultivars. The genotypes of D. exigua were higher than those of the type cultivars, but the genotypes of D. hansenii were much lower than those of the type cultivars. The results of the results of the present study showed that the genotypes of wheat monocultures in Finland were dominated by the type of cultivars. These results suggest that genotypes of wheat cultivars in Finland are dominated by genotypes of genotypes of wheat cultivars.

The frequency of wheat monocultures was significantly higher in D. hansenii than in D. exigua. The genotypes of D. hansenii were higher than those of the type cultivars. In the present study, the frequencies of the genotypes of D. exigua and D.
