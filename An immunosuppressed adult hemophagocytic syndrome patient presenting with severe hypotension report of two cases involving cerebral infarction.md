## Abstract
Cyanobacteria, yeasts present in a range of environments, and their DNA methylation state may be important for the regulation of the maintenance of virulence in some pathogens. The latter are responsible for the host defence against antifungal drugs. As the complexity of the human body and the functioning of many human-pathogenic fungi makes regulation of cyanobacterial DNA methylation complicated, this paper focused on mechanisms that could explain the variability in virulence in the pathogenic filamentous fungal species Rhizoctonia solani and Aspergillus fumigatus.

The R. solani genome was retrieved from the Carbapenem database by January 23rd, 2016, and is available at http://r.ph.nutu.edu.cn/ncbi/ncbi/r-solani.html.


## Introduction

A 54-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit with progressive deterioration of bilateral and right cerebellar hypokalemia and a right hemophagocytic syndrom. She died after a month of intensive care. The patient's history of diabetes was unremarkable.

Acute presentation
A 45-year-old female patient was initially reported for emergency surgery. She had a low-grade hemoptysis with a normal corneal tone and progressive right hemispherical hemorrhage. She had a right low-grade hemorrhage of approximately 8 cm × 2.5 cm over the posterior wall. She had an initial thoracic and external genital examination. A right low-grade hemorrhage was present on microscopic examination. A right low-grade hemorrhage was observed in the external genital mucosa. The patient's symptoms were typical of the other patient’s disease. She had a low-grade hemorrhage of approximately 8 cm × 2.5 cm over the posterior wall, which was found to be infected. The corneal tone and skin lesions were normal. The patient was initially prescribed oral antibiotics but was later prescribed corticosteroids but was not prescribed any other drugs. The patient's neurological status improved but was not monitored. She was seen at the hospital three weeks after her second operation.

Her neurological status improved but she remained poorly monitored. On examination, the patient had a right low-grade hemorrhage of approximately 8 cm × 2.5 cm over the posterior wall, which was found to be infected. The corneal tone and skin lesions were normal. The patient was initially prescribed corticosteroids but was later prescribed corticosteroids but was not prescribed any other drugs. The patient's neurological status improved but her monitoring status was not monitored. On examination, the patient had a right low-grade hemorrhage of approximately 8 cm × 2.5 cm over the posterior wall, which was found to be infected. The corneal tone and skin lesions were normal. The patient was initially prescribed corticosteroids but was later prescribed steroids but was not prescribed any other drugs.

## Methods
Study sites and samples
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo (Protocol number 27/2012) and performed by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo (Protocol number: 60/2012). The research was approved by the Ethical Review Committees of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo and the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of São Paulo. All subjects were healthy and provided written informed consent.

Study design and population
The study was conducted according to the institutional review board of the University of São Paulo, and the clinical data were collected from patients admitted to the hospital during the study period. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo. All subjects were adults and were healthy (not pregnant or lactating). They were followed in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was conducted according to the recommendations in the Helsinki Declaration, and the patients’ data were obtained after the informed consent of the patients.

Ethical approval
The ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo approved this study. The data were obtained after the informed consent of the patients.

Data collection and analysis
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo. The data were collected from patients admitted to the hospital during the study period. The data were collected from the patients’ demographic characteristics, physical and mental state, the presence of the primary antibodies, the presence of the secondary antibodies and the presence of the antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or the serum. The data were collected from the clinical characteristics of patients and the laboratory findings. The data were collected from the patients’ medical records.


## Results
At autopsy, the patient was found to have haematologic evidence of cerebrospinal fluid infiltration and other sign.

Recovery of the Hypersensitive Reaction Syndrome
In a second experiment, the patient was treated with metronidazole, and the patient was found to have a hemoglobin of 27.2 g/L. At the end of the course, the patient was found to be in a good neurologic status and was receiving a standard of care for signs of hypoglycemia. The patient was finally found to have stabilized and was receiving standard treatment for hypoglycemia.

The patient had been misdiagnosed as having a seizure at a local hospital, and was misdiagnosed as having a diuretic reaction. The patient was diagnosed with generalized tonic-clonic seizures at the hospital, and was treated with metronidazole for 1 month. At the end of the follow-up period, the patient was found to have a headache similar to that of the original patient and had been in a good neurologic state and had received standard treatment for signs of hypoglycemia.

The patient had developed several neurologic signs including the presence of the giantaguyae, the collapse of the upper lobe, and the deposition of the brainstem. The patient was found to have a persistent cough. The patient was found to have an orochdomyolytic syndrome. He had a seizure in the course of the experiment. The patient was found to have clinical signs of hydrocephalus.

Neuroimaging
The patient was found to have a highly progressive phase of the brainstem. The patient had a cerebrospinal fluid sedimentation of 1.2 × 10^5 CFU/ml.


## Discussion

The first case was described in a patient who had a severe pulmonary alveolar infection, which was later described in a patient with cerebral and cerebral infarction [10. The second case was described in a patient who had a severe cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage [6]. In the first case, the patient was not administered nephrotoxic treatment and the patient developed fever and jaundice in the brain [9]. In the second case, the patient had been treated with anti-fungal agents and died of septic shock [11].

The diagnosis of disseminated encephalomyelitis was established by immunohistochemistry and molecular testing of CSF for fungal growth [12]. Our patient presented with complete loss of the left ventricle and no evidence of disease, and was diagnosed with cerebral infarction [6].

The patient with cerebral infarction did not receive any immunosuppressive therapy and the CSF findings of cerebral infarction were negative. We suspect that the patient had disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patient had been treated with anti-fungal therapy and then died.

The patient with cerebral infarction was successfully treated with oral fluconazole and the CSF findings of cerebral infarction were negative. The patient was discharged from the hospital after obtaining no evidence of brain infarction. The patient's condition improved and was discharged from the hospital without any additional symptoms, and we were able to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated encephalomyelitis.

There are several reports of encephalitis in adults. In the literature review, 19 cases were reported in children [14]. Only one case was described in a male patient with cerebral infarction. This patient had a positive CSF culture of Cryptococcus neoformans. No information was available on the type of CSF culture and the patient had a positive blood culture.

There are no reports of cerebral infarction in adults. However, in the literature review, a case of cerebral infarction was described in a patient with cerebral infarction [8].

There is no case report of cerebral infarction in adults. There are no reports of encephalitis in adults. There is no case report of cerebral infarction in children. There is no case report of cerebral infarction in children.
