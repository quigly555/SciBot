## Abstract
Candida species are common colonizers of the human skin and mucosa, causing numerous superficial infections, even in healthy individuals. However, Candida species with a high degree of resistance to the clinically available antifungal drugs have potential to become an attractive therapy. Hence, it is imperative to discover new antifungal targets without yet introducing Candida species into the host system. In this study, we screened a library of compounds with a potential antifungal activity in C. albicans and identified the GH19, a phospholipase enzyme originally identified as an important target of antifungal drugs.


## Introduction
(2013. Fusarium Octopus was found on a leaf of a bryophyte, Saffron ambori, and was characterized morphologically by numerous stromatic and stilboreal conidiomata, melanized pseudohyphae and a +2 to +3-fold capacity for phialides, with the phialides to be readily distinguished from the phialides produced by Fusarium sp. (McClintock, 2004). The taxonomic status of the genus is largely unresolved, with the type species F. urophellae L.I. et al. (2017). F. urophellae is widely distributed in the environment, and may be found on diverse woody plants (Chupp & Tauber, 2010).

Fusarium species are commonly found on various tree species, including angiosperms, gymnosperms, and herbs. Fusarium urophellae and F. oxysporum are common pathogenic species of woody plants. Fusarium oleaginosus is the causal agent of oleomycosis (Schwein.) Cooke, a fatal, necrotrophic root rot disease that affects more than 200 species of trees in the Northern Hemisphere (Vargas-Garcia et al., 2012; El-Brazwat, Juglancon, & Cogliati, 2017). In North America, F. oxysporum causes severe, but less severe, oleomycosis (Holmström, 1975). In the Northern Hemisphere, F. oxysporum is an important pathogen of softwoods, including Norway spruce and elm tree, and causes a severe disease in elm trees (Holmström, 1975; Sun et al., 2017). F. oxysporum can infect leaves of trees and produce necrotic lesions, called “oeosinophilic necrotic lesions”, which can result in the death of the tree (Holmström, 1975; Sun et al., 2017).

Several fungi can cause oleomycosis. For example, Aspergillus niger and A.

## Discussion
Morphologically, Exophiala (former Tausconisporium) and Daphnialea (former Tausconisporium) share similar conidiomata with Octopus (Sigurrodon: Tausconisporium: Tausconisporium: Tausconisporium) (see Fig 1. Although Daphnialea and Octopus share similar conidiomata, the former and Daphnialea species share more conidiomata (Fig 1) and more conidiophores (Fig 2) than the latter (Fig 1) (see also Table 1). Septoria (former Tausconisporium) and Septoria (former Tausconisporium) differ in conidiophore size, but they do not share the same conidiophores. Septoria and Septoria-like genera from other genera were detected (Fig 1).

The genera in Fig 2, which represent fungi and plants, are similar to Exophiala and Tausconisporium, and also possess the same conidiomata. Septoria and Septoria-like genera were found in only a few genera (Figs 1 and 2), and the genera in Fig 1 were found in all genera (Fig 2). Septoria-like genera were also detected in the genera in Fig 1, but they were only found in Tausconisporium, Octopomatales, and Ustilago (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera from Ustilago were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera from the Octopus genus were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera from the Tausconisporium genus were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera from Octopus were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera from Octopus were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1). Septoria-like genera were only found in Tausconisporium (Fig 1).
