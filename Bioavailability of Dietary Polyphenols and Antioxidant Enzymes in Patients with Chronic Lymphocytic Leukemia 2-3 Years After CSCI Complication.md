## Abstract

CLR-PCR was performed on serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine samples from patients with CSCI-CLR, and the effect of glucocorticoids on the fungal burden and cytotoxicity of CCR-PCR was evaluate.

The mean age of the patients was 52.1 years. The median age was 40 years. The clinical manifestations included fever (90.8%), headache (75.4%), neck stiffness (90.4%), aachrichodermia (90.4%), lymphocytosis (90.4%), and fever in the arm and leg muscles (90.4%). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was >1,200 cells/mm3. The mean serum levels of polyphenol oxidase (PON) were >1,100 copies/mL in 10/20 patients. The mean serum levels of HbsA and HbsB were >1,200 copies/mL in 11/20 patients, and the mean serum levels of ß-lactams were >1,200 copies/mL in 10/20 patients. The serum levels of galactoferrin, proline-rich DNA-binding protein (GRP), and pyranosylated linoleic acid were significantly higher in patients with CCR-CLR than in those with CCR-CLR survivors (P < 0.01). The mean age of the patients was 43.4 years. The incidence of CCR-CLR in CCR-CR-positive patients was 13.9 cases/100 person-years (P < 0.01), and 7.7 cases/100 person-years (P = 0.02), for CCR-CLR-positive patients. Nine patients died due to CCR-CLR-CLR. The serum levels of PON, HbsA, and PON were >1,200 copies/mL in 10/20 patients, and PON was higher in CCR-CLR-positive patients than in CCR-CLR-negative patients (P < 0.01). Serum PON was higher in CCR-CLR-positive patients than in CCR-CLR-negative patients (P < 0.01).


## Introduction
The current “Warburg Effect” (Warburg) includes a mixture of mechanisms to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, including the action of the antioxidant system of metalloproteases, and the action of the anti-ROS defenses. Metalloproteases are enzymes that degrade both organic and inorganic matter to aqueous, as well as free radical-attenuating, and can be classified into different groups depending on their biochemical functions, and their catalytic sites (Figure 1). The free radical-attenuating and free radical-producing (fMR) enzymes can be classified in different groups based on their electron density. The free radical-producing (fMR) enzymes are of particular interest due to their ability to alter the redox potential of the surrounding medium, and the increasing resistance of the microorganisms to oxidative stresses (1). This is important for the efficient growth of their microorganisms.

FMR enzymes are important for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a wide range of microorganisms, and they are the first group enzyme that can oxidize free radicals and free radicals, and thus, they can participate in the redox balance of the cell (2). The presence of antioxidants and free radical scavengers in FMR enzymes has been confirmed in a large number of microorganisms (3). FMR enzymes can act on a variety of substrates, including organic matter, water, and various compounds that are used as feedstocks for biofuels, industrial enzymes, and chemical and chemical compounds (4).


## Methods
The samples were collected by the clinical department, the laboratory, and the resident physicia. We monitored the urine pH, pH indicator, and the final content of urine. We also measured the content of urine protein content by the microbial enzyme assay (LBA) and the internal standard curve (ISA) (Fig 1).

LBA assay
The assay of bioavailability of the polyphenols and their fractions was carried out using the LBA-lactate standard method [8]. Briefly, the lactic acid (A) was added to the supernatant of the first-phase of the lysis reaction to obtain a concentration of 0.5 mM lactic acid. The reaction was carried out in a boiling water bath at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The lactic acid was diluted with distilled water to obtain a final concentration of 1.5-2.0 mM and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with distilled water. The lactic acid was then added to the extraction reagent and the mixture was placed on a gradient of ethanol to acetone (C) to methanol (M) and then was stirred at 200 rpm for 10 min. The methanol was removed and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method [9]. The results were expressed as µmol/L. LBA assay was performed in duplicate and the mean and standard deviation of the results were calculated.

SDA assay
SDA assay was performed using a previously described method [10]. Briefly, the silymarin (SDA) was added to the samples of the first-phase of lysis reaction to obtain a concentration of 0.5 mM silymarin. The reaction was carried out in a boiling water bath at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The silymarin was diluted with distilled water to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mM silymarin. The silymarin was then added to the extraction reagent and the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 10 min. The silymarin was removed and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method [10].

LBA assay
The lactic acid (A) was added to the supernatant of the first-phase of lysis reaction to obtain a concentration of 1.5 mM lactic acid.


## Results
5) reduced in patients with CSCI-associated death compared with patients with CSCI-associated death (.50 ± 1.22 vs. 1.59 ± 1.80, P<0.01). A comparison of survival in patients with and without CSCI-associated death demonstrated no significant differences in survival between patients with and without CSCI-associated death (4.38 ± 0.92 vs. 3.92 ± 0.87, P<0.05). These findings are consistent with the results of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve (Fig 2). We also compared survival after CSCI-associated death between patients with and without CSCI-associated death. There was no significant difference in survival (P<0.05) between patients with and without CSCI-associated death (Table 4).

In a second model, we compared survival of CSCI-associated patients with and without CSCI-associated death by the proportion of patients with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count < 50 cells/mm^3. There were no significant differences in survival between patients with and without CSCI-associated death (Table 4).

Given that the degree of CSCI-associated death was reduced in patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Table 4), we next evaluated whether the degree of CSCI-associated death was also reduced in patients with chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. We observed that patients with CSCI-associated death had significantly higher (P<0.05) survival (Table 4). In addition, we evaluated the proportion of patients with CSCI-associated CSCI-associated death after administration of a single dose of a CSCI-concentrated dose of amphotericin B or fluconazole. The administration of a single dose of fluconazole (125 µg/mL) resulted in a reduction of survival (2.3 ± 1.24 vs. 5.1 ± 2.2, P<0.05) after 1 year of follow-up.

## Discussion
This study is the first to describe the intestinal microbiota of C. neoformans in a mouse model of infection. We found that C. neoformans colonized intestinal epithelium significantly increased the abundance of CD19 and CD14, both of which are expressed in the gut. CD19 and CD14 were expressed at higher levels in C. neoformans. CD14 and CD19, which are key regulators of CD14 and CD14a, are found in the intestinal epithelium of C. neoformans [28], [29]. CD14 is also required for the intestinal uptake of sugars and that CD14 is involved in the clearance of pathogenic fungi from the intestinal epithelium [29]. The intestinal microbiota is highly dynamic and colonized with different microbes including fungi and other microorganisms [31], [32].
