## Abstract
Meningitis is the second leading cause of adult meningitis in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the availability of powerful diagnostic tests, the high rates of failure and mortality in immunocompromised patients, the limited number of intervention trials, and the absence of a universal treatment regimen for meningitis, there is a pressing need for new approaches to improve outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a novel combination of neurosurgical procedures (SPCO) and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of adult meningitis in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Two hundred and seventy adult patients with acute onset of the disease were enrolled in this study. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain radiological findings were collected at hospitalization.

The median age was 39 years, and the median length of illness was 5.4 years. The treatment arms were 1.0 years for CSF, 5.3 years for MRI. Median duration of illness was 27 days. The treatment arm had significantly worse outcomes (P < .0001) in the combined neurosurgical approach (P = .02) versus not (P = .02), with the combination MRI having a superior outcome (P = .02), and better prognoses (P = .02) with fewer side effects (P < .0001). The improvement rate was 81% in the combined approach and 69% in the neurosurgical approach, and this was reflected in the better prognosis achieved by the combined approach versus not (P = .02).


## Introduction
The resistance to common antifungal drugs is increasing, leading to an increase in life expectancy of patients with fungal infections, as well as the development of resistance to all currently available drugs, including the echinocandins, flucytosine and amphotericin B [1]. The increasing number of infections has caused a major reduction in the number of antifungal drugs, in particular, the echinocandins. As a result, there are fewer available antifungal drugs, which represent the most widely used class of antifungal drugs, especially in patients suffering from severe fungal infections.

The echinocandins are used as first-line drugs against invasive mycosis, with flucytosine, an orally effective class of antifungals, being the most widely used antifungals in the clinic. However, echinocandins are highly cytotoxic and have a wide spectrum of activity. Some echinocandins, such as caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin, have a short half-life of ~2 h and, therefore, they are frequently given as a prophylaxis drug rather than as a therapy [2]. In the last decades, new echinocandin-resistant Candida species and azole-resistant Aspergillus species have been described [3-6]. The number of echinocandin-resistant species and azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. has been increasing [7].

## Methods

.3. Evaluation of Purity of Agar Using Ester-Based Pathogen-Free Mini-Beads
The cultivation medium of C. neoformans was sterilized at 121°C for 24 h with 15 ml of 70% ethanol. The cells were lysed in 2 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl and incubated at 37°C for 30 min with shaking at 200 rpm. The biofilm layer was filtered and washed with 0.9% NaCl. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to a sterile microfuge tube and diluted with sterile water to 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% NaCl-0.05% sodium bicarbonate, which is the standard culture medium of the Brazilian National Institute for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NIMES) [19]. The suspensions were prepared in sterile distilled water and adjusted to 0.9% NaCl. A suspension of ~2.5 × 10^7 cells/ml in 0.9% NaCl was prepared in sterile distilled water. After a single addition of 1 ml of PBS, the medium was transferred to a sterile microfuge tube, centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube. The optical density of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000^TM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The biofilm was divided into three subsamples, each containing ~50 µl of the suspension and the assay was performed in duplicate. The biofilm with absorbance value of 0.5-1.0 was considered as biofilm-free and the biofilm with absorbance value of 0.5-1.0 was considered as biofilm-fungal. The biofilm with absorbance value of 0.5-2.0 was considered as biofilm-fungal. The cell viability of the biofilm was evaluated in 96-well microplates in the absence of biofilm. The biofilm with absorbance value of 0.5-2.0 was considered as biofilm-fungal. The assays were performed in triplicate and the data were expressed as the percentage of biofilm-free and biofilm-fungal biofilm.

## Results
neoformans strain. The results showed that the tested polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity resulted in an increase in colony size of the strain MUM-2. The addition of 50 µg/ml of the polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity showed an increase in colony size of the strain MUM-2. This result indicates that the polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity could be a promising antifungal activity against C. neoformans.

Effect of Polybutylene Substituted with Potential Antifungal Activity on the Microbial Burden
The influence of polybutylene on the microbial burden in the colon was evaluated by the effect of polybutylene on the microbial burden of C. neoformans. The results showed that the polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity was able to significantly decrease the microbial burden of C. neoformans (Figure 6). The bacterial burden in the colonized host was significantly reduced by the addition of polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity. The results indicated that polybutylene in the presence of potential antifungal activity can be a promising antifungal activity against C. neoformans.

Effect of Polybutylene Substituted with Potential Antifungal Activity on the Microbial Burden in the Presence of a Medium with a C. neoformans
The effect of polybutylene in the presence of a medium with a C. neoformans strain MUM-2 on the microbial burden of C. neoformans was evaluated. The results showed that the polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity could effectively reduce the bacterial burden in the colonized host by the addition of polybutylene. The results indicated that the polybutylene substituted with potential antifungal activity can be a promising antifungal activity against C. neoformans.

## Discussion
Fungal pathogens are opportunistic, fungal, and parasitic bacteria. They infect and cause a wide array of diseases, including life-threatening infectious and life-threatening infectious complications [1], [2]. Some fungal pathogens are more aggressive than others, such as Histoplasma capsulatum and Aspergillus fumigatus [3].
