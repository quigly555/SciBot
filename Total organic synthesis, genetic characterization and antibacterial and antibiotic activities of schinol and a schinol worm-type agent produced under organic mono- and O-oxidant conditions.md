## Abstract
Fungal infections are a growing public health concern. Among the main Candida species, the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata is the most commonly isolated species from immunocompromised patients. The majority of immune-deficient clinical isolates are therefore promptly discarded because of their pathogenic potentialities. The antifungal properties of C. glabrata, however, have been well studied. Here, we review current antifungal therapy and the available options for treatment of this yeast. Our goals were to provide a concise overview of antifungal therapy in C. glabrata and to discuss the main clinical aspects that can impact the decision to proceed with therapy. We also discuss recent advances regarding treatment of C. glabrata and how to optimize therapy for the treatment of candidiasis.


## Introduction
Selection of drug targets can vary according to the species, and the degree of overlap of target species is a major factor determining the pharmacological value of drugs [1]. Drug targets can be defined by two main entities, which are heterogeneous: (i) the targets can be expressed as a single gene, (ii) the genes can be expressed in a multilayered structure, (iii) the targets can be expressed in a multiple gene matrix, and (iv) the drug targets are transcribed by the same or both RNA polymerase. The definition of drug targets in fungi has been studied in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which is a model system for studying cell biology and cell biology of pathogens, and has been used for the study of drug targets in several groups of fungi, including the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans [2]. Most studies on fungal drug targets have focused on the human fungal pathogen, and have been conducted in the family of Candida and Candida albicans [3]. Fungal drug targets have been extensively studied in the family of ascomycetes, and they include the genes encoding a protein-protein interaction regulator (PPI) and a key enzyme for endocytosis in the fungal cell wall [4]. However, the mechanisms by which PPI is involved in fungal pathogenesis are poorly understood.

PPI is a major PPIase, and is synthesized in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene cluster. The catalytic enzyme catalyzes the first reaction of PPI to form the de novo PPIase (PPI) catalytic enzyme, which converts the first intermediate of PPI to the active PPI product, which then serves as the second intermediate of the catalytic product [5]. In C. albicans, PPI is involved in cell wall biosynthesis, and in C. albicans, PPIases are activated by an enzyme PPIase, which contains an enzyme called PPIase homology (PhcA) which has a role in the biosynthesis of the PPI product [6]. In this regard, there is a high similarity between the human PPI and the fungal PPI, which may explain why Ppiase genes are found in C. albicans and other fungi. The PPIase in C.

2.3. Antimicrobial Activities of a Schinol-Type Efficacy Test
The antimicrobial activities of a schinol-type Efficacy Test (S-E) were performed as described previously [26, 27] using the EO with 0.05% tetraspopropyl-2-aminopropyl ether as the antimicrobial agent. Briefly, the sample was ground with liquid nitrogen and 1.0 ml of this extract was added to a pre-chilled sterile 0.8% volumetric saline solution. The suspension was vortexed at maximum speed for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The obtained supernatant was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.0 ml of this diluent was added to a pre-chilled sterile 0.8% volumetric saline solution and this was then poured into a pre-chilled sterile 0.8% volumetric saline tube and homogenized by homogenizer with a mixture of beads. The suspension was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The homogenate was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.0 ml of this diluted solution was added to a pre-chilled 0.8% volumetric saline tube. The obtained supernatant was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.0 ml of this diluent was added to a pre-chilled 0.8% volumetric saline tube and then homogenized by homogenizer with a mixture of beads. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min and the resultant supernatant was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.0 ml of this diluent was added to a pre-chilled 0.8% volumetric saline tube. The obtained supernatant was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.0 ml of this diluent was added to a pre-chilled 0.8% volumetric saline tube. The obtained supernatant was then diluted with 0.8% volumetric saline and 1.


## Results
The lower antibacterial activity observed in the Escherichia coli strain and the antibiotic activity in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain was further confirmed by the use of an isogenic yeast strai. The antimicrobial activity of the schinol worm-type agent was confirmed by the broth microdilution method (Table 1). The antimicrobial activity of the schinol worm-type agent was also confirmed by using the broth microdilution method (Table 1).

Chemical Characterization of Schinol Worm-Type Agents
To understand the chemical structures of the schinol worm-type agents, FTIR spectra of FTIR spectra of Schinol Worm-Type Agents were analyzed by MS/MS. The FTIR spectra of FTIR spectra of the schinol worm-type agents are shown in Fig 3. The FTIR spectra of FTIR spectra of the schinol worm-type agents are shown in Fig 3.

Fluorescence Reductase Activity of the schinol worm-type agent
To study the ability of the schinol worm-type agent to inhibit the growth of S. enterica, a fluorescence reductase assay was performed. The fluorescence reductase activity of the schinol worm-type agent was found to be 4.69 (± 0.57) U/mg (Fig 4). The activity of the schinol worm-type agent was found to be 32 (± 2.40) U/mg (Fig 4). The fluorescence reductase activity of the schinol worm-type agent was found to be 20 (± 1.88) U/mg (Fig 4).

Optimization of Schinol Worm-Type Agents for Phytotoxicity
Phytotoxicity testing of the schinol worm-type agent against the human fungal pathogen P. aeruginosa was conducted. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig 5. The best cytotoxicity was observed for the schinol worm-type agent against the P. aeruginosa strain (P<0.


## Discussion

To date, the antibacterial activity of schinol and a schinol worm-type agent was found to be relatively weak, with MIC values of 8 and 16 µg/mL, respectivel. This suggests that schinol does not play a key role in the antibacterial activity of schinol. However, it should be noted that schinol worm-type nematodes have a higher MIC value for a drug to inhibit cytochrome P450 than a schinol worm-type agent. However, this could be due to differences in the chemical composition of the drugs used in the experiments, such as the presence of secondary metabolites [32].

The antimicrobial activity of schinol and a schinol worm-type agent against Gram positive and -negative bacteria was also assessed. The results showed that the antibacterial activity was weak, with MIC values of 1 to 2 µg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of schinol was decreased in the presence of benzyl alcohol and ethyl acetate, but remained unchanged in the presence of the two compounds. In addition, the antibacterial activity of schinol was decreased in the presence of the antibiotic, clindamycin and ceftriaxone. The antibacterial activity of schinol was decreased in the presence of chloramphenicol, which was not present in the control. This suggests that the antimicrobial activity of schinol is likely due to the presence of these compounds in the worms.

However, it is possible that the antibacterial activity of schinol is a result of the selective action of the nematode parasite. It is known that nematodes possess a wide range of mechanisms to combat parasites, including defense-related mechanisms such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, development of novel antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the establishment of antibiotic resistance. It has been suggested that the nematode parasite maintains a low level of virulence by releasing antimicrobial peptides. In addition, many pathogens are able to use the parasite to invade host tissues through the skin and through the gut [33]. Therefore, the nematode worms may also release antimicrobial peptides during their excretory/secretory pathways [33].

In the current study, a total of 72 schinol worms were infected with schinol and one worm was treated with an anaerobic derivative of schinol and a schinol worm-type agent.
