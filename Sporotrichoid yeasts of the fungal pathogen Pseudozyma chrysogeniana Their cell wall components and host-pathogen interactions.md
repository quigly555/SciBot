## Abstract
The Cryptococcus gattii VGIIa population has been identified in the Americas and Europe. Genetic differentiation of the VGIIa population has been reported from crosses of the “endotherkin” species. In the Americas, crosses were organized into clades that encompassed seven major molecular types and were characterized by a high degree of genome plasticity. Here we report genetic, genomic, and molecular studies of the genetic diversity of the two genetically divergent lineages, VGIIa and VGIIb, and their subsequent mode of differentiation.

Genetic differentiation was achieved by both selection and the action of recombination. Splicing, and meiosis, are key mechanisms of genetic differentiation. One of the most important virulence traits of the hybrid is its capacity to undergo sexual reproduction. We previously reported that sexual reproduction can occur during meiosis, a reversible process that also occurs in the non-recombinant lineages. We found that the sexual reproduction ability of the CGIIa population can evolve during meiosis. In the CGIIa population, sexual reproduction occurs at a much lower rate than at other molecular types. When the sexual reproduction ability of the CGIIa population was compared to the other molecular types, the development of invasive disease was significantly reduced compared to that of the non-invasive forms.

The sexual reproduction ability of the CGIIa population can evolve during meiosis. This is likely associated with the relatively small size of the hybrids. In addition, the CGIIa population is characterized by a high level of chromosome segregation and size variation.

By studying the CGIIa and non-C. gattii genetic diversity in the American continent, we identified a lower degree of genomic plasticity and then accelerated genetic differentiation. This work reveals a genetic process in the hybrid that is highly dynamic in the American continent.


## Introduction
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) comprises a group of opportunistic pathogens that can cause pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients [1]. The pathogenic microorganism is considered to be the causative agent of the very serious lung infection known as pulmonary mycosis (PM) [2]. PM is characterized by the presence of thick mucus layer and lack of moisture in the tissue. The thick mucus in the airway mucosa causes tissue damage and eventually death in pulmonary fibrosis [3]. Despite the availability of effective anti-inflammatory drugs, the number of effective drugs continues to increase. Only the liposomal and eosinophilic eosinophils are the most susceptible to eosinophilin. They are unable to penetrate the thick mucus layer and are not able to overcome the eosinophilic microorganism. Therefore, eosinophilin is the ideal drug target because it can penetrate the thick mucus layer and overcome the challenge of eosinophilin.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE_2) is a cytokine produced by macrophages and neutrophils [4]. It is produced by many pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leishmania donovani, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [5, 6]. The role of PGE_2 in PM has been well-documented [7]. In fact, the role of PGE_2 in PM has been found to be important for the pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii infection [8] and P. aeruginosa in pulmonary fibrosis [9]. P. aeruginosa is a major opportunistic human pathogen of people with a weakened immune system such as HIV/AIDS, who become infected with AIDS.

P. aeruginosa is a polymorphic yeast with four mating types (a, ß, <U+03B3> and d). The a mating type, pini, has a mating type locus with two alleles, a and a, which are present in all environmental P.


## Methods
2.1. Strains and Growth Media
The clinical isolates C. albicans ATCC 90028 and C. tropicalis ATCC 90030 were used in this study. The isolates were maintained in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) at 37 °C. The yeast cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). The cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the concentrations indicated in the text. The media was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at the concentrations indicated in the text.

2.2. Growth Assays
To evaluate the growth of the C. albicans strains, a serial dilution of the stock RPMI-1640 medium was performed, as previously described (Moumana et al., 2016). The C. albicans strains were cultured in YPD medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 1% agar) at 30 °C for 48 h. The cultures were then centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and used for the growth assay.


## Results
 2010. In addition, we identified putative fungal cell wall components (Sgtb, Pyrococcus, and Pyroabacillus) in the fungal genomes of P. chrysogeniana (Table S5).

P. chrysogeniana genome sequence and structural characteristics
P. chrysogeniana genome sequence was searched for similarities with the genomes of other fungal species. The most similar sequences to P. chrysogeniana were those of the Basidiomycetes (74.5% similarity; Fig 1A) and the Ascomycota (37.3% similarity; Fig 1B). In total, 41.2% of the P. chrysogeniana genome was similar to the other fungal species. The average sequence similarity of the fungal species was between 98.5% and 99.2%, with an average of 93.2% and 100%, respectively. The average sequence similarity of the Basidiomycetes (97.7%) was lower than the Ascomycota (88.4%), with an average of 77.9%. The average sequence similarity of the Basidiomycetes (97.9%) was higher than the Ascomycota (99.9%), with an average of 91.7%. The average sequence similarity of the Ascomycota (96.2%) was lower than the Basidiomycetes (92.4%), with an average of 86.2%.

## Discussion
Pseudozyma chrysogeniana shares several cell wall components with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen that is common in forest soils (44. However, the presence of these cell wall components may reflect the different extents of the pathogenic activity of this species.

Pseudozyma chrysogeniana has also been reported as a pathogen of several plant species (40, 41, 50). However, the majority of the reported cases of P. chrysogeniana infection of apple trees in California have been isolated from two plant species (54). However, the pathogen of the genus Pseudomonas can also be found in the gut of apple trees, and the pathogen is also commonly found in other woody plant species (40, 41, 50).

In this study, we have investigated the roles of the melanin pigment in P. chrysogeniana infection in different hosts. The ability of P. chrysogeniana to produce melanin in response to host-pathogen interactions has not been previously reported.

We found that P. chrysogeniana induced the production of melanin and the production of this pigment in response to host-pathogen interactions. Melanin is produced by C. albicans, which is a common, saprophytic fungus, and is required for proper infection of several plant species (44). C. albicans was found to produce melanin and in many cases, melanin-producing bacteria have been isolated from infected apple woody tissue (48). The results suggest that P. chrysogeniana can produce melanin and melanin-producing bacteria that are capable of infecting apple trees.

Because P. chrysogeniana can produce melanin in response to host-pathogen interactions, we investigated the ability of P. chrysogeniana to synthesize melanin in response to host-pathogen interactions. The results showed that P. chrysogeniana has the capability to produce melanin in response to host-pathogen interactions. This ability could be due to the presence of melanin-producing bacteria in the soil or the production of melanin-producing enzymes in the host-pathogen interactions.

In this study, we found that P. chrysogeniana can produce melanin in response to host-pathogen interactions. The results suggest that P.
