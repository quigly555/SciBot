## Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. A previous study reported a pharmacokinetic (PK) safety profile for F6117, a polyene diazonium-5 polylactide, for prevention of cryptococcosis and disease in HIV-infected patients.

The current study aimed to analyze the pharmacokinetics of F6117 at an early stage in order to inform dosage recommendations.

One hundred and forty patients were included. Ziehl-Neelsen-Arbstein test (ZNAT) was performed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of F6117 in comparison with standard antifungal drug fluconazole. PK data were analyzed by statistical Mann-Whitney U test.

The average pharmacokinetic (PK) of fluconazole at an early stage was 98 mg/dl (range 16-107 mg/dl) with fluconazole 50 mg/dl in 5 of the 50 patients. Among the 20 patients, 10 patients had an early-stage infection and none of the 20 patients had an early-stage infection. The mean steady-state concentrations were 1.4, 0.7, 0.9, and 0.8 mg/dl after 48 h of treatment, respectively.


## Introduction
Microbial biofilms are structured communities of microorganisms adhered to one another or embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM) (Giandamani et al., 2015). Many microorganisms are able to thrive in a protective environment in close contact with their host and their biofilms. ECM is a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and other biofilms (Hageva et al., 2011; Haas, 2011; Fernández-Herrera, 2012).


## Methods
linicaltrial.gov;datecited 2017-01-09).

Patients were retrospectively managed with the use of available electronic medical records. They were followed up at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTS) for up to six months after neutropenia diagnosis, and subsequently underwent a complete blood count and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) count.

Laboratory tests
Blood and CSF specimens from all patients with acute febrile neutropenia were routinely collected. CSF was analyzed with the use of a Bruker-Dalton X-100 and a Qubit instrument, using standard laboratory procedures. CSF acid-fast count (AFCC) was performed on the specimen, using the Qubit^® instrument (Invitrogen) and the specimen was stored in the same condition. CSF results were interpreted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. CSF acid-fast counts (AFCC) were performed on the CSF of all patients with acute febrile neutropenia.

Laboratory tests
Laboratory tests were performed using standard laboratory procedures. CSF was processed in the same way as described above. The same results were then calculated, and the results of CSF acid-fast counts (AFCC) were also performed, on the CSF of all patients with acute febrile neutropenia.

Laboratory tests
CNS was performed in the same way, on the same specimen, on a similar pathogen. A standard antifungal assay, which consists of two types of cephalosporins, was also performed. These antifungal concentrations were: fluconazole (FLC), flucytosine (FLC), and ketoconazole (KTC). These concentrations were chosen based on the CLSI guidelines.

Laboratory tests
The C. gattii antigen-specific antigen and antibodies (ASAsA) were detected using C. gattii specific antigen (CgAsA) and antibodies (CgAsA-CgAsA) in the same way. A standard antifungal assay, which consists of two types of cephalosporins, was also performed.


## Results

These patients were included in a prospective study to determine the efficacy of high-dose empiric oral corticosteroids in patients with acute febrile neutropeni. Treatment with high-dose empiric oral corticosteroids was not associated with any adverse events.

Patient characteristics and laboratory findings
The mean fluconazole MIC of the combined regimen was 16 µg/ml for the four neutropenic patients (Table 2). The median fluconazole MIC was 0.31 µg/ml for the four neutropenic patients and 0.32 µg/ml for the four high-dose empiric oral corticoids (Table 2). The mean fluconazole MIC of the four neutropenic patients was 0.32 µg/ml for the four high-dose empiric oral corticoids and 0.32 µg/ml for the four high-dose empiric oral corticosteroids (Table 2).

Laboratory and biochemical parameters
The median concentrations of serum albumin (GSH) and creatinine ( creatinine) were 0.916, 0.869, and 0.813 mg/mL, respectively, for the four neutropenic patients and 0.722 mg/mL for the four high-dose empiric oral corticoids and 0.569 mg/mL for the four high-dose empiric oral corticosteroids (Table 3). The median concentrations of serum urea (Urea) and creatinine ( creatinine) were 0.93, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.99 mg/mL, respectively, for the four neutropenic patients and 0.923, 0.98, and 0.99 mg/mL for the four high-dose empiric oral corticoids and 0.903, 0.98, and 0.99 mg/mL for the four high-dose empiric oral corticosteroids, respectively (Table 3). The median concentrations of serum creatinine ( creatinine) and serum urea ( creatinine) were 0.


## Discussion
 2009. Additionally, a number of patients have reported that antibiotic therapy is associated with adverse effects (Kämpfer et al., 2009). In the recent literature review, 22 cases of renal toxicity were reported. Only one case of renal toxicity was reported in one patient with renal insufficiency (S.A.S. et al., 2016). The patient in our case had undergone renal transplantation and was treated with corticosteroid for 4 months and then renal dialysis. The patient in the case presented to the ER and had a kidney transplant that was delayed by 2 weeks.

Infectious etiology
Infectious etiology is the diagnosis of renal dysfunction caused by an infectious agent. The most common cause of infection in patients is infection by Burkholderia, where the organism is transmitted via the inhalation of the fungus. In our case, the patient had a history of travel to a location with a history of travel to the ER and was treated with oral antibiotics.

Infectious etiology
Pulmonary infection is a primary cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which occurs when an infectious agent enters the respiratory tract. The patient in our case had a history of travel to a location with a history of travel to the ER. Pulmonary infection was suspected because the patient had a history of travel to the ER. This case report illustrates the importance of the use of antibacterials and microbiological techniques to detect and diagnose infectious agents.

Infectious etiology
Infectious etiology is a non-toxic, non-susceptible, non-invasive, non-quantitative, non-invasive, non-intracellular, non-hematopoietic, non-tuberculous, non-transplant, non-transplant, non-transplantating, non-invasive, non-fungal, non-transplant, non-transplantating, non-transplantating, non-transplantating, and non-transplantating infection (Brown et al., 2009).

Infectious etiology
The infection can be easily treated with antibiotics and topical antibiotic treatment is recommended (Brown et al., 2009). The first step in the treatment is to perform a clinical examination of the patient in the ER.
