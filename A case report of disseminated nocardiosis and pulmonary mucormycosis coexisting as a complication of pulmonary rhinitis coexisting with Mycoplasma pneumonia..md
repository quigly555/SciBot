## Abstract
The bacilli are a group of highly virulent eukaryotes and, as such, represent a potential source of vaccine candidates with protective effects. This vaccine would be effective in preventing and treating diseases caused by the fungi Sporothrix brasiliensis and Mucorales, as well as by Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, with a reduced-tuberculosis chance. To understand the mechanisms underlying these differences, we compared the transcriptional profiles of clinical, sero-, inactivated and inactivated mice against either S. brasiliensis/Mucor circinelloides or C. albicans/Aspergillus nidulans.


## Introduction
The recent discovery of increasingly diverse marine sponges that contain membrane-bound peptides (PBLPs) [1], [2], [3] is fueling the search for new natural products with antimicrobial activity. The PBLPs are produced in marine sponges and are used for the development of bioactive agents. In particular, marine sponges have been exploited as a source of antifungal drugs, including polymyxins, viroids, diclofenac sodium (EDN), and the antimycotic cationic AMP (cAg) [4], [5]. The cAgs are produced from the breakdown of PBLPs, which are converted to sponges by the action of two types of enzymes: the endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanases (EC3.1.1.8) and the endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanases (EC3.1.3.5). The enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes are the most common endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanase and are responsible for the conversion of the PBLPs to aminocytic form by ß-glucanases. The enzyme glycosylhydrolase (HBD) enzymes are also the most common endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanase and are responsible for the conversion of the PBLPs to aminocytic forms [6]. Although the phylum of sponges contains a large number of natural products, the majority of them have been obtained from marine sponges [7], [8]. Marine sponges contain a wide variety of bioactive natural products and are of great interest as drug delivery systems [9]. The endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanases (EC3.1.3.4) and EGH enzymes are the most abundant enzymes in the sponges, and they are classified as promising endo-ß-1,3-d-glucanases (EC3.1.3.7) [10]. These enzymes are the first to be discovered in sponges, and the utilization of these natural products is a hot topic [11].


## Methods
A broad search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct from 1996 to 2016. We included relevant articles from the literature and abstracts of numerous journals. We also reviewed the English literature. We consulted several English language sources for the references, including the articles on infectious diseases in Africa. The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. We also searched the following databases: PubMed, PubMed Central, and Science Direct. We then searched the full text of each language to identify articles that reported on the different infections and different bacterial strains. We found the references to each of these databases. We also retrieved their abstracts for the following searches: AIDS, Antimicrobial Resistance, and Mycosis. Finally, we searched the published literature and abstracts of this review for the references in all of these databases. We also downloaded the following databases: PubMed, PubMed Central, and Science Direct.


## Results
Fluconazole was most commonly used for the first three days of treatment (9.1%), followed by flucytosine for 5 days (58.5%) and empiric azole for 4 days (50.5%). MIC_50 values were lowest for fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml and for empiric azole at 0.5 µg/ml for both the clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus (Table 3).

The most common resistance to fluconazole was for the MIC_50 values of azole at 0.5 µg/ml (28.4%), followed by fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml (24.4%) and empiric azole at 0.5 µg/ml (23.3%) for the clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus. A MIC_50 of 0.5 µg/ml was achieved by 100% in the case of fluconazole treated patients (Table 3). The most common resistance to fluconazole was for the MIC_50 values of fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml (28.4%), followed by fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml (23.3%) and empiric azole at 0.5 µg/ml (23.3%) for the clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus. The MIC_50 values of fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml were achieved by 100% in the case of fluconazole treated patients (Table 3).

The MIC_50 of fluconazole was lowest in the case of fluconazole treated patients (Table 3). The MIC_50 values of fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml were lowest in the case of fluconazole treated patients (Table 3).

The MIC_50 values of empiric azole at 0.5 µg/ml were lowest in the case of empiric azole treated patients (Table 3). The MIC_50 values of fluconazole at 0.5 µg/ml were lowest in the case of empiric azole treated patients (Table 3).


## Discussion
Aetiological roles of Xyloglobulins in Cryptococcus
Xyloglobulins play an important role in the pathogenesis of fungal infections. They are produced by multiple types of fungal pathogenic mechanisms, including, among others, glycosylation of a-amylases, and de novo synthesis of proteins with glycosylation, such as those that constitute the bifurcation endonuclease (BAF) and the superfamily of glycosidases [21].
