## Abstract
In this study, we focused on the structure and function of a cationic poly(A)-rich mycelium that produced the active ß-D-glucan capsule of Bacillus anthracis. The polysaccharide capsule was insoluble, and the capsular structures were consistent with that of a typical chitosan capsule. Microscopy of the polysaccharide in the polysaccharide fraction was evaluated in biotransformation and in crystallography assays. The ß-D-glucan was insoluble and insoluble-digestible. The structure of the capsule was similar to other polysaccharides, and all the capsular structures had a similar crystal structure. Structural and biochemical characteristics were consistent with that of chitosan, and the ß-D-glucan was insoluble and insoluble-digestible, suggesting that it contains a polymer of 2-FOOD, including chitosan.


## Introduction
2017. However, several species of these fungi are known as pathogenic yeasts, such as the so-called “black yeasts” or “black yeasts” (Liu et al. 2017), the causal agent of black yeasts infections in humans and animals (Ahmad et al. 2007; Silva et al. 2016).

The genus of the black yeasts, known as “black yeasts”, was first introduced by von Recklinghausen (1921) as a genus of lichenicolous fungi and has since been described from a variety of substrates, including soil, dead wood, dead branches, and plant material (Couch et al. 2015). The genus is currently divided in three subgenera, i.e., Mycorrhiza (Ribeiro et al. 2013), Vainioin and Clitortoin (Couch et al. 2015), Phanerochaete (Chou et al. 2016), and Pseudomyrmexysillysillys (Couch et al. 2015). The genus is also divided in three different subgenus, namely Phaenia (Pauly & Wingfield 2017) and Phaeodactylum (Couch et al. 2015). Phaeodactylum is comprised of white-rot fungi, which cause considerable economic losses in the timber and paper industries (Vincent et al. 2016). The genus Phaeodactylum includes at least 80 species, of which Phaeodactylum melanogaster (L.) is the most economically important (Couch et al. 2015). The genus Phaeodactylum is divided in three subgenera, namely Phaeodactylum uroculesulare (Vainio et al. 2010) and Phaeodactylum phaeodactylum (Vainio et al. 2012). Phaeodactylum melanogaster is mostly associated with hardwoods (Sutton 1975) and therefore one can ask whether the genus Phaeodactylum is actually a taxonomic synapomorph. However, there is no published information on the phylogenetic relationships between Phaeodactylum and other fungi (Couch et al. 2015).


## Methods
The mycelial fragments of a plant pathogen were separated and transferred to screw-cap tube. The samples were incubated in a plastic tube for one week, and the tubes were then inoculated with 1 mL of sterile, deionized water. The tubes were incubated in a moist chamber at 37°C for 2-3 days, and the fungal colony was observed and counted.

A total of 47 species of the Basidiomycete fungi were examined in the genus, the species, and the genus, respectively. The fungi were observed in the range of six species of the genera and were named Basidiomyceteaceae. These fungi were selected because they are the closest relatives of the Basidiomycete fungi in our department.

A total of 16,879 pathogenic fungal isolates were obtained from clinical samples. The fungal isolates were also included in this study due to their heterogeneous morphotypes and their genome size. The fungal species were identified based on their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences. The genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated fungi were cultured in liquid Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) (dH_2O) at 28°C for 24 h. The supernatant was used to extract DNA using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Microscopy
For microscopic examination, samples were fixed in 1.5% buffered formalin, washed with 1.5% buffered formalin, washed again with 1.5% buffered formalin, and mounted in 1.5% buffered formalin. The samples were then fixed with a 0.45% KOH solution for 1 h, followed by a gentle rotation with a rubber filter (0.45 µm).


## Results
In order to identify the putative cytochrome b5 oxidoreductases in plant pathogens, we used three independent approaches: (i) a . elegans genome sequence was subjected to the Ingenuity of the Genome project [25], (ii) the plant fungal genome was subjected to the Biotyper project [26], and (iii) the plant plant fungal genome was subjected to the Mateshark program [27]. The results of the Ingenuity of the Genome project were compared to those of the Mateshark program. The results of the Ingenuity of the Genome project are shown in Figure 2.

The analysis of the results obtained from the three independent C. elegans and C. parapsilosis genes revealed the presence of more than 40 CYP gene sequences, with the highest number being C_003380. The analysis of the in-silico analysis revealed the presence of only two CYP genes. The CYP gene CYP3 in C. elegans had 100% sequence identity with a C. albicans CYP3 gene from Cryptococcus neoformans. The CYP gene CYP2 in C. parapsilosis had 100% sequence identity with a C. albicans CYP2 gene from C. parapsilosis.

The presence of CYP2 was confirmed using comparative genomics and protein sequencing. The number of CYP gene sequences in the C. elegans and C. parapsilosis were found to be similar (Figure 2). In addition, the CYP2 gene in C. parapsilosis was found to be the most similar CYP gene in the plant pathogenic fungus C. elegans. The number of CYP2 gene sequences in C. elegans was found to be higher than that in C. parapsilosis (Figure 2).

Cytochrome b5 is a major, multi-copy cytochrome P450
In order to evaluate the importance of CYP2 in pathogenicity, we investigated the gene expression level of CYP2 in the pathogenicity of two P. brasiliensis strains (Table 1). The expression levels of CYP2 in the pathogenicity strains were determined to be 0.54-0.81 and 0.


## Discussion
This family comprises members of a family of proteins related to iron acquisition and metabolis. This family was also found in the genomes of most of the genera. However, it was not found in the present study. Glycoside hydrolases have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of fungi and the pathogenicity of some pathogenic species (Osherovich et al., 2008). These enzymes include hydrolases of the sterol-binding proteins (SBL1) and sterol-capping proteins (SCL1). Other enzymes were found in this study, as they are found in fungi. Glycoside hydrolases were detected in all of the analyzed fungal genomes, suggesting a higher diversity of glycoside hydrolases in fungi than in bacteria. It is not possible to find other glycoside hydrolases in fungi.

The only one of the glycoside hydrolases identified in this study was identified in the Fusarium species (P. wickerhamii) in the present study. In S. pombe, the glycoside hydrolase family 17 (GHL18) is also present in this study. This family is characterized by the ability to degrade pyrrolidine and pyrroline. It is an extracellular protein containing a hydrophobic pocket. Glycoside hydrolase family 22 (GHL23) is the only protein identified in this study. This family was present in most of the analyzed fungal genomes. This family is characterized by a hydrolase-like protein domain and is characterized by an intramolecular signal peptide domain. Glycoside hydrolases have been found in the genomes of many fungal species, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium digitatum, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus (Osherovich et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014).

The proteome of each fungal species was analyzed and the proteome of each fungus was analyzed using BLAST (20S) for each protein. Figure 6A shows the proteome of each fungus analyzed in the present study. It was not possible to obtain all the fungal species in this study.
