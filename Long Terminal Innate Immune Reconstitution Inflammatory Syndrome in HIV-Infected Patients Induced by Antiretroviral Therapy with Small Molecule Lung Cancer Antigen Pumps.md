## Abstract
TTI-LP (TIP-LA) is a new computer-assisted RAD-induced laser anatomoporation (LAA) that enables direct visualization of lung cancer cells in real tim. This powerful technology is especially useful for lung cancer patients with advanced stages of lung cancer and for studies in mice, which are prone to developing IRIS as their immune systems adjust to new signals of different types of lung cancer. TTI-LP is specific to Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and numerous other opportunistic fungal pathogens, making it a valuable tool for studies in the early phase of lung cancer. This study aims to present the TTI-LP technology in more detail about the lung cancer invasive features and the treatment strategy when lung cancer is detected in patients with advanced stage of lung cancer.

TIP-LA was created from the use of TTI-LP to measure and visualize the pathogenesis of the different types of lung cancer in an animal model. The aim of the study is to compare TTI-LP with radiotherapy and to present the results of the tests performed and the differences between them.

The purpose of the study is to compare TTI-LP with radiotherapy and to present the results of the tests performed and the differences between them. Final results will be published in the October issue of PNAS.

The use of TTI-LP in the treatment of human lung cancer needs further verification. It has been demonstrated in the literature that the imaging results are more favourable in comparison to TTI-LP with radiotherapy. The aim of the study is to compare the imaging results of patients with advanced stage lung cancer in order to find out the most suitable treatment option for these patients.

Two open clinical trials were conducted among patients with advanced-stage lung cancer undergoing LFTC-CTI. The primary objectives were to compare TTI-LP with radiotherapy and to determine the most suitable treatment option for these patients. Secondary objectives were to assess the imaging findings of TTI-LP in the setting of advanced-stage lung cancer in addition to evaluating the imaging results of TTI-LP in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer.


## Introduction
Mango (Mangifera indica Linn.) is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant from Mangifera subirtuos (Amazonaceae). The plant is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. It is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as tonic, astringent, and to alleviate malaria, diarrhea, fever, asthma, pain, and gastrointestinal distress [1].


## Methods
The qPCR primers are shown in Table . The qPCR protocol was performed using the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The initial denaturation step was performed in the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The relative quantification of DNA damage was calculated as the ratio of the internal control and the endogenous control.

In order to evaluate the effects of cell culture and treatment on the relative mRNA levels, the qPCR protocol was performed using the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The initial denaturation step was performed in the following conditions: 94°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The relative quantification of mRNA levels was calculated as the ratio of the internal control and the endogenous control.

Antiretroviral Therapy with Small Molecule Lung Cancer Antigen Pumps
The studies were conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (M.S.F.). The animals were maintained under standardized conditions, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of the West of France (protocol # 269/2012).

Animals
The animals were maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment, and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of the West of France and were performed according to the guidelines of the French National Council for Laboratory Animal Care (2012/6/2012).

Fungus
The experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines of the Committee on the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (2008/8/2012).


## Results
. Impact of Late-Delay Treatment on the Production of Pro-Inflammatory Enzymes
Inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by C. albicans is associated with an increase in the production of mononuclear cells and neutrophils (Jung et al., 1996; Park et al., 1998; Stoll et al., 1998; Colletotrichum et al., 2000; Singh et al., 2002). Therefore, we examined the effect of late-disease treatment on the production of cytokines by C. albicans. The ability of C. albicans to produce and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated. As shown in Figure 1, the production of cytokines by C. albicans was decreased in late-disease treatment compared to control (p < 0.05). The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also increased in the presence of late-disease treatment (Figure 1).

## Discussion
The main mechanisms of HIV-Infected patients’ immune responses are epithelial-mediated immune cell-mediated immunity (Hic)1/Hic lymphopenia and the host immune response to disseminated infection (Hic)1/Hic lymphoproliferative disorder (HIV) [7. Hic cells are typically present in the lower respiratory tract and colonic mucosa, but they also occur in the upper airway and lymphoid tissue, where they are also present in the lungs. Patients with HIV infection may present with Hic lymphoproliferative disorder, which has been described in two HIV-infected patients [7]. In addition, patients with HICL may present with systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIR) and liver dysfunction [7]. The present study found that immunocompetent patients had significantly higher levels of HICL compared to immunocompetent patients.

Hic cells play an important role in the immune response to infectious diseases [7]. In the present study, Hic cells were significantly more abundant in the lung tissue of HIV-infected patients compared to immunocompetent patients. This was similar to other studies showing that Hic cells play a significant role in the immune response to pulmonary infection [7, 12]. Hic cells play an important role in the immune response to tuberculosis, and the present study showed that patients with HICL had significantly higher levels of HICL compared to immunocompetent patients.

The present study also found that Hic cells were significantly more abundant in the pulmonary tissue of HIV-infected patients compared to immunocompetent patients. This was similar to studies showing that Hic cells play an important role in the immune response to pulmonary infection [7].

Hic cells are a large class of cells in the lung, and they are also present in the brain and other organs of HIV-infected patients [7]. Hic cells are also present in the brain, and they are also present in the blood [7].
