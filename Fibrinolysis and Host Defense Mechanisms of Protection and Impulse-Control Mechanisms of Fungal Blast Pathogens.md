## Abstract
Several studies have focused on the immune response to fungal infections. Here, we investigate how the immune system responds to S1 pneumoniae infection, a fungal pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised patients, and we use these immune responses to relate the response to fungal pathology. We found that immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency significantly increased the frequency of sputum myelitis and decreased the percentage of fungi in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency did not affect the frequency of sputum myelitis but it did increase the frequencies of both myelitis and sputum granulomatous lesions. We found that the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that responded to S1 pneumoniae infection were significantly depleted and significantly depleted both in patients with and without immunoglobulin M deficiency and patients without immunoglobulin M deficiency. These two cells were also less abundant in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in sputum granulomas. Collectively, these data indicate that immunoglobulin M deficiency causes a reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activity and decreased percentage of sputum myelitis and sputum granulomas in immunocompromised patients. These results suggest that, in the absence of immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G increases the frequency of sputum myelitis and sputum granulomas.

Cryptococcus neoformans is an important fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immune compromised individuals. In this study, we found that an IgG deficiency in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals caused markedly decreased fungal burden and reduced fungal burden in the brain in an immunocompromised state. IgG deficiency did not affect the frequency of sputum myelitis and sputum granulomas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in sputum granulomas but it did increase the percentages of both myelitis and sputum myelitis and decreased the percentages of both myelitis and sputum myelitis and decreased the percentages of both myelitis and sputum granulomas in immunocompromised patients. These findings support the hypothesis that the immunological response to S1 pneumoniae infection is mediated by both innate and adaptive immunity.


## Introduction

The mechanism of host defense against fungal pathogens is a complex interplay involving immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, but also cells of the peripheral or deep tissues, e.g., lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and monocytes, which are considered to be key players in the defense of tissues against fungi. ^8-11 Macrophages are one of the major cell types responding to fungal pathogens, and their ability to phagocytose fungal cells is crucial for survival. ^12-14 Neutrophils are among the first cells to respond to fungal infections, and they produce granules that kill the fungus. These granules can be secreted to the extracellular environment, e.g., mucus, and serve as phagolysosomes for killing of the fungus. ^15-17 In addition, macrophages can differentiate between non-classically activated macrophages (M1) and activated macrophages (M2) as the macrophages are used for immune processing. In the M1 macrophage activation, macrophage differentiation involves the recruitment of Th1-type T cells, which differentiate into a type-2 subset, which differentiate into the T helper (Th2) population. The M2 macrophage differentiation involves the recruitment of Th2-type T cells and neutrophils, which differentiate into the Th2/Th1/Th2 subset. This differentiation requires the participation of neutrophil and macrophage killing factors. The macrophage subtype is different from other subsets of the th-1/Th2/Th1 type, which can be differentiated into more than one subset. M2 macrophages are distinguished from the M1 and M2 macrophages by their production of macrophage chemokines. Th-2/Th1/Th2 differentiation can be induced in the presence of macrophage chemokine M1 and M2 macrophages. The M2 macrophage chemokine M2 binds to the intracellular binding pocket of the macrophage and induces the activation of neutrophils and neutrophils from the Th1-type subset. ^16-18 In the context of mycobacterial infections, the role of neutrophil activity in the control of the fungal growth and dissemination is poorly studied.

## Results
Recently, the . albicans FH<U+03B3>R gene was also identified as a target of C. albicans in the murine model of candidiasis [18]. We screened the FH<U+03B3>R gene in the murine model of candidiasis. The FH<U+03B3>R expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the FH<U+03B3>R gene was expressed at high levels in both mouse and human models, and it was expressed in the yeast form (Fig 5). The results indicate that the C. albicans FH<U+03B3>R is not only expressed in the yeast form, but also in the yeast form in C. albicans.

Role of FH<U+03B3>R in Pathogenicity
To elucidate the role of FH<U+03B3>R in pathogenicity, the fungal infection of mice was monitored by the establishment of a lethal infection. The results showed that the mice infected with C. albicans successfully killed all the animals at day 7 after infection (Fig 6).

To further evaluate the role of FH<U+03B3>R in virulence, we examined the virulence of the C. albicans strain H99 in the mouse model. The mice were inoculated with 10^5 CFU of C. albicans H99, the CFU of the yeast form of the fungus was measured, and the fungal burden was determined by day 7 after infection. The results showed that the mice infected with H99 died in a day 3 fashion. After 3 days, the mice were sacrificed and the fungal burden was determined by day 7 after infection. The mice were sacrificed and the CFU of the yeast form of the fungus was measured, and the fungal burden was determined by day 7 after infection. The results showed that the mice infected with H99 died in a day 3 fashion. After 3 days, the mice were sacrificed and the CFU of the yeast form of the fungus was measured, and the fungal burden was determined by day 7 after infection.


## Discussion
The importance of stress in the development of . cinerea is demonstrated by several genetic mechanisms, including the ability of Bc to survive and replicate intracellularly in different environments, its ability to escape from the immune system, and the ability of Bc to colonize various body sites in different host niches [34]. The ability to colonize different body sites and reach different fitness levels in different hosts is an important aspect of host defense mechanisms [34]. The ability of Bc to survive and replicate intracellularly in different host niches is an important aspect of host defense mechanisms [34]. The survival ability of Bc to survive and replicate in different body sites in different host niches can be mainly determined by the ability to survive within the host environment and the ability to colonize various body sites in different host niches. A major difference between the two species is the ability to survive inside the host environment. Although the ability to survive inside the host environment has been reported previously, the ability to survive inside the host environment has been demonstrated to be a key factor in the evolution of virulence of B. cinerea and B. bassiana [35, 36]. In this study, the up-regulation of the genes encoding the enzyme, C-6, encoding the serine-threonine kinase (SLK1) and the calcium-calcineurine (CaCn) biosynthesis pathway in BcC.5 and BcC.6, respectively, suggest that Bc.5 is a better host for B. bassiana than Bc.6. The expression of the genes encoding the enzymes (SLK1, CaCn, and C-6) and the membrane-bound, dephosphorylated (PLC) protein (PLC4) are also increased in Bc.5 and BcC.6, suggesting that Bc.5 and Bc.6 may have a more balanced response to host stress, which is a key factor in the evolution of the pathogenicity of B. cinerea.

Previous studies have shown that Bc.5 is a good host for B. bassiana because of its ability to survive inside the host environment [36].
