## Abstract
The genus Chlorophyta includes yeasts that inhabit the citrus and citrus-derived endophytes. In this paper, we present seven species of the genus Klonopaca, which are of clinical and agricultural interest, due to their geographical distribution and economic importance. The species are distinguished on their host plants, such as apple, pear, and grape, and also such plants as jasmine, cassia, lycophyll, Passau-quercus cinerea, and Syzygium tuberosum. In vitro studies indicated that the compounds isolated from these species have antimicrobial, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and insecticidal activities.


## Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients, and may cause opportunistic infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It is also an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe central nervous system (CNS) involvement [1]. In the 1980s, the most common cryptococcal infection was in patients with severe immunodeficiency, and the incidence of other CNS infectious diseases has increased in recent years. In fact, a substantial proportion of AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis (CAMs) are now coinfected with these pathogens [2].

However, although there is a clear association between cryptococcal infections and neurological disorders, their association is rarely investigated. Recent studies have reported that cryptococcal infections are associated with high morbidity, low mortality, and even late mortality [3,4]. The majority of studies were conducted on patients with various degrees of immunosuppression, such as those with cancer or organ transplantation, and less than 50% of the cases were reported in the HIV-negative population [5].


## Methods
The water bath is a water treatment device for the treatment of the hydrolytic activity of a particular microorganism, and the treatment is controlled by the application of a pressure in a controlled fashio. As a control, the water bath is set at an angle to the vessel, and is used to control the relative humidity. In the hypoxic chamber, the same procedure was used to treat the same number of fungi for 3 days, as described above.

Molecular analysis of fungi associated with osmotic stress in the submerged vessel
Fungi present in the water bath were identified by morphological and molecular methods. A replica cell of the fungal cell wall was prepared from the culture media of the bacteria and used for the cell wall analyses, as described in the section ‘Fungal morphology’.

A single colony was selected for the analysis. The colony was then inoculated in water and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. To determine the growth rate of fungi, the colony was incubated in the dark at 37°C for 5 days. The number of cells per µL was counted.

For the osmotic stress assay, fungal strains were grown in the presence or absence of different concentrations of an osmotic stress (fluconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, or voriconazole, which was evaluated by comparing the results of the osmotic stress assay and the water bath experiments. The stock solutions of osmotic stress were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and were subsequently diluted to 100 µL with water. The osmotic stress solution was then poured into a 96-well microtiter plate and treated with the same concentration of an osmotic stress (fluconazole, voriconazole, or voriconazole). The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 3 days, and the number of yeast colonies was counted.

Fungal morphology was observed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Co., Ltd., Japan). A single colony was selected for the analysis. The cells were then observed in the same way, and the results were expressed as optical units (AU) per mm^2, as described in the section ‘Cell wall analysis’.

The cell wall analysis was performed as described in the section ‘Cell wall analysis’.


## Results
Identification of mutants in the miR-223 gene
A deletion mutant of miR-223 was selected for phenotypic characterization of a miR-223 mutant in C. neoformans [16], and we used the miR-223 mutation to develop the miR-223 strain. Since deletion of miR-223 causes a delay in the growth of C. neoformans, we developed a deletion mutant to increase miR-223 expression in C. neoformans. A transposase-like element (TE) with a predicted role in the regulation of gene expression was created by construction of a C. neoformans miR-223 strain (strain H99) as described in the methods section. As shown in Figure 1A, the miR-223 strain was more sensitive to the growth of C. neoformans than H99 and complemented strains. However, the complemented strain was still sensitive to C. neoformans infection (Figure 1B).

Deletion of miR-223 caused a delay in the growth of C. neoformans
We first tested whether deletion of miR-223 affected the growth of C. neoformans. As shown in Figure 1C, the miR-223 strain exhibited a delay in growth, which is not associated with the growth rate of the complemented strain. The growth of the miR-223 strain was similar to that of the wild-type C. neoformans strain, but the complemented strain exhibited more severe growth. The miR-223 strain showed increased sensitivity to B. dermatitidis infection, but not to the growth of the H99 or complemented strains.

A total of 14 isolates of C. neoformans were used in this study (Table 1). The strains were tested for their susceptibility to B.


## Discussion

The design of hypoxia-controlled water for biofilm formation using combination of hypoxia and hypoxia-contaminated water was experimentally performed in three different pH-stressed media (SDS, PYE, and PYE supplemented with .5 mM MgSO_4 and 4.5 mM MgCl_2), where SDS and PYE treated samples exhibited lower biofilm formation activity, but PYE and SDS had the highest activity against biofilms of the three strains (Figure 1 and Table S3).

The biofilm formation by all three strains was inhibited by hypoxia-contaminated water, and biofilm formation was increased by hypoxia-contaminated water (Figure 2). This increase in biofilm formation capacity of each strain was correlated with the concentration of MgSO_4 and the concentration of MgCl_2. This correlation was stronger for MgCl_2 than for MgSO_4. The increased biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was due to the reduction of the water content in the medium and the use of hypoxia as the substrate. The increased biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was also correlated with the use of MgCl_2 as the substrate.

The presence of MgSO_4 in water enhanced biofilm formation. This enhanced biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was due to the presence of MgSO_4 and MgCl_2, which were not present in the medium. The presence of MgSO_4 in water enhanced biofilm formation of MgCl_2 strain. This enhanced biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was also correlated with the use of MgCl_2 as the substrate.

The inhibition of biofilm formation by MgSO_4 and MgCl_2 increased biofilm formation by all three strains. The increased biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was correlated with the use of MgCl_2 as the substrate.

Biofilm formation was also increased by hypoxia-contaminated water, and the increase in biofilm formation capacity of MgCl_2 strain was correlated with the use of MgCl_2 as the substrate.
