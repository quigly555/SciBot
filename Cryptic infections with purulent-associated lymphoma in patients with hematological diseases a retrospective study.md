## Abstract
Diseases caused by fungi and protozoa remain a major concern in the modern era of antischiplagotrophism, and new approaches to these infections are needed. The use of invertebrates such as Scolycetes, Molluscus, and Drosophila has led to the identification of fungi responsible for the majority of protozoan-fungus antagonism. Here we review the current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which protozoa and fungi antagonize each other. Our understanding of these mechanisms is also of interest for, as yet undescribed, host-directed, immune mediated, and non-host directed protozoan stress responses, as well as key advances in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the fungus.

Involvement between protozoa and fungi has led to major evolutionary leaps and losses with the emergence of pathogenic fungi with different degrees of antagonism. Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which protozoa and fungi antagonize each other, with the focus on fungal-fungal interaction mechanisms. We focus on the key fungal stress responses, stress adaptation, and the host directed immune responses that result from protozoan antagonism.


## Introduction
The majority of the worldâ€™s population is under the age of 30, with approximately 10 million people living with HIV. Globally, there are approximately 10 million new HIV infections each year, with approximately 15,000 new cases occurring every year [1]. Around half of all HIV-infected individuals in the world are under the age of 30. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections [2]. In the United States, the highest HIV-associated mortality is in individuals who have had a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm^3, with an estimated 5% of the total CD4 cases being under 30 years old [2,3]. In some areas, such as Brazil, the high HIV-related mortality is attributable to the high-risk population at large, which includes patients with prior HIV-infection, those with advanced HIV disease, and those receiving ART. Although the number of HIV-infected individuals in Brazil is not known, the country is estimated to have approximately 10 million HIV-infected individuals, and the HIV epidemic has resulted in an increase in the number of deaths from HIV infection [4].

In Brazil, there is a complex epidemiological pattern: the country has been in a steady state of HIV/ AIDS, and the situation has been deteriorating in the public health system. However, a very specific form of HIV infection is being encountered in the state of Rio de Janeiro. In the state of Goira, there are numerous HIV-related hospitalizations and deaths due to HIV/ AIDS in the hospital communities, which is due to the fact that the health system there is not providing the individualized care he or she need [5]. This is a major problem because most patients are underprivileged individuals, and these deaths are often due to malignant diseases [5]. This is one of the main reasons for the lack of HIV/AIDS clinics in Goira, and the government is committed to developing health facilities that are more conducive for the practice of care.

Since 2007, the National Health Service of Goira (Goi) has been providing free HIV/AIDS consultation to approximately 50,000 health care workers [6]. This service is a basic service clinic, which is staffed by health workers from the State of Goi. The clinic is located at the municipal hospital and is free to the patients.


## Methods
All study participants were male.


## Results
Determining the molecular mechanism for the cdc42 null mutant phenotype
Previous studies of C. neoformans and C. albicans have shown that the cdc42 mutant strain of C. neoformans carries a constitutively expressed intronless, GFP-labeled protein (Chilis et al., 2015). To identify the molecular mechanism by which the C. neoformans cdc42 mutant phenotype is caused, we screened for the presence of intronless GFP-labeled proteins in C. neoformans and C. albicans. We identified a set of 8 genes in the C. neoformans genome, which are constitutively expressed in the presence of a GFP-labeled intronless protein (Fig 1A). We predicted that these genes would carry a GFP-labeled intronless protein (Fig 1B). Our screen identified a C. neoformans gene, GFP-labeled intronless GFP-labeled intronless protein (GFP-I) as a candidate gene for intronless GFP-labeled intronless proteins. Our screen also identified a C. albicans gene, Cdc42, which was selected to carry an intronless intronless GFP-labeled intronless protein (Fig 1C).


## Discussion

Lymphoma is the leading cause of immunosuppression in patients with hematological diseases [20. Lymphoma was one of the top causes of renal and hematological malignancies in renal transplant patients [21]. Lymphoma was the fourth leading cause of renal transplant in patients with hematological diseases [21].

The following patients with disseminated fungal infection (Fusarium, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma) were included in this study:

All fungi were found in this study. Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma species were the most common fungi isolated from CSF samples of patients with hematological malignancies in this study. The most common fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study were Aspergillus and Blastomyces species. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study. Cryptococcus gattii was the most common species isolated from CSF samples of patients with hematological malignancies in this study.

According to the research by Sanju et al., the most common fungal organisms isolated from CSF samples of patients with hematological malignancies were Aspergillus and Blastomyces species. The most common fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study were Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Blastomyces species. The fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study were Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Blastomyces species.

The most common fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with hematological malignancies were Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida, and Blastomyces species. The most common fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study were Aspergillus and Blastomyces species. The most common fungal species isolated from CSF samples of patients with disseminated fungal infection in this study were Aspergillus and Cryptococcus neoformans.
