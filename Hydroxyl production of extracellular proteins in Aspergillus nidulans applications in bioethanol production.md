## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is an uncommon disease that predominantly affects immunocompromised patients. The immunocompetent host may reactivate the underlying condition, leading to an increased risk of disease and death. The immunocompromised host may exhibit decreased production of anti-fungal factors as well as other pathogenic microorganisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of acyclovir, a synthetic antifungal medicine, on pulmonary cryptococcosis clinical isolates.

Plant extracts were assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal pathogen.

Acyclovir-treated plant extracts exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against C. neoformans. Acyclovir was well-tolerated and safe. Use of plant extracts with a curative effect against C. neoformans was associated with decreased fungal burden.

Acyclovir, a plant-derived drug, may be an effective treatment for pulmonary cryptococcosis in immunocompromised hosts. Further studies of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacokinetics are needed to fully define the effects of acyclovir on pulmonary cryptococcosis.


## Introduction
. Corner, pers. Comm. Comm.) and transport (E.C. Corner, pers. Comm.) as a dye bleaching agent (E.C. Corner, pers. Comm.) (Cui et al., 2011). The major constituents of extracellular protein secretion in A. nidulans, including chitin, chitosan, ß-glucans, galactomannan, and chitosan, are produced by secretory pathways (Cui et al., 2011). Chitin is the major component of fungal secretory systems (Vu et al., 2010), but its synthesis is restricted by specific enzymes, such as chitin synthase (Chs) and chitinase-like proteins (Chl), which are synthesized in secretory pathways (Cui et al., 2011). The secretory proteins are usually encoded by the proteins encoded by the secretory proteins, which are produced from the secretion proteins (Vu et al., 2010). The secretory proteins are mainly composed of a subgroup of proteins with unique sequence identity, that are also found in secretory proteins (Chm1, Chm2, Chm3, Chm4, Chm5, Chm6, Chm7, Chm8, and Chm9) (Cui et al., 2011). Chs are not present in the secretory proteins, but they are found in the secretory proteins secreted by the secretory proteins (Cui et al., 2011). Chs are important to the fungal cell defense, such as chitinase (Chs2, Chs3, Chs4, Chs5, Chm1, Chm2, Chm3, Chm4, Chm5, and Chm9), which are encoded by secretory proteins (Chm1, Chm2, Chm3, Chm4, Chm5, Chm6, Chm7, Chm8, and Chm9) (Cui et al., 2011). Chs are important to the activity of the chitin synthase (Chs1, Chs2, Chs3, Chs4, Chs5, Chm1, Chm2, Chm3, Chm5, Chm6, Chm7, Chm8, and Chm9) (Cui et al.

## Results

In order to provide a more in-depth view of the comparative activities of extracellular extracellular proteins and their extracellular polysaccharides, the extracellular extracellular polysaccharides were selected by fluorescence microscop. For the screening of extracellular extracellular polysaccharides, the extracellular extracellular polysaccharides were analyzed for their extracellular polysaccharide contents (Fig 3). The extracellular polysaccharide contents of both aspergilli and the human genome were analyzed for their extracellular extracellular polysaccharides using PAMM (Proteasome Metabolism Metabolism Mapping System, 2012) and the results are shown in Table 1. Aspergillus and the human genome were used to analyze the extracellular extracellular polysaccharide contents of extracellular extracellular polysaccharide. Aspergilli were used to test the extracellular extracellular polysaccharide levels in the aspergilli. As shown in Fig 4, the aspergilli had significantly higher extracellular polysaccharide contents than the human genome, which was more than the average extracellular polysaccharide contents of the two strains. In the aspergilli, the extracellular polysaccharide content of the aspergilli was significantly higher than the average extracellular polysaccharide contents. In the aspergilli, the extracellular polysaccharide contents of the aspergilli were significantly lower than the average extracellular polysaccharide contents. In addition, the extracellular polysaccharide content in the aspergilli was significantly lower than the average extracellular polysaccharide contents. The extracellular polysaccharide content of the aspergilli was significantly lower than the average extracellular polysaccharide content.

The extracellular extracellular polysaccharide contents in the aspergilli were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as shown in Fig 5. The extracellular polysaccharide contents of both aspergilli and the human genome were significantly higher than the average extracellular polysaccharide contents of both strains.


## Discussion
Our previous results showed that both of these enzymatic activities are produced in the presence of the extracellular lysozyme 1 (xylosidase 1. The presence of extracellular lysozyme 1 in the growth media (flasks) is known to induce the production of extracellular lysozymes, especially the three-dimensional lysozyme structure [33, 34]. The extracellular lysozyme 1 (xylosidase 1) also produces extracellular lysozymes in the presence of the extracellular lysozyme 1 (extracellular lysozyme 1) [32, 35].

Sugar fermentation
C. albicans utilizes two types of glycosyltransferases to produce lipid bilayers. In C. albicans, the glycosyltransferase A and B are induced in response to the cell wall hydrolases that are involved in maintaining cell wall integrity [36]. In S. cerevisiae, the glycosyltransferase A is activated by the ß-oxidation of glycolysis-derived glycoside bonds. The glycosyltransferase C is activated by the pyrrolyl transferase A (pyrrolyltransferase A) [37]. In C. neoformans, the glycosyltransferase A (GATase A) and the glycosyltransferase B (GATB) are induced by the ß-oxidation of glycoside bonds in the extracellular matrix and subsequently the addition of glycoside bonds to the glycosyltransferase A [38]. In C. neoformans, the glycosyltransferase A and the glycosyltransferase B are induced by the addition of glycoside bonds to the glycosyltransferase B [38]. The latter enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylated sugars.

The glycosyltransferase C (GATB) and the glycosyltransferase B (GATB) are activated by the addition of glycoside bonds to the glycosyltransferase A and B and the addition of glycoside bonds to the glycosyltransferase C [39]. In C.
