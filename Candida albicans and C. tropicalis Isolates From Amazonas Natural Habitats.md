## Abstract
The contribution of necrotrophs to the host immune response to a wide range of infections is now well documented. The interaction of fungi and macrophages has also been shown to play a role in the response to the most common invasive fungal pathogens. Macrophages are immune cells that are polarized towards a type of complement that includes Th1-like cytokines and cytokines of the interleukin-1 family. Th1-like cytokines are components of the well-studied T helper 1 cytokine system and play a number of important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. However, the role of these components in the response to viral infections and the response to other microbial pathogens is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of these macrophage cytokines in the response to the highly virulent pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, a frequent cause of life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. Using a mass spectrometry-based immunization strategy that included the use of mouse cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), we found that the macrophage and Cryptococcus capsule cyclins had different effects on the cell's response to infection with this environmental strain of C. neoformans. Interestingly, the capsule of C. neoformans also induced a strong increase in the number of phosphodiesterases (PdSeq) in the fungus compared to the wild type. These findings are consistent with CrAg screening Cryptococcus for potential cross-protection from the cross-reactivity test. Interestingly, the cryptococcal capsule also induced an increase in the expression of MHC class II and III in the fungus compared to the wild type. Collectively, these data clearly establish that CrAg screening cryptococcal for cross-protective effects and reveal that this molecule also acts as a cross-protection molecule. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which a macrophage protects itself from infection with this eukaryotic pathogen.


## Introduction
The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased significantly over the past two decades due to the widespread use of immunosuppressive regimens of chemotherapy, which resulted in an increase in the number of patients who had underlying diseases that were more severe and more difficult to treat.1,2 Nowadays, invasive fungal infections are increasingly identified as causes of morbidity and mortality.3 In fact, up to 70% of all Candida infections are caused by Candida albicans, which is a common human commensal organism, and can cause asymptomatic or chronic disease in a healthy individual. In some cases, candidemia may be a risk factor for systemic candidiasis, while other risk factors may predispose to these infections.

C. albicans is a commensal organism of the gut lining the mouth and the distal genital tract. Its ability to grow at 37Â°C and to survive in the presence of this host environment are crucial for its virulence. The clinical manifestations of candidiasis are diverse, with a predominance of mucosal lesions, with other mucosal manifestations being associated with gastrointestinal and systemic candidiasis.


## Methods
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method.


## Results
(41 isolates, 4.7%) were C. albicans (44 isolates, 24.1%) and C. glabrata (37 isolates, 14.6%). The isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the most abundant species in all environments tested, and the largest number of isolates of C. glabrata were detected in the Amazonas. The diversity of Cryptococcus spp. isolates was highest in the Amazonas (45 isolates, 26.6%) followed by C. glabrata (30 isolates, 16.3%) and C. tropicalis (21 isolates, 13.6%). The number of C. glabrata isolates from the Amazonas was high (12 isolates, 26.6%) followed by C. albicans (9 isolates, 22.1%) and C. tropicalis (8 isolates, 20.5%). The diversity of C. albicans isolates from the Amazonas was highest (48 isolates, 24.1%) followed by C. glabrata (24 isolates, 15.5%) and C. tropicalis (12 isolates, 16.3%). The diversity of C. glabrata isolates from the Amazonas was highest (14 isolates, 12.3%) followed by C. glabrata (5 isolates, 4.3%) and C. tropicalis (3 isolates, 2.6%). The diversity of C. glabrata isolates from the Amazonas was highest (14 isolates, 11.8%) followed by C. glabrata (4 isolates, 5.3%) and C. tropicalis (2 isolates, 1.8%).

C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are not monophyletic species
To determine the relationship between the species of the C. glabrata and C. tropicalis clades, the diversity of the isolates from each clade and the phylogenetic species of the C. glabrata and C. tropicalis clades was calculated using a Bayesian analysis (Supplementary Fig S5). The diversity of the C.


## Discussion
In addition, . albicans and C. tropicalis Isolates From Amazonas Natural Habitats Are Highly Conserved For Species Recognition [25]. These C. tropicalis Isolates are more abundant in mangrove sediments than in mangrove soil [26].

During cultivation, mangrove sediment was detected in the 15.6% fraction of mangrove sediment. According to our results, the C. albicans and C. tropicalis Isolates from mangrove sediment are from higher sediment. This is in contrast to C. albicans and C. tropicalis Isolates from sediments from Atlantic Rainier in Mexico [27]. The occurrence of C. albicans and C. tropicalis Isolates from mangrove sediment is lower than in the soil of the Amazonas. The two species are associated with different species of fungal communities in the soil of the Amazonas. This is in contrast to the high diversity of fungal communities found in the soil of the Amazonas.

A recent study indicated that C. tropicalis and C. albicans are the two main species of fungi that have been detected from the water of the Amazonas in the present study [28]. However, C. tropicalis and C. albicans were not detected in this study. However, C. albicans was found in all the samples and was the predominant species. This was in contrast to the study of M. hirsuta from the Brazilian Amazon [29]. In this study, C. albicans was the most abundant species. This is in contrast to the study of C. tropicalis and C. albicans from the Amazon [30]. The species of C. albicans were also found in all the samples. The study of C. albicans indicated that it is the most dominant species in this region.

In addition to the isolation of C. albicans from the mangrove sediment, the isolation of C. tropicalis and C. albicans from the soil was also performed. According to our results, the isolation of C. tropicalis was higher than C. albicans from the soil of the mangrove sediment. This was in contrast to the study of C. albicans from the soil of the Amazonas in the Amazonas Natural Habitat [31].
