## Abstract
We evaluated the antitumor and chemotherapeutic potential of a synthetic peptidase from Phellodendron hydratense from South Africa against a range of plant pathogens. The antifungal activity was assessed by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) using the minimal and the minimal in vitro toxicity assays. The cytotoxicity of the synthetic peptidase enzyme was evaluated by the non-cytotoxic non-toxin assay. The antifungal activity was assessed by the non-toxic non-toxin assay, following the toxicity of the enzyme in a human erythrocytic transformation assay. The chemotherapeutic potential of the Phellodendron hydratense synthetic peptidase enzyme was assessed using the non-toxic non-toxin assay.


## Introduction
The fungal kingdom contains over 200 taxa, some of which are important human and animal organisms. Fungi are found in all natural habitats, including soil, air, water, and in living organisms. The majority of fungal species, including Malassezia species, Leishmania species, and Cryptococcus species, are found in freshwater, marine, and freshwater invertebrates (Iridawi and Fries, 2014). However, a few species are pathogens of animals and plants (e.g.


## Methods
The various concentrations of the selected naphthoquinones and phthalates were chosen as standard solutions, and were prepared according to the methodology described by Saeed et a. [11].

Soya oil and phthalate solutions were prepared from the same solution (1.0 g L^-1) and were diluted with the appropriate reagent. The solutions were applied in a 96-well microplate and 100 µL of solution was added into each well. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The biofication product (50 µL) was added to the wells and the plate was then incubated for another 10 min. The biofication product was removed from the well, and the absorbance value (µL^-1) was measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader.

To evaluate the effect of the fungal-F. graminearum complex and the in vitro antimicrobial activity, the standard naphthoquinone and the phthalate solutions were applied as standard solutions. The test was performed with four biological replicates. One sample was taken from each well. The results obtained were expressed as the mean ± SD.

The inhibitory activity of the fungal-F. graminearum complex and the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the phthalate solutions were compared using a two-parameter model with one comparison in which F. graminearum was treated with the drug FIC. FIC was selected based on the following information: (1) FIC: FIC = FIC of the drug (2.0 × 10^-3). (2) FIC: FIC = FIC of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the phthalate solution (2.0 × 10^-3). (3) FIC: FIC = FIC of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the fungal-F. graminearum complex. (4) FIC: FIC = FIC of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the fungal-F. graminearum complex. (5) FIC: FIC = FIC of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the phthalate solution (2.0 × 10^-3).


## Results
The biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenes is known [11. In order to obtain an overview of the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene naphthoquinone compound, the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenes was investigated. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenes was found to be involved in the synthesis of the sesquiterpenoids and phthaloids. To assess the activity of the sesquiterpene naphthoquinone compound, the production of the phthaloids and the phthaloids produced by the sesquiterpene naphthoquinone compound was investigated. The phthaloid production was found to be 1.4-fold higher than that of the sesquiterpenes and it was further found that the production of the sesquiterpenes was 1.2-fold higher than that of the phthaloids and it was further found that the production of the sesquiterpenes was 2-fold higher than that of the phthaloids. The production of the sesquiterpenes was found to be 3.7-fold higher than that of the phthaloids.

2.2. Antimicrobial Activity
The MIC values for the sesquiterpene naphthoquinone and phthaloids were determined against S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. bovis, B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, and C. albicans. The MIC values of the sesquiterpenes against S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and C. albicans were found to be 2-fold, 2-fold, 1-fold, 1-fold, and 1-fold, respectively, higher than those of the phthaloids. The MIC values of the sesquiterpenes against M. tuberculosis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and C. albicans were higher than those of the phthaloids.


## Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the effect of phthalate and propidium-based biofogging on the uptake of sesquiterpenes in the . benthamiana grown on propidium-based biofogging in vitro and in vivo. The results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the presence of propidium-based biofogging resulted in significantly higher concentrations of sesquiterpenes (50.3, 55.3 and 62.4 µg/mL) than those of the control (0.4 µg/mL). The results of the in vivo experiments indicated that the production of sesquiterpenes in N. benthamiana grown on propidium-based biofogging was significantly higher than that of the control (55.3 µg/mL). The results of the in vivo experiments indicated that the use of propidium-based biofogging increased the amounts of sesquiterpenes (43.1, 49.8 and 67.9 µg/mL) than that of the control (0.4 µg/mL). The results of the in vivo experiments indicated that the use of propidium-based biofogging increased the production of sesquiterpenes (54.2, 55.2 and 69.3 µg/mL).

It is known that propidium-based biofogging has the potential to enhance the uptake of other compounds, such as propidium sulphoxide and propidium-sphingosine, as well as increase the yield of the biofogging agent, propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds [25]. Additionally, the use of propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds increases the yield of the biofogging agent, propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds [25]. The application of propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds increases the yield of the biofogging agent, propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds [25]. It has been reported that the use of propidium-based biofogging increases the yield of propidium-to-peptidorin-like compounds [25].
