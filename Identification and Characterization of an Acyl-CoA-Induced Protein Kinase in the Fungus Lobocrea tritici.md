## Abstract
This study was designed to evaluate the activity of the antifungal and antibacterial agents in combination and in pre-set concentrations. Liver and spleen of A. fumigatus were agenapeolar phagocytically stimulated with 1% propionate for 1 min. The compounds were incubated at 37°C for 15 min and then washed with ethanol. Subsequently, the enzymes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature for 2 samples per minute. The results were compared to that of the control. Compound 2 showed the best activity at inhibiting the fungi at 1 h and at antibacterial at 10 min. The best activity was obtained at 5% pretreatment at inhibition rate of 35.1%. The activity of compound 2 was significantly higher than that of control. The results showed that the combination of drugs at the concentrations used did not act by reducing the fungal burden. The combination of compounds 2 and 3 had a synergistic activity against fungi. In conclusion, the combination of 1% propionate with the combination of antibiotics at the concentrations used did not act by decreasing the fungal burden.


## Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat. It is estimated that ~10 million people develop TB annually and ~700,000 deaths are estimated to occur annually (Brown et al., 2012). Although the incidence of TB is decreasing, the global burden is increasing. TB is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide, occurring as a multisystem systemic disease with an estimated incidence of 10,000 cases and 300,000 deaths annually (Kumar et al., 2009; Kandeme and Keller, 2013). In the United States, nearly 40% of TB cases are diagnosed in individuals with active TB, with more than 70% of the TB cases occurring in those with advanced TB (Lombard et al., 2013). In contrast, the overall incidence of TB in China is about the same as in the United States (Park et al., 2009). Although the incidence of TB in China is low compared to the United States, the TB cases caused by non-TB patients are high in China (Park et al., 2009). Despite the high burden of TB cases, the diagnostic tests performed are time-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis. Moreover, the availability of diagnostic tests and strategies is limited in China.

Previous studies have shown that TB can be detected in HIV-positive patients and non-HIV-positive patients from the diagnostic laboratories of Chinese hospitals (Xu et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015).


## Methods
In brief, the fungus was cultivated in liquid YPD (1% peptone, .5% yeast extract, and 2% glucose) medium at 30°C for 18 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation (4000×g for 15 min), washed twice with distilled water, and resuspended in 1 mL of distilled water. The suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer, and the concentration was adjusted to 1×10^6 cells/mL with distilled water. The Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase activity was determined using the method described by Rizet et al. [45].

4.5. Biochemical Characterization of Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase
Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase activity was measured using the method described by Rizet et al. [45]. The preparation of 50 µL of the Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase in 1 mL of YPD medium was done by mixing 10 µL of the reaction mixture with 0.5 mL of 1 M K_2HPO_4. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 20 min, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 520 nm. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the organic layer was removed by filtration. The amount of Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase used in the assay was determined using the method described by Rizet et al. [45].

4.6. In Vitro Susceptibility Assay
The in vitro susceptibility of the Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase to various concentrations of the chitosan, chitosan-inositol, or chitosan-oligonothric acid (CCL) was determined using the in vitro antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility assays of Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase. The method described by Rizet et al. [45] was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Acyl-CoA-Induced Protein Kinase against Gram-negative Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and filament-associated bacteria (ATCC 3966; ATCC 22019; ATCC 40882; ATCC 32069).


## Results
niger BLAST was unable to identify the Acyl-CoA-dependent protein kinase domain of the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Af_002571.1) in the genome sequence of the fungus. In order to confirm the protein kinase activity of the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the fungus, BLASTp analysis was performed using the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus, which were identical except for one gap (Figure 1A). The Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus had the same gaps, indicating that the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus have the same function. BLASTp analysis was performed using the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus. The Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus had the same gaps, indicating that the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus have the same function.

To confirm that the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein is also expressed in the A. niger BLAST, BLASTp analysis was performed using the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus. The Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus had the same gap, indicating that the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein sequence from the fungus and the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein from the fungus have the same function.


## Discussion
This kinase, termed cytochrome b_2A, was localized on the inner surface of the sporodochial sporodochioid (PF1) and fusiform sporodochioid (PF2) cell wall. The kinase was annotated as a putative phospholipase B1 (PF1) with a glycosylation sequence of Cys_B11, and its activity was demonstrated to be active in sporodochia. FungiDB1 (FungiDB1) was then further characterized by the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sequencing. This NMR-based study indicated that the cytochrome b_2A kinase was localized on the sporodochioid sporodochioid and fusiform sporodochioid cell walls, and that the kinase was inactive in sporodochia. These results suggested that the Acyl-CoA-inducible kinase was localized on the sporodochioid sporodochioid cell wall. The kinase was identified as a putative phospholipase C1 (PF1) (Figure 1). This kinase was characterized as inactive in sporodochia, and the kinase was inactive in sporodochia. These results indicated that the Acyl-CoA-inducible kinase was localized on the sporodochioid sporodochioid and fusiform sporodochioid cell walls, and that the kinase was inactive in sporodochia. These results indicated that the Acyl-CoA-inducible kinase was localized on the sporodochioid sporodochioid and fusiform sporodochioid cell walls, and that the kinase was inactive in sporodochia.

The kinase was characterized as a putative phospholipase C2 (PF2) (Figure 1). This kinase was characterized as inactive in sporodochia, and the kinase was inactive in sporodochia.
