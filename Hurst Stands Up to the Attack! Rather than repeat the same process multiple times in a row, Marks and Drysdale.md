## Abstract
Oral candidiasis is a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy and has been suggested to be associated with antifungal resistance. In a mouse model of oral candidiasis, administration of an antifungal peptide, containing the human toll-like receptor (TLR), caspase 1, and TLR-2, together with oral antimicrobial drugs, was shown to protect mice against pulmonary and systemic fungal infections in vivo. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of oral antifungal peptide (hCP) on the natural killer (NK) cell and NK cell subsets in vitro. In vitro growth of fungal isolates was shown to be significantly inhibited by hCP in an Aspergillus fumigatus model. The inhibition of fungal growth was inhibited by the combination of oral antifungal peptide with TLR-2 and NK cell and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in a Galleria mellonella model. HCP alone inhibited the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo inhibition studies were conducted in G. mellonella model. Our results showed that hCP alone inhibited the growth of the fungal isolates tested in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicated that oral antifungal peptide combined with TLR-2 and TLR-2 may be effective in the treatment of oral fungal infection.


## Introduction

The method described here is not ideal because the TUP system is well-described and easy to interpre. The approach presented in this study was not only practical, but also suggested by reference.

The authors should pay attention to the conclusion of the study. A number of important points should be stated clearly to the methods. These points are: (i) they should state correctly which events were preceded by the first attack and/or the first defence. (ii) they should list all the defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences. Moreover, they should list all defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences (paragraph (iii) and Table (iii)). Furthermore, they should list the nature of the defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences (paragraph (iv) and Table (iv)).

3. The method described in this study is not suitable for use by the authors because it requires 3 days of high-resolution melt analysis. The authors should state clearly which defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences. Furthermore, they should list all defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences. They should list all defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences. Moreover, they should list all defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defences (paragraph (v) and Table (vi)).

4. Section 2.1 says that the authors should state which defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific details. The authors should perform the respective descriptions and descriptions for all the defence-specific defence-specific defence-specific details.

## Methods
The In-house FASTQ tool, which is available from the Research and Evaluation Office of the University of Strathclyde (https://ww.unst.edu/fao/fao.htm), is an alternative strategy for following the same strategy for a specific process. It uses a similar format for mark and Drysdale and the program takes a set of character states and mixes them with a list of 25 attributes for the individual process, and then lists each attribute, assigning each attribute in its own unique state. This can be useful for finding the best matching patterns among various parameters. For example, the program mark_1.dds uses the mark_1.dds program to assign the 1st attribute from the state 1 to the state 2 attributes from the process. This can be useful for finding the best matching patterns among different parameter values. In fact, this method can also be used to identify the best matching patterns among a set of conditions. For example, the program mark_1.dds applies the mark_1.dds program to assign the 2nd attribute from the state 2 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameters values. For example, the program mark_2.dds applies the mark_2.dds program to assign the 3rd attribute from the state 3 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameter values. The program mark_1.dds applies the mark_1.dds program to assign the 4th attribute from the state 4 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameter values. The program mark_2.dds applies the mark_2.dds program to assign the 5th attribute from the state 5 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameter values. For example, the program mark_1.dds applies the mark_1.dds program to assign the 6th attribute from the state 6 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameter values. The program mark_2.dds applies the mark_2.dds program to assign the 7th attribute from the state 7 to the state 1 attributes from the process. This can be useful for identifying the best matching patterns among different parameter values. The program mark_2.


## Results
In fact, the pattern may change when the attack time increases to a certain point and it will therefore be the same as befor. A Taxonomy-Like Metatypes With Different Functions (Tables 1 and 2) describe the process of characterizing the Dollocton condensation (Figure 1). The Dollocton condensation appears to be an evolutionary history (Figure 1), as the Dollocton condensation was shown to occur in the last common ancestor of the phyletic eukaryotes, and it has recently been found that it did occur in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, as previously reported [8,9]. The Dollocton condensation appears to have evolved in evolutionarily diverged species. The diversification of the Dollocton condensation in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes was relatively rapid (Figure 1), and it was likely in part due to the fact that the dikaryotic species were able to survive in the environment. In contrast, the diversification of diversification of dikaryotic species has been very slow. This might be a consequence of the fact that the diversification of eukaryotic species has been very slow (Figure 1).

## Discussion
We have generated two orthologs of C. albicans' cyclophilin that are highly similar in their amino acid sequence and that share some features with the human cyclophilin. The first was the presence of the regulatory domain of the cyclophilin, which is present in cyclophilin-1,3,4,5, and cyclophilin-2. The second was the presence of a TCS domain, which is present in cyclophilin-1 and cyclophilin-2. These two orthologs represent a separate protein family, which shares only a single amino acid motif, and is a conserved domain in all of the different proteins in this family. The most striking similarity of these two orthologs is their ability to form a complex with the human cyclophilin. These two proteins, which share the same amino acid motif, form an extended complex with the human cyclophilin.

Our previous studies on the conserved C. albicans cyclophilin from human and animal cells showed that it is expressed at the same time in both species [24]. However, we did not observe differences between the two organisms in the cyclophilin-1 and the cyclophilin-2 structures, and the differences were not statistically significant. We hypothesized that the differences in the cyclophilin-1 and the cyclophilin-2 structures could be a result of differences in the mechanism of cyclophilin-1 and cyclophilin-2, respectively, which could result in differences in the activity of the cyclophilin-1, and the cyclophilin-2 structures.
