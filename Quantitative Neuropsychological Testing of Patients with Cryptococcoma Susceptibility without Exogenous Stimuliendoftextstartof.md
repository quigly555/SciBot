## Abstract
The purpose of this study was to determine whether bile salts, sodium bicarbonate, ethyl acetate, and sucrose were the most effective in controlling Candida biofilm formation and the antimicrobial activity of hygromyalgia joint stiffness and to determine the in vivo effects of these substances in the treatment of C. albicans yeast biofilm infection.

All candidal strains were evaluated in vivo as mediators of C. albicans biofilm infection and in biofilm eradication from mice after intravenous and oral doses of BacT.Bysis or Bactec MG50. Candida albicans was the most sensitive to sodium bicarbonate, Na-acetate, and ethyl acetate. After two weeks, Candida glabrata was the most sensitive in both the sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate groups, followed by C. albicans (both 2 weeks later). The stiffness and the antimicrobial activity of hygromyalgia joint stiffness were the most important parameters when the results of this study were compared to controls.

Our results show that intravenous and oral caspofungin, which is fungicidal against clinical isolates of C. albicans, and oral acapsular Candida were effective in controlling C. albicans biofilm infection in C. glabrata.


## Introduction
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic granulomatous mycosis endemic to Latin America, affecting millions of people, mostly in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela [1]. The disease is caused by the dimorphic fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii, which share a common ancestor about two million years ago [2]. The fungi are classified into two distinct genera, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii, based on morphological characteristics, such as the formation of conidia and asci, and the number of spermatogonia, anaphase formation, and the presence of pseudohyphal cells [3]. The genus Paracoccidioides includes 12 species, of which at least 14 are endemic to Latin America [4]. The most prevalent species, Paracoccidioides venezuelensis, is responsible for the majority of the diseases in the region, while other species, such as P. brasiliensis, P. venezuelensis, P. lutzii, and P. venezuelensis, are reported in several countries [5]. In Brazil, the most prevalent Paracoccidioides spp. species, which are classified as endemic to the area, are classified as: Histoplasmosis, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis [6].

We report the first description of the conidial dimensions and conidia by means of light microscopy and electron microscopy, followed by a description of conidia by inoculation and the nature of the conidium. The characters of conidial dimensions were determined by two independent experimental conditions, namely, the light microscopy and electron microscopy of the microscopy (ZOEM) and the analysis of the yeast parasitic phase (YPS) of conidia [7]. Our results show that the conidial dimensions of Paracoccidioides spp. are more than those of other species of the genus and this number is greater than that of Histoplasma capsulatum, which are described as endemic to Brazil and are described as a new genus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, with new conidial dimensions.


## Methods
Escherichia coli strains used in this study are listed in Table . All strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. Plasmids were cultured overnight at 37°C in LIM (Lipase) medium (0.2% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.01% NaCl) or in LIM broth (Lipase) medium (0.2% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.01% NaCl) with shaking at 200 rpm. The mycelia were collected by filtration and used for RNA extraction. The cells were counted on a Neubauer chamber and seeded into 24-well plates. Three replicates were prepared for each strain. Each strain was incubated at 37°C for 2 days and then 1.5 × 10^6 cells/ml were added. The medium was removed and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. The OD_600 was measured every 10 min for a total of 3 h in a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Yeast growth was monitored by measuring the OD_600 at different time points of incubation, using a BioTek Synergy 2 Multimode Reader. To measure the number of CFU/ml, the percentage of yeast cells with a cell-cell-cell interaction was calculated by subtracting the number of cells with no cell-cell interaction from the total number of yeast cells (OD_600 = OD_600 - OD_600/number of cells in the presence/absence of cell-cell interaction).

For the cell-cell-cell interaction assay, 5 × 10^6 yeast cells/ml were plated on LIM (Lipase) medium (0.2% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.01% NaCl) with shaking at 200 rpm. The culture was incubated for 72 h at 37°C with orbital shaking (200 rpm) at 25°C. The mycelia were harvested by filtration and used for RNA extraction. The cells were counted on a Neubauer chamber and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min at 4°C.


## Results
pneumoniae patients with sulfamethoxazole
In this study, the incidence of . pneumoniae was 28.1% (30/120). As shown in Table 1, the median age was 32 years (range 13-56 years) and the mean white blood cell count was 4,311 (range 181-551). The mean CSF white cell count was 2,869 (range 246-3,190) and the median CSF white cell count was 4,115 (range 219-5,712). The mean CSF protein and serum albumin were 116,756 g/L (range 151-160 g/L) and 100,824 g/L (range 40-172 g/L), respectively. The mean CSF glucose was 1.12 (range 0.28-1.34) mmol/L (range 0.14-1.26), and the mean CSF protein was 0,209 (range 0.04-0,904) protein/mg protein. The mean CSF white cell count was 3,769 (range 0.22-9,322) and the mean CSF protein was 49,845 (range 30-57,827). A second series of K. pneumoniae patients was used to analyze the impact of sulfamethoxazole on the CSF parameters. In this series, the CSF parameters were adjusted to the baseline values, and the patients were divided into two groups: a (n = 23) and a (n = 10) group.

Baseline characteristics of patients with cryptococcal meningitis
The median age of the patients with cryptococcal meningitis was 32 years (range 4-56 years), and the median CSF parameters were 42.6 g/L (range 12.5-104.4 g/L) and CSF glucose was 1.62 mmol/L (range 1.53-3.05 mmol/L) for patients 1 and 2, respectively. The CSF glucose was 1.23 mmol/L (range 1.05-1.49 mmol/L) and CSF protein was 0,106 (range 0.1-1,409) protein/mg protein.


## Discussion
Cryptococcus neoformans was originally discovered as a pathogenic fungus, acquired a genetic code by homologous recombination of genes from different species of the same species, and subsequently acquired a broad range of biological functions through repeated gene duplications of the same genes [26. The key genomic and functional roles of the HapX/Hap43 complex are not well understood. The HapX/Hap43 complex has been found to be a key factor in cell differentiation, proliferation, and differentiation of C. neoformans and C. gattii [7,10,12]. Our group showed that HapX/Hap43 complex plays a key role in differentiation of C. neoformans in C. gattii infection model (Fig 3A). These results were consistent with the hypothesis that C. neoformans HapX/Hap43 complex was essential for the cell differentiation, proliferation, and differentiation of C. gattii and C. neoformans. The presence of three genes encoding proteins that are part of the C. neoformans HapX/Hap43 complex (CnHap43A, CnHap43B) that are closely related to the CnHap43A and CnHap43B proteins of HapX/Hap43 complex (Fig 3B) suggests that the HapX/Hap43 complex is required for the development of C. gattii and C. neoformans. The key roles of these genes are conserved in the genomes of C. neoformans, C. gattii, and C. gattii, respectively (Fig 3B). The HapX/Hap43 complex plays important roles in both pathogenesis and host defense against fungal pathogens.

The C. neoformans HapX/Hap43 complex is involved in the cell differentiation, proliferation, and differentiation of C. gattii and C. neoformans in vitro [7,10,12]. The major roles of the HapX/Hap43 complex in C. gattii and C.
