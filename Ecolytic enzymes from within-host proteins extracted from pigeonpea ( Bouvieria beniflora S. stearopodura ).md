## Abstract
The pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a causative agent of paracoccinosis, the most common systemic mycosis in Latin America. As a result of its interaction with host cells and fungal hyphae, Paracoccidioides spp. is an important virulence factor in human as well as animal infection. Paracoccidioides spp. produces several enzymes that specifically target host cell membranes. One of these is the Paracoccidioides-specific protein Pbr2, which is a member of the Ras family of family 20 proteins. Pbr2 belongs to the superfamily of proteins and their functions are diverse. In this review, we focus on the recognition of Pbr2 and its significance in fungal biology and Pbr2 function is currently being studied by the association of Paracoccidioides spp. with membrane trafficking. We also discuss the relevance of Pbr2 function for the pathogen's pathogenicity and Pbr2 function is linked to virulence. Finally, we highlight the interactions between Paracoccidioides spp. and other pathogenic fungi.


## Introduction

## Methods
The primary metabolites were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on .45% polyacrylamide gel (SDS). The TLC plates were then placed in a water bath for 12 h at 150 °C. After that, the plates were observed under a UV-light lamp at 254 and 365 nm.

The identification of the cell-free proteins was done by comparing the retention times of the precursor peptide and the corresponding fragment. The non-polarized peptides were detected with a molar ratio of 1:2.5 (polar mass ratio [MW]: 1) and 1:1.5 (polar mass ratio [P]: 1).

Preparation of the Kinase Compounds
A mixture of peptone, sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1.5% wt, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 3.5% wt and 1.5% wt (v/v) of the different amino acid fractions was prepared by the method of Guo and Fang (2013) with slight modifications. A drop of the mixture was mixed with a 10 mm PDA mill (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. The clear pelleted water was transferred into a 1.5 ml screw-cap tube and then the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again for 10 min. The crude product was used for the determination of the retention time at 280 nm, using the ratio of 1:2.5 (polar mass ratio [MW]: 1) and 1:1.5 (polar mass ratio [P]: 1). The concentration of the peptone was calculated by using the ratio of the retention time at 280 nm of the sample to that at 280 nm. The purity of the peptone was determined by using the HPLC method.

The insoluble portion of the peptone was precipitated by adding a 1.5% wt stock solution of ethanol to a 1 ml screw-cap tube and then centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. The precipitate was discarded and the supernatant was collected. The precipitate was washed with 50 mM KCl and then washed again with 50 mM KCl. The sample was then dissolved in 40 µl of ethyl ether.


## Results
In addition, the ability of non-invasive strain to produce capsulated, nuclear capsular material was studie. The absence of capsular material was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig 3). Conidia of the non-invasive strain were found to be spherical in shape, with a length of approximately 2 µm, but were very large and rounded at the base. The nucleus of the non-invasive strain was found to be unthickened, with a small, small nucleus surrounded by a large, long, smooth, filiform membrane.

Anti-GXM antibodies were also used to treat the non-invasive strain, and anti-GXM antibodies were also used to treat the non-invasive strain. In addition, anti-GXM antibodies were also used to treat the non-invasive strain, and anti-GXM antibodies were also used to treat the non-invasive strain. Inhibition of growth of the non-invasive strain by GXM is shown in Fig 4.

The serum of the non-invasive strain was further tested for the capacity to produce capsulated, nuclear capsular material. The non-invasive strain grew better than the non-invasive strain in the presence of GXM (Fig 5).

Binding of anti-GXM antibodies with the intact mitochondrial membrane of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans

The in vitro assay of the in vitro binding of anti-GXM antibodies to the mitochondrial membrane of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans is shown in Fig 6. Binding of anti-GXM antibodies to the mitochondrial membrane of the non-invasive strain was detected by TEM. Binding of anti-GXM antibodies to the intact mitochondrial membrane of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans was also detected by TEM, and the supernatant of the supernatant was also analyzed. Binding of anti-GXM antibodies to the intact mitochondrial membrane of the non-invasive strain was detected by TEM, and the supernatant of the supernatant of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans was analyzed. The supernatant of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans was analyzed by TEM. The supernatant of the non-invasive strain of P. destructans was analyzed by TEM. The supernatant of the non-invasive strain of P.


## Discussion

The genus Pseudomonas is a group of highly diverse, Gram-stain-positive, long-lived, human-associated, Gram-stain-positive bacteria [34] that have been isolated from bird droppings, air, water, and plant material [35], and are associated with human infections, and have also been isolated from the gut of bees [36] and mice [37. In addition, a group of pathogenic, Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal species have been isolated from pigeonpea [38], and are also present in human skin [39], nail [40] and oral mucus [41] and mucous membranes [42]. The genus Pseudomonas was first described by Baker et al. [43] and has been consistently associated with the gut and the human oral mucus [44].

The genus Candida is a group of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and mycobacterial, which is mainly found in soil and plant material [45]. In addition, several species are also found in plant tissues and in plant tissues, such as Cladosporium fusca, Cladosporium fulvum, and Candida species [46]. The genus Candida was originally described by Baker et al. [43] and has now been confirmed as a group of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal yeasts [47]. In this study, a new species of Candida was identified, and several species have been isolated from the gut of several birds and humans.

In this study, the genus Acremonium was isolated from human skin and nails, and several species were isolated from human skin and nails, including Cladosporium sp. and Cryptococcus sp. from pigeonpea and pigeonpea samples, and Cladosporium sp. from human skin and nails. However, the genus Acremonium was not previously described in the genus Acremonium, which is known to be associated with human infections and is known to be associated with plant material [48].

The genus Caulofelis was isolated from pigeonpea, skin, and nails, and was mainly associated with pigeonpea and pigeonpea samples.
