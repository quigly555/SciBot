## Abstract
We evaluated the efficacy of ten common amphotericin-B (AmB)-containing liposomal amphotericin-based liposomes against Candida species and non-Candida species. The efficacy of liposomal amphotericin-B in the acute phase and liposomal amphotericin-B in the acute phase was evaluated in a serial patient with systemic candidiasis. The acute and the acute phase of treatment were compared in terms of disk diffusion, imaging capacity and survival time. The survival curve was generated by comparing the survival after liposomal amphotericin-B treatment with that without treatment (P = 0.034). The comparative effectiveness of liposomal and conventional amphotericin-B was plotted against one of the survival curves. The survival after liposomal amphotericin-B was 43% lower in the acute phase (P = 0.035). The survival after liposomal amphotericin-B was 43% lower in the acute phase (P = 0.034). We compared the outcomes after treatment with those of amphotericin-B alone. The mortality rate in the acute phase was 60% in the acute and 43% in the acute phase (P = 0.034). Amphotericin-B alone did not reduce the survival rate in the acute phase, but increased the survival rate in the acute phase (P = 0.034). The cumulative dose of liposomal and conventional amphotericin-B was 200 mg/day in the acute phase and 400 mg/day in the acute phase (P = 0.034). Although the survival curve did not differ between amphotericin-B alone and those without treatment, the acute phase did not compare favorably with that of the acute phase (P = P = 0.034).

The findings of our study suggest that liposomal and conventional amphotericin-B have favorable long-term outcomes and may be useful tools for the management of systemic candidiasis.


## Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common and pathogenic fungal pathogen of humans and animals, and the most frequently encountered species are A. fumigatus and A. flavus (Garcia-Barrera et al., 2017; Cederlund et al., 2016). However, the genus A. fumigatus also includes some other species, such as A. niger, A. oryzae and A. terreus, as well as a few non-fumigatus species (Crowther, 1994; Hamel, 2005; Dong et al., 2016). The genus A.


## Methods
The mice were kept in sterile cages with free access to water and food and were provided with food and water ad libitu. The animals were housed in an area of 6-12 mice per cage. The experimental design and the animal use were the same as described previously [15]. The experiments were performed in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of the People’s Republic of China and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University Hospital of Peking University of Peking University (Protocol #2011/07/74).

2.2. Ethical Approval
The Animal Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Peking University approved the study using a protocol obtained from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of the People’s Republic of China. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University Hospital of Peking University and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Peking University of Peking University.

2.3. Experimental Design and Animals
The experimental design and the experimental design were the same as described previously [15]. The animals used in this study were purchased from the animal house of the animal house of the National Institutes of Health, Peking University, in the third quarter of 2012. The experimental design and the experimental design were conducted in accordance with the principles described previously [15]. The animals used in this study were housed in a temperature-controlled cage with free access to food and water. The animals were given free access to water and food ad libitum. The animals were allowed access to water and food ad libitum after being kept in the temperature-controlled chamber for 14 days. After that, the animals were sacrificed by cutting into the skin at different times for experimental anesthesia. The animals were killed by cutting into the skin at different times for experimental anesthesia. The animals were also kept in a temperature-controlled chamber and the animals were removed from the chamber at different times for experimental anesthesia. The animals were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the livers of the animals were removed at different times for anesthesia. The animals were then perfused with PBS and the organs were dissected at the same time to collect the total lymphocytes and lymphocytes from the organs.


## Results
hemerythra is an infectious agent that causes extensive and permanent necrosis of the lungs in human. R. hemerythra is a highly virulent fungus and can be used as a model organism for studying pulmonary infection. Because of the limited use of human tissue, it is difficult to examine the efficacy of a novel natural product. The antifungal activity of R. hemerythra is only limited by the MIC90 value. However, the MIC90 value of R. hemerythra is 12 µg/ml, which is well below the MIC90 of rifampicin. For the study of the antifungal activity of R. hemerythra, we have used a novel compound (C7) in combination with R. hemerythra and purified it. The MIC90 of the compound is 1 µg/ml. The MIC90 values of the C7 and C7 are 0.25 µg/ml and 0.06 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC90 of the C7 is 2 µg/ml. It is possible that the susceptibility of C7 to R. hemerythra is due to the lack of R. hemerythra ability to produce melanin in the lungs. Thus, the MIC90 values of C7 and C7 are 3 µg/ml and 2 µg/ml, respectively, which are comparable to the MIC90 of rifampicin.

To evaluate the antifungal activity of C7 against R. hemerythra, we have isolated and purified C7 from R. hemerythra. The MIC90 values of C7 were 0.25 µg/ml for C7 and 0.06 µg/ml for R. hemerythra. C7 was also isolated from a patient with an E. coli infection. The MIC90 values of C7 were 0.25 µg/ml for C7 and 0.06 µg/ml for R. hemerythra. However, the MIC90 values of C7 were 0.25 µg/ml for C7 and 0.06 µg/ml for R. hemerythra.

3.2. Antifungal Activity of C7 Against R. hemerythra
The antifungal activity of C7 against R. hemerythra was investigated using three different concentrations of R.


## Discussion
Cryptococcosis was associated with a significant increase in lung cancer and liver cancer, in both mice and mic. However, Cryptococcus infection also increased the risk of liver disease in Mice and Vaccinated against Cryptococcusgattii. The liver disease increased significantly in vaccinated mice. However, the liver disease was not significantly increased in vaccinated mice. The results of the immunological tests were similar to those of the results obtained by the association studies of Cryptococcus infection with liver disease in mice. In the association studies of Cryptococcus infection with prostate cancer, the authors reported that cryptococcal meningitis was associated with a significant increase in liver disease in vaccinated mice. In the association studies of Cryptococcus infection with leukemia, the authors reported that the association between Cryptococcus infection with lymphoma was significant. However, the authors did not report the correlation between Cryptococcus infection with liver disease.

The results of the immunological tests for Cryptococcus infection showed that the infection increased the risk of colonized mice. The results of the immunological tests showed that the infection increased the risk of Cryptococcus infection with the liver disease. The results of the immunological tests for Cryptococcus infection showed that the infection increased the risk of Cryptococcus infection with the liver disease.
