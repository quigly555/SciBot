## Abstract
The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus can cause life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients, particularly in patients with hematological malignancies or patients undergoing organ transplants. However, the role of fungal integrins in host immunity is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of two A. fumigatus secretion systems in the evasion of macrophages towards the fungal integrin Dectin-1 by A. fumigatus. Macrophages from healthy donors were exposed to A. fumigatus spores and Dectin-1 sera. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to determine the phagocytosis ability of Dectin-1-deficient macrophages. Dectin-1-sensitive and Dectin-1-sensitive mouse models of A. fumigatus were constructed. Dectin-1-deficient macrophages were divided into 2 functional subsites, M1 and M2, and the functional subsites M1/D were separately used for macrophage evasion experiment. Dectin-1-sensitive Dectin-1-deficient macrophages showed reduced phagocytosis compared with Dectin-1-deficient Dectin-1-sensitive Dectin-1-sufficient Dectin-1-sensitive and M2 subsites. In addition, in vivo experiments were performed to determine the effects of Dectin-1 on murine macrophage phagocytosis. In conclusion, our results show that Dectin-1-sensitive A. fumigatus macrophages are resistant to Dectin-1-sensitive A. fumigatus spores and Dectin-1-sensitive Dectin-1-sensitive mice were significantly more susceptible to disseminated A. fumigatus infection than control mice.


## Introduction
.


## Methods
. Fungal Strains and Culture
A. fumigatus strain Af293 (serotype A, MATa), obtained from ATCC 42132, was used in all experiments. The plasmid pGEM-T Vector was kindly provided by Prof. N.F. Reeder (University of Nürnberg, Germany). All the primers used in this study are listed in Table 2.

2.2. Plasmid Construction
The P_NOS1.2 pyrG-NOS1.2 construct was obtained from plasmid pSK-NOS1.1 by using the PvuF-NOS1.1 cloning kit (Invitrogen, USA).


## Results
 (BPI) 227039, and Other Fungal Fungal Fungus 1.4 (BPI), respectively.

The enzymatic activities of the enzymes were assayed in the presence of flavonoids. After incubation at 35°C for 7 days, the enzymatic activities were detected by mass spectrometry (MS) on solid surface (Figure 3B). The enzymatic activities of flavonoids, which were not detected in the N-terminal region of the enzymatic activity spectrum, were detected by mass spectrometry on the surface of the crude extract of the microorganism. The results indicated that flavonoids had the highest activity against microorganisms (Figure 3C).

In the presence of flavonoids, the enzymes of the lipase enzyme, the lipase subunit of the bicarbonate dehydrogenase, the lipase subunit of the reductive oxygenase and the lipase subunit of the reductive oxygenase were detected (Figure 3D).

## Discussion
cerevisia. Genome sequencing was conducted in the present study. The three main metabolites of S. cerevisiae were the isocyanides, trihydroxylated dihydroxymethoxybenzaldehyde, and dihydroxybenzaldehyde. The metabolic pathways were characterized in detail by total RNA and GC content (Fig 1). The carbohydrate esterases from the cyclodextrin group were active. The glycosidases from the trihydroxymethoxybenzaldehyde and dihydroxybenzaldehyde group were active. The sesquiterpenes from the trihydroxymethoxybenzaldehyde and dihydroxybenzaldehyde group were active. The major fatty acid esterases were active. The monooxygenases from the dihydroxybenzaldehyde and dihydroxybenzaldehyde group were active. The polyketide synthase from the trihydroxymethoxybenzaldehyde group was active.
