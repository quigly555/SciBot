## Abstract
Infectious diseases are emerging as a significant cause of death in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NRS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different water soluble salts (salt andalkalactone) in the control of NRS and determine their synergistic effects against invasive candidiasis. SALT alone or in combination with alkylating drugs (AlKalate, KAlA, bathophenanthrolactone, EtOAc) or in combination with carbopol (orfistatin or bromo-8-ene) was given to 50 SALT + alkylating drugs (1-5) in a subcutaneous systemic candidiasis clinic. The effects of AlKalate, KAlA, ecto-8-ene on candidiasis were evaluated. The candidiasis was treated by intraperitoneal (IP) and intervallic (OG) injection. AlKalate alone or in combination with carbopol was given to each drug individually once daily for 10 min. The effects of AlKalate, KAlA, ecto-8-ene on candidiasis were evaluated by the checkerboard assay. The synergistic effects of AlKalate, KAlA, OGE and carbopol on the outcome of the study were determined by the checkerboard assay. The interaction of AlKalate, KAlA, OGE and carbopol with Candida species was evaluated using the checkerboard method. The results showed that AlKalate, KAlA, ogen-8-ene, and the combinations were synergistic 93.5% (95% CI, 70.1-100%) and synergistic 66.1% (95% CI, 35.7-84.3%) when compared with combinations of AlKalate, KAlA, ogen-8-ene, and carbopol. The results showed that alkylating drugs with carbopol added to 1-5 min before treatment had a statistically significant increase in the risk of candidiasis compared with that of alkylating drugs alone. This study demonstrates the potential of combining AlKalate, KAlA, ogen-8-ene, and carbopol to be an effective treatment for candidiasis.


## Introduction
The most common symptoms are fever, weight loss, nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss with or without antibiotic therapy (Figure 3. The most common symptoms include dyspnea, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia [6,7,8,9].

SLE patients are commonly immunocompromised, which is one of the reasons that SLE is frequently associated with an increase in HIV RNA and cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and cryptococcemia (CM) incidence.

The most common SLE pathogen is Cryptococcus neoformans, but the pathogenicity mechanism of SLE may vary depending on the host. In healthy individuals, Cryptococcus causes almost half of all cryptococcal meningitis and approximately 90% of all cryptococcal disease is caused by C. neoformans var. grubii. In immunocompromised individuals, C. neoformans causes a large variety of infections, ranging from asymptomatic colonization of the lung to fatal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. The most common C. neoformans var. grubii strains that cause SLE are VNI, VNII, and VNB (Figure 4). In contrast, C. gattii and C. neoformans var. gattii have increased in frequency in recent years and can be divided into three serotypes. C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype A) is responsible for most cryptococcal infections in AIDS patients, and C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) is the most common cause of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV infection [10].

C. neoformans var. grubii is responsible for approximately 90% of all cryptococcal infections in patients with HIV infection. C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) is the most common cause of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV infection. C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype B) is responsible for cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV infection. The most common C. neoformans var. grubii strains isolated in patients with AIDS and patients with cryptococcemia are VNI, VNIV, and VNBI (Table 1) [11].

## Methods
Genome sequencing and annotation
The assembled, annotated C. neoformans H99 genome was downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). The genome was sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. The protein sequences were assembled using the same approach. The assembly was manually inspected and improved using the “Add New Mutagenesis” workflow.


## Results
In a patient with gastritis, no mucosal ulceration was foun. The patient also had a pulmonary adenocarcinoma (Fig 5, Fig 6).

Lymphadenopathy was noted in 19 (40%) patients. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 11 (40%) patients. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 5 (8%) patients. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (7%) patient.

The most common lymphadenopathy in patients with systemic lupus infection was a small but variable lymphadenopathy (Fig 7). The most common lymphadenopathy was in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common lymphadenopathy was in a patient with mucosal ulceration.

Lymphadenopathy was found in 6 (23%) patients. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 2 (13%) patients. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (10%) patient. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (9%) patient. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (10%) patient. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (9%) patient. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (10%) patient. Lymphadenopathy was noted in 1 (10%) patient.

## Discussion
Mucosal disease is a significant complication of the human mucosal barrier [8. In this study, mucosal mucosal lupus was observed in patients with mucosal mucormycosis, i.e., mucormycosis of the spleen, liver, kidney, and bone marrow [9]. In a patient with mucormycosis, mucormycosis was most commonly found in the spleen, and mucormycosis was most commonly observed in the liver [9].

The mucormycosis-related mucormycosis (MRC) is a non-Hodgkin’s lymphomatosis (NHL) that occurs mainly in patients with malignant tumor [10]. A patient with MRC was initially treated with anti-molecular chemotherapy, with the goal of improving the patient’s lymphomatoid disease status. A patient with MRC was treated with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial therapy, including, but not limited to, surgical debridement, intraline antimicrobials, and a combination of anti-molecular and anti-tuberculous chemotherapy. The final diagnosis was made by the histopathological examination and culture of the organism.

The mucormycosis-related mucormycosis (MRC) is caused by a single cell-mediated mutation in the mucoralean human mycobacterial gene inactivation complex. The mutated gene is responsible for the production of mucormycoses-related mucormycoses, such as mucormycosis of the lungs, mucormycosis of the liver, mucormycosis of the skin, and mucormycosis of the gastrointestinal tract [11].
