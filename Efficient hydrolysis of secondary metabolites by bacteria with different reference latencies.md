## Abstract
The identification of unique and potentially life-threatening pathogen-specific genes (e.g., those encoding secreted proteins or degrading enzymes) has become a widespread and ongoing research topic. This is motivated by the aims of reducing the environmental impact of biotechnological and life-threatening biotechnological problems to species of higher eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and fungi. The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of 14 genes belonging to the monothiocarbamate to trichothecenes complexes, and their possible impact on the pathogenicity of two wheat diseases (Hogger and Sweet).

For this study, the expression profiles of all genes were investigated using non-metatranscriptive whole genome microarrays. Phenotypic analysis of the gene regions was done using real-time PCR and real-time sequencing of the whole genome. Comparison of the expression levels between the different samples revealed that the different phylogenetic groups of the wheat pathogens (Hogger mandrillaris and H. rust) were mainly affected. The expression patterns of the genes were analyzed using a QTL mapping strategy.

Several biotechnologically important plant pathogens have been revealed to be up-regulated in response to the presence of monothiocarbamate and trichothecenes complexes. Some of these biotechnologically important pathogens are represented in the wheat genome.


## Introduction
Recent years have seen an increasing number of patients receiving an array of immunosuppressive regimens for solid organ transplantation (SOT) and the increasing number of patients receiving supportive care for transplantation [1]. The use of immunosuppressive therapy has become more difficult and at the same time, the number of immunocompromised patients has skyrocketed. On a global scale, SOT recipients are living longer and healthier lives with less infections, which in turn have improved SOT outcomes and overall patient safety. The most common immunosuppressive regimen used in the SOT program is the combined antifungal therapy (CAT) [2]. CAT is effective in preventing fungal infections and helps to prevent the spread of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). It is effective against invasive aspergillosis, candidiasis, candidemia, mucormycosis and other common invasive fungal infections (IFIs) [3-5]. In addition, the combined antifungal treatment is generally safe and can be administered orally. However, the CAT regimen is associated with serious adverse effects and frequent adverse events. In some patients, this can lead to severe morbidity and mortality [6].

The mortality rates of invasive aspergillosis in the SOT population are about 50% [7]. This is significantly higher than in other patient populations, which is alarming considering that the number of patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis in the SOT program is approximately 10-15% [7]. The mortality of invasive aspergillosis is well over 50% [7].


## Methods

Enzyme activity
The production of O3 (OMT) was performed as previously described [50. O3 was extracted from the culture broth by the addition of 10% (v/v) methanol. The extract was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. O3 was then mixed with the test reaction mixture, and the residual product was determined. The activities of O3 were expressed as percentage of the activity (mg/l) of the test product.

Enzyme activity
The production of ß-glucosidase (GSH) was performed as previously described [51]. GSH was extracted from the culture broth by the addition of 10% (v/v) methanol and the extract was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. GSH was then mixed with the test reaction mixture, and the residual product was determined. GSH was expressed as percentage of the activity (mg/l) of the test product.

Enzyme activity
The production of ß-amylase (AB) was performed as previously described [52]. AB was extracted from the culture broth by the addition of 10% (v/v) methanol and the extract was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. AB was then mixed with the test reaction mixture, and the residual product was determined. AB was expressed as percentage of the activity (mg/l) of the test product.

Enzyme activity
The production of ß-antioxidant moieties (A_1-A_5) was performed as previously described [53]. A_1 was extracted from the culture broth by the addition of 10% (v/v) methanol and the extract was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. A_5 was then mixed with the test reaction mixture, and the residual product was determined. A_1 was expressed as percentage of the activity (mg/l) of the test product.


## Results
The extent of degradation by enzymes involved in the degradation of microbial metabolites by enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of secondary metabolites is complex and varies between microbe. These enzymes include enzymes that degrade lipids, xylan, and polyketides, as well as enzymes that degrade glycerophosphatidylinositol, lipase, and lipidase. These enzymes were identified as members of the major phylum of fungal metabolites in the literature [29], [30], [31], [32], [33].

In order to further investigate the nature of degradation of microbial metabolites by enzymes involved in degradation of lipids, xylan, and polyketides, an efficient hydrolysis of lipids by aldehyde dehydrogenase (EHE) was performed using M. tuberculosis SA5. EHE is a key enzyme involved in the degradation of volatile organic compounds by E-type polyketides, which are recognized as promising candidates for new antibiotics and antifungals [34], [35]. M. tuberculosis SA5 contains an EHE homolog and is also a member of the MDR subgroup of enzymes with a high degree of similarity to the MDR subgroup of enzymes [36], [37]. Thus, this EHE homolog was predicted as a candidate for degradation of lipids and xylan by aldehyde dehydrogenase (EHE) in M. tuberculosis SA5.

Reverse-transport of microbial metabolites
The exact mechanism of microbial metabolites degradation by enzymes involved in metabolism is unknown. In the current work, we were interested in exploring the mechanism of degradation of microbial metabolites by enzymes involved in the transport of microbial metabolites. We were interested in studying the transport of microbial metabolites by enzymes involved in degradation of lipids and xylan by enzymes involved in the degradation of enzymes involved in the degradation of lipids and xylan.

The transport of microbial metabolites by enzymes involved in the degradation of enzymes involved in the degradation of lipids and xylan by enzymes involved in the degradation of lipids and xylan is shown in Table 3. The transport of microbial metabolites by enzymes involved in the degradation of lipids and xylan is shown in Table 3.


## Discussion
 2012.

Morphological analysis of C. cinerea-P. lutzii complex
The fungal cells of the present study were visualized in a purple light microscopy (data not shown). The fungus was dominated by hyphae that appeared in the light from 60 to 150 m s, as well as pseudohyphae (both) at distances of 60-125 m, with conidia (Figure 5).

The yeast cells of the present study also produced a complex consisting of yeast-like cells (Figure 6) that appeared in the dark and dark-exposed cells (Figure 5) as well as in the light from 150-200 m s.

It is noteworthy that the present study did not specifically analyze C. cinerea, as it is known that the ITS2 gene is highly expressed and expressed in most fungi (Chen et al., 2014). To confirm that the fungi studied in this study are indeed able to produce C. cinerea, we analyzed the fungal cell-surface micrographs of C. cinerea and its wild-type strain. The presence of a fungal cell-surface protein in the cell-surface micrographs (Figure 5) corroborates the results of the molecular characterization of C. cinerea, which was confirmed by the use of micrographs (Figure 6).

Morphological analysis of the C. cinerea-P. lutzii complex
To investigate the role of the fungal cells in the biosynthesis of C. cinerea, we used a synthetic mixture of fungal cell wall polymers, such as cell wall pectin, chitin, and xanthones, to generate a synthetic mixture of C. cinerea and P. lutzii. The fungal cells were treated with synthetic P. lutzii for 24 h and then the cells were collected and analyzed.

The presence of cell wall polymers was observed by spectrophotometry (Figure 6). The presence of cell wall polymers was observed in the present study (Figure 6) and in the yeast cells of the present study (Figure 5). The presence of cell wall polymers was also observed by spectrophotometry of the dark-exposed cell (Figure 5).

The presence of cell wall polymers was also observed by spectrophotometry of the dark-exposed cell (Figure 5).
