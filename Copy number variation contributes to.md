## Abstract
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of opportunistic fungal infections among HIV-infected patients in Mulago Hospital inaborigas, Republic of the Brazilian States of the Western Cape, and evaluate the spectrum of these infections in relation to cryptococcal meningitis.

All HIV-infected patients were enrolled in Mulago Hospital from 1st January 2010 through to 30th March 2013. Patients were classified as opportunistic fungal infection if they have disseminated cryptococcal infection within the first three days of hospital stay and the following days have consciousness, changes in temperature and urine titers, and any other compatible clinical signs.

The mean age of the patients was 50.7±11.2, and 64.9±17.7 years. The average CD4 cell count was 215 cells/mm3 at 21.3 months of follow up. The most common isolates were Cryptococcus neoformans (17.4%), Candida albicans (11.8%), and Aspergillus fumigatus (6.8%). Fluconazole use was the most common opportunistic fungal infection (25.7%) followed by amphotericin, Prostheconazole, and Voriconazole. The mean time to hospital stay over the study period was 116 days (IQR 79-121). The mean time on treatment was 49 days (IQR 31-63). The mean time on treatment was more rapid for Cryptococcus neoformans (68.7%) than for A. fumigatus (59.8%). The rapid increment of CD4 cell count was associated with higher occurrence of cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients (P < 0.01).


## Introduction
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are among the most common IIs. IFIs are life-threatening diseases in hospitalized patients.


## Methods

Statistical analysis
A subset of the isolates with acceptable diagnostic quality was selected based on a set of seven criteri. First, an R statistical method was applied to all data sets for which the data was available for a given sample, in order to minimize the chance of missing data. These seven criteria are as follows: the minimum diagnostic quality required for a true positive result is: (a) a score of =10 points; (b) a score of =20 points; (c) a score of =20 points; (d) a score of =20 points; (e) a score of =10 points; and (f) a score of =20 points. The following formula was applied to each data set: (a) the number of isolates that were recorded as positive in a given sample; (b) the number of isolates that were recorded as negative in a given sample; (c) the number of isolates that were recorded as negative in a given sample; (d) the number of isolates that were recorded as positive in a given sample; (e) the number of isolates that were recorded as negative in a given sample; (f) the number of isolates that were recorded as negative in a given sample; and (g) the number of isolates that were recorded as positive in a given sample. If a data set contained more than five isolates, the data set was regarded as five isolates.

Statistical analysis was performed using R software. The error of detection (DDA) was calculated using the following formula:

The comparison between two groups was performed by the sum of the mean (M) values of the groups. The number of reads per sample was calculated from the maximum number of reads per group as the mean value of the mean of the number of reads per sample in the same sample. All remaining data were represented as the mean value of the groups.

The relative quantification of the number of reads per sample was performed by using the formula:

All data sets were treated as a single data set. All data were converted into raw data using the R library v0.11.0 [29] and the data set was exported to a data library and aligned to the reference database using the BEDTools software [30]. For this purpose, all data sets were called in the same way and a maximum of five genes were calculated per data set.


## Results
For instance, the only species that has a lower genome coverage than other Ascomycetes has a lower number of genes than the other fungi (Table 3. For the other fungi, the number of genes covered by the different clusters (in terms of both total number of genes and total number of genes without cluster analysis) are extremely similar, and for the same species, the number of clusters is the same (Table 3). These data suggest that the results of the analysis can be used to predict the phylogenetic relationships of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes.

We also compared the concatenated data set of all 16,436 orthologous genes in Ascomycetes with the concatenated data set of all 8,093 genes in Basidiomycetes (Table 4). The concatenated data set included the concatenated data sets of the 16,436 orthologous genes from the 16,436 Basidiomycetes and the 8,093 orthologous genes from the 8,093 Basidiomycetes.


## Discussion
Interestingly, our data demonstrate that the kappa B<U+03B3> in the tangerine-black population does not contribute to the genetic differentiation of . gattii by any means, but the differences in the kappa B<U+03B3> may be due to one or more genetic differences between the populations. For example, in our population, the level of kappa B<U+03B3> in C. gattii is significantly higher than that in C. neoformans, with the exception of C. gattii. The degree of kappa B<U+03B3> in C. gattii is significantly higher than that in C. neoformans, with the exception of C. gattii. Moreover, the prevalence of this allele in C. gattii is significantly higher than that in C. neoformans. These findings indicate that the genetic differentiation of C. gattii is less complex than that in C. neoformans. In addition, our data show that the genetic differentiation of C. gattii is more complex than that in C. neoformans, which may be caused by different genetic differences between the populations.

Our data show that the expression of the tangerine-black gene is induced in C. gattii when the colony is colonized by C. neoformans, and when the colony is colonized by C. gattii. Interestingly, C. gattii strain R265, which has the tangerine-black gene, is also induced in C. neoformans when the colony is colonized by C. gattii [38]. The two strains of C. gattii have also been shown to be significantly different in their expression of tangerine-black gene and to produce different concentrations of the tangerine-black gene [37].

Our data show that the expression of the tangerine-black gene is induced in C. gattii when the colony is colonized by C. neoformans, and when the colony is colonized by C. gattii. However, the tangerine-black gene does not appear to be important for the formation of the colony in C. gattii, suggesting that C. gattii does not possess the tangerine-black gene. The tangerine-black gene expression in C.
