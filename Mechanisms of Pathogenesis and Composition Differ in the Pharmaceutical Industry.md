## Abstract
Fusarium graminearum is a filamentous fungus that is responsible for the lethal wilt disease on many rice plants. The life cycle of F. graminearum is characterized by the formation of massive conidia and conidia tubes that are surrounded by a conidial membrane that exerts tremendous pressure on the nematode to create a tough, swollen conidia that later penetrate the nematode to cause the wilt. As a defense mechanism, the fungus mounts a successful response to the wilt by growing out of the conidial wall a rich array of proteins involved in multiple aspects of the nematode's physiology. The role played by many proteins in this adaptation process is still being discovered. This review summarizes the physiological, biochemical, and genetic properties of the different proteins involved in the formation of the conidial wall that allow the fungus to penetrate the nematode. We also discuss the evolution of the fungal proteins that allow this adaptation process to occur, and we highlight new targets that may help the fungus cope with the wilt. The evolutionary processes that lead to the adaptation of fungi to wilt have opened up new pathways that may take advantage of the different nutritional and/or nutritional state that the fungus has right now. This review also highlights the fact that wilt is a disease that is currently being introduced to almost every plant and a number of fungi that are known to be involved in the wilt-control process.


## Introduction
Many pharmacological agents are produced from the pharmaceutical chemical arsenal of plants and their derivative. Among them, the active ingredients, such as retinal, chromatin, melanin, histidine, lanine, histidine derivatives, and phenylalanine, are based on biological mechanisms of action and are often associated with pharmacological activities that are influenced by cell membrane permeability, such as facilitation of phagocytosis, stimulation of phagosome maturation and release, promotion of apoptosis, and inhibition of membrane fusion [26,27]. Recently, a new class of molecules, such as benzene- and ethylbenzene-diols, has emerged, in which the addition of a phenylbenzene moiety to the benzene moiety causes a conformational change of the benzene moiety into the ethylbenzene moiety, thereby generating a new benzene moiety [28]. The benzene moiety, which can be oxidized to form ethylbenzene moiety, is a central constituent of many pharmaceutical agents [28]. Benzene-diol conjugates, synthesized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, are involved in drug metabolism, particularly the regulation of redox homeostasis [29]. Among the pharmaceutical agents with an ethylbenzene moiety, the benzene-diol conjugates are the echinocandins, micafungin-like derivatives, and azoles, which were reported to be active against Candida albicans [30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. The echinocandins are structurally similar to the benzene derivatives. In contrast to the echinocandins, the echinocandins were reported to exhibit fungicidal activity against a variety of fungi, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida krusei. The echinocandins are highly fungicidal against both as well as fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and C. glabrata [29,31,32,33]. The echinocandins are commonly used in the clinic as prophylactic and treatment agents against opportunistic fungal infections [31,32,33,34,35]. The echinocandins are highly active against C.


## Methods
Pathogenesis was considered a well-established phenomenon which is observed in the clinical practice [22. Pathogenesis of a given drug with its properties was assessed by determining its physicochemical properties, i.e., hydrophilic properties, hydrophobic properties, alkaline properties, and tannic properties.

Determination of the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC)
The FIC index is the ratio between the FIC value of a compound and the FIC value of its corresponding stock solution in DMSO [23]. The FIC index is calculated according to the following equation: FIC = 0.5 - FIC 1.0 [24].

Preparation of the Toxic Compounds
To evaluate the toxicity of a compound, it was used to test its metabolic activities and the accumulation of toxic compounds in the CNS, liver, and the kidneys [25]. The concentration of a compound in DMSO was determined with a Gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-1090, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an automated injector and an autosampler (Shimadzu AG-3100, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The calibration curve was established using DMSO at the lowest concentrations of the compounds that produced no effect [25].

Determination of the Chemical Characteristics
The chemical characteristics of a compound were determined using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-1090, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an automatic injector and an autosampler (Shimadzu AG-3100, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The calibration curve was established using DMSO at the lowest concentrations of the compounds that produced no effect [25].

In order to evaluate the safety of the compounds, it was used to evaluate the toxicity of a compound in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis (MOCCF) [26]. The determination of the percentage of mortality in the first week of treatment was performed in order to determine the probability that the compound was in fact effective and to determine the number of days of therapy after the first treatment.

## Discussion
The natural pathogenic fungi are found in soil and water, and are associated with water contamination [15. These fungi are found in many plant species and can cause diseases in plants and humans [16]. In the current study, the microbial community of the water systems in the hospital was largely dominated by the three genera of Cryptococcus, Aureobasidium and Alternaria, as well as the other three genera, Lecanicillium and Alternaria, which are commonly found in soil and water. However, a few of the genera, including Alternaria, Cladosporium, Candida and Candida, were not detected in this study. However, these genera were included in the current study based on their taxonomic distribution and geographic distribution. This is because the genera were isolated from the soil and water samples.

The higher diversity of fungi in water systems is consistent with previous findings in clinical samples [17]. The highest diversity was observed in the water systems of the hospital, which exhibited a mixture of bacteria and fungi. The most abundant genera were Alternaria, Cladosporium and Cryptococcus, and the second-largest genera were Alternaria, Penicillium and Cryptococcus, with the majority of the genera belonging to the order Penicillium. The fungal community was dominated by Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporium, which are widely distributed in soils, which are associated with diseases in plants [18]. The most abundant genera of the order Penicillium were Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Fusarium-tinctur, Aspergillus, and Trichosporon. The same genera were also found in the hospital water samples, which are frequently associated with diseases in plants [19].

The water systems of the hospital were dominated by the three genera of Acremonium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Alternaria, which are commonly found in soil and water. A large proportion of these genera was also found in this study. These genera are commonly found in water systems, which can act as water-borne pathogens and cause disease in plants [20].
