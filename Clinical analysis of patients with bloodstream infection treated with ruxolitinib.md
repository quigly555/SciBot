## Abstract
Aspergillus fumigatus is an airborne fungal pathogen capable of causing life-threatening pulmonary aspergillosis, a globally distributed and often deadly fungal infection. Current antifungal therapies have limited efficacy and limited success in treatment. Patents and polyenesities that limit A. fumigatus adaptation to standard therapies have restricted its access to limited-clinical trials. We developed a novel, cost-effective, noninvasive inhalation method to successfully administer ruxolitinib to A. fumigatus in vitro and in vivo. We successfully delivered ruxolitinib to the skin surface and sustained its release without any mechanical, chemical, or other physiological intervention. Ruxolitinib demonstrated a low adverse drug profile and reduced fungal burden in the lung, heart, and other organs. The results of this study suggest that ruxolitinib could be an effective alternative to conventional therapy for invasive aspergillosis.

Aspergillus fumigatus is a globally distributed and deadly fungal pathogen that is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis worldwide. Current therapies have limited efficacy and have limited success, and the most effective treatment options are currently limited. Ruxolitinib is a relatively new and novel inhalation method for the treatment of A. fumigatus infection. This study demonstrates that ruxolitinib achieved its first success with high dose intravenous drug administration and achieved significant reductions in fungal burden and disease severity. Ruxolitinib was successfully delivered intravenous to successfully alleviate pulmonary aspergillosis without adverse drug effects. This trial adds to the collection of clinical data that is available in the clinical setting and could prove useful for identifying patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis.

IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus is a polyextremophilic fungal pathogen that is ubiquitous in the environment and human mycoses. Key virulence attributes have been shown to contribute to its ability to cause disease in immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we demonstrated that the ruxolitinib armamentarium was superior to that of amphotericin B, a commercially available oral antifungal, in determining of pulmonary aspergillosis.


## Introduction
Histoplasmosis is an uncommon and frequently fatal fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. It is endemic in about 100 countries and the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It is most commonly seen in children and in immunocompromised patients, particularly AIDS patients and patients with cutaneous and pulmonary histoplasmosis, and it is an AIDS-defining illness [1]. The infection can progress from an asymptomatic infection to an acute disseminated histoplasmosis or it can develop into a fulminant disseminated histoplasmosis, which is fatal without treatment. The diagnosis of the disseminated histoplasmosis is difficult, however, due to the presence of several signs: fever, redness, chills, nausea, diarrhea, hypotension, abdominal pain, and weight loss [2]. The most common forms of histoplasmosis are subcutaneous and systemic. Most patients with disseminated histoplasmosis are at risk of contracting infections by post-infectious mechanisms. The mortality rate associated with fungal infection is approximately 20% to 25%, depending on the stage of the disease and the treatment given. Infections are usually asymptomatic and the infection can be treated with antifungal drugs, although amphotericin B and its lipid formulations can have some adverse effects. The best-known antifungal is fluconazole, the main drug used to treat histoplasmosis in the clinic. A recent study showed that amphotericin B, itraconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole are active against most fungi and can inhibit the growth of some fungi. It has been suggested that the ability of amphotericin B to inhibit the growth of fungi is related to the ability to bind with iron and to the degree of binding to mannan. In addition, amphotericin B has been used for treatment of fungal infections because of its short half-life, which can be prolonged for a longer duration than that of the conventional drugs.


## Methods
The clinical examination was performed on admission and the results were recorded dail. The patient’s level of consciousness was recorded as N/N (%) [5].

Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Academy of Sciences [10]. The protocol was approved by the institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Guangdong University (Approval No. CAI/2006/4).

Animals
Female C57BL/6J background mice (20-25 g) were purchased from Jihua Animal Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment and were cared for in accordance with the principles of the Society for Laboratory Animal Welfare (STROBE) and the principles of animal welfare of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmic Medicine (AALOPUS). All animals were handled in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmic Medicine. The experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the National Animal Welfare Act of 1975.

Preparation of fungi and their preparation
Fungal cultures were prepared by inoculating 5 mL of Fava Netto broth (FLB) in 0.9% NaCl at 28 °C and incubating at 25 °C. The cultures were then grown on filter paper for 3-5 days. The mycelia were collected by filtration using sterile double-sided glass slides, dried, and the extracts were solubilized in sterile distilled water. The extracts were stored at -20 °C.

Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ruxolitinib was determined using the broth microdilution method according to the CLSI M38-A method [12] and according to the CLSI M27-A2 method [13]. The tested compounds were diluted with RPMI-1640 and RPMI-1640 medium and then added to a final concentration of 0.5-2.5 mg/mL in sterile double-sided glass containers.


## Results
Thus, patients with bloodstream infection were treated with rifampicin, in which the use of this drug was not tolerate. In contrast, patients with bloodstream infection were treated with rifampicin in which the use of rifampicin was not tolerated. The drug dose was generally low, ranging from 0.1 to 2 mg/kg/day. As shown in Table 3, the median duration of therapy was 2.7 (range, 1-6.6).

The results of the pharmacokinetic parameters of rifampicin and rifampicin-naïve mice are summarized in Table 4. In rifampicin-naïve mice, the effective dosage of rifampicin (0.38 mg/kg/day) was 7.5-fold higher than that of the control (4.2 mg/kg/day). In contrast, the effective dose of rifampicin-naïve mice was 18-fold higher than that of the control (4.5 mg/kg/day). There was a significant difference in the effective dose between the two groups, with rifampicin-naïve mice receiving an effective dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day and rifampicin-naïve mice receiving a lower effective dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day. In addition, rifampicin-naïve mice had a higher effective dose of 0.45 mg/kg/day than the control group (3.6 mg/kg/day).

The pharmacokinetic parameters of rifampicin and rifampicin-naïve mice are summarized in Table 5. In rifampicin-naïve mice, the effective dose of rifampicin (0.38 mg/kg/day) was 11.2-fold higher than that of the control group (4.2 mg/kg/day). In contrast, rifampicin-naïve mice received a lower effective dose of 0.46 mg/kg/day than the control group (2.4 mg/kg/day).


## Discussion
In this report, we found that Cryptococcus neoformans has the capability to form biofilm on human skin and that this ability is conserved in C. gattii.

C. neoformans has been classified as a clinically defined fungal pathogen. However, this species has been found in multiple clinical and environmental sources (25, 26). We found that C. neoformans has the ability to form biofilms on different hosts, including animals (25, 26), and this ability is also reflected in the number of C. neoformans genome-sequenced reads (14, 13, and 13). We observed that C. neoformans biofilm formation was more rapid than that observed in vitro, and the rate of biofilm formation was faster in vitro. We also observed that the biofilm formation rate of C. neoformans was faster than that of C. gattii (n = 3 biofilm formation/gene), suggesting that C. gattii biofilm formation is an important virulence factor.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a dimorphic yeast with a cytoplasmic genome that is similar to C. neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is classified into two major clades: clade I (isolated from Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans clades II-IV) and clade II (isolated from Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii) (27).
