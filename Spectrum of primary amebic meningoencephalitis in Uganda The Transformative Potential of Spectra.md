## Abstract
The yeast, Candida glabrata, causes skin infections, especially to immunocompromised patients, and the majority of human infections are associated with oral and dermal infection. Despite the limited understanding of the host defense mechanisms against oral and dermal candidiasis, the C. glabrata genome contains a small number of genes that encode for proteins that may function as pathogenicity factors. For example, the C. glabrata COPD1 gene encodes a carbohydrate transporter that could have been involved in the pathogenicity of C. glabrata. We have determined that the COPD1 gene is also required for virulence in a murine model of aspergillosis. We have identified two other genes in the genome of C. glabrata, COPD2 and COPD3, that are also expressed during disease and may confer virulence. This study demonstrates that C. glabrata copd1 and/or copd3 play a critical role in fungal colonization of mammalian hosts and thus may have a significant impact on the development of human aspergillosis.


## Introduction
The resistance of microorganisms to a broad spectrum of antifungal agents is a major problem. The emergence of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens has prompted the search for new targets for antifungal agents [1]. As a result of the emerging threat of fungal infections, several new targets have been proposed for antifungal treatment. The target of antifungal agents is the fungal cell membrane [2], [3]. The cell membrane is a unique and key structural organelle. It is known to be highly reactive in fungi and is involved in cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and fungal virulence [4], [5]. Several species of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus have emerged as important pathogens of humans and plants. Among the most important pathogens of humans are those that cause aflatoxin-producing earworms [6], [7]. The evolution of virulence, and the evolution of antifungal drug resistance, has been an important topic in drug development.

The antifungal drug is designed to inhibit fungal cell growth without inducing toxic effects.


## Methods
Isolation of yeasts from intestinal

G. mellonella were maintained in sterile plastic Petri dishes at 28°C and 7% CO_2. A single colony was transferred to a Petri dish containing 0.25% polymyxin B (PMA) and incubated at 28°C for 24-48 h. Subsequently, the mycelia was harvested by filtration on a 0.22 µm filter and washed with sterile distilled water to obtain pure culture media (M) in which yeasts were maintained for 48 h. The fungal mycelia were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterile distilled water. The mycelia were then re-suspended in sterile distilled water to the desired concentration (1 × 10^3 to 1 × 10^2 cells/mL), and a 50 µL aliquot of this suspension was added to 1 mL of sterile distilled water. The suspension was incubated for 24 h at 37°C, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

For quantification of fungal biofilm formation, a 30-mL aliquot of a culture of G. mellonella was placed on a Sabouraud dextrose agar plate, and the plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. The biofilm diameter was measured after incubation for 24 h at 37°C.


## Results
These results are summarized in Table . The spectral probes were tested with purified clinical isolates of several pathogenic fungi including the Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium spp., Candida spp., and Aspergillus spp. which were previously used in the infection of humans with the pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. (18). We performed the data analysis using the spectral probes to elucidate the potential spectral diversity in the diagnosis of human infections (Table 3).

The spectral probes were able to identify a small percentage of pathogenic fungi including the Aspergillus spp. (Table 3). The majority of pathogenic fungi were C. albicans (63.5%), C. glabrata (29.3%), A. flavus (5.8%), C. dubliniensis (3.7%), C. parapsilosis (2.4%), C. tropicalis (1.2%), and A. fumigatus (0.5%). The majority of C. dubliniensis were common to all tested strains (80%) and C. parapsilosis was only found in two of the five strains tested. The overall spectral diversity of C. albicans (6.2%) and C. glabrata (3.6%) was higher than those of C. parapsilosis (2.3%), and A. fumigatus (0.9%) and C. parapsilosis (1.1%) and C. tropicalis (0.9%) respectively. The spectral diversity of A. flavus (6.7%) and C. parapsilosis (2.3%) was higher than that of A. fumigatus (1.1%) and C. parapsilosis (0.9%) and C. tropicalis (0.9%) respectively. The spectral diversity of A. flavus (6.7%) and C. parapsilosis (2.3%) was higher than that of C. parapsilosis (2.3%) and A. fumigatus (0.9%) and C. parapsilosis (1.1%) and C. tropicalis (0.9%) respectively.


## Discussion
While the majority of cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis have been reported in the United States, the case reported in the United Kingdom is the first report in an African population of Pneumocysti. The patient had a history of committing an act of sexual intercourse and was initially suspected of having an idiopathic CD4 lymphoma. The patient had a history of sexually-transmitted amebic meningoencephalitis and a history of coexisting with an idiopathic CD4 lymphoma. The patient was treated for AIDS-related opportunistic infections including the lymphoma. After treatment, the patient was cured and the lymphoma was diagnosed as Pneumocystis. The patient had a history of amebic meningoencephalitis, which was later confirmed by testing for HIV-1 in an immunocompetent patient. The patient had a history of parenchymal lymphoma and was treated for AIDS-related opportunistic infections.
