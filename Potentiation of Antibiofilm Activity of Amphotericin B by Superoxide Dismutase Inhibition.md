## Abstract
The three-dimensional gel electrophoresis (3-DE) proteomics platform generated in this study provides new insights into the proteome of Trichoderma reesei, the type strain of Trichoderma that is responsible for the blue-underbelly edible mushroom. To analyze proteins of T. reesei, proteomes were generated from three different protein collections. The first set of proteins identified proteins that were either absent or had been replaced by another protein. The second set of proteins identified proteins that were either present or had been replaced by a different protein. Finally, the proteomes of Trichoderma castellanii, Trichoderma virens, Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma atlantei, and Trichoderma barbatimicroscopicalis were generated using oligonuclear cells with protein coverage of only 12.5%. Three additional proteomes were generated using an oligonuclear cell with protein coverage of 44.5%. The results of the proteomics suggest that T. reesei is a heterothallic ascomycete with a mating type that has the ability to produce viable spores. This heterothallic ascomycete is very similar to Trichoderma so we propose the concept of a mating-type locus. Finally, the use of oligonuclear cells with protein coverage of 46.5% indicates that T. reesei has been successfully completed in producing spores.


## Introduction
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii (the causative agent of chromoblastomycosis) and is an important zoonotic infection in humans and animals.1,2 The infection occurs through the inhalation of spores (spores) from the environment. Spores are released into the air and settle on the skin, where they can disseminate to other body sites, causing significant morbidity and mortality.3,4 The interaction of toxoplasmosis with other zoonotic diseases is complex and is largely mediated by host-pathogen interactions. The infections of the respiratory tracts, skin, and gastrointestinal tract are the most common and severe.5,6

The genus of the toxoplasmatic parasites, Toxoplasma, has six host species; seven of them, Toxoplasma bantiana, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxoplasma capsulatum, and Toxoplasma tatemex, have been reported in humans.7,8 In the United States, the most common form of toxoplasmosis is toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a pathogen of chickens, rabbits, and cattle.9 In this species, toxoplasmosis is usually caused by the nonpathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite of humans.


## Methods
[26. Briefly, the mycelium of the test strain was cultured on PDA plates at 37 °C for 2 days and then the mycelium was harvested and inoculated with 0.25 ml of 0.2% of PDA. Mycelium was then harvested and the mycelium was washed with water and the fungal suspension was adjusted to 10^4 conidia ml^-1. Then the suspension was incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 2 days. The mycelium was then washed with water and the fungal suspension was adjusted to 10^4 conidia ml^-1. The mycelium was then collected and washed with water and then the fungal suspension was adjusted to 10^3 conidia ml^-1. After the mycelium was collected and washed with water, the fungal suspension was adjusted to 10^3 conidia ml^-1. The fungal suspensions were then mixed with the mycelium and the mycelium were mixed with a sterile toothpick and the fungal solution was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min and the weight of the supernatant was determined. The control was also performed using PDA medium without any drug and the mycelium was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh PDA plate and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured.

2.6. Hemolytic Activity of Amphotericin B
The antibacterial activity of Amphotericin B was determined by using the method of Lamour et al. [27]. Briefly, the mycelium of the test strain was cultured on PDA plates at 37 °C for 2 days and then the mycelium was harvested and the mycelium was washed with water. Then the mycelium was washed with water and the fungal suspension was adjusted to 10^3 conidia ml^-1. The suspension was then mixed with the mycelium and the mycelium were mixed with a sterile toothpick and the fungal suspension was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured.

## Results
In this study, we tested the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against the strains of Candida sp. and human breast cancer in order to understand the mechanism of antifungal activity of amphotericin B. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B was assessed by the antifungal activity of the methanolic extract of the oil of the plant (Figure 4). The antifungal activity of methanolic extract of the oil of the plant was against all the tested strains of Candida spp. (Table 2), showing that the methanolic extract of the oil of the plant does not inhibit Candida spp. (Figure 4).


## Discussion
In the infected tissue, Superoxide Dismutase was detected in supernatants of Tumor cells (Fig 1A) and was subsequently ruled out as a potential cause of antimonial effect. The supernatants of Tumor cells also showed the presence of superoxide dismutase (Fig 1B). However, these supernatants of Tumor cells did not show this superoxide dismutase (Fig 1A). We showed that superoxide dismutase is a major cellular organelle involved in the autophagy pathway, a process that allows the survival and proliferation of bacteria. This is in agreement with the findings of the present study, in which the superoxide dismutase activity was detected in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B. However, the activity was not detected in the supernatants of Tumor cells treated with Toxoplasma.

The increase in superoxide dismutase activity in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B is consistent with the findings of the present study. The increase in superoxide dismutase activity in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B is also in agreement with the results of the present study. The results of the present study showed that superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B. The reason for this decreased superoxide dismutase activity in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B is not clear. In addition, the results of the present study showed that the superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B. The results of the present study showed that the superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in supernatants of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B.

The results of the present study showed that the superoxide dismutase activity of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B was decreased by 9.33-fold in comparison to that of Tumor cells after treatment with Amphotericin B. This finding is in agreement with the results of the present study.
