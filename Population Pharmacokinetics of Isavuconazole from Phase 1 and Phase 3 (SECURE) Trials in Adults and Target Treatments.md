## Abstract

A5202 was a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial conducted from January 2012 to March 2014 in twelve hospitals in Chin. Twelve healthy adults randomized to receive 1 mg or less of venalidine or doxorubicin orally for 14 days. Two primary outcomes were selected: treatment response and length of survival. Secondary outcomes were: weight, blood pressure, cardiovascular event, risk of acute respiratory failure, hemoglobin levels, and CD4 count.

Of the 123 subjects enrolled, median age was 41 years (IQR 31-48); 68% were male and 35% were female, respectively (Median age 36 years (IQR 33-40), range 0-68). At baseline, there was a history of multiple myeloma (MSM), an acute pericardial effusion, jugular carcinoma, spleen cell carcinoma, endomyocardial fibrosis, monocyte chemotaxis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cancer. Only 1 subject had a history of infection, diabetes mellitus, and 1 had an elevated protein (P > 0.05) or an elevated glucose (P > 0.05) as assessed by glucose-metabolizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At baseline, he was adherent, with anoglobin level in the range of 1.1-5.1 g/dL (IQR 1.2-5.4), with a non-fatal neutropenia. He was adherent 24 hours after initiation of treatment, but had a non-fatal neutropenia in the following 24 days. At week 14, he was adherent, with a non-fatal neutropenia in the following 24 days. At week 29, he was adherent, with a non-fatal neutropenia in the following 24 days. At week 60 he was negative, but was negative with mucormycosis. At week 144, he was negative, but had a low-grade fever and sepsis.

## Introduction
The genus Thymus is traditionally defined as a phylloplane or ‘sporotopergoid’. Phylloplane and sporotopergoidus are often associated with secondary metabolites with biological activities, e.g., amyloid-beta folic acid (AFB), folic acid, and pyrrolactone. Secondary metabolites with biological activity can be either organic (a-ketoglutarate, ethyl pyrophosphate) or inorganic (e.g., p-glycosides, p-galactosylated d-glucosides) [1]. The chemical structure of a-ketoglutarate (KG) and its chemical structures are still not fully understood because most of the studies on this topic have focused on the chemical structure of compounds with biological activity, e.g., AKG, AKG/LNK, AKG/KD and LNK [2,3,4,5,6,7].

AKG is a heterodimeric glutamate protein and is a member of the family of serine proteases, S proteases [8,9]. It contains four isoforms (SH1, SH2, SH3 and SH4) and three isoforms (SH3, SH4 and SH4) [10]. The SH3 isoform contains a His-Asp (His-Asp) domain and a His-Asp domain. The SH3 isoform is conserved in different organisms. However, it is not well known whether the SH3 isoform is present in other organisms or whether it is only present in some cells. The present work is an in vitro study, and the results may be compared with those obtained from studies on the structure of AKG.

## Results
The included data included 32 patients enrolled in this stud. The baseline characteristics and the baseline outcomes are shown in Table 3.

The median age of the patients was 41 years (range, 3-86 years) and the median baseline CD4 count was 200 cells/mm^3 (range, 25-500 cells/mm^3) (Table 3). The median CD4 count was 38 cells/mm^3 (range, 12-67 cells/mm^3) and the median baseline CD4 count was 135 cells/mm^3 (range, 40-500 cells/mm^3) (Table 3). The median CRP was 0.09 (range, 0.07-0.55) mg/L/day (Table 3). A randomization study was conducted between 2019 and 2019. The included data included 24 patients (12% of all patients) enrolled in this study. The baseline characteristics and the baseline outcomes are shown in Table 4.

Safety Study
In this safety study, 40 patients (20%) died during follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 4.5 years (range, 0.1-7.6 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 22.2 months (range, 3.2-37.2 months). All patients had previous solid drug use. The patients in the safety study had a median CD4 count of 263 cells/mm^3 (range, 48-3,6 cells/mm^3) and the median CD4 count of 161 cells/mm^3 (range, 47-1,9 cells/mm^3) (Table 3). No adverse events were reported.

Correlation between Clinical Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes
The correlations between the clinical variables of the 10-month-old healthy volunteers and the median CRP and baseline CD4 counts are shown in Table 5. The results are summarized in Table 6. There was no significant relationship between the clinical variables of the 10-month-old healthy volunteers and the median CRP and baseline CD4 counts. The correlation between the clinical characteristics and the median CRP and baseline CD4 counts is shown in Table 6. There was no significant difference in the clinical characteristics between the patients in the safety study and those in the placebo control.


## Discussion
Of the patients, 598 (70%) were treated with echinocandins and 2 (14%) with amphotericin . The second phase included 155 (54%) patients and included the age group of 14-68 years. The third phase included 139 (51%) patients and included the age group of 15-68 years. The fourth phase included 121 (23%) patients and included the age group of 14-68 years. The fifth phase included 48 (3%) patients and included the age group of 14-68 years.

The percentage of patients treated with echinocandins at all stages is shown in Table 1. The percentage of patients treated with amphotericin B was also higher in the second phase than in the first phase, which is in line with the results of previous studies in adults. In addition to the first phase, the percentage of patients treated with echinocandins was higher in the second phase than in the first phase. The percentage of patients treated with amphotericin B was higher in the second phase than in the first phase, which is in line with the results of previous studies in adults.
