## Abstract
bgp-EN has been delete.

A bgp-EN deletion strain was identified in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and it was shown to be adapted to host-symbiont-mediated cryptic formation by the fungus. The deletion mutant was shown to be non-pathogenic and had reduced conidial volumes. Furthermore, it was shown that conidia from the <U+0394>mhccl-3b strain of the Pichia pastoris were not readily extracted and that hyphae from <U+0394>mhccl-3b strain were unable to be extracted. These results suggest that the P. pastoris deletion strains harbor an abnormal inability to remove hyphae. The lack of hyphal fusion in <U+0394>mhccl-3b, and the fact that <U+0394>mhccl-3b had defective formation of conidia, together with abnormal conidial volume, indicate that P.


## Introduction
Molecular detection and characterization enabled the identification of many important chemical factors in the cell wall, including the main cell wall polysaccharides, the cytoskeleton, the basic serine residues and the exoskeleto. In the past decade, several enzymes such as glycosaminoglycans, glycosaminoglycans-like proteins and lipases were identified in the cell wall, providing a new source of bioactive components, including the nematode-trapping fungi.

In addition, enzymes are involved in the process of nematode-trapping fungi survival, and nematode-trapping fungi are widely distributed in diverse ecosystems, including soil, plants and animals (15). Among soil bacteria, the nematode-trapping fungi are generally found in the soil or in water and can be divided into two groups: saprophytic and pathogenic species (23). The saprophytic species are mainly found in freshwater lakes and rivers, where they have a role in soil decomposition and water movement (22). The pathogenic species are found in freshwater environments and are associated with diseases in animals and humans (23). The pathogenic species of nematodes are associated with nematode-trapping fungi. In this study, the role of the cytoskeleton in the nematode-trapping fungus N. oxysporum was investigated. N. oxysporum belongs to the phylum Nematoda and is found in soil and freshwater (16). The cell wall of N. oxysporum has been shown to be involved in nematode-trapping processes. Cell wall remodeling in the nematode-trapping fungi was also investigated. The cell wall has been shown to be involved in nematode-trapping processes. These studies demonstrated that the cell wall is the major structural barrier against nematode invasion and they could be used to study the role of the cell wall in nematode-trapping fungi.

The nematode-trapping fungi have been extensively studied. Cell walls have been shown to be involved in the establishment of infection sites and nematode-trapping fungi are usually found in the soil or in water (12, 17, 23).


## Methods
., leaves of fine brown twigs, eucalyptus, and tree trunks) at a depth of ~10 cm. Sporangia were cut from bark of the rice-seedlings (Bengal and Cenca, 2006), or from the woody mycelium of the rice-plant pathogen-treated plants (Bengal and Cenca, 2006). The spore concentration in the spore suspensions was determined by the method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008) and in the case of the rice-plant pathogen-treated rice-treatments (Bengal and Cenca, 2006).

For the determination of the antimicrobial activity of the spore suspensions, the spore suspension (3 mL of spore suspension) was added to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) solution (Nematode, São Paulo, Brazil) in a laminar flow hood. The spore suspension (1 mL) was transferred to a sterile 96-well microtiter plate (Nematode, São Paulo, Brazil) with an optical density of 0.6-0.8 at 600 nm. A volume of 100 µL of the spore suspension was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. The absorbance of the sample was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3-3) and a blank control was included. The absorbance of the blank control was not measured. The antimicrobial activity of the spore suspensions was determined by the method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008).

The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the spore suspensions were determined by the method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008) with slight modifications. The spore suspension (1 mL of spore suspension) was mixed with 5 mL of 10% saline and then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and the pH of the spore suspension was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 0.165 M NaCl.


## Results
Microscopic examination of the nematode surface revealed a large number of bacteria and fungi with a recognizable morphology (Fig 4B. The number of bacteria ranged from 10 to 1,200, and 10 to 1,500, whereas the fungal community was larger (Fig 4C). The bacterial community is characterized by a broad spectrum of morphologies and features including a punctate pattern of Gram-positive bacteria, as well as a high density of Gram-negative bacteria. The fungal community also includes multiple microbial species (Fig 4D), including several filamentous fungi and other protozoan species.

The bacterial community of nematodes is highly diverse and encompassed a wide spectrum of bacteria and fungi (Fig 5A). We found that Nematodes harbour at least one unique bacterial species (Fig 5B). Among the newly discovered species, two are homologous to Penicillium and two are homologous to P. destructans (Fig 5C). A third is a member of the Clostridium clade (Fig 5D). Interestingly, we also observed a different diversity of fungal species in the nematode community. As previously reported, Penicillium species can be distinguished from Penicillium spp. (S. cerevisiae) by their hemicellulae and periphyllous colonies (P. destructans). The presence of Clostridium spp. in nematodes was also noted by the use of the Clostridium spp. dye and the presence of a distinct gram-negative genus Penicillium spp. (P. destructans). Moreover, we also found that a member of the genus Bacteroides was also found in nematodes. In addition, the nematode communities were dominated by Gram-positive bacteria. As previously reported, these Gram-positive bacteria are Gram-positive fungi and therefore appear to be associated with the nematode surface.

In order to further assess the presence of these new bacterial species in nematodes, we compared the bacterial community of nematodes with those of B. cinerea and C. elegans. We found that nematodes harbour more Gram-positive bacteria than B. cinerea (Fig 5E). The relative abundance of B.


## Discussion
The nematode-trapping nematode population was thus determined in the field, and in this study we focused on the nematode-trapping nematode populatio. We have used a very conservative approach to define the nematode-trapping nematodes. This approach has been widely used to assess nematode-trapping nematode populations [36], and it is possible that we have underestimated the percentage of nematode-trapping nematodes in the field. This approach has also been widely used to assess the nematode-trapping nematodes [37], but it is of limited use in determining the nematode-trapping nematode populations in this study.

Our results suggest that nematode-trapping nematodes are highly tolerant of nematode-trapping nematodes. However, the nematode-trapping nematodes in the field could be expected to be more tolerant than the nematode-trapping nematodes. This could be due to several reasons. First, nematode-trapping nematodes are highly tolerant of nematode-trapping nematodes, whereas nematode-trapping nematodes are less tolerant of nematode-trapping nematodes [37]. Second, nematode-trapping nematodes are extremely sensitive to nematode-trapping nematodes, which could be due to the relatively high abundance of nematode-trapping nematodes in the field. Third, nematode-trapping nematodes are highly tolerant of nematode-trapping nematodes. This is also reflected by the presence of nematode-trapping nematodes in the field.

Our results also suggest that nematode-trapping nematodes are relatively resistant to nematode-trapping nematodes. This is a very interesting hypothesis, but it is worth highlighting that nematode-trapping nematodes are less tolerant of nematode-trapping nematodes. This may be due to their more recalcitrant lifestyle and more efficient nematode killing [38], which could also be a factor.
