## Abstract
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of viral meningitis in humans, with over one million cases of active tuberculosis each year, and over one million deaths occur every year. Fluconazole inhibits the replication of the active form of this viral infection in infected cells. We previously reported that d-glucuronic acid, a prominent immunogenic compound, was found in the airway bacterial microbiome in human lungs during d-glucuronic acid treatment of mice, and this finding was associated with reduced bacterial killing of neutrophils by human bone marrow derived macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether d-glucuronic acid treatment could impact d-galacturonosylation, a marker of natural microbial populations.


## Introduction

The generation of a selective niche is driven by the “selection theory of action” [16. The selection of an organism is a mathematical process that involves the creation of an optimal niche by selection acting on the selective agents that are able to fit the proposed niche. The selected agent acts by producing selective agents that are capable of causing a selective agent to be more competitive with the non-competeable non-competeable individuals, thus causing the selective agent to be more competitive with the non-competeable individuals. The selection of an organism can be divided into two types of agents: (1) active/adaptive/diversity agents and (2) selective/incompetent agents. The fitness costs associated with each type of agent are identified by the fitness costs associated with each agent and the relative costs of each type of agent.

The fitness costs associated with a selective agent are identified as follows. First, the fitness cost of the selective agent is determined by the existence of a limited number of viable alleles (i.e., virulence cost) of the agent. Second, the fitness costs associated with a selective agent are determined by the degree to which the agent can survive in the limiting environment (i.e., host immune response cost) and the host resistance cost (i.e., susceptibility cost) of the agent. Third, the fitness costs associated with a selective agent are determined by the outcome of the selection process. For example, the fitness costs associated with an agent that is killed by the death of its non-competent host are shown in Figure 1 (UDP). The fitness costs for an agent that is killed by a non-competeable non-competeable non-host (non-host) agent are illustrated in Figure 2 (E)-E. First, the fitness costs associated with an agent that is killed by the non-competeable non-competeable non-host (non-host) agent are illustrated in Figure 2 (F). The fitness costs for a non-competeable non-competeable non-host (non-host) agent that is not-host are illustrated in Figure 3 (F.1). The fitness costs for a non-competeable non-competeable non-host (non-host) agent that is not-host are illustrated in Figure 4 (E.1).


## Methods
solani oryzae foci into environmental and pathogens, we generated a series of bacteria and fungi sub-cultures, which were grown in D-M-FOA medium (BD Bioscience) in Petri dishes (160 mm by 5 mm and 150 mL. One hundred microliters of D-M-FOA were added to the dishes to give a final density of 5,000 colony-forming units (CFU/mL). The D-M-FOA culture was then inoculated into each dish. At the end of each incubation, the plate was covered with a plastic cover slip and incubated at 37°C in a rotary shaker for 24 h. Fungal growth in the cover slip was observed and recorded.

To quantify the effects of the R. solani oryzae foci on microbial growth in the presence of H_2O_2, we inoculated 500 µL of H_2O_2 broth (BD Bioscience) with 1,000 µL of R. solani oryzae foci (Sigma-Aldrich). We used a sterile pipette to close the cover slip, remove the filamentous fungi, and then added the bacterial culture. After the fungal growth was completely removed from the cover slip, we observed that the fungal growth in the D-M-FOA broth was slightly modified by H_2O_2. For the D-M-FOA culture, we added 200 µL of H_2O_2 broth and the culture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After the fungal growth was completely removed from the cover slip, we observed that the fungal growth in the D-M-FOA broth was slightly modified by H_2O_2.

## Results
We first compared the relative contributions of the dimorphic fungal populations in terms of their relative contributions to the emergence of species in the field and in other habitat. We first compared the relative contributions of dimorphic fungal populations in terms of their relative contributions to the emergence of species in dimorphic fungi, and then used the same population-based approach to assess the influence of species on the development of dimorphic fungi. In the first step, we used population-based approaches to assess the impact of species on the evolution of species in dimorphic fungi.

## Discussion
As a result, we found that there was a significant increase in the number of fungal species in the two habitat. In addition, we also found that the number of fungal species in the field was significantly higher than that in the field at harvest time (P = 0.038). The overall number of species increased in the two habitats (P = 0.037) and the number of fungi decreased in the field (P = 0.038).

The pathogenic fungi were primarily distributed in the field, as previously reported by several studies (Alviano et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2017). We found that the number of species increased in the field, and the number of fungi decreased in the field. This result suggests that fungal diversity is changing in the field, which in turn may be due to the increase in the number of fungi. The results of the present study revealed that the number of fungal species in the field was significantly higher than that in the field at harvest time (P = 0.038). This indicates that the number of fungi increases in the field. The number of fungi in the field increased with harvest time. The results of the present study revealed that the number of fungal species in the field increased with harvest time.

The number of fungi decreased with harvest time and the number of fungi increased in the field. This indicates that fungal diversity in the field is significantly decreased. This indicated that the number of fungi in the field is significantly decreased.

The number of fungal species in the field decreased with harvest time and the number of fungi increased in the field. This indicates that the number of fungi in the field is significantly decreased.
