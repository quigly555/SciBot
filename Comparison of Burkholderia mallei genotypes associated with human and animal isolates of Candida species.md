## Abstract
The cell wall of Leishmania major (Lm) is a structure that is common to animals, plants, and fungi. It is comprised of many polysaccharides and has a number of unique features including its involvement in the interaction with macrophages. Leishmania has an unusual architecture in which the protein domains are usually joined to the cell walls by the molecular machinery controlling the binding of these two states. It is possible that the changes in the cell wall during the interaction of Leishmania with macrophages result in the changes in the host cell matrix and the failure of the parasite to adapt to the new environment.


## Introduction
Tick-borne diseases are caused by tick-borne viruses (HBVs) that transmit the tick-borne pathogen H3K9, the causative agent of tick-borne illness in humans and animals, to the global population (Morton and Staples, 2017). Several tick-borne viruses have been reported to cause human and animal infections ranging from mild skin and nail infections to severe, disseminated tick-borne infections such as bovine mastitis, boviera-dermatitis, and tick-scrubbingitis, to severe acute and chronic disease manifestations in immunocompromised individuals (Martín et al., 2013; de Paula et al., 2015; de Paula et al., 2018). The most commonly reported tick-borne viruses include Borrelia burgdorferi, Rickettsia monophagus, and Staphylococcus aureus (Puente et al., 2013; de Paula et al., 2015; de Paula et al., 2018).

It is well known that the innate immune system is composed of many specialized cells. The innate immune system is composed of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), which includes the activation of innate immunity and the cell-mediated defense (Nurada et al., 2016; Blanco-Ceradez et al., 2016). In order to detect and respond to the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens, the various pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues are necessary and in the pathogenesis of tick-borne infections (Martín et al., 2013).

The innate immune system is essential for the control and eradication of infectious diseases.


## Methods
Sample collection and cultivation
The isolates were obtained from the culture collection of the Mycology Laboratory at the Department of Clinical Laboratory of the University Hospitaliers-Perth, and were identified as the isolates C. albicans ATCC 18804 and C. tropicalis ATCC MYA-8726 using standard methods. The isolates were maintained in 1 L of distilled water at -20 °C.

The isolation of bacteria was performed as previously described [7]. Briefly, a suspension of each strain was inoculated on the surface of 1 L of PDA medium at the rate of 50 L/min in a Petri dish. The liquid was shaken at 200 rpm for 48 h, and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with distilled water and centrifuged again. The pellet was washed with distilled water and dried over night. The pellet was then dissolved in 2 L of distilled water, and then it was kept at -20 °C.

The mycobacterial identification was carried out by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products and the sequencing reactions.


## Results
mallei is a clinical isolate of . albicans (Figure 1). Its phylogenetic relationships with the other C. albicans species (Table 2) are well-supported (96% BP, 95% MLBP, and 99% MLBP), but their phenotypic differences and the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates are often ambiguous (Table 2). This is due to the limited number of isolates of the C. albicans subclade and the uncertain phylogenetic position of the Candida species in the tree. The two Candida species of the Candida clade are closely related, but with low BP and MLBP (97% MLBP and 97% MLBP, respectively).

Candida albicans differs from C. neoformans in its virulence profile and in the number of isolates from animal and human hosts (Figure 2). Candida albicans isolates from animal hosts are highly virulent (81%) and are susceptible to antifungal agents (Table 2). Both clinical and environmental isolates are also avirulent in humans, as shown by the ability of these isolates to cause fatal or even lethal candidiasis in patients with candidemia (Table 2). These data are consistent with the results of a recent study of a cohort of C. albicans isolates of clinical isolates of C. neoformans (Naseer et al., 2015). We also observed that C. neoformans isolates from animal hosts are avirulent, with high virulence for Candida albicans isolates in humans and a reduced host range (Table 2).

B. mallei isolates are avirulent in humans
The avirulent Candida species of the C. albicans subclade are avirulent in humans, which is consistent with the results of a previous study of a cohort of human isolates of Candida albicans (Naseer et al., 2015). For example, the avirulent Candida albicans isolates from humans have higher survival rates than the avirulent Candida albicans isolates from the C. albicans subclade (Table 2). The avirulent Candida albicans isolates from animals are avirulent, with a reduced host range (Table 2).

## Discussion
This study found that the majority of patients with solid organ transplantation (SOT) had minimal or no presence of CMV. Patients with severe CMV-related disease had higher levels of CMV RNA, the highest in the bloodstream. In our previous study on CMV reactivation in SOT, only seven patients were diagnosed with CMV, and three of them had CMV-related disease. In our previous study, only three patients had CMV and none had CMV-related disease. Therefore, CMV-related CMV-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CMV-related SOT. This study also found that SOT had lower levels of CMV RNA and higher viral load.

In addition, the CMV-related CMV-related disease was confirmed in four of the seven patients who had no CMV-related disease. The risk factors for CMV-related CMV-related disease were not specified in the previous study, but CMV-related CMV-related disease was identified in seven patients. This study also confirmed CMV-related CMV-related disease in three patients.
