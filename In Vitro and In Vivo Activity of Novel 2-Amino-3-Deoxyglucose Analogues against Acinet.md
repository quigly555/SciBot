## Abstract
Trichosporon asahii is a genus of a new genus of Aspergillus (T. asahii). The genus T. asahii has an overwhelming influence on the Botryosphaeriaceae, and several species are being used as starters for future research. Although the exact taxonomic placement of T. asahii is still ambiguous, the generic concept of T. asahii has been settled by two species, T. uniginosa and T. flavus, which is the first study to show that both species are basal relatives of T. asahii. Currently, the genus T. asahii consists of T. asahii and T. flavus and has a strong support in the Chinese traditional system. In addition, it was established in 2011 that T. uniginosa, T. asahii, and T. flavus can be classified as independent genera. In the present study, we investigated T. asahii in China for evidence of hybrid predation by two species occurring in the same host. We found that the morphology and ecology of T. asahii and T. flavus in host plants is similar to that of T. asahii. The results also showed that the opportunistic fungi of T.


## Introduction
The genus Mycosphaerella (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) is a diverse and polyphyletic collection of organisms (Kirk et al. 2009) that is distributed in the tropics, subtropics, and temperate regions, and causes more than a million human and animal diseases (Dean et al. 2011). Mycosphaerella graminicola, also known as black rot, is an ascomycete that causes hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year (Muller and Wynn 2017). The fungus is a worldwide problem, and the discovery of new species and their new morphs has been recently increasing (Dean et al. 2017).


## Methods
in Vitro

The ergosterol analogue, ergosterol 2-a, is a widely used analogue in veterinary medicin. It is also used for the evaluation of toxic effects of topical regimens. It has been used in vitro as a broad-spectrum fungicide in several animal models [37]. In vitro activity was analyzed using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The ergosterol 2-a was added to a volume of 0.4 mL in a 50 mL of sterile saline solution. The volume was further diluted in a 15 mL of sterile saline solution and then added to the solution to obtain a final concentration of 1 mL/mL. After mixing for 30 s, the amount of ergosterol 2-a was measured at 520 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Antifungal Activity
A. fumigatus strain Af293 (strain AF293) was used as the recipient strain in this study. The A. fumigatus isolate Af293 was cultured at 35°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C. The cells were cultured on a rotary shaker at 37°C. The media was changed every 3 days to 7 days to promote the growth of A. fumigatus.

For the antifungal activities of ergosterol 2-a, a strain of A. fumigatus was cultivated in liquid medium in a shaker at 37°C for 7 days. The fungal cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with sterile saline and lyophilized. The dry biomass was re-suspended in 1.0 mL of 0.8 mL of sterile saline. The lyophilized fungal biomass was divided into three parts (1-2 mL): the first part was used for antifungal activity and the second one was used for the calculation of the fungal counts. The first part was used for antifungal activity and the second one was used for the calculation of the fungal counts. The fungal counts were divided into three parts (0-5 mg/mL). The first part was used for antifungal activity and the second one was used for the calculation of the fungal counts.


## Results
and 4-acetylglucose of Acinetobacter lusitaniae, and tested for antifungal activity against the three clinically important Aspergillus species (Candida sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans) (Materials and methods). Acinetobacter spp. and Acinetobacter lusitaniae were highly susceptible to 2-acetylglucose analogues, with MIC values ranging from 0.09 to 1.25 µg/mL for 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose analogues, and 0.2 to 1.5 µg/mL for 3-acetylglucose analogues (Table 1). In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of Novel 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose Analogues against Acinetobacter spp.
The antifungal activity of novel 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose analogues against Acinetobacter spp. was evaluated using a colorimetric assay. Acinetobacter spp. showed an MIC of 0.1 µg/mL for the novel 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose analogues against Acinetobacter spp., while 0.1 µg/mL for the novel 3-deoxyglucose analogues. The same result was observed for the novel 4-deoxyglucose analogues (Table 1). However, the activity of the novel 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose analogues was much lower than the activity of the novel 3-deoxyglucose analogues (Table 1). These results indicate that the novel 2-Amino-3-deoxyglucose analogues, which are able to bind to 2-acetylglucose analogues, possess antifungal activity against Acinetobacter spp.

The activity of 1,2-a-mono-ß-D-glucopyranosidase against Acinetobacter fowleri was evaluated in the following conditions:

(i) The concentration of the 2-chlorophenyl derivative 1,2-a-mono-ß-D-glucopyranosidase was 2.8 µg/mL, and the 2-aminothiophenyl derivative 1,2-a-mono-ß-D-glucopyranosidase was 2.4 µg/mL.
