## Abstract
Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic human pathogen causing severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, including AIDS patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii is classified as a non-infectious fungal infection. However, its clinical, immunological and immunological prognostic characteristics are reported to be similar or superior to other systemic mycoses.

To determine the clinical, immunological and in vivo immunomodulatory characteristics of 41 P. jirovecii clinical isolates, we generated a lung epithelial vector with multiple epithelial cells (39%), followed by a culture of P. jirovecii in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cultivated in a fetal lung (HAL) stage. All P. jirovecii strains, except one from one isolate, were found to produce a T-helperblum contagio-like phenotype in the HLA-B (C-section). There were no differences in the in vitro antifungal susceptibility between the two groups.

We show that P. jirovecii strains produced a T-helperblum-like phenotype in the BALF and in the HLA-B groups, but they were different in the production of antibodies and antigen. The anti-Pneumocystis jirovecii strains from the HLA-B group were highly resistant to inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or to several cytochrome P450 inhibitors, as well as to the protease inhibitors corticosterol and hygromycin. They were also highly susceptible to the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule, which was highly abundant in the lungs of infected mice, and to several antifungal drugs, including those from Rituximab and Zopf, and to phencycline, cyclophosphamide, clopidopterin and cyclophosphamide 25,25-diphenyl-tryptophan (CDPP).

The identification of the 41 clinical and 41 environmental isolates of P.


## Introduction
The genus Conchoglossum (Hib.) P.C.A.J. Keller (Polyporales) is a highly morphologically diverse and morphologically diverse group of saprobic fungi that mainly reside in tropical and subtropical rain forests of the South American continent and in the Atlantic Ocean [1,2]. Conchoglossum is an important species in this genus because of its ability to grow on dead branches of several gymnosperms, including cockroaches, gymnosperms of the order Pinaceae, and gymnosperms of the family Myrtaceae [3,4,5].

The species in this genus are considered as important members of the myrtaceae because of their ability to grow on dead and decaying material of gymnosperms, including cockroaches [6]. In addition to the presence of conidia, they can also form appressoria, where small aggregations of conidia form basidia and, as a consequence, basidiospores [7].

The species in this genus are characterised by their enormous sizes, which are approximately 10-12 µm in diameter, ranging from an average of about 10 µm in diameter in some species, to larger ones (around 10 µm) [8].


## Methods

In-silico fractionation of PkaU7 and its pyrolysis was performed in a laminar flow system, with an initial step of 5 min at 70% of saturatio. The monomer was purified with a commercial HPLC grade elution column (Nexabeads 3.0 mL, 100% ACN, 30 µL/min) (Merck, Germany) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The elution was carried out in a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The fractions were collected and concentrated by evaporation and concentrated by evaporation. The concentrate was used as a solvent system in the mass spectrometer (Nexabeads, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) to obtain the N-hexane fraction (0.5%). The mass spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu LCQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) operated in the mode of mass/charge ratio (M/M) mode. The interface was solid-state (2% MeOH, 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetic acid, pH 7.0) with a capillary column of 0.25 µm (Silent-Sep TCEP-3A, 100 × 4.6 mm) and a refractive index detector (Silent-Sep TCEP-2A, 200 × 2.5 mm) (Nippon, Tokyo, Japan). The data were acquired using the quadrupole mode with an injection time of 1 min at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. The samples were stored at -20 °C.

Determination of pKaH
The pKaH (pKa) of P. indicum isolates was determined by using the method of Zhang et al. [8] with slight modifications. The P. indicum isolates (S. cerevisiae strain L. mili) were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 28 °C.


## Results
 2012. The PkaU7 gene in the Pterocarya gemini genome contains the putative PkaU7 gene sequence with a predicted cDNA fragment of approximately 1,200 bp and an N50 of approximately 1000 bp, as well as the putative PkaU7 gene sequence with a predicted cDNA fragment of approximately 1,200 bp and an N50 of approximately 500 bp (Tse et al., 2012). In addition, a PkaU7 gene from the Pterocarya gemini genome (Tse et al., 2012) was also constructed using the same strategy. The PkaU7 gene was then assembled using the homologous recombination approach. The PkaU7 gene was expressed from the pkaU7 gene in the Pterocarya gemini genome using the pkaU7 gene as the template and the PkaU7 gene was expressed using the homologous recombination approach (Figure 1B). The PkaU7 gene was then expressed using the homologous recombination approach and the PkaU7 gene was expressed using the homologous recombination approach.

A total of 11 and 10 PkaU7 gene genes in the Pterocarya gemini genome were predicted using the MEGAN pipeline, respectively. The PkaU7 gene in the Pterocarya gemini genome had a predicted cDNA fragment of approximately 1,200 bp and an N50 of approximately 800 bp (Tse et al., 2012), which indicates that the PkaU7 gene in the Pterocarya gemini genome is likely to be PkaU7. The PkaU7 gene in the Pterocarya gemini genome contained the putative PkaU7 gene sequence with a predicted cDNA fragment of approximately 1,200 bp and an N50 of approximately 1,100 bp, as well as the PkaU7 gene sequence with a predicted cDNA fragment of approximately 1,200 bp and an N50 of approximately 500 bp (Figure 1C).
