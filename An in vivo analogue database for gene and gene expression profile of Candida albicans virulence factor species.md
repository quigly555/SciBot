## Abstract
Tuberculosis is a common and deadly disease in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults. The two major drugs of therapy for tuberculosis are chemotherapy and induction therapy. Most antifungal drugs used to treat tuberculosis are cytotoxic or fungicidal, and there is insufficient emphasis on the treatment of it. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed us to significantly improve survival in the first years of treatment. However, there is a paucity of evidence that this therapy is effective. This review focuses on the role of the central nervous system (CNS) in host defense against mycobacterial infection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults.


## Introduction
Several studies have shown that . albicans is able to rapidly internalize extracellular matrix (ECM) by a process termed biotrophic growth [7,8]. In fact, C. albicans can utilize ECM as a vehicle to grow and survive in vivo in a variety of environments including a broad range of warm and cold environments, in addition to the clinical environment [9].

C. albicans is a commensal yeast, found in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, colon, skin, respiratory tract and vagina. In the context of oral health, C. albicans can cause infection in healthy individuals and in immunocompromised individuals [9]. The ability of C. albicans to form biofilms is largely influenced by the presence of macrophages and neutrophils [10,11]. In fact, C. albicans biofilms can be found in the environment as well as in individuals with low immune status [12]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive C. albicans biofilm formation and the properties that promote biofilm formation.

Macrophages are key players in the innate immune system of the host. The main role of macrophages is to control inflammation and tissue damage in the joints and wounds of the body. Macrophages play an important role in the early stages of host defense and tissue invasion by the immune system [13]. Macrophages are classified into three groups based on their size and tissue: M1, which primarily resides in the bone marrow, and M2, which primarily activates macrophages and other inflammatory cells [14]. M1 and M2 macrophages are classified according to their activity level, which is dependent on the cytokine milieu and tissue tropism of the host. In contrast, M3 macrophages are classified based on their activity level, which is dependent on the cytokine milieu of the host. M1 and M2 macrophages are activated when stimulated by their type-2 cytokines, IFN-<U+03B3>, or their cytokine, IL-12. M1 macrophages are the most active macrophages, as they are activated by the IL-12 receptor and can be activated by IL-10, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 [15].


## Methods
andidagenom.org/). We used the database to assess for changes in gene expression patterns between the strains tested in the in vivo assay and we used the gene expression profiles for all strains available from the Candida Research website (https://candidagenome.org/).

Virulence assay
The in vivo assay was performed in accordance with the standard laboratory methods [21]. In brief, ten mice (20 males and 20 females) were randomly divided into four groups, and their weight (kcal) was recorded in triplicate. Mice were then weighed and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg body weight) as described previously [22]. Mice were intranasally infected with 10^5 conidia of each strain (0.5 × 10^4 conidia/ml) and were monitored twice a day for the first 24 h and then for 24 h for the last one. For the in vivo assay, six mice (20 males and 20 females) were randomly divided into four groups, and the dose of ketamine and xylazine was recorded. Mice were monitored and sacrificed if they displayed symptoms consistent with meningitis, at which time they were humanely euthanized.

Cryptococcal infection
Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were infected with 5 × 10^6 conidia of each strain. Mice were monitored twice a day and death was confirmed if they displayed signs of fungal infection or were moribund. The animals were weighed and humanely euthanized. For the in vivo assay, six mice (20 males and 20 females) were randomly divided into four groups, and the dose of ketamine and xylazine was recorded. Mice were monitored and sacrificed if they displayed signs of fungal infection or were moribund.

Ethics statement
The animal studies conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act and the Animal Welfare Act, and the study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (UCLA-PI-Protocol #1973).

Animal experimental design
The in vivo assay was performed in accordance with the standard laboratory methods [23].


## Results

The human . albicans gene expression profile is very well described by other authors [23, 26]. It has been shown that the human genes have the ability to modulate the expression of virulence factors in C. albicans [27, 28]. Furthermore, the C. albicans C. albicans gene expression profile is well documented in other organisms [29]. These authors have investigated the functional significance of the C. albicans gene expression profile by analyzing gene expression profiling in different conditions in the presence and absence of various concentrations of FK506. The current C. albicans gene expression profiling results show that the C. albicans gene expression profile of FK506 is stable after treatment with FK506 for 4 h (Fig 2). After treatment with FK506 for 4 h, the C. albicans gene expression profile was restored to the wild-type level (Fig 2). In contrast, the C. albicans gene expression profile of FK506 was only stable after treatment with FK506 for 24 h (Fig 2).

FK506 regulates C. albicans immune response by directly activating C. albicans virulence factors
To determine if FK506 is able to influence C. albicans immune response in vivo, we studied the expression of several C. albicans virulence factor species, including C. albicans virulence factors, in the murine model of systemic candidiasis. The C. albicans C. albicans virulence factors were identified as C. albicans Cps (Table 1), Cps4 (Table 2), Cps3 (Table 3), Cps5 (Table 4), and Cps6 (Table 5). The Cps4 (Table 1) and Cps5 (Table 2) Cps genes were found to be significantly upregulated after treatment with FK506 (Fig 3). The Cps4 (Table 1) and Cps5 (Table 2) Cps genes were found to be significantly upregulated after treatment with FK506 (Fig 3). Cps3 and Cps6 genes were found to be significantly upregulated after treatment with FK506 (Fig 3).

These results show that FK506 directly regulates C.


## Discussion
A novel assay for the selection of gene and gene expression profile of . albicans mutant was developed [26]. In this study, we showed that the combination of a single drug and C. albicans strain A, which have a similar morphology, could be used for the optimization of the gene expression profile of C. albicans.

We showed that combining a single drug and C. albicans strain A with a combination of a single drug could improve the pathogenicity of C. albicans strains A1, A2, and A3. The combination of a single drug and C. albicans strain A could also be used to improve the pathogenicity of C. albicans. This approach could improve the number of pathogenic C. albicans strains by using a combination of a single drug and a combination of a single drug. The combination of a single drug and C. albicans strain A would be advantageous for the control of C. albicans infection.
