## Abstract

Based on the results of the study, the current study provided evidence that the inhibitor FK506 significantly increased the activity of Fusarium verticillioides, as determined by its in vitro and in vivo activit. The in vitro activity of FK506 against three human cancer cell lines, including HeLa, HeLa- and Ire1- cells, including HeLa cells, HeLa-ß cells, and lung cancer cell lines was significantly higher than that of the FK506 inhibitor caspofungin (4.5 to 7.8 µg/ml) alone or in combination with caspofungin (2.8 to 9.5 µg/ml) and in combination with amphotericin (8.8 to 32.4 µg/ml) alone or in combination with caspofungin (2.8 to 10.2 µg/ml) and caspofungin (2.1 to 3.7 µg/ml) and amphotericin (6.1 to 12.2 µg/ml) alone or in combination with caspofungin (1.8 to 3.1 µg/ml) and caspofungin (1.8 to 2.9 µg/ml) and caspofungin (0.9 to 1.4 µg/ml) in vitro and in vivo, and the in vivo results were comparable to the in vitro results of the two in vitro antifungal agents. The in vivo results were comparable to the hemolytic activity of amphotericin (8 µg/ml) alone or in combination with caspofungin (1.8 to 3.1 µg/ml) and caspofungin (0.9 to 1.4 µg/ml) and caspofungin (0.9 to 1.1 µg/ml) in vitro and in vivo.

The study showed that the combination of FK506 and caspofungin with caspofungerosal antifungal agents, especially amphotericin and fluconazole, was a viable strategy to treat meningitis. In addition, fluconazole and voriconazole were found to have synergistic effects against F. verticillioides, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values of 8 and 16 µg/ml against F. golletii, F.


## Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is a primary component of the fungal respiratory chain and is widely used as an antimicrobial and an antioxidant. In vitro studies have shown that NO scavenges the initial oxidative burst of phagocytes and inhibits the proliferation of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. NO induces a catalase-dependent cytokine response, chemokine (CXCL1) and chemokine (CXCL2) production, and NO acts as a proinflammatory mediator. A significant increase in the expression of NO-susceptible and -secreting cells has been observed in response to the treatment with NO. In this study, we provide evidence that NO is an independent mediator of NO-susceptible and -secreting cells in response to NO challenge.


## Methods
The first inhibitor is a combination of both fluconazole and CAS, and the second inhibitor is a combination of both FLC and CA. The first inhibitor was developed by the formation of p-nitro-5-carboxylic acid, which has been shown to be a good candidate for biofilm reduction by P. trichoderma [28]. The second inhibitor is a non-toxic compound, which can be used for the biofilm reduction. It was selected for its demonstrated biofilm reduction ability [18], and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of C. albicans biofilm formation [29].

The methodology was developed to determine the specificity of the inhibitors to the study. In brief, the methods described above were applied to determine the drug concentrations that were necessary to kill the cells and the concentration groups that would inhibit the biofilm reduction. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The drug concentrations that were considered as the negative control were not included in the analysis. The antifungal activity of the drugs was calculated by the average effective concentration of the inhibitor in comparison to the antifungal control.

To identify the compounds that were likely to inhibit biofilm reduction, the method was adapted to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI) M27-A3 method [30]. The standardized MICs were determined using microtiter wells for biofilm reduction (NCCLSM27-A3, reference document number: M27-A3). The MICs were defined as the lowest concentration that was able to inhibit biofilm formation.

Antifungal Activity of L-Lysosylcysteine (L-Lysosylcysteine)
The method to determine the antifungal activity of L-Lysosylcysteine was adopted by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CCLSI) M27-A3 [31]. The standard (Phenol Blue) and the extract were prepared by mixing 1 mL of the preparation with a sterile 0.85% Tween 20, and then adding a drop of sterilized distilled water (50 mg/mL).


## Results
Antifungal activities of the selected MDR strains were compared against the strains of the three . gondii clinical isolates. The MIC_50 of amphotericin B in the MDR strains of T. gondii was >100 µg/ml, while in the non-T. gondii isolates, it was >1 µg/ml.

For the non-T. gondii isolates, the MIC_50 was >100 µg/ml. MIC_50 values were compared against the clinical isolates of T. gondii in both the reference strain T. gondii ATCC 10184 (which was isolated from an environmental sample) and the T. gondii clinical isolate ATCC 627B (which was isolated from an environmental sample) by means of the modified Sanger kit for the FungiScan® Analysis. The results of this analysis are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

The results of this analysis showed that amphotericin B was active against the selected T. gondii clinical isolates in both the reference strain T. gondii ATCC 10184 and the T. gondii clinical isolate ATCC 627B. The susceptibility of the selected T. gondii isolates to amphotericin B was then tested against the clinical isolates of the non-T. gondii isolates of T. gondii. The results of this analysis showed that amphotericin B was active against the selected T. gondii isolates in both the reference strain T. gondii ATCC 10184 and the T. gondii clinical isolate ATCC 627B.

The MIC_50 of amphotericin B in the T. gondii isolates of the three T. gondii clinical isolates was lower than the MIC_50 of amphotericin B in the non-T. gondii isolates, which could be explained by the higher MIC_50 values for the non-T. gondii isolates than the T. gondii clinical isolates.

MDR Strains Were Associated with a Higher Risk of Fungal Infection
In order to understand the fungal pathogenicity of the selected T. gondii clinical isolates, the in vitro susceptibility of the T.


## Discussion
fumigatus, their use is limited by their toxicity and safety concerns [45. To assess the antifungal activity of Fusarium antifungal agents, two strains of A. fumigatus (A. fumigatus strain H99) were screened for their antifungal activity against A. fumigatus. Antifungal activity against A. fumigatus was measured using the G. mellonella larvacean larvae (ATCC 7028), which is a non-pathogenic, invasive, and fast-growing model of infection in the giardiasis-endemic area [46]. The larvae of the larval model were inoculated with fungi that were commonly found in the insect guts, such as C. neoformans, Aspergillus spp., and Aspergillus flavus. The larvae were inoculated with Fusarium spp. and were exposed to various concentrations of Fusarium spp. It was observed that the larvae of the larval model were highly susceptible to Fusarium spp. and Fusarium spp. was the most active agent. The larvae of the larval model, which was immunocompromised, were exposed to varying concentrations of Fusarium spp., Aspergillus spp., and Candida spp. It was observed that the larvae of the larval model showed decreased susceptibility to Fusarium spp. and Candida spp. It was reported that exposure of A. fumigatus to different concentrations of Fusarium spp. resulted in reduced larval survival and larval size [47]. Therefore, we were interested in further study of antifungal activity of Fusarium spp. against A. fumigatus. Fusarium spp. has been used for in vitro antifungal drug development and was used to inhibit the growth of A. fumigatus [48]. In this study, Fusarium spp. was tested for its antifungal activity against A. fumigatus. The antifungal activity of Fusarium spp. against A. fumigatus was assessed by using immunofluorescence. It was found that the antifungal activity of Fusarium spp. against A. fumigatus was higher than that of the other fungi.
