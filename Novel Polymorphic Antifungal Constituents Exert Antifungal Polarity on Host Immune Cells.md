## Abstract
Members of the C4b family, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Aspergillus fumigatus, have extraordinary plasticity in response to environmental changes. The extracellular proteome of Drosophila melanogaster is comprised primarily of secreted proteins and is thus an excellent model for studying fungal adaptation to environmental changes. Many of these proteins have been found to be involved in cell wall composition, growth, nutrient uptake, and virulence factors. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of two proteins secreted by D. melanogaster on the cell wall composition and composition of the epidermis and cell wall polysaccharide (EC) layers of the epidermis. We found that the secreted chitin and anilines were found to be preferentially localized in the EC and that the polysaccharides of the epidermis were preferentially localized in the epidermis of the A. fumigatus epidermis. Moreover, the chitin composition of the epidermis was changed depending on the environmental conditions. The A. fumigatus secretome included chitin de novo, chitosan, and chitosan oligosaccharides which were enriched in more highly expressed chitinase and de novo synthase-derived chitosan. We found that the A. melanogaster secreted chitin is preferentially localized in the EC and this was preferentially in A. fumigatus epidermis. Furthermore, the A. melanogaster secretome comprised chitosan oligosaccharides enriched in more highly expressed chitosan. The ability of D. melanogaster to grow as yeast in vitro was demonstrated by growth defects caused by chitosan deficiency, as well as by the high expression of the secreted proteins in the A. fumigatus secretome. These data indicate that A. fumigatus secreted chitosan has a wide range of biological activities, including growth at high temperature and in yeast. The data presented here provide evidence that A. melanogaster shares this epidermis secreted protein environment with A. fumigatus, with the latter being an excellent model for studying fungal adaptation to environmental changes.


## Introduction
The genus of Microbotryum, encompassing 15 species, was recently revised [1]. The genus has six orders: Phyllosticta, Microbotrya, Phyllosticta, Pseudophlya and Pseudodidymiopsis. Microbotryum species are known from pine, hardwood, hardwood, rangel, cassava, cassava, sugarcane, wheat, table olives, wheat straw, tobacco, tobacco cones, tobacco, cassava, sugarcane, cassava oil, tobacco, cassava, sugarcane, cassava, tobacco, tobacco molasses and cassava, cassava, tobacco and cassava oil, etc.

The genus Microbotryum was divided into two sections-the sclerotia and non-sclerotia. The sclerotia are woody, branched, brown, thin-walled, smooth-walled, and acervuli are usually globose.


## Methods
(2006. Briefly, the test organism was selected based on its morphology, its antimicrobial properties, and on the structure of the fungal cell walls. The test organism was then divided into four groups: non-infected, infected, non-internalized, and internalized. The test organism was then divided into five groups: non-infected, infected, internalized, and internalized. All the assays were performed in triplicate. The test results were recorded as the mean ± SD.

Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibits fungal growth and/or the growth inhibiting effect of the test agent. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibits fungal growth by 50% compared to the growth inhibiting effect of the test agent. The lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibited the growth of the test agent compared to the growth inhibiting effect of the test agent was defined as the MIC value. The test agent with the lowest concentration of the test agent was considered as the MIC value.

Determination of the Minimum Antimalarial Concentration (MIC)
The MIC of the test agent was determined by using the broth microdilution method as described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008). Briefly, the test agent was diluted in sterile distilled water to an initial concentration of 0.01% and the dilutions were made to obtain concentrations of 0.01-64 µg/mL. After serial dilutions of the test agent, the final concentrations of the test agent were 50-0.01% and 0.01-64 µg/mL, respectively. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test agent that inhibited fungal growth by 50% compared to the growth inhibiting effect of the test agent. The test agent with the lowest concentration of the test agent was considered as the MIC value. The test agent with the lowest concentration of the test agent was considered as the MIC value.

Determination of Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC)
The MFC of the test agent was determined by using the broth microdilution method as described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008).


## Results
Aneuploidy of this set of genes was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S1. When the polysaccharide drug AMB was used in combination with AMB, a combination of azole and AMB resulted in a higher accumulation of polysaccharide drug-resistant strains. In addition, the polysaccharide drug AMB (g_1) exhibited a protective effect against AMB-resistant AMA (Figure 1) and AMB (g_2) AMA strains, and AMB and AMB + AMB (g_2) strains had increased resistance to AMB + AMB. This was consistent with the high cell wall polysaccharide levels in these strains (Figure 1).

Polysaccharide drug resistance is most prominent in the yeast phase. This is due to the importance of cell wall polysaccharide structures as well as the presence of the cell-surface surface polysaccharide capsule. The lack of protection from AMB, AMB + AMB (g_2), and AMB + AMB (g_1) AMA strains in the presence of AMB suggests that AMB is not an effective antifungal agent for AMA and AMB-resistant AMA strains [12,14]. However, there is a higher probability of resistance in AMA + AMB + AMB strains when compared with AMB + AMB (g_1) AMA strains (Figure 1). Therefore, the high concentration of polysaccharide drug resistance in AMB + AMB (g_2) AMA strains may be attributable to the lower concentrations of AMB + AMB (g_1) AMA strains. This observation is consistent with the fact that AMB is a well-established antifungal drug target of AMA and AMB [14,14].

Polysaccharide drug resistance in AMB + AMB (g_2) AMA strains is accompanied by an increased susceptibility to AMB and AMB + AMB (g_1) AMA strains (Figure 1). This suggests that AMB is an effective antifungal drug against AMA and AMB-resistant AMA strains.


## Discussion
neoformans have been studied for over a decade [6], [7. In the current study, we present the first case of C. neoformans meningitis due to the introduction of miconazole and fluconazole. We show that C. neoformans has a limited ability to use antifungal drugs, as well as a restricted ability to grow in culture media containing antifungal agents. While C. neoformans may require the use of other drugs to reduce the risk of infection, in a patient with immunodeficiency such as HIV or those who present with a history of immunodeficiency, C. neoformans has an increased sensitivity to antifungal drugs.

A previous study demonstrated that C. neoformans can grow on and release into the extracellular space within the lung [12]. C. neoformans is able to rapidly grow and undergo major cellular morphological changes including the formation of hyphae, conidiophores, and pseudohyphae, and to penetrate various host tissues. These morphological changes may trigger the production of melanin, a melanin pigment that is produced by many fungi and some bacteria [13]. Although this process occurs in most other fungal species, such as Candida albicans [14], Cryptococcus neoformans [15], and C. gattii [16], it is not always the case. In the present study, we have observed that C. neoformans can use and release into the extracellular space within the lung, and the hyphae and conidia were released into the extracellular space of the lung by a switch from a non-melanized state to an melanized state. We also observed that the morphological transition between the non-melanized and melanized states was limited to the lung. In addition, we observed that the fungus could grow on the infected lung and release into the extracellular space within the lung.

In conclusion, we observed that C. neoformans can release into the extracellular space within the lung and the release of melanin was limited to the lung. The release of melanin from the fungus occurred only after phagocytosis by macrophages, and the fungus may be able to grow in the extracellular space of the lung.
