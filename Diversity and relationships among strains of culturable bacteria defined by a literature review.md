## Abstract
Introduction. Aseptic meningitis is a severe complication in patients with nephrotic syndrome, presenting as hydrocephalus and meningeal signs. Aseptic meningitis is uncommon in adult patients, and it can present as rapidly and asymptomatic hydrocephalus in non-HIV patients. Case Presentation. Aseptic meningitis was originally reported as a complication in patients with idiopathic thrombosis who had septic shock. Aseptic meningitis is not uncommon in patients with idiopathic thrombosis. We describe a patient with aseptic meningitis who presented with acute onset of consciousness and severe headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple nuclei in the pons and in the dura mater. Brain biopsy revealed a pleocystis foci that was predominantly rhabdomyoid formation with multiple cells of filaments and thrombi. Infectious disease was suspected, and the patient received systemic corticosteroids and antifungal treatment. Ultimately, the patient was treated with a combination of intravenous amphotericin and oral itraconazole. Conclusion. Sepsis is uncommon in patients with idiopathic thrombosis and may be the initial symptom of septic shock. Diagnosis of this complication should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with aseptic meningitis.


## Introduction
The genus Saprolegnia consists of 10 species. Saprolegnia brasiliensis is the predominant causative agent of skin infections in Asia and Africa, especially in tropical and subtropical regions.1,2 There are approximately 5 000 recognized species of Saprolegnia.3,4,5 The pathogenicity of Saprolegnia species depends on multiple virulence traits.6 The most common among the Saprolegnia species is the production of melanized extracellular pigments, such as dark-coloured glands, sclerotia, phaeodes and chlamydospores.7 The polysaccharide capsule protects the fungus from the physical and/or chemical stresses, including UV-B and C radiations, temperature extremes, pH values, and temperature extremes.8,9 The ability to grow at body temperature is an important factor in the pathogenic ability of Saprolegnia.10

The first reported case of Saprolegnia infection was reported in 1943 by the Japanese surgeon Yoshimasa Sato. Yoshimasa's disease was confined to the lungs and he was seen to have severe pulmonary complications.11 The infection was only diagnosed as an acute pulmonary disease when he died in 1946. The disease has since been reported in 60 countries.12,13 The first clinical case of Saprolegnia infection was reported in the mid-1970s in a Japanese patient. In that case, the fungus was found to be non-responsive to pentavalent antimony.


## Methods
A literature review was undertaken to identify other potential sources of bacterial diversity in the metagenomic librarie.

Identification of potential sources of microbial diversity
Microbial diversity was identified using the ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene. The data set included ITS region of high bacterial diversity, sequencing and sequence analysis (ITS) sequences from several organisms such as the human genome, microorganisms and plant and plant and plant-like fungi from the New Zealand Botanical Garden, the Canadian Council on Botanical Research and the Canadian Society of Microbiology. Genomic DNA was used to confirm sequence similarities of the microbial communities using the GenBank nucleotide database, and the ITS sequences were then used to generate taxonomic novelties using the UNITE database.

To improve the identification of potential source of diversity and avoid false positives, all taxonomic novelties were compared using the Phyloseq web-based database. The results were then filtered using the following criteria: (i) the data set was not on the most abundant taxa and (ii) only a few taxonomic novelties were included.

Identification of potential source of diversity
The read pairs that were produced from the metagenomic libraries were then aligned to the sequence using MOTHUR software [23] and their taxonomic positions were then compared with the sequences from the metagenomic libraries.

Identification of potential source of diversity
A high abundance of ITS sequences from the metagenomic libraries was considered as the positive identification of the metagenomic library. A high abundance of ITS sequences from the metagenomic libraries was also considered as the negative identification of the metagenomic library.

Identification of potential source of diversity
In order to further expand the coverage of the metagenomic libraries, a high abundance of ITS sequences was considered as the negative identification of the metagenomic library. The high abundance of ITS sequences from the metagenomic libraries was also considered as the positive identification of the metagenomic library.

Identification of potential source of diversity
The first and last steps of the phyloseq method were used to identify potential contaminants. In the first step, the sequences were aligned and taxonomic positions of the phyloseq database were then compared with the sequences from the metagenomic libraries.

The first step of the phyloseq method was also applied to identify potential contaminating sequences, since the metagenomic libraries contained more than one sample per species.


## Results
The most frequent bacteria identified in the 4 clinical strains were: erythematous yeast (23 isolates), erythematous mold (11 isolates), erythematous yeast (10 isolates), and mycobacterial community (4 isolates.

We found that the presence of erythematous yeasts was consistently detected in the 4 strains, whereas the presence of mycobacterial communities was rare in the 3 strains (Figure 1). The most common fungal community was found in all 4 strains except for strains 4B and 4C (Figure 1). The most common phylum belonging to the Ascomycota (Figure 1) was the Basidiomycota (Figure 2).

The highest proportion of fungal OTUs were observed in the 3 strains, which were characterized as Basidiomycota (Figure 1), Glomeromycota (Figure 1), and Glomerotrophomonadaceae (Figure 1). The fungal community in the 4 strains was dominated by the Ascomycota (Figure 1). The Basidiomycota (Figure 1) and Glomeromycota (Figure 2) were characterized by the Ascomycota (Figure 1) and Glomerotrophomonadaceae (Figure 1).

The dominant OTU of the Ascomycota (20.8%) was a fungal OTU belonging to the Leotiomycetes (Figure 1), which was present in 3 strains and in all strains except for strains 4B and 4C. The Leotiomycetes (Figure 1) and the Leotiomycetes (Figure 2) were characterized by the Glomeromycota (Figure 1), while the Glomeromycota (Figure 2) was dominated by the Ascomycota (Figure 1).

The predominant fungal community was found in all strains except for strains 4B and 4C, which were characterized as Glomeromycota (Figure 1) and Glomerotrophices (Figure 1).

The most common bacterial phyla identified in the 4 strains were Ascomycota (20.5%), Basidiomycota (19.3%), and Ascomycota (17.3%) (Figure 1).


## Discussion
Nevertheless, this study revealed the genomes of eight bacterial genera of unusual phylotypes in seawater sample. These bacterial genera are known to have novel functions as bioactive agents and virulence factors [6,7,8,10,16,17,18].

The genus Pseudomonas is well-known for its ability to produce bioactive metabolites that can cause human disease [19]. The genus is also known to produce bioactive compounds [20]. This study identified this genus in a seawater sample and compared its bioactive compounds with those produced by Bacillus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. in the study conducted by Wigler et al. [20]. The authors found that the two genera were associated with two bioactive metabolites, namely pyrrolidine and pyrrolidine-3,4-di-dione. pyrrolidine (Pd) was reported to be the most potent bioactive compound in the study conducted by Læssøe et al. [21]. The bioactive compounds, pyrrolidine-3,4-di-dione and pyrrolidine-3,4-di-dione, were isolated from a marine sample of marine Pseudomonas sp. by Tisserant et al. [22].

The other Pseudomonas sp. species (Pd) were isolated from seawater samples of Pseudomonas tabescens by Læssøe et al. [21]. The study also identified the genus Pseudomonas as the most bioactive genus in the study conducted by Læssøe et al. [21]. Pseudomonas flavus was isolated from a marine sample of Pseudomonas flavus by Læssøe et al. [21]. This genus was reported to be the most effective bioactive compound produced by Pseudomonas flavus in the study conducted by Læssøe et al. [21].

C. brumptii was isolated from seawater samples of C. brumptii by Læssøe et al. [21]. The study also identified C. brumptii as the most bioactive genus in the study conducted by Læssøe et al. [21]. C. brumptii was reported to be the most effective bioactive compound produced by C.
