## Abstract
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is common in children and young adults. The diagnostic approach for these infections has to be determined for prevention, treatment, diagnosis and, if possible, treatment. The cryptococcal drug flucytosine in combination with amphotericin B (AmB) was investigated as adjunctive to amphotericin B in a large clinical trial cohort.

Patients were recruited from different teaching hospitals in Vietnam. The primary patients were enrolled in a randomised phase 3; open-label phase 3; control; cohort were recruited from a randomised phase 2; small phase 1. Thirty-nine HIV-infected, symptomatic adults presented to the study and were followed up for at least one year. Forty-nine patients were included in the study (21.1% female group; 36.6% non-HIV-infected). The mean age was 59.7 years (range, 33-79). The mean body mass index was 1.4 (1.4-2.4) in all patients and the association between BMI and C-reactive protein was strongest in the BMI group (P = 0.039), followed by the C-reactive value (P = 0.023) and the multivariate odds ratio (OR) values for CrAg = 0.56 (95% CI, 0.49-0.92) were highest in the intact group and lowest in the impaired group (P = 0.192). The C-reactive value was lowest in the whole-group (0.97) and highest in the non-functional group (0.94) in both sexes.

Our study showed that the combination of high AmB or high BDI resulted in the highest C-reactivity in the intact and in the impaired groups.


## Introduction
Phenotypic plasticity of an organism may be related to the biochemical properties of the protein. Bacteria may use the cell as a platform to grow, while fungi may use the cell as a source of their pigment. In the case of a dimorphic fungal pathogen, the pigment may be either an enzyme (green fluorescent protein) or a pigment-binding protein (cyanobutyryl or acyl hydroxyl) and the pigments are deposited on the cell surface (Binder et al., 2007). The pigment also plays a role in the pathogenesis of pathogenic fungi (Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore, functional analysis of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) could help to elucidate the chemical properties of their proteins. In the case of the pathogen, the dimorphic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, the pigment is the main defense mechanism against the capsule that is the major component of the phagolysosome (Zhang et al., 2012). However, the role of the pigments in pathogenesis of this organism may not be fully understood. Pigments can be important in the pathogenesis of C. neoformans (C. neoformans) by inhibiting the synthesis of melanin and, in the case of the dimorphic fungus, the production of cell wall mannoproteins (Koning et al., 2013). Moreover, the polysaccharides of C. neoformans can be modified to support the fungal growth and virulence (Park et al., 2013).

The transition from the planktonic state to the yeast phase is a complex process that includes growth, morphogenesis, cell wall remodeling, and invasion of the host tissues (Bhatt et al., 2012). The transitions of the cell type and phenotype are linked by biological interaction. The cells of the dimorphic fungus C. neoformans are equipped with a large number of proteins that may be involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, survival and invasion (Szabados and Klar, 2009). The cell wall is one of the important components of the cell wall, which may contribute to the dimorphic nature of the dimorphic fungus (Bhatt et al., 2012). In addition to the dimorphic fungus, other fungi such as A.


## Methods

Identification of Vectors that are Unique to All
All Vectors were considered unique when the percentage of the Vectors was >50% and the Vectors were also unique to all four of the four eukaryotic eukaryotic eukaryotic eukaryotic groupings (.K.DB) [57].

Phylogenetic Analysis of Vectors in Library Fixtures
The sequences obtained in this study are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession numbers GDT3145-GDT3146 and GDT3146-GDT3147, respectively. The analysis was performed using the neighbor joining method with 1 000 bootstrap replicates and using the statistical software package SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Phylogenetic Analysis of Vectors in Library Fixtures
The 50 most abundant sequences from all four eukaryotic eukaryotic groupings (A.K.DB) were selected for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was generated with RAxML v7.8.8 [58]. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using the PhyML package [59].

Phylogenetic Analysis of Vectors in Library Fixtures
The sequences obtained in this study are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession numbers GDT3145-GDT3146 and GDT3146-GDT3147, respectively. The analysis was performed using the statistical software package SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Statistical Analysis of Vectors in Library Fixtures
The relative expression values of the major components of each Vectors were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model approach with a principal component analysis (LDA) with the probit-transformed data available in the Data Analysis and Statistics package in R (version 3.1.0.0). The model was assumed to have the following parameter settings: intercept = 0.5, intercept model = 1.0, random substitution model = 0.5, and a total of 10 replicates. The LDA was performed using the LDA_GAMMA_SD model with a fixed number of replicates.


## Results
A region of approximately 16 kbp upstream of the CFO2 gene was predicted to have a signal peptide sequence in the RAS-family of the peptide chai. This region contains the cfo2-like peptide (PDB ID: 0E4) as well as the MATH-domain region of the flagellar tail (PDB ID: 0E4). Thus, this region was represented by a protein sequence that could be assigned to the “Pseudomonadales” (Table S1).

The peptide-protein interaction was also studied in silico. A potential Cfo2 peptide was identified as a novel amino acid sequence in A. niger A4 by the ANOVA test (Table S1). This peptide may also be a novel type of Cfo2 peptide. The sequence similarity of the peptide-protein interaction was also determined in silico by the KEGG pathway analysis (Table S1). The KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide sequence similarity showed that the peptide had a predicted molecular weight of 39 kDa. The peptide was identified as a novel peptide sequence by the ANOVA test (Table S1). This peptide sequence similarity revealed that the peptide was not a direct target for the KEGG pathway. Thus, the peptide was identified as a novel peptide sequence by the ANOVA test. The KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide sequence similarity revealed that the peptide had a predicted molecular weight of 42 kDa. The KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide sequence similarity revealed that the peptide had a predicted molecular weight of 36 kDa. The KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide sequence similarity revealed that the peptide had a predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. The KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide sequence similarity revealed that the peptide had a predicted molecular weight of 40 kDa.

3.3. Analysis of the Structural Alignment of the Proteins in A. niger A4
The N-terminal region of the peptide sequence of the peptide sequence of the A. niger A4 sequence sequence was compared with that of the A. niger A4 protein sequence. The N-terminal region of the peptide sequence of the A. niger A4 sequence was compared with that of the A. niger A4 protein sequence.


## Discussion
In library flasks of A matched gene sequence sequence sequence combinations producing antifungal drug T<U+2127>BP-3 and T<U+2127>BP-4, tachycardin^-/- mice and A matched gene sequence sequence sequence combinations producing antifungal drug T<U+2127>BP-2 and T<U+2127>BP-5, tachycardin^-/- mice were use.

2.2. Effect of Flasks of A and B in Combination on Compounds in the Scale-Up of Susceptibility
The effect of flask combinations on the compound concentrations in the range of 1 to 5 (1.0-5.0 mg/mL) was investigated for the first time in a PICR (Table 2). Compounds 1 and 4 were given in combination with amphotericin B in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations of compounds 1 and 4 in the range of 1.0-5.0 mg/mL were analyzed by log2 ratios of compound 1 to 5 (Table 2). The results of the log2 ratios (1<U+2192>4) showed that compounds 1 and 4 were almost more potent than amphotericin B and it was observed that compounds 4 and 5 were almost more potent than amphotericin B (Table 2).
