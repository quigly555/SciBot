## Abstract
Although Cryptococcus laurentii has been used as a model organism to study pathogenicity, there is a paucity of genomic information available for this yeast. Here, we assembled the C. laurentii large subunit (LSU) unicellular polyketide synthase (LSK) of C. deneoformans var. grubii, which encodes a polyketide with 70 amino acid residues, and the G-protein-coupled endoplasmic reticulum GPR/GRS pathway. In a mouse model of cryptococcosis, the LSUk was found to be weakly expressed with respect to ATPase activity, and to be significantly decreased in culture conditions.


## Introduction
In recent years, with the global population growing and the development of more advanced medical interventions, the incidence of fungal infections has been rising. For example, in 2012, the overall number of fungal infections in the Western world was estimated to be over 1,400, to be estimated at over 23,000 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs2618.htm; http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs2633.htm). The main fungal infections are those caused by Candida and Cryptococcus species. These yeasts have been well documented as opportunistic pathogens, being present in both clinical and environmental settings. However, the epidemiology of fungal infections in the clinical setting is very different. Candida albicans is reported to be the most common cause of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in the developed countries, and the most frequent cause in immunocompromised patients (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Although the prevalence of candidemia and mycosis has increased in the past two decades, the prevalence of candidemia and mycosis remains low, with Candida infections occurring in 6-14% of all patients (Sobel, 2012). In addition, the incidence of other fungal infections such as histoplasmosis and candidemia has decreased, and the number of invasive fungal infections has decreased. Therefore, the epidemiology of fungal infections in the clinical setting is not well understood. The recent WHO Expert Group on Candida and yeast infections recommends a two-stage approach: (i) early diagnosis, followed by management with empiric therapy, and (ii) aggressive antifungal therapy (Adrian et al., 2016). In this scenario, the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections can be delayed or delayed by several reasons.


## Methods

Construction of a deletion cassette in the . rubrum genome
Genomic DNA of T. rubrum strain H99 was extracted by using the DNA extraction kit (Roche) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The deletion cassette was then PCR-amplified by using primers: 5'-CCGGTCACGGCAGGAGC-3' and 5'-GCGATCTCGATCTCTTCTC-3' to replace the native allele of CcRNA gene with the URA5 locus of strain H99. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and ligated to the HindIII site of pIR1. The resulting plasmid pIR1-LH3 (Transgen) was transformed into E. coli strain TOP10A competent cells (Invitrogen) and selected on lysine-free NaCl minimal medium (0.3%) (Life Technologies). The plasmid was then transformed into the C. neoformans strain H99 strain by using the lithium-free lithium acetate method [26]. The plasmid was then transformed into the E. coli strain K-12 (Invitrogen) and selected on lysine-free NaCl minimal medium (0.3%) (Life Technologies). The plasmid was then transformed into the <U+0394>Trx<U+0394>J strain by using the lithium-free lithium acetate method [27]. Transformants were then screened by colony PCR and confirmed by diagnostic PCR using primers that yielded positive results by using qPCR.

## Results
Among the data, we identified allantoin and exenine as the most common exoproteases and their presence in all the pathogenic fungi we examine. A comparison of the genomes of the fungi examined in this study with other pathogenic fungi (Table 2) reveals a large number of genes that were significantly increased in exoproteases in the pathogenic fungi, whereas the transcript level of these genes was significantly decreased (Table 2). These genes include the extracellular membrane-anchoring RNA-binding protein (ECR-DPR), cytoplasmic protein (CYP) and endocytic protein (ECP), and the transporter-bacterium (TB-B). These genes are involved in many cellular processes, including the metabolism of amino acids, DNA and proteins, and the extracellular membrane-anchoring RNA-binding protein (ECR-DPR). We found that the number of genes encoding these enzymes increased in the pathogenic fungi. Among them, several genes related to the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and isoprenoids, including the endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (ECR-DPR) and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (ECR-DPR), the extracellular membrane-anchoring RNA-binding protein (ECR-DPR) and the extracellular membrane-anchoring protein (ECP) were significantly decreased in the pathogenic fungi. These genes include the extracellular membrane-anchoring RNA-binding protein (ECR-DPR) and the endocytic protein (ECP), and the extracellular membrane-anchoring RNA-binding protein (ECR-DPR). The genes encoding these enzymes also decreased in the pathogenic fungi, and we further detected the transcript level of these genes in the genomes of the pathogenic fungi, which were not different from the one in which we examined the exoproteomes of the pathogenic fungi.

A closer look at the changes in the transcript level of exoproteases in the pathogenic fungi revealed that they were all significantly decreased in the pathogenic fungi (Table 3).


## Discussion
Amino acids are molecules that are synthesized by all three major enzymes of the enzyme cascade, but not by the second enzyme, the third enzyme, or the membrane receptor, the first enzyme, or the second enzym. The three enzymes are involved in a broad range of biological processes, from immune response to pathogenesis.

The azole-resistant and azole-susceptible isolates of A. fumigatus were found to possess the production of several new molecules, including five new lanosterol metabolites, five new esterases, and three new alginate synthases, all of which are encoded by genes involved in the biosynthesis of new lanosterol derivatives, which are also encoded by genes involved in the biosynthesis of lanosterol derivatives. The production of the new esterases was also detected in both the A. fumigatus isolates, with the production of the new esterase, which has been described previously only as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of azole derivatives [47].

As expected, lanosterol metabolites were detected in the A. fumigatus isolates, and two esterases were detected in the A. fumigatus isolates. These two esterases are also found in the biosynthesis of lanosterol derivatives, and the biosynthesis of lanosterol derivatives is also regulated by the pathway that is activated by azole, but not azole-dependent pathways. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates were also found to possess the production of esterases, which is a well-established virulence trait of this fungus [49], suggesting that they may play a role in the azole-resistant A. fumigatus.

The biosynthesis of lanosterol derivatives is a well-established virulence trait of this fungus [50]. This is also the case for other members of the fungal kingdom, which also produce lanosterol derivatives. In A. fumigatus, lanosterol derivatives are produced as a by-product by lanosterol reductase [51], and lanosterol reductase is involved in the biosynthesis of lanosterol derivatives by degrading lanosterol.
