## Abstract
The genus Malassezia includes yeasts that are known to produce astaxanthin, a carotenoid with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The astaxanthin content of Malassezia furfur, for example, was found to be 1.7-fold lower than that of the common genera Carpinophyta and Paraphaeosphaeria, suggesting that the fungus possesses a great range of possible astaxanthin-producing fungi. However, the gene content of the recently sequenced genome of Malassezia melanogaster var. xiamenensis has not been characterized.

We report the complete genome of Malassezia melanogaster var. xiamenensis from the Institute of Genomic and Gene Reconciliations of America (IGRAGE) database. The 26.2-megabase (MGB) genome contains 17.6 Mb of repetitively duplicated DNA, 64.4% sequence identity and a similarity threshold of 97.8%. Compared to the genomes of the genera Carpinophyta and Paraphaeosphaeria, the Malassezia genomes are more diverse, with a total of 35 species encompassing 12 genera. Of the Malassezia species, 14 are also contained in Carpinophyta and are phylogenetically distant to other ascomycete fungi, including M. furfur, Malassezia globosa, Malassezia canadensis, Paraphaea crenata and Paraphaeosphaeria crenata. The overall content of the genome of Malassezia is 1.36-fold less repetitive than that of Carpinophyta. The genome similarity threshold of IGRAGE annotation identified the Malassezia genome as lacking several genes that might confer resistance to oxidative stress and could control the accumulation of astaxanthin.

## Introduction
Numerous reviews have recently been published on the use of plants as medicinal resources, especially in China. The search for new natural products is one of the most important goals of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry [1]. In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical compounds have been found to possess significant biological activities, including antimicrobial [2], anticoagulant [3], anticancer [4], antiviral [5], anti-inflammatory [6], antimalarial [7], anti-fungal [8], antiviral [9], and antiplasmodial [10] activities. Several pharmacological properties of plants have been reported, including antileishmanial [11] and antitubercular [12], and antiplasmodial [13], and antimicrobial [14] activities.


## Methods
A total of 1 × 10^7 cells/mL were cultured in 200 µL of YPD media containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 30°C for 18-24 h and then subcultured on LPSa70 aga. Three replicate cultures of the cultures were performed.

LPSa70 was expressed in L. werneckii B/A cells (JEC21, JEC21-F, JEC21-R and JEC21-S) [17] at a ratio of 1.5 × 10^4 cells/mL. Cells were cultured in culture medium (YPD) at 37°C for 2-3 days and then treated with 20 µM LPSa70. In some experiments, the LPSa70-specific expression of the LPSa70 toxin was also determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody to mouse anti-LPSa70 (a monoclonal antibody to LPSa70 [18]) at a dilution of 1:20 in culture medium (YPD). The LPSa70-specific expression of the LPSa70 toxin was also determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody to mouse anti-LPSa70 (a monoclonal antibody to mouse anti-LPSa70 [19]) at a dilution of 1:20 in culture medium (YPD). The levels of LPSa70 were determined as described by [20].

In vivo (5 × 10^7) LPSa70 and LPSa70-resistant strains were cultured in an RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C and 5% CO_2 for 3-4 days. The culture supernatant was collected and adjusted to 2 × 10^7 CFU/mL with a 0.05% w/v glycerol solution and 5% w/v glucose, and the cells were cultured in LPSa70 at a ratio of 1.5 × 10^5 CFU/mL.


## Results
neoformans infection
Since the LPSa70 and LPSa70a genes were identified as being required for the production of LPSaß, we tested the effects of overexpression of the LPSaß gene during . neoformans infection. C57BL/6 mice were infected with a total of two doses of the LPSaß gene in the presence of a mixed infection (1×10^3 CFU of both strains). After 4 h of infection, C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and the brains were collected. We observed a significant reduction in the percentage of dead mice as assessed by the brain microvascular endothelial growth factor (BVE) counts after the first hour post-infection (Figure 2A). The brain microvascular endothelial growth factor (BVE) counts in the brains of C57BL/6 mice were significantly decreased at 1 h post-infection compared with C57BL/6 mice (Figure 2B). Thus, the decreased activity of LPSaß was associated with a reduced brain microvascular endothelial growth factor (BVE) count in the brain.

LPSaß increases the production of LPSaß by the macrophage-like cell line S. cerevisiae in vivo

We also tested the ability of LPSaß to stimulate the growth of S. cerevisiae in vivo. After 72 h of infection, we measured the expression of the LPSaß gene in macrophages in the macrophage-like cell line S. cerevisiae and the lysosomal marker CD11b. We found that LPSaß increased the expression of the LPSaß gene in macrophages compared with the control (Figure 3A). The LPSaß gene is known to be involved in the host response to several infections [30]. Moreover, LPSaß increased the expression of the LPSaß gene in S. cerevisiae when compared with the control (Figure 3B). These data indicated that LPSaß increases the expression of the LPSaß gene.

LPSaß increases the expression of the LPSaß gene in a mouse model of acute S. cerevisiae infection
In S. cerevisiae, the actin cytoskeleton is highly modified by the S. cerevisiae-interacting proteins Sef1 and Sef2 [31].


## Discussion
With the recent increase in HIV-1 infections, opportunistic infection is increasingly recognized as the major risk factor for mortality [29]. In the current study, we identified a genetic factor that increases the risk of death in mice infected with a serotype D strain of Cryptococcus neoformans. This finding has important implications for the understanding of cryptococcal virulence, the therapeutic strategies to treat this infection and the implications for the management of patients with C.
