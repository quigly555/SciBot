## Abstract
In this study, we characterized the role played by the alga Phytophyllum crenatum in host defense against cryptococcosis. Phytomegal isolation and biochemical characterization of selected fungi revealed a low expression level of the P-Terminal Protein 1 (Pla1) from P. crenatum, which is a member of the first order [A+] protein. Deletion of the respective P-terminal markers resulted in different transcript profiles, with higher numbers of genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate degradation, cellulose and thioredoxin metabolism. Furthermore, the expression levels of some genes were increased during infection, suggesting that the alga harbored different virulence strategies, including filamentous growth, via endocytosis or by host cell killing. These results suggest that P-terminal kinase Pla1 might play different roles during the host infection. We also observed a positive interaction between the alga and P-terminal host kinase Pt and this interaction may be due to the co-evolution of the fungus with the host, as mutants of both Pt and P-terminal host kinases were produced at different developmental stages. Taken together, our results reveal that P-terminal host kinase P-crenatum may play different roles during the host infection.


## Introduction
Oral candidiasis is a common opportunistic fungal infection in humans and has been increasing worldwide in recent years (Mead et al., 2017). Candida albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen of the oral mucosa, and has a high level of clinical and systemic mortality (Shen et al., 2007; Dadachova et al., 2016). Although Candida spp. are the most common yeast pathogen of the human oral cavity, the frequency and frequency of other yeast species are increasing worldwide (Binder & Breslow, 2004). Candida spp. are commensal organisms in healthy individuals, but can cause serious health problems when they colonize the skin and the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (Gutierrez & Cibaca, 2012). The discovery of new antifungal agents is pivotal to improve the effectiveness of antifungal treatment in this group of patients.

Traditional antifungal therapy has been largely focused on the development of aflatoxins, which are biologically active molecules that possess both antifungal and antibacterial activities. Among the many antifungal agents, the azoles, which target ergosterol biosynthesis pathways, have shown the most promising results in terms of efficacy and safety (Ogata & Yamaguchi, 2000; Klabi et al., 2001; Walsh et al., 2004; Zeng et al., 2014).


## Methods
The complete list of primers used for the preparation of genomic DNA is shown in Table .

The results of this study were considered valid if the cloned fragments were subsequently subjected to DNA sequencing. The sequences of the markers used in the present study are listed in Table 3.

Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Sigma, UK) and were used for the assays. Growth and conidiation of the bacteria was monitored after 3-5 days of growth at 25 °C.

DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses
Bacterial strains were grown on PDA plates at 25 °C, 200 rpm for 7 days. Cell suspensions were diluted to an OD_600 of 0.1 in RPMI 1640 and stored at -20 °C until further processing.

Genomic DNA extraction was performed from the strains using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA extraction protocol was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions (V3.1-V5.0; www.bio.ic.ac.uk/tools/genomic/index.html). DNA quality was checked on agarose gel (Saracá, Spain).

Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, bacterial sequences were retrieved from GenBank database using BLAST [21]. Sequences were aligned using the program ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustal/). Sequence similarity was assessed using the online program BLASTn [22] and the closest sequences were selected for further analysis. The nucleotide substitution model selected was CaMt-like (0.5 Da, Cladrievous, unpublished data).

The protein sequences of the selected bacterial strains were aligned using the program ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustal/). The nearest homologous pair in each of the species was selected in the phylogenetic analysis.


## Results
In addition, we found that FKS1 protein has homology to the ChNRV-1 protein from . oryzae, which has been shown to have cytosolic membrane permeability [47]. As we have demonstrated previously, FKS1 was not expressed in Aspergillus fumigatus under growth conditions [47]. Moreover, our analysis of the Aspergillus fumigatus FKS1 protein did not reveal homology to the FKS2 protein from M. oryzae.

FKS1 is a Cytosolic Molecule
In order to confirm that the FKS1 protein of Aspergillus fumigatus was expressed in A. fumigatus, we generated a deletion mutant of the FKS1 gene. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the resulting mutant strain was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig 1a, b). This strain was also verified by Southern blot (Fig 1c). As shown in Fig 1d, the FKS1 protein in A. fumigatus was expressed in A. niger, A. terreus, A. niger, and A. terreus, and a non-redundant fraction of the genome was mapped to the FKS1 protein of Aspergillus fumigatus.

The FKS1 protein was also expressed in M. oryzae, although the expression levels of this protein were lower than those of the wild type. However, we found that this protein was expressed in A. fumigatus in a low level in the <U+0394>fks1 mutant, and thus it was not possible to determine the protein expression in the wild type strain. We also performed Western blotting of the Aspergillus fusiformis FKS1 protein with the FKS1 protein from the M. oryzae strain, but no difference was found between the strains (Fig 1e).

In addition, we performed Southern blot analysis of the Aspergillus fumigatus FKS1 protein from the A. niger strain, which showed a higher expression level than the <U+0394>fks1 strain. However, this difference was not significant (p > 0.05).


## Discussion
This study, in comparison with other species, identified five protein kinases, which are involved in the regulation of mating and sporulatio. Among them, three of them are identified as Pkh1, Rim11, and Rhe1 (Table 1).

Pkh1 is a mitochondrial protein, and it is involved in the regulation of nuclear localization and asexual development [48]. It is also involved in the development of pathogenic fungal species, such as Histoplasma capsulatum [49], and in the regulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation [50]. The Rim11-Rhe1 complex in P. chrysogenum is involved in sexual development [51]. The mating-type genes of P. chrysogenum are located in the ER-resident region of Rim11 [52]. In contrast, the genomes of other fungal species, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans, have a single Rim11 gene (Pkh1p) [53]. This is the first report on the genome of P. chrysogenum.

The other four Pkh1 orthologs are also present in other fungal species, including Fusarium graminearum, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, but not in P. triticina. The Pkh1 ortholog was also identified in Aspergillus fumigatus, but it is not present in the other species, for example, P. asperellus. It has been previously reported that Pkh1 orthologs are involved in the fungal pathogenesis [55]. In this study, we identified Pkh1p in P. triticina, but we did not find any ortholog in P. asperellus.

In addition, we also found Pkh1p in P. triticina, but we did not find any ortholog in P. asperellus.

Pkh1p is involved in the mating process in P. triticina
In addition to the Pkh1p orthologs in other fungal species, Pkh1p was also found in P. triticina. The Pkh1p proteins are involved in the mating process in P.
