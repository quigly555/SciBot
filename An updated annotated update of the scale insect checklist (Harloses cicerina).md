## Abstract
To improve the safety and quality of antifungal drug discovery, we screened the chemical databases at our university for the preparation of posaconazole (Urd), a first-line triazole antifungal drug with low plasma half-life (FRT), for early detection of candidiasis. Posaconazole has been the drug of choice for approximately 18 months in strategic drug development for use against candidiasis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of candidiasis among patients with normal renal function (NDR) and to compare this group to those without.

We screened the major antifungal drugs listed in the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for posaconazole prevalence, and we found that 22% of posaconazole-positive patients were deficient in NDR, and only 5% of posaconazole-negative patients were negative for candidiasis. Candida albicans was the most prevalent fungal species (n = 1025, 61.2%), followed by Candida dubliniensis (n = 9, 8.9%), Candida tropicalis (n = 7, 4.5%), Candida lusitaniae (n = 6, 3.9%), and Candida parapsilosis (n = 6, 3.9%). The prevalence of posaconazole-positivity in our university medical students was 43.9% compared to 41.8% in the general population and 45.7% in the medical students only population. The antifungal susceptibility prevalence of candidiasis was higher in the medical students than in the general population (94.4% versus 90.6%, p = 0.03), while among medical students, the prevalence of candidiasis among medical students was higher than among students in the general population (53.9% versus 42.1%, p = 0.03).

We identified a high prevalence of candidiasis in the medical students and a high prevalence of candidiasis among medical students in the European Union, which may be responsible for the high mortality of this disease. The prevalence of candidiasis among medical students may be responsible for the high mortality of candidiasis.


## Introduction
The fungal genus Trametella was first described by Chasnov in 1963 and revised by Chasenko in 1968 [1]. More than 40 species were described by Chasenko and later Chasenko [2]. Among them, Trametella pratylinerea (formerly known as Trametella anomala) is the most common and famous. It is a perennial, hyaline, macroconidia, 2-3-septate, 1-2-septate, and 3-5-epimastigotes, occurring on small, irregular, and usually blastic, darkly septate conidia. Chasenko described Trametella pratylinerea in 1963 as an ectal-to-endemain conidium, and later published a revised version of Trametella pratylinerea (subsection “Endeminal conidiomata”, last paragraph) in 1976 [3]. In his revision of the genus, Chasenko again described Trametella pratylinerea, although this one was described 2-3-septate from sexual spores. Chasenko's original description was based on microscopic findings and was based on microscopic data, but his revision has since been revised and enlarged, showing the sexual morph, and describing Trametella pratylinerea in its sexual morph form, with a truncated apical appendage, and a thin, darkly septate conidium.


## Methods
A, B, and C on the aerial parts of beetle. Although the FOCA guidelines have not yet been published, a recent review of the literature revealed that the FOCA-recommended FOCA, while lacking the most appropriate relevance, did not fit with the FOCA recommendations and suggested an updated version of the FOCA scale insect checklist. It was thus decided to use the tetraodon tetraodon as a basis for a new FOCA, based on the recommendations in this review. The tetraodon Tetraodon was provided by Dr. J.P. Hanley (University of Strathc, UK) and Dr. M.V. Srikantha (University of British Columbia, BC, Canada) [34].

Biological functions
Mammalian cell walls were investigated by recording the morphology of the cell wall preparations using the caliper-shaped caliper (Figure 1). The colony morphology of the caliper-shaped caliper was recorded after 72 h. The caliper was used to record the morphology of the cell wall preparations, using a tape-decoy system (Figure 1). The caliper was positioned at the center of the colony, at the height of 2 cm, and at a depth of 2 cm. The caliper was inverted, and the cell wall preparations were observed under the caliper. For the first stage caliper measurements, the caliper was held at least 5 cm away from the center of the colony, and at least 2 cm away from the center of the cell wall preparations. For the second stage caliper measurements, the caliper was held at least 2 cm away from the center of the colony, and at least 2 cm away from the center of the cell wall preparations. Each measurement was performed in duplicate and averaged.

The results of the caliper were read with a caliper-shaped caliper and recorded with a tape-decoy system. Caliper measurements were performed at each stage of the experiment to determine the cell wall preparation (Figure 1).

The cell wall preparation was carried out as described previously [33].


## Results
elegans metatranscriptome database (http://metatranscriptom.org) (35) was performed using a combination of four gene replacement approaches. The first two were designed to select the best candidate genes from the scaffold of the metatranscriptome database. The third was designed to select the candidate genes from the reference metatranscriptome database. A second approach was to provide new information about the gene family by creating an e-mail address for the new member of the family (37). Finally, a third approach was used to provide new information about the gene family by making an updated annotation of the metatranscriptome database (http://metatranscriptome.org). The annotation of the new member of the family by the e-mail address was done using the BLAST tool (38).

Comparison of genome sequences of P. destructans and the other insect species
We also compared the genomes of P. destructans and other insect species. The genome sequences of P. destructans and P. destructans var. grubii are very similar. However, P. destructans var. grubii is different from other insect species in that it has a genome containing four genes (CNAG_03564, CNAG_06940, CNAG_06972 and CNAG_07604) that are very similar in structure and amino acid sequences (see Fig S1 in the supplemental material). The genome sequences of P. destructans var. grubii are more similar in structure and amino acid sequence to those of other insect species (see Fig S1). The comparison of P. destructans var. grubii genome sequences was done with the genome sequence of P. destructans var. grubii EST data from GenBank and NCBI.

The comparisons of P. destructans and other insect species were performed using the BLAST tool (38). The BLAST result for P. destructans var. grubii is shown in Table 2 and the resulting analysis results are shown in Fig S2.

## Discussion
castaneum Botanical Collection (Barber et a. 2008). The new checklist is marked with the new lineages of the genus and the newly described species of the genus in the section "Fungal symbioses" in the updated work. It also includes the fungi of the genus Ustilago (Agaricostilbales) and members of the genus Metarhizidium (T. holophylla). The new species is described as P. sylvestris (Basidiomycota) and the new species is named P. nematophilum.

The new species of the genus Tephrosphaeria was found in the T. pyrifolia collection. It was previously recorded in the T. castaneum Botanical Collection (Barber et al. 2008) as T. holophylla. The new species was also observed in a collection of Tephrosphaeria cicatricola (Tephrosphaeria cicatricae) (Fig 1). It was originally reported as T. pyrifolia (Figs 1 and 2). The species has been isolated from other woody species, but T. pyrifolia has never been recorded in the T. castaneum Botanical Collection.

The new species is distributed in the T. castaneum Botanical Collection (Figs 1 and 2) and T. cinerea (Figs 1 and 2).

The genus Teratosphaeria has been isolated from several woody species and the species was previously described as T. castaneum (T. castaneum) (Fig 1). The species has been recorded as T. eucalypti (T. eucalypti) in the T. castaneum Botanical Collection (Figs 1 and 2). The new species is described as T. eucalypti (T. eucalypti) in the T. castaneum Botanical Collection (Figs 1 and 2).

The new species is described as T. oligophila (T. oligophila) (Figs 1 and 2).

The genus Trichosporon was isolated from the wood of Fagaceae (Figs 1 and 2). The new species was originally reported as Trichosporon spp. (Figs 1 and 2).
