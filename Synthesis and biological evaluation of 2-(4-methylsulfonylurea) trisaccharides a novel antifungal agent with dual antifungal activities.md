## Abstract
Hybridization, the utilization of multiple genes as one strain, has been considered as a possible strategy to increase fitness of various beneficial fungi. However, the genetic diversity of beneficial fungi is poorly defined and the number of strains is usually very small. This study investigated the beneficial mycelium growth and diversity in different Hymenaea martiana (S.) minutis and its interaction with a hybrid strain. A total of 110 strains were isolated and sequenced. Results showed that the mycelium of the genetically divergent strain S. martiana was more diverse and had distinct fungal populations. S. minutis was isolated mainly from the soil and was mainly infected by nine fungi, including Aspergillus species. In addition, a genetic analysis showed that the S. minutis strain URAF 5G could be a strain of Aspergillus fumigatus. S. minutis also infected S. fumigatus and the combination of these two strains showed that the fungus is mainly a biotrophic fungus that can be colonized by both plant and animal hosts. In conclusion, the data show that the genetic diversity of the three strains S. martiana is more heterogeneous than that of the parental strain, which can be explained by the relatively larger population size of the strain and the presence of more strains in the genome.


## Introduction
Gut microbiota in the intestine plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and virulence of intestinal microbes. It is composed of small intestinal bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Pediococcus. These small intestinal bacteria are usually colonized by gram-negative bacteria and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Prevotella is a gram-positive bacterium and the most common one in the intestines, followed by Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Salmonella. It is associated with infections in humans, horses, dogs, cats, and dogs [1]. The colonization of the small intestine by Prevotella is associated with changes in the gut bacterial population, which are dependent on the type of host. The occurrence of an infection by other intestinal bacteria in humans, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas, is associated with an increased number of these intestinal bacteria in the gut [2]. In dogs, the presence of intestinal bacteria in the small intestine is associated with an increased number of intestinal bacteria in the small intestine [3]. However, in humans, there is no specific recommendation for the use of probiotics in the prevention of intestinal bacterial infections in humans, but these bacteria can be beneficial to the host. However, probiotics can be beneficial to the host, and some studies have demonstrated that microorganisms present in the small intestine have beneficial effects on the host.

Studies have shown that the human intestinal microflora can be conditioned by the presence of microbes [4]. The composition of the intestinal microbiota is also influenced by diet [5], and the composition of intestinal microbiota could be conditioned by the diet. These microbiota changes could affect the health of the human gut.


## Methods
Analyses of the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the desired compound were performed as well as the drug-drug interactions, using a compound-drug interaction model [31. Drug-drug interactions were modeled by the combination of the two drugs [32], and the model was determined using a drug-drug interaction predictor with the solver set using the model-based approach. The interactions were obtained from the interactions between the compounds in a single compound, while the interactions between the two drugs in a combined compound were obtained from the interactions between the same compound. The model was evaluated and visualized using a computer program [33]. The solver was developed using the model-based approach.

2.2. Drug Susceptibility Testing
The MIC values were defined as the lowest concentration of the compound that inhibits the growth of the fungus. The lowest drug concentration that caused the visible growth was considered as the “safe drug” level. MIC values obtained from the wells were considered as “low drug concentration”.

2.3. Antifungal Activity of the 2-(4-Methoxy)-1-(4-Chlorobenzyl)-4H-chromen-3-ol (BMS-2) Synthesis
The 2-(4-Methoxy)-1-(4-Chlorobenzyl)-4H-chromen-3-ol (BMS-2) derivative of BMS-1 with its antifungal activity was prepared by the simultaneous addition of 0.25% BMS-2 to 1% BMS-1, and then the mixture was stirred at room temperature (RT) for 24 h. The obtained compounds were diluted in sterile 1-l ethanol (0.85%) to give the final concentrations of 50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively. The ethanol-solubility of the BMS-2 derivative was monitored at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600nm) using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The diamide hydroxide (DHE) method [34] was employed to determine the relative inhibitory concentrations of the drugs. The compounds were diluted in a saline solution (0.85%) to give the final concentrations of 0.25-1 mg/mL.

## Results
The concentrations of trisaccharide used in the assay were as follows: 20 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL, 20 µg/mL, 20 µg/mL, 20 µg/mL, and 10 µg/m. As a control, no activity was observed in the broth microdilution method. The results are presented in Table 1 and Table S1. As a result, no activity was observed in the broth microdilution assay, except in the concentration range 20-100 µg/mL.

Identification of 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharide and selectivity of the antifungal agent
The sequence of the trisaccharide identified in the broth microdilution assay is shown in Figure 4A. The sequence of the sequence of this sequence is very similar to the sequence in the antifungal agent used in this study (Figure 4B). The antifungal agent used in this study was that obtained from a commercial plant. It was selected as the selective agent because it was established to be effective against Cryptococcus neoformans.

3.2. Antifungal Activity
The antifungal activity of the trisaccharide identified in the broth microdilution assay was compared to that of the one used in the broth microdilution assay (Figure 4C). The antifungal activity of the trisaccharide identified in the broth microdilution assay was evaluated using the dilute broth microdilution method. The results are presented in Table 2. As a result, the antifungal activity of the trisaccharide identified in the broth microdilution assay was compared to that of the one used in the broth microdilution assay. As a control, the concentration range of 20-100 µg/mL was used. As a result, the antifungal activity of the trisaccharide identified in the broth microdilution assay was compared to that of the one used in the broth microdilution assay.

## Discussion

The most potent antifungal agents against Candida strains are those with the N-substituted phenyl alkylthiophene (PMA) and n-alkylthiophene (ALK) derivatives (10, 11. The latter two compounds are toxic to human cells and are also active against pathogenic fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus fumigatus var grubii (12). As such, a recent study suggests that PMA and ALK are both active against C. albicans and C. neoformans, respectively. A literature review by Chatterjee and Jha and others (10) found that PMA is active against C. neoformans and C. albicans. Based on these findings, we have chosen PMA as the antifungal agent for further study in this study.

In vitro activity of 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharides
The activity of 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharides against C. albicans and C. neoformans strains was investigated using an in vitro assay. The antifungal activity of 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharides against C. albicans was tested against two different C. albicans strains (vacuole and murine A1) and three different C. neoformans strains (C. glabrata and C. albicans). The inhibition of Candida growth by 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharides was tested in the presence of ethanol and with 2-BP, 1-BP and 2-PP. The antifungal activity was confirmed by the concentration-time dependent antifungal activity (AIC_TT), which showed that trisaccharides were highly active against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. albicans and C. neoformans. The antifungal activity of 2-(4-methylsulfonylurea) trisaccharides against C. albicans was also tested in the presence of ethanol.
